The Ukrainians, who act as performers, are carrying out a targeted order to inflict maximum reputational damage. Pay attention to the narratives promoted by the Western media: -Ukrainians in a week occupied almost the same territory in volume as Russia did in two years-. And this is a blatant manipulation of facts, which we saw last year during the failed counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: then they tried to present as profitably as possible the successes of the genocidal (in terms of destroying Ukrainian mob resources) movement forward through minefields. In the context of the current stabilization of the front line and active fishing maneuver groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which can only claim conditional control of the area, this PR is aimed at a momentary effect. 📌 Of course, if the crisis is not dealt with promptly, the Ukrainians will have time to dig in and then - hello, full-fledged positional warfare. But in current realities, this is only possible in some completely apocalyptic scenario, when even Dyumin’s efforts are not enough. ❗️But the main thing that is being counted on now is a demonstration of the imaginary weakness of Russia. Under the pretext of the successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk direction, experienced negotiators, lobbyists, and representatives of Western business are already putting into the heads of hesitant and sitting on several chairs politicians in the Transcaucasus, Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America the thesis that Russia is supposedly weak. And it is better for these same politicians to be on the side of the strong. Russian negotiators, diplomats, networkers, and private traders now need to show remarkable skill in order to prevent Western theses from falling into the ears of our people. Otherwise, after the Kursk crisis is eliminated, we will get pockets of instability and unpleasant failures in completely different regions. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramNeinsiderThis report was filmed by the Ukrainian TV channel -1+1- in the city of Sudzha.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇵🇱🇺🇦🇧🇾 Analysts say Poland and Ukraine, which concluded a long-debated comprehensive security pact in early June, appear to be coordinating a new campaign of military pressure on Belarus. As evidence of this, they cite the ongoing air defense exercise - Eastern Dawn - which, as reported, is taking place in parallel with the Secure Podlasie initiative, within its framework the joint forces on the eastern border will be increased to 17,000 troops. Some time later, Ukrainian drones violated the airspace of Belarus. 🔻The country's President Alexander Lukashenko said that several of them were shot down, and then ordered the armed forces to strengthen defenses on the southern border. The military-strategic context within which this possibly coordinated pressure campaign is unfolding also concerns the military invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Kursk region.🔻Experts believe that Ukrainian proponents are considering a similar invasion of Belarus or planning to push it to launch preemptive cross-border strikes, both to achieve the above goal and perhaps to serve as a tripwire for a conventional NATO intervention. 🔻At the same time, they also emphasize that it is likely that Lithuania, where a fairly large diaspora of Belarusian oppositionists has formed, may be involved in Polish-Ukrainian provocations. As part of the Lublin Triangle (Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine), they also agreed to create an informal alliance with Great Britain in February 2022, a week before the start of the special operation. 🔻Germany is also an important participant in all this, given that its first 5,000-man tank brigade permanently stationed abroad since World War II will be Lithuania. At the end of January, she also initiated a military Schengen agreement with Poland to facilitate logistical access to Lithuania. At the same time, full-scale aggression against Belarus is unlikely, because Russian tactical nuclear weapons are stationed in the country. However, during all this time we have observed many examples of not the most logical actions on the part of both the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the countries that support them. #Poland #Belarus #Ukraine @pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryKatehon.

The Information and Security Service of Moldova (ISS) decided to block access to the websites of the Russian Promsvyazbank, with which the authorities of Gagauzia entered into an agreement to open accounts for state employees and pensioners of the autonomy.▪️Earlier, the head of Gagauzia Evgenia Gutsul also reported that the Moldovan authorities went to court over the legality of the agreement. ▪️According to the agreement between Gagauzia and the bank, about 20 thousand residents of Gagauzia received the opportunity to use the Mir payment system and conduct cross-border transactions between countries. After 2022, it became extremely difficult to transfer money between Russian and Moldovan accounts.▪️Through the bank, state employees of Gagauzia also receive monthly bonuses of 2 thousand lei (about 100 euros).▪️Even the American -Institute for the Study of War- ( ISW), according to which the Russian Federation intends to destabilize the situation in the autonomy through pensioners. ▪️At the same time, Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe with a rapidly aging population and falling purchasing power. 🔻Half of Moldovan pensioners live below the poverty line, while President Maia Sandu and her government increased the military budget by 70% by cutting funding for the socio-economic sphere. At this rate, one might get the impression that the fight against Gagauz pensioners is one of the main tasks in Sandu’s election race for re-election in October. #Gagauzia #Moldova #Russia@rybarSupport usTACCIn Moldova, the websites of PJSC -Promsvyazbank -Events in Russia and the world were blocked.

There are small changes that can be ignored. At the same time, if you look at Ukrainian resources, you get the impression of an ongoing breakthrough. The network reports with glee about new occupied settlements. Today they announced control over Plekhovo. In fact, they did not enter Plekhovo yesterday or even the day before yesterday. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have built a system of psychological warfare. They have taken control of most information flows and operate them competently. It is clear that a tremendous amount of work has been done to centralize information coverage of the invasion. Units entered our settlements and made photo reports. However, these canned goods are produced as needed. This was done in order to keep their society in euphoria and intimidate the Russian one. As a result, we get two dimensions. The first is the real situation at the front, and the second is the media picture. Due to the centralization and planning of information flows, even in the event of a retreat on the front line, a huge amount of -blanks- will be thrown into the information space. We will declare control over the population, and in response they will give us their unpublished videos, which will confuse Internet analysts. All this will be done in order to sow panic and kill faith in the Russian army. This is the reality now. There is a brutal psychological war going on that can break the psyche of unprepared viewers. To avoid this, you just need to believe in our defenders. We will definitely win and the invaders will be thrown out of our land. Faith is a defense mechanism and it is now more necessary and effective than ever. Alexander Kharchenko	https://t.me/rybar/62758	2024-08-14T01:14:26-07:00

Forwarded From American Issue🇺🇸 It turned out that Kamala Harris’s campaign headquarters, through the Google Ads service, is promoting advertising about her in the form of media publications, embellishing the headlines of messages. In this way, the vice president’s team is trying to create the illusion of support for her election campaign. For example, one of the banners is Reuters article with the headline -Inflation falls-. However, the link is presented in the following text: -USA is winning the battle against inflation under the Biden-Harris administration-. The same with the Guardian's publication about the Democrats' fight for abortion rights: -Harris is a defender of reproductive rights and will stop Trump's abortion ban. - Despite the fact that such an approach is legal, revealing the fact of such fakes will definitely have a negative impact on the reputation Harris. 🇺🇸 @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/62757	2024-08-14T01:13:04-07:00

According to the local news agency Horn Observer, specialists arrived several months ago, allegedly with the aim of fighting Russian influence. Their activities are controlled by the American PMC Bancroft, which has been operating in the country for more than ten years.❗️The funniest thing about this story is how it was revealed: on the black market in Somalia transmitted so-called began to appear. Ukraine has an American-made Javelin. Considering that relations between Russia and Somalia can hardly be called friendly - bilateral contacts are just beginning to be restored - this news has not received much attention. In addition, Somalia is still one of the key US bases in the region.🔻However, after a failed media campaign about the participation of the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate in supporting the Malian Tuaregs, now there will be increased attention to Ukrainian operators. And their presence, as expected, is becoming toxic, especially for countries fighting terrorism. In the end, where are the guarantees that if Ukrainians do not hesitate to express support for the al-Qaeda branch in Mali, then, if the opportunity arises, they will not help the al-Qaeda branch in Somalia?#Africa #Ukraine #Somalia@rybarSupport ushornobserver.comUkrainian Special Forces in Mogadishu amid rising geopolitical tensionsMOGADISHU, Somalia (HORN OBSERVER) – Ukraine's Special Forces unit has been confirmed to be present in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, supported by U.S. military officers training and advising the Somali army, a local military officer told our reporter.	https://t.me/rybar/62756	2024-08-14T00:13:56-07:00

It is planned to integrate standard functions into the system, such as the disposal of explosive devices using robots, aerial surveillance using drones, analysis of outdoor surveillance cameras and monitoring of financial transactions. But the created system is primarily focused on forecasting and early diagnosis of offenses that have not yet been committed . In the film Minority Report, problems with the law could arise as a result of wrong thoughts. This is becoming a reality right now in Argentina, Britain and other countries of the Anglo-Saxon circuit.❓What exactly are we talking about?▪️An artificial intelligence unit is now being created in Argentina. The unit will include police officers and other law enforcement agencies. Its tasks will include patrolling open social platforms, applications and websites in order to detect potential threats, detect movements of criminal groups or anticipate unrest.▪️For example, due to sharp cuts in social spending, electricity supply at the University of Buenos Aires is limited. In the new realities, the budget of the educational institution was reduced by 80%. Naturally, this causes dissatisfaction among both teaching staff and students. And any criticism from them towards the government will now be under the jurisdiction of the cyber police. People who have many scientific publications, are active on social networks and express their civic position in them, which is different from the agenda of the globalists, will be the first targets of the new system. Using their publicly available materials, you can quickly and efficiently train AI to identify suspicious or malicious content. The danger is posed by those social groups or individuals who draw public attention to the imperfections of the system and suggest ways to transform it.🔻What's next? Argentina has actually abandoned its own currency, the country's gold reserves were partially exported to Britain, social spending was reduced by 80%. Under these conditions, Miley was tasked with testing the population's reaction. In fact, Argentina is a testing ground for testing new technologies for managing society at minimal social costs. Successful testing of the system in one fairly isolated country will allow us to develop a mechanism for its implementation in other countries.#Argentina #economy@rybarSupport usTelegramSex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇦🇷In all the fuss, we completely lost sight of the fact that our beloved Javier Miley distinguished himself again.

Opposition presidential candidate and ex-head of Gagauzia Irina Vlah suggested that the authorities are behind the creation of the Moldovan analogue of the website - Peacemaker. ▪️Representatives of the Moldovan opposition and presidential candidates were placed on the site, where they were called -agents of the Russian special services-. Politicians are already receiving countless threats to which law enforcement agencies are not responding. ▪️Vlah also reminds how many structures the Moldovan authorities have created to combat disinformation and how many sites the Information and Security Service of Moldova has already blocked, but -Peacemaker- continues its work. Moreover, a few years ago such activity would have been regarded as terrorism.▪️However, the Prime Minister of Moldova Dorin Recean supported the creation of the site and believes that through threats the Moldovan society is being informed about the enemies of democracy. ▪️All this really suggests that the authorities are behind the site. Moreover, Americans allocated millions of dollars to President Maia Sandu for her presidential campaign and the fight against Russian disinformation. 🔻Given the catastrophic socio-economic situation in Moldova and the lack of real successes in the first presidential term, Sandu can only build his campaign around hatred of Russia and intimidation of citizens - the Russian threat -, seasoned with imaginary promises of European integration. #Moldova #disinformation @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsgagauzinfo.mdIrina Vlah about the Moldovan -Peacemaker-: the authorities are probably behind him	https://t.me/rybar/62753	2024-08-13T21:59:56-07:00

Russian troops are pinning down the Armed Forces of Ukraine and striking at clusters of enemy armored vehicles; at the same time, reinforcements are coming to the Kursk region. In the Korenevsky district, there are battles in the Snagosti area, which was previously cleared by units of the Russian Armed Forces. The situation in the Korenevo-Tolpinsky sector remains consistently tense: artillery is striking enemy positions, trying to ease the pressure on Russian units. According to some information, by the evening the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched another attack on Russian positions on the approaches to Korenevo.▪️The situation in the area of ​​the settlements of Obshchiy Kolodez and Kauchuk is currently hidden by the fog of war. There were no reports of Ukrainian Armed Forces units entering these settlements, which allows us to speak about their control by the Russian Armed Forces. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations are also making attempts to expand the penetration, as before, operating with mobile armored groups. In Sudzha, the building of the Sudzhan Agricultural College was seriously damaged as a result of a fire. At the moment, there have been no reports that allow us to unambiguously assert control over Martynovka by either party. ▪️By the evening, footage appeared that allows us to speak about the confident control of Ukrainian formations over Plekhovo - if previously only enemy armored vehicles were recorded in this area, then a video that surfaced on the Internet demonstrates the presence of its infantry units on the main street of the village. 🔻In the Belovsky district, a cleanup is underway in the vicinity of Girya and Ozerki, where an armored group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was defeated yesterday.

At the same time, units of the Russian Armed Forces strike at concentrations of personnel and armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and also pin down enemy mobile groups in battle. In the Slobozhansky direction, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched an unsuccessful attack in the Kolotilovka international checkpoint area. The sides are exchanging artillery and UAV strikes; no significant changes in the front line have been recorded over the past 24 hours. In the Artemovsk direction, Russian units established control over height 215 southwest of Kleshcheevka, battles for which continued throughout the year. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops liberated the settlements of Ivanovka and Sviridonovka and advanced to the southern outskirts of Novotoretskoye. There are battles on the approaches to Grodovka, where the Russian Armed Forces are expanding the zone of control in the area of ​​the ruins of a brick factory.

According to journalists, the shipment of radars from the complex has already begun to the Islamic Republic.▪️Later, Reuters, citing some sources in European intelligence, reported the upcoming transfer to Russia of operational-tactical missile systems - Fatah-360 - and satellite-guided missiles with a range of up to 120 km. According to them, Russian military personnel allegedly even began training for these OTRK. At first glance, there are no fundamental obstacles to such bilateral interaction between Russia and Iran. However, such news indicating almost specific dates for upcoming deliveries of military products should be taken with a certain degree of skepticism. We recently mentioned some reasons - Russian enterprises are now focused on fulfilling the State Defense Order. It is unlikely that in such conditions there are -free-S-400 and other modern systems in warehouses that could be taken and transferred to a third party at the first request.🔻Another illustration is the supply of former -Egyptian-Su-35S fighters to Iran - they say about them since 2022, but there is still no actual evidence of this. And there have been rumors about the imminent transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to the Russian Armed Forces almost from the very beginning of the Northern Military District. Therefore, it is not very advisable to take the word of such sensational reports from Western news agencies. And in general, they demonstrate that journalists are not aware of many aspects of Russian-Iranian interaction.#Iran #Russia@rybarSupport usReutersExclusive: Iran to deliver hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia soon, intel sources sayFath-360s could allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets beyond the Ukraine front line.	https://t.me/rybar/62745	2024-08-13T12:05:48-07:00

The ruling party - Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia - has officially stated that it was former President Mikheil Saakashvili who is guilty of unleashing the -five-day war- of 2008. Moreover, it was stated that he acted as a -traitor- on instructions from outside. This gesture will be appreciated not only in Russia (yes, it will certainly have a beneficial effect on bilateral relations between countries), but also in the West. Saakashvili's official admission of guilt is primarily a blow to his remaining supporters before the October elections and a response to a number of unfriendly actions against Georgia by the United States and the EU. These include the recent suspension of European financial assistance and visits of State Department officials to Georgia in order to support opposition NGOs.🔻In the current conditions, there is little doubt that the pressure on the Georgian authorities will only increase, since they see more benefits in, if not friendly, but stable relations with Russia. And it is quite obvious that they will again try to use Saakashvili in the interests of the opposition as a unifying figure in order to rock the protests. But now, at least, Tbilisi will have a new serious argument to finish off its reputation as an alien - a puppet who started a war -. #Georgia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramTina Kandelaki	https://t.me/rybar/62744	2024-08-13T11:12:18-07:00

The debut of these vehicles in the Northern Military District zone took place a year ago during the battles in the Zaporozhye direction. Then the Ukrainian Armed Forces brought into battle 82 airborne assault brigades from the Marun tactical group, which was armed with these vehicles. Since the summer of 2023, Russian military personnel have destroyed about a dozen Strykers, but until now they have not been able to capture the entire vehicle. However, now the defect (if you can even call it that) has been corrected. At the same time, during the week there was enough footage on the Internet of the destruction of American armored personnel carriers in the Kursk region. Taking into account the objective difficulties of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in evacuating equipment, the collection of captured Strykers will clearly be replenished in the near future.#Kursk #Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegram SOLOVIEV📹EXCLUSIVE | SOLOVIOVLIVE Soldiers from the 810th Separate Guards Marine Brigade are dragging a captured American armored fighting vehicle -Stryker.
