No, this is not a special squad of combat thugs that parachuted in the area of ​​Nevsky Prospekt. These are ordinary teenagers who have recently learned to use social networks and instant messengers, but, unfortunately, without common sense. For 200 units of American currency, the guys were offered to set fire to a cell tower by some unknown people in a telegram chat bot. Without hesitating at all, they agreed, They did it, and now they have escaped justice. As a result, the customers ditched them, of course, without paying, and the security forces charged them with serious charges, for a real 20-year sentence. The moral of the story is simple: everything that could previously pass for a hooligan is now sabotage, and examples of conspiracy from militants do not work, SOBR with a sledgehammer he will still knock on the door.🎯 @opersvodki	https://t.me/rybar/62835	2024-08-16T04:39:42-07:00

The President signed a law granting the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Information and Security Service the powers to block any website. Such measures are especially indicative against the backdrop of the upcoming presidential elections in October. All that remains is to follow the example of Great Britain and start jailing 15-year-olds for ten years for participating in protests. Although in the case of Moldova we see the opposite trend: a fight against pensioners, who are considered -agents of the Kremlin- and are deprived of subsidies from Russian accounts. This is what the path of Eastern European democracy looks like. #Gagauzia #Moldova@rybarSupport usTelegramMoldovan Mole‼️‼️The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the SIS received official powers to block access to websites.

The enemy uses artillery and aviation to shell the border zone, including the settlements of Tetkino, Glushkovo and Korenevo. In the Mogritsa area in the Sumy region, two strikes from the Iskander OTRK destroyed two, presumably HIMARS MLRS, as evidenced by objective control footage , capturing the detonation of the ammunition and the abnormal launch of rocket launchers. This was the third confirmed loss of vehicles of this type over the past two days: another was destroyed in a nearby forest plantation yesterday. In the Lgov region, local authorities are calling for the voluntary evacuation of the population, citing the unstable situation in the region. Civilians have the opportunity to go to safer places in the rear regions.🔻In the Korenevsky district in the morning, an enemy DRG was destroyed, which was conducting reconnaissance of the area in the Kremyanoye area, for which there had recently been fighting. The allegations about the destruction of an alleged column of armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces in Korenevo were not confirmed on the ground. In the Sudzhansky district, the configuration of the front in the Makhnovka area was clarified. Footage was published of the destruction by UAV operators of two armored personnel carriers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, presumably French VAB, at a short distance from each other. From this we can conclude that the settlement is located in the gray zone and, most likely, is not controlled by the Russian Armed Forces at the moment. In the Belovsky district, there was no information about changes in the front configuration or any battles during the night. Clashes are still taking place at the Girya - Kamyshnoye - Krupets - Spalnoe line. The enemy published a photo near the local post office in Borki, but the image was most likely not taken today.

🇺🇸🇰🇿 How USAID is preparing infrastructure for border control...	🇺🇸🇰🇿 How USAID is Preparing Infrastructure for Border Control of Central Asian Trade The US Embassy in Kazakhstan has good news: USAID has purchased advanced servers manufactured by DELL Corporation to support the new KGD Customs IT system -Keden-, which will replace the outdated system -Astana-1- . Thus, USAID, according to them, supports the creation of a more efficient and secure customs environment in Kazakhstan.▪️At least one parameter indicating the effectiveness of border control was previously voiced to us by European diplomats and State Department officials: the degree of compliance with sanctions against Russia. The Americans are striving to ensure the highest quality monitoring of the sanctions regime; it is difficult to believe that this data will remain in Astana. ▪️Western partners began working on this issue back in 2022, as shown by the purchase by the Border Service of the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan of American Raven drones for border monitoring.▪️It is in the interests of the United States to take control of the southern borders of the republic. Then all the streams through which dual-use products from Central Asia could enter Russia will be blocked at once. And there have already been precedents for the seizure of shipments of Chinese UAVs on the Kyrgyz border.🔻At the same time, Washington’s plans are not limited to Kazakhstan. The digitalization of customs authorities was discussed back in October 2023 in Samarkand, where representatives of USAID and ministers of all five Central Asian countries met. In parallel with attempts to economically strangle Russia, the Americans aim to control all trade flows in the region, including Chinese ones. And so the question remains: is this not a preparation for the introduction of trade sanctions against China? #Kazakhstan #USA #CentralAsia@rybarSupport UsUS Embassy and Consulate in KazakhstanUSAID supported the modernization of the customs system of Kazakhstan with the transfer of new computer serversASTANA, KAZAKHSTAN, August 14, 2024 - Today US Ambassador Daniel Rosenblum and representatives of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) transferred modern computer servers to the State Revenue Committee (SRC) of the Republic of Kazakhstan in order to modernize...	https://t.me/rybar/62832	2024-08-16T01:43:48-07:00

In particular, howitzers and components for them. The reason was allegedly an increase in terrorist activity in the north of the country.❗️But the context behind this decision somewhat changes the impression of the news. Thus, after a visit to Benin in May by the head of the US Africa Command, Michael Langley, who promised another tranche for the needs of the Benin army, the government closed the Chinese pipeline from Niger. Now, in addition to protecting their interests - the safety of oil export routes - they also want to create a counterbalance to the American military machine in the country. Moreover, Chinese business is already has gained a foothold in Benin and any demarches from the leadership are extremely undesirable for him. That’s why the Chinese are trying to outplay the Americans using their own methods.

🇦🇲🇷🇺 About the new after Armenia in Russia Gurgen Ar...	🇦🇲🇷🇺 About what’s new after Armenia in Russia In Armenia, Gurgen Arsenyan was officially appointed as the new ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the republic to Russia. ▪️Arsenyan is a member of the Civil Contract party, and his candidacy for the post of ambassador was proposed by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. ▪️It is noteworthy that Arsenyan does not have much experience in diplomatic work, but was originally a businessman. The reason for his appointment as ambassador to the Russian Federation is primarily said to be loyalty to Pashinyan. ▪️Arsenyan himself promised to soften the rough edges in relations between Armenia and Russia, change the algorithm of conversation, relations between countries. ▪️However, real changes in the very difficult relations between Armenia and Russia should not be expected. ▪️Arsenyan adapts to the situation and his words are clearly related to an attempt to test the waters in the country of his new destination. ▪️Moreover, literally in 2023, deputy Arsenyan argued that the military presence of the Russian Federation in Armenia was coming to an end, after which the republic would finally improve relations with Turkey. The statement, to put it mildly, is dubious.▪️There will be no thaw in relations between the countries because the guarantors of Pashinyan’s power are the United States and the EU, for which the Armenian leadership is taking demonstrative anti-Russian steps, such as, for example, criticism of the CSTO, the expulsion of Russian border guards from the Zvartnots airport and the appointment of an American adviser to the Ministry of Defense.▪️At the same time, the Armenian economy is tied to exports and re-exports to Russia, and membership in the EAEU has provided the republic with stable economic growth in recent years.🔻Perhaps Ambassador Arsenyan will only be busy with economic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation , as well as constant excuses to the Russian Foreign Ministry for the latest anti-Russian attacks by their superiors. #Armenia #Russia @rybarSupport usInterfaxGurgen Arsenyan appointed Ambassador of Armenia to the Russian FederationGurgen Arsenyan has been appointed new Ambassador of Armenia to Russia.	https://t.me/rybar/62830	2024-08-15T23:23:01-07:00

Forwarded From Kirill Fedorov / War History Weapons (Stanislav Belenky)🇷🇺🇺🇦 On August 12 in Ukraine, the National Anti-Corruption Agency, supervised by the American Embassy, ​​detained Deputy Minister of Energy Alexander Hale. They accepted him for accepting a bribe of half a million dollars; The bureau agents were also assisted by Minister German Galushchenko himself. It would seem, why is a military blogger writing about this event? The news is from a completely different sphere! In fact, it relates to what is happening at the front as a marker event. But the whole point is what exactly the official was supposed to receive a bribe for. So, a certain coal mining company from Western Ukraine, where there have been mines since Austrian times, asked Heil to help them remove valuable and rare equipment from a state mine... in the Pokrovsky district of the Donetsk region. Now it should be clearer to the reader what the significance of this case is. We remember that the Braves are actively advancing in the direction of Pokrovsk, and the pace of advancement itself is increasing as the operational crisis in the Ukrainian Armed Forces worsens. And the day is not far when the Russian army will begin and complete the liberation of the Pokrovsk agglomeration. In these conditions, it is clear to business, devoid of ideological blinders, that it is necessary, as our respected Chinese partners say, to rob in case of fire - once the city is surrendered, then at least for yourself in Galicia you can get hold of valuable equipment. Kirill has already written about the importance of Pokrovsk in military terms, but it also has economic significance. The fact is that only and exclusively in the Pokrovskaya agglomeration coking coal is mined for the Ukrainian metallurgical industry, and without this raw material this industry will stop completely. And this, in turn, will mean the disappearance of a large and important source of the country’s export income. In this context, the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ adventure in the Kursk region, instead of protecting a strategically important city, looks, in line with Miliukov’s famous speech, stupidity or treason. But that's not all. Those same 25 km from Pokrovsk to the west are Pavlograd, Dnepropetrovsk region. This is an industrial center and a strategically important railway junction, through which it still flies, and with the approach of the LBS to it, it will be even more so. And these problems for Ukraine will not be of an operational-tactical nature, but of a strategic nature. And this is a completely different story.TelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsky direction: the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Grodovka, battles on the approaches to Novogrodovka and the worsening of the operational crisis of the Armed Forces of UkraineSituation as of 21:00 on August 15, 2024 In addition to the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, the depressing situation of the Ukrainian ...	https://t.me/rybar/62827	2024-08-15T18:47:52-07:00

Forwarded From RosgVardeetsRybar writes that in order to eliminate problems with interdepartmental interaction, a Coordination Council was created by decision of Defense Minister Belousov. If you look at the entire system from the inside, it looks like many disparate states fighting among themselves. The problem of interaction between adjacent units that fight side by side is still at the forefront. Just think about it. Example. The subcontractors are going to attack, we find out about this after the fact, when they walk past us, that is, we are not ready to cover them and are not ready to pull them out. This is one of the most common situations at the front. Now imagine that now all the offices have gathered in the Kursk region, which, except for regional exercises, have never interacted, and such exercises were not carried out everywhere. Moreover, all these problems were shown by the first year of the war, when the Defense Ministry did not understand what to do with the Russian Guard, and the Russian Guard did not understand how to work with the Defense Ministry. There were so many stupid situations, including the Kharkov regrouping, when the Ministry of Defense began to retreat without warning the Russian Guard about this. Has anyone drawn any conclusions? No! And now we have received the fact that we have reserves, but we cannot use them to their full potential, because there is no understanding and experience of interaction. Very often, interaction is established at the level of horizontal connections, and this is done by ordinary soldiers and commanders of a level not higher than a platoon/company commander. As a result, there are several departments that cannot establish interaction with each other.

In just one day, about three dozen attacks were repulsed. Despite a slight decrease in the intensity of the fighting compared to previous days, the situation is currently far from stabilizing. In the Lgovsky district, the voluntary evacuation of the local population continues, meanwhile, Ukrainian formations do not stop artillery shelling. In the Korenevsky district, near Safonovka, details of the repulse of a recent attack by an armored group have appeared The Ukrainian Armed Forces consisted of at least five vehicles: the enemy convoy was ambushed and shot from both sides, the personnel were destroyed.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation did not undergo significant changes by the end of the day. Fighting and attacks by Ukrainian sabotage groups continue in the area. In the Malaya Loknya area in Nikolaevka, a fighter of the local self-defense squad burned an abandoned BMP-1 of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with a canister of gasoline.

Russian troops attacked Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine. In the Dnepropetrovsk region, the territory of a machine-building plant in Pavlograd was hit, and not far from Poltava, an ammunition depot in Terentievka was hit. In the North Ukrainian direction, Ukrainian formations are seeking to expand the zone of control in several districts of the Kursk region. Units of the Russian Armed Forces respond with regular strikes on places where Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel and equipment are concentrated, and also hold back enemy advances. In the Slobozhansky direction, Ukrainian formations carried out an attack on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the Kolotilovka international checkpoint and for some time occupied the territory of the checkpoint. Later, Russian troops knocked the enemy out of their positions and regained control of the crossing. In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops made significant progress on the approaches to Dzerzhinsk and almost completely liberated Kirovo. In Novgorod, the Russian Armed Forces completely occupied the eastern outskirts of the settlement and cleared out the pocket between Novgorod and Balka Shiroka. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops liberated Orlovka and gained a foothold on the southeastern outskirts of Zhuravka.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖 Stills from the video of the 8th Special Forces Regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine operating in the Kursk region. Ukrainian Special Forces officers use red tactical ribbons/bandages to organize ambushes and operations in rear areas. We ask the soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces to be extremely careful so as not to run into an enemy posing as their own! Such actions on the part of the enemy are logical, because This is one of the direct purposes of these units - to operate in the rear. And, given that the line of defense is not built in the Kursk region, the Ukrainian Armed Forces resort to these types of camouflage. The main goal of the enemy’s tactics is to increase the chances of survival of their groups and remain undetected. Move around populated areas without attracting the attention of both civilians and Russian military. In addition, by dressing in the uniform of the Russian Armed Forces and gaining trust, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have more opportunities to be the first to enter the battle. In this regard, counterintelligence measures should be strengthened in this direction. Archangel of Special Forces. Subscribe.	https://t.me/rybar/62819	2024-08-15T13:17:01-07:00

Meanwhile, the total number of Palestinian deaths since the beginning of the escalation has already exceeded 40 thousand. In the south of the enclave, the Israelis again announced an evacuation east of Khan Yunis, once again resorting to reducing the humanitarian zone. However, the expected offensive by the Israel Defense Forces never materialized. Engineering work by the 162nd Armored Division -HaPlada- continues along the Philadelphia Corridor. Israeli troops are demolishing the remaining buildings a kilometer from the Gaza Strip border with Egypt. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids, detaining suspects with links to Hamas. The largest Israeli operation took place in Nablus, where two local militants were eliminated. The usual strikes by the parties continue on the Lebanese-Israeli border, which this time led to fires in both southern Lebanon and northern Israel.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsk direction: breakthrough of the Russian Armed ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦Pokrovsky direction: the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Grodovka, battles on the approaches to Novogrodovka and the worsening operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Situation as of 21:00 on August 15, 2024. In addition to the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, the depressing situation of the Ukrainian formations is also developing in the Pokrovsky sector, where In recent days, Russian troops have been able to significantly expand the zone of control. Currently, the enemy is preparing for defense in the Grodovka-Novogrodovka sector. Both of these settlements are the last major lines of defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces before Pokrovsk - one of the key transport hubs of the Donbass enemy group.▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to Novotoretskoye, where the crossing of the Kazenny Torets River takes place. Earlier, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ivanovka and Lisichnoye, which allowed them to reach the outskirts of the settlement, breaking through several enemy defensive lines. North of Novotoretsk, the Armed Forces of Ukraine equipped a large fortified area covering the approaches to the N-32 Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. Probably, the main efforts of the Russian Armed Forces on the northern flank in the near future will be concentrated on the liberation of Vozdvizhenka and further advance towards the highway with the aim of cutting it. ▪️In the central sector, after successfully capturing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the ruins of a brick factory, Russian troops entered the southeastern outskirts of Grodovka. Assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually moving along Donetskaya Street, while the territory of the clay quarry located to the south remains in the gray zone. The offensive is also taking place to the northeast of the settlement, where Russian troops are pushing out Ukrainian formations from positions in forest belts. The enemy notes the high efficiency and number of Russian drones that disrupt supplies and hit armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. ❗️In the area of ​​the O-05-44 highway, immediately behind Grodovka, the enemy is installing a new defense line designed to stop the advance of Russian troops in this area. It is known about at least four large strongholds built at a higher altitude relative to the village itself, which gives the Ukrainian Armed Forces an advantage both in visual observation capabilities and in adjusting artillery and mortar fire. Nevertheless, it is clearly not worth talking about the inaccessibility of this fortified area - during the battles for Vesele, Russian troops overcame a similar line of defense of Ukrainian formations in just a few days. ▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces, relying on Sergeevka, carried out a series of attacks, as a result of which the village of Orlovka was liberated. In neighboring Zhuravka, fighting appears to be continuing, and at least the south-eastern outskirts of the village are under the control of Russian troops. We should soon expect Russian troops to pull up the left flank and storm the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Novozhelenny area. There are reports of the start of battles for Novogrodovka, where a large railway junction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is located, and a 20-hour curfew has been introduced in the city. Located just three kilometers to the east, Nikolaevka is already under the control of the Russian Armed Forces: the enemy published footage of the landing at the western exit of the village.🔻So far, the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine is savoring information victories in the Kursk region, the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Pokrovsky direction continues to rapidly deteriorate. After the Russian troops occupy Grodovka and Novogrodovka, the path to Pokrovsk and Mirnograd will be open. Units of the Russian Armed Forces threaten important enemy communications not only in this area, but also in the Selidovo area and the N-32 highway, along which Ukrainian formations are supplied in the Donetsk, Artemovsk and Aleksandro-Kalinovsky directions. The command of the RF Armed Forces faces several promising directions for attack at once.
