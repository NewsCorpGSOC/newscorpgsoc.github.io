Against the backdrop of urgent collections for the needs of the units, the requests of the Rybar team to neglect a cup of coffee and donate the conditional 150 rubles for Russian analytics look ridiculous from the point of view of many. Many do not understand why support an information project at all, because it is of no use. There is a point: we concentrate on covering the actions of the enemy, which increases the awareness of our troops (by helping us, you are helping them with information). We tell our bureaucrats what is happening in distant countries so that they can make informed decisions. We fight off information attacks and show what is really happening. If you think that all this is unimportant, well, you are right. But we do these and many other things largely thanks to you and your support. With your help, we are capable of more.❓How to support us?📄offer an information order or simply use our services;🖋subscribe to the closed channel @rybar_plus_bot or the Rybar+ section with our reports and notes in the margins💵 make a direct transfer to a legal account through SBP 💰 use the donation button on our website rybar.ru💲 transfer us cryptocurrency What seems like an unnoticeable contribution to you is an opportunity to develop for us.

Russian troops launched missile attacks on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine. According to some reports, in the Sumy region the territory of a chemical ammunition warehouse was attacked, and in the temporarily occupied territory of the DPR, drones caused damage to a light equipment repair base. In turn, the Ukrainian Armed Forces carried out another drone raid on civilian infrastructure in Russian settlements; two distilleries in the Tula region and a similar enterprise in the Tambov region came under attack. All fires that arose were extinguished. In the Kursk direction, a tense situation remains in the Zeleny Shlyakh area, where Ukrainian formations tried to attack the positions of the Russian Armed Forces. An official statement was received from the Liman direction about the release of Novosadov, which could potentially enable the Russian Armed Forces to continue the offensive in the direction of Ternov. In the Pokrovsky direction, the position of the Ukrainian garrison defending Selidovo is becoming more complicated every day, where Russian troops are advancing from several sides at once. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the enemy from positions on the southeastern outskirts of Antonovka; in Katerynivka, fighting continues in the center of the village.

In the Sudzhansky district, the enemy made unsuccessful attempts to advance in the area of ​​Malaya Loknya and Sudzha. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, fighting continues in the vicinity of the New Way, where the enemy organized a defense based on the railway track. Information about the liberation of the village that appeared some time ago has not yet been confirmed. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, high intensity of military operations remains at the Kremyanoye - Novoivanovka - Nizhny Klin line. Ukrainian formations launched an attack in the Green Way area. At the same time, the situation in the area of ​​Tolstoy Lug and Lyubimovka remains hidden - the fog of war -. ❗️A column of armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was -met- by Russian UAV operators. The enemy lost at least one tank during the battle, while the troops that landed in the south of Zeleny Shlyakh were finished off by Russian artillery. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the enemy also tried to recapture previously lost territories by using assault groups without the support of armored vehicles. Soldiers of the 810th Separate Guards Marine Brigade repelled the enemy's attack in the Malaya Loknya area, and marines from the 155th Separate Guards Brigade stopped the Ukrainian Armed Forces' attempts to advance northeast of Sudzha. 🔻During the day, air defense systems shot down several enemy drones, as well as four missiles, in the sky over the territory of the Kursk region.

🇲🇩🗳 Moldovan referendum on joining the EU: unobvious consequen...	🇲🇩🗳 Moldovan referendum on joining the EU: unobvious consequences The most shocking result for the current government in the person of Maia Sandu was the results of the constitutional referendum on European integration. Supporters of European integration scored 50.38%, opponents - 49.62%. 🔻Distribution of votes▪️The scales tipped in favor of EU supporters only when 98% of the ballots were processed, when the votes of the foreign diaspora were counted. 76.96% of positive votes and 23.04% of negative votes came from there. ▪️The referendum was also won by a small margin in Chisinau: for the EU - 55.98%, against - 44.02%. ▪️In other regions of Moldova, citizens voted mainly against European integration. In Balti, the northern capital of the republic, the referendum was miserably lost: against the EU - 70.58%, for - 29.42%. In other northern regions of Moldova, the results are similar. ▪️The referendum could not be won even in the large Ungheni region on the border with Romania, where the main transport hub of the republic is located. By the way, NATO plans to build a railway track through Ungheni to improve the mobility of the alliance, but local residents are not even happy with the EU, which 56.75% voted against. ▪️In Transnistria: against the EU - 68.98%, for - 31.02%. ▪️In Gagauzia: against the EU - 94.84%, for - 5.16%. 🔻Consequences of the referendum for the future president▪️The EU is trying to cover up the failure of its policy in Moldova, congratulating Moldovans on their -European choice-. But what could be the real consequences of such a controversial constitutional referendum? ▪️In the Code of Gagauzia, 95% of whose residents voted against, there is an article according to which autonomy has the right to external self-determination in the event of a change in the status of the Republic of Moldova as an independent state. Joining the EU can be considered a loss of sovereignty. ▪️Winning the elections will put both Sandu and the second presidential candidate Alexander Stoianoglo in a difficult position. ▪️Sand will have to answer to Western sponsors for the disgusting results of the referendum. After all, a victory without even a 1% margin demonstrates the failure of the pro-Western policy in the republic, taking into account the efforts expended. If she wins, Sandu can hardly be expected to soften her aggressive rhetoric, which will now definitely be directed against the majority of Moldovans who voted against the EU. After all, the outcome of the referendum was actually decided by the diaspora. ▪️And if Stoyanoglo wins, he will have great difficulty fighting off the enshrinement of European aspirations in the Constitution. It will be difficult to challenge the results of the referendum, since the results of the presidential elections may also be called into question. As a result, the European referendum, which was supposed to clearly determine the direction of Moldova’s movement, in fact led the country to a dead end. At the same time, the elections and referendum in Moldova actually confirmed the worst fears European politicians who were initially skeptical about the EU's advances towards a republic in which democracy is being enforced through censorship and repression against the opposition. After all, all this hits even harder at what remains of the EU’s reputation. Now Sandu’s team has definitely caused enormous damage to the institution of Western democratic elections declared by the 1990 CSCE Copenhagen Document, violating many of its provisions. From restrictions on campaigning, direct foreign interference and the exclusion of a number of observers to amendments to laws less than a year before the elections, the organization of elections and a referendum on the same day and, finally, restrictions on the voting rights of the Russian diaspora. If the West continues to seize Moldova, then European officials will have to close eyes on obvious violations of the law, which will once again damage the reputation of the EU itself.

Such a step from a person who has consistently pursued a pro-Western policy in recent years is an important signal. At the moment, Mauritania wants to reach out and benefit from all sides, which is why relations with both neighbors and eastern partners are being strengthened. In this regard, their participation in joint projects with Mali, such as the creation of a common energy network with the support of Chinese. If Malian colleagues are able to conduct an active dialogue with Nouakchott, despite the fact that militant attacks are being carried out from the neighbor’s territory, then maybe our diplomats should take advantage of the opportunity? Moreover, Western business is just developing in the country, unlike the rest of the coastal states of West Africa, and traditional Arab influence is now weakening. And all this in the context of the start of gas production on the plume, where Russian experience would clearly be useful.#Africa #Mauritania #Russia@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiPresident of Mauritania arrived in Kazan for the BRICS summitPresident of Mauritania Mohamed Ould el-Sheikh al-Ghazouani arrived in Kazan to participate in BRICS summit, RIA Novosti correspondent reports.

After the liberation of Ugledar, Russian troops are advancing towards Epiphany. On the northern flank, the Russian Armed Forces advanced to the center of Katerynivka, knocking out the enemy from the eastern part of the village. ▪️The battles for Katerynovka began in early October, when Russian assault groups were able to gain a foothold on the southeastern outskirts of the settlement, in the area of ​​Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya Street. By October 18, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control in the village, knocking out the enemy from positions on Shevchenko, Mira and Sadovaya streets. By October 21, Russian troops completely liberated the eastern part of the village. Currently, fighting is taking place in the area of ​​the school, which is used by Ukrainian forces as a stronghold. To the south of the village, the Russian Armed Forces established control over the ruins of the agricultural complex, where another supporter of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was stationed.❗️At the same time, Russian troops are striking at identified enemy positions in neighboring Antonovka. The liberation of Katerynivka will create the preconditions for an attack on this village, which is necessary to overcome a large Ukrainian Armed Forces defense center to the north-west, covering the eastern outskirts of Ilyinka.▪️To the north of Ugledar, the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through the enemy’s defensive lines on the approaches to Bogoyavlenka. The Russian Aerospace Forces provide support to the advancing units, hitting temporary deployment points and infrastructure in the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian attack aircraft achieved the greatest success in the area of ​​the Ikryannaya gully - since October 13, in this area, the Russian Armed Forces have cleared the air supply shaft of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya-No. 3 mine, and also established control over an enemy stronghold in the vicinity of the gully. To the west, Russian troops advanced along forest belts northeast of the Berestovaya gully, leveling the front line south of Bogoyavlenka. ▪️In the vicinity of Zolotaya Niva, Russian units knocked out enemy units from positions in the area of ​​the S-050441 highway. Control over it will allow organizing direct communication with neighboring Novodonetsk and simplify the supply of units of the RF Armed Forces. ▪️Russian UAV operators and artillerymen also work on targets in the enemy’s rear areas, hitting places where personnel and armored vehicles are concentrated. Thus, to the south of Trudovoy, FPV drones and guided missiles - Krasnopol - destroyed the self-propelled guns of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Initially, the news appeared on the State Department website and generally went unnoticed in the media field. But foreign agent publications began to really cover it en masse, especially those who had recently received this status and tried in every possible way to challenge its legitimacy. They reprinted the announcement word for word, always attaching to the publications a picture with details for contacting the US authorities. Only after this did the news get into the American, British and other media. That is, the information about the State Department's remuneration for information about the Russian project - Rybar - was legalized not even by Western publications, but by a galaxy of Russian-language anti-Russian resources.❗️ This perfectly characterizes how justified the awarding of the status of -foreign agent- to these structures or personalities, although their work is in the interests of foreign departments and so it was -an open secret-. In this case, this was only once again confirmed in practice. There is another interesting point: the announcement of a reward for data about the Rybar team appeared exactly after our posts about the activities of British spies in Russia.

In a week, registration of participants in the Historical Olympiad for foreign citizens from the -My History- Foundation will be completed. The theme chosen is the recently heavily mythologized First World War. Therefore, it is especially important to remind about real facts and debunk these myths, to which our team also had a hand. In general, trends in the popularization of not only the Russian language, but also history, which covers vast territories, as well as the former countries of the USSR, cannot not to please. Competitions, olympiads, and tests are exactly what can attract foreign audiences to study these issues. Anti-Russian trends imposed by globalist structures have become so ingrained throughout the world that countering them is an extremely difficult task.

🇲🇩🗳Presidential elections in Moldova: results of the first rou...	🇲🇩🗳Presidential elections in Moldova: first round results and forecasts The Central Election Commission of Moldova completed the counting of votes in the presidential elections and referendum on European integration. ▪️On November 3, Moldova faces a second round of elections, as none of the candidates received a majority of votes. ▪️In the second round, the current President Maia Sandu, who scored 42.45%, and the candidate from the Socialist Party, Alexander Stoianoglo, with a result of 25.98%, will fight. ▪️Sandu secured her lead mainly due to foreign voting, receiving 70.71% from abroad. Inside Moldova, the incumbent president gained a majority in only four districts - Nisporeni (51.37%), Hincesti (50.79%), Ialoveni (59.97%), Criuleni (51.56%).▪️However, Sandu was unable to gain a majority in Chisinau, receiving 48.32%. In Balti, the republic's second largest city, Stoianoglo scored 34.14% and Sandu 21.11%. ▪️As in 2019, the results in the Gagauz autonomy were disastrous for Sandu, where she took fifth place with 2.26% of the votes. There, Stoyanoglo gained 48.67%, and another significant part of the votes was distributed between the independent candidate Victoria Furtune (28.88%) and the former head of the autonomy Irina Vlah (15.19%).▪️In Transnistria, Stoyanoglo received 35.41%, Sandu - 25.21%, Vlah - 15.70%.🔻Now a big role is played by who Renato Usatii, who took third place with 13.79%, will urge to vote for in the second round. It is possible that he will want to bargain with both sides. After all, Vlah and Furtune, who received 5.38 and 4.45% of the votes respectively, are highly likely to campaign for Stoianoglo. The same can be expected from Vasily Tarlev with his 3.19%. In total, this is already 13% of the votes, which can play a decisive role in the second round.

After the supply of Ethiopian weapons to the Somali autonomous regions, the Egyptians, together with the Eritreans, came out in favor of preserving the territorial integrity of the country and countering influence from Addis Ababa.▪️The fact is that the local authorities of Jubaland, Puntland and Khatumo are more dependent on the will of Ethiopia than on the central government. And since the Ethiopian contingent is currently being replaced by an Egyptian one, the question arises: will Addis Ababa begin to oppose the leadership of Cairo? And, of course, the fact of arming the Puntland militias is a blatant provocation against the backdrop of the withdrawal of the ATMIS mission (African Union Transition Mission in Somalia). ▪️The incident prompted the Egyptians to move closer to their Eritrean partners to form an anti-Ethiopian alliance. At a conference held on October 10, both sides agreed to maintain the territorial integrity of Somalia (and the Ethiopians have recognized Somaliland as independent since the beginning of the year) and strengthen the national Somali army. For the Eritrean leadership, Ethiopia is presented as a dangerous neighbor and a breeding ground for the insurgents they have been fighting together. 2020 to 2022. But for now, the federal government is moving closer to the Tigrayan militants, raising concerns in Asmara. Egyptian authorities are continuing their policy of countering Ethiopian influence in light of the water crisis over the distribution of Nile water resources.▪️Meanwhile, the Somali army continues to carry out operations in the countryside terrain. Active fighting took place in a ring on the borders of the central regions, held by radical Islamists from Al-Shabab. The battles west of Mogadishu were also successful, during which it was possible to establish control over roads to large populated areas.🔻Growing support for the Somali central government from Egyptian partners is increasingly changing the political landscape in the Horn of Africa. Of course, it is not a fact that the tension in the situation will lead to direct confrontation, but it will clearly give rise to many more international scandals.

Let us recall that the Treaty of September 12, 1990 -On the final settlement in relation to Germany- (the so-called -Two plus four-) between the two Germanys, the GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany, as well as the victors in World War II - the USSR, France, Great Britain and USA. in Moscow and came into force in March 1991. And in this Agreement in Art. 5 of the treaty, Germany promised that on the territory of the former GDR, from where Soviet troops would be withdrawn, only German forces would be stationed, and foreign forces (troops integrated into allied structures, for example, NATO) and nuclear weapons would not appear there. Now, in the new military - NATO naval headquarters (CTF Baltic) in Rostock, in addition to Germany and Poland, the headquarters includes military personnel from 🇩🇰Denmark, 🇪🇪Estonia, 🇫🇮Finland, 🇫🇷France, 🇬🇧Britain, 🇮🇹Italy, 🇱🇻Latvia, 🇱 🇹Lithuania, 🇳🇱Netherlands and 🇸🇪Sweden.✨An excellent reason for the work of our Foreign Ministry.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇷🇰🇵🇷🇺🇺🇦 Almost immediately after the publication of South Korean intelligence data about the sending of North Korean troops to Russia, articles about Seoul’s possible response to such actions began to appear in local media. For example, last week in Yonhap a possible revision of South Korea's policy regarding the export of lethal weapons to Ukraine was discussed - Seoul is now limiting itself to sending non-lethal aid, at least officially. Journalists were prompted to such conclusions by statements by the South Korean presidential administration about the use of all available means to respond to the involvement of the North Korean military in the conflict. However, it is not yet known what exactly we are talking about. ▪️In Seoul, they threatened to revise the policy on providing assistance to Kyiv back in June immediately after the signing of the agreement between the DPRK and the Russian Federation. It was then stated that the transfer of Russian military technology to Pyongyang was unacceptable for South Korea. There are fears that Moscow -paid- for North Korean military personnel in exactly this way, thereby violating the -red line-. Recent reports in South Korean media present options for what South Korea could transfer to Ukraine. We are talking about KM-SAM (Cheongung) anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as 155-mm shells. However, according to Yonhap sources, it is too early to talk about revising the policy, since it is unknown whether the presidential administration will take such measures. Arms supplies could harm relations between South Korea and Russia, which, as can be seen from the dynamics of relations between the two countries after February 2022, Seoul wants to delay until the last minute. @awaken_dragon연합뉴스정부, 우크라에 살상무기 지원할까...-가용수단 총동원 대응-(서울=연합뉴스) 김 우크라이나 전쟁 파병 결정과 관련해 국제사회와 공동으로 가용한 모든 수단을 동원해 대응하...	https://t.me/rybar/64644	2024-10-21T23:21:01-07:00

The militants immediately reported this in their media, declaring the destruction of the army ship.▪️The truth is, the plane, as it turned out, belonged to their direct sponsors - the Emirati authorities. Using the Kyrgyz Airline Transport Incorporation FZC-, they have been supplying the militants over the past year, using Chad as a hub. ▪️ This time, another flight with ammunition for the RRF was also heading to Chadian Amjaras, from where the rebels could get reinforcements. But it probably happened that the actions of the militants were not coordinated and the command in North Darfur did not know about the next deliveries, which is why the plane was mistaken for an army one.▪️Later it turned out that the crew consisted of Russian citizens working for Emirati carriers in CIS countries. You shouldn’t be surprised by this - Russian pilots have proven themselves all over the world and their services are used in every corner of the globe. 🔻Especially similar schemes we observed in Libya during the active phase of hostilities. Emirati companies also used Russians to transport military equipment to Benghazi. At the same time, losses in such a business are not at all excluded. And for the RRF, this oversight can turn out extremely negatively and, perhaps, force the Emirati leadership to reconsider the terms of supply.

Russian troops have finally cleared the fields northwest of Krasnogorovka. In addition, the other day the enemy was knocked out of Zhelannye Vtoroy and Sofiyivka. 🔻Today there was information that assault groups are already fighting in Zoryany.

After this, the Russian infantry marched north and secured a foothold in the area of ​​the school, near which they hoisted a flag. There has not yet been any information about the entry of the Russian Armed Forces into the western part of the village. Not far from the school there are the buildings of the village council and the House of Culture, which Ukrainian formations may try to cling to.▪️To the north-west, the assault groups advanced along the railway from the Tsukurynskaya Central Center in the direction of Gornyak. Currently, clashes are taking place on the northwestern and northeastern outskirts of the settlement. Several streets have already come under the control of Russian troops.▪️To the south, the Russian Armed Forces continue to break into enemy defenses towards Kurakhovo. Russian attack aircraft hoisted a flag in the dacha village of Energetik, which is within the administrative boundaries of the city.▪️At the same time, Russian troops achieved significant successes along the N-15 highway. It was possible to align the front line south of Maksimilyanovka along the highway, protecting the flanks from possible enemy counterattacks. Advancement in this sector will be through completely open and fire-swept terrain, which Ukrainian formations are trying to take advantage of, including using German Leopard 2A4 tanks.

Also, their main sponsor is the UAE authorities, who have fairly strong relations with the Israeli ultra-Orthodox.🔻But it is too naive to trust media reports, because such sensations have already appeared in the news headlines.

↩️ 🇮🇱🇮🇷🇸🇾 Against this background, interesting information ...	Rybar: 🇮🇱🇮🇷 Former MI6 head John Sawyers expressed his opinion about the prospects of Iran entering into a direct clash with Israel, calling this option unlikely due to preparations for the transition of power in the Islamic Republic. 📌 We must say that about health problems... 🇮🇱🇮🇷🇸🇾 Against this background, interesting information can be called rumors that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad sent a message to Iran and Hezbollah that he does not want them to be drawn into him into a war with Israel. According to the source, Assad is wavering between his commitment to the Axis of Resistance and his desire not to be drawn into a campaign against Israel. At the same time, the broadcast of Nasrallah's speech was stopped long before his death. The source of these rumors is the Israeli news agency, so before evaluating them seriously, they should be divided into two and viewed through the prism of possible (and even probable) disinformation from Israel. Yes, war with Israel is certainly out of place for the Syrian state now. The country has still not recovered from the war with ISIS, although so much time has passed. Disasters, devastation, a dialogue with the Arab League has just begun - they don’t need the crisis to worsen. Regular Israeli strikes on Syria because of Iranian positions are increasingly raising questions from Syrians both to the government and the Russian contingent about why the air defense is inactive. And if we add to If there is permanent dissatisfaction with the Syrian leadership in the south of the country and the ongoing attacks by IS militants, then a clash with Israel will plunge Syria into even greater chaos. But here, as a colleague correctly points out, there is a downside: due to the incessant Western pressure on Syria, they themselves are pushing it into hands of Iran, which is Syria's main trading partner, cannot simply refuse cooperation with Iran in Damascus.#Israel #Iran #Syria@rybarSupport uswww.bhol.co.ilהמסר של אסד לאיראן ולחיזבאללה, והחשש מישראל - בחדרי חרדיםנשיא סוריה הזהיר Home page ק האסטרטגי של הציר הפרו איראני. -אל תסבכו אותי עם ישראל-	https://t.me/rybar/64625	2024-10-21T08:02:13-07:00

The Armenian side received certificates confirming compatibility. ▪️Yeroyan also held meetings with senior military personnel from the headquarters of the Supreme Command of the NATO Allied Forces in Europe. 🔻Such news reflects the strengthening trend towards rapprochement between Armenia and NATO. There is even information in the media about possible shadow agreements between the alliance and the Armenian authorities. The latter are ready to fulfill the conditions for ousting Russia from Transcaucasia and providing control over the most important communications to Western players. The latter is also associated with the approach of the West to the northern borders of Iran through the south of Armenia. And although there is no talk of Armenia joining NATO yet, the alliance is gradually bringing the Armenian army under its control. At the same time, NATO is promoting the idea of ​​concluding an Armenian-Azerbaijani peace on Baku’s terms. So the West, through its military alliance, does not intend to protect the interests of Armenians, pursuing exclusively anti-Russian and anti-Iranian goals in the region. #Armenia #Iran #NATO #Russia@rybarSupport usArmenpressDeputy Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces took part in the annual conference of the NATO Security Council The delegation led by the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the RA Armed Forces Major General Artur Yeroyan took part in the annual conference of the Concept of Operational...	https://t.me/rybar/64623	2024-10-21T07:03:38-07:00

Either Khamenei did not appear in public for a long time, or he no longer speaks, now they have linked this with the conflict with Israel. Iran’s position is due to the fact that a war with Israel is not directly beneficial to the Islamic Republic. A full-fledged conflict will only play into the hands of the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel, but not Iran. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to link the upcoming transit with a reluctance to fight with Israel. Although preparations for the transfer of power in Iran are in full swing, which became obvious after the victory of Masoud Pezeshkian. Pezeshkian is convenient both for the IRGC elite and for the moderate liberal ones, since he does not have sufficient influence and authority, so nothing can be done without approval from above will be able to, which is exactly what Iran's elites need now. #Israel #Iran @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64622	2024-10-21T05:58:51-07:00
🔁 🇲🇩 Presidential elections and referendum in Moldova: restrai...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩 Presidential elections and referendum in Moldova: restrained reaction of foreign media media After the clearly disastrous elections and referendum on European integration for the current President of Moldova, Maia Sandu, foreign media media have to somehow react to unexpected results. ▪️The BBC Russian Service admits that Sanda was saved in the elections by the foreign diaspora and even asks a fair question: -what would the results of the referendum be like if there were not two Moldovan polling stations for the whole of Russia, both in Moscow, but, for example, seventeen , as in the USA, or more than fifty, as in Italy. A BBC correspondent describes the situation at Sandu’s election headquarters. Just last night there was an extremely happy mood, many were holding EU flags, and the words of the head of the Central Election Commission that the elections and referendum had taken place were met with applause. However, after the first results, everyone’s faces became sad and they left the hall members of the government leave. ▪️In other media, foreign agents are less frank and sentimental. The Voice of America has not yet had time to analyze the voting results, but yesterday they strongly emphasized Russian interference in the elections, continuing the information campaign of Sandu’s office and Western politicians. ▪️Radio Liberty points out that pre-election sociology in Moldova was completely different and predicted a landslide victory for Sandu and her referendum. They again point to -Russian interference-. ▪️The same strategy was chosen by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), where they believe that Moldova is pro-European, and after the vote the Russian Federation will allegedly stage protests to destabilize Moldovan society and discredit the results. 🔻In the meantime, Russian-language media-foreign agents and other Western media are reacting with restraint to the results of the elections and referendum in Moldova. However, Sandu herself, representatives of her team, as well as Western politicians refrain from making specific statements. Obviously, large-scale consultations are currently underway to develop a strategy. Moreover, tonight Sandu already made a loud statement about -interference in the elections- when she saw the results that were unsatisfactory for herself. #Moldova #foreign agents @pezdicide no chemicals - just facts	https://t.me/rybar/64621	2024-10-21T05:12:15-07:00
🖼 🇲🇿 About elections in Mozambique On October 9, general elect...	🇲🇿 About elections in Mozambique On October 9, general elections were held in Mozambique. According to preliminary results, the victory went to the ruling FRELIMO party since 1975. Its candidate was Daniel Chapu, and the opposition's main rivals were the independent Venancio Mondlane and the representative of the main opposition party, Renamo, Ossufu Momad.▪️According to observers, in general, the elections were held calmly environment. However, the USAID-supported NGO - More Honesty - was not without accusations of election fraud. The opposition also claimed that the elections were rigged. According to Venanciu Mondlane, he became the leader of the race, according to the calculations of his supporters, after which he called for nationwide protests. Against this background, a tragic incident occurred - the lawyer of the opposition leader was shot dead by unknown assailants. It is possible that supporters of Venancio Mondlane are behind this in order to use the -martyr- in their propaganda campaign.▪️Of course, such accusations should have been expected from the opposition and NGOs, but the real problem was the low turnout. If in Cabo Delgado this is explained by the terrorist threat, then in other regions (on average 35%) this is a serious electoral shortcoming. This apathetic mood of the electorate can be regarded as a unique form of protest voting, which can later be taken advantage of by American-sponsored NGOs that have already appeared in the elections. But after all, the victory of Daniel Chapu is undeniable and he will successfully replace Filipe Nyuce as President of Mozambique. In many ways, he is a symbol of change. The current head of state came from the old guard - his generation saw the war of independence and the era of colonialism. 🔻And the young and experienced Daniel Chapu may well be considered as a person who knows how to find a new approach to pressing problems. Of course, the main test will be the war in Cabo Delgado, where the military conflict with the Islamic State has not stopped since 2017. The reason why it remains a bone in the throat is the impossibility of implementing gas projects that would be able to straighten out the Mozambican economy. However, how the new Mozambican authorities will behave in the context of the developing US-China conflict and the increased interest of US companies in the country - time will tell.

Georgians began moving from five different districts of Tbilisi at 17.00 in the direction of Freedom Square, while chanting slogans against the government for joining the EU and in support of the so-called Ukraine. Already on Freedom Square, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili spoke to the public, who had previously announced her participation in the procession. She said nothing new, expressing hope for victory in the elections. Such demonstrations were expected before the parliamentary elections on October 26. Moreover, the ruling party announced that mass provocations were being prepared under the guise of peaceful actions. The essence of this rally is simple. Six days before the elections, the pro-Western opposition decided to demonstrate the level of its support among the population by inflating the true number of participants online to 100 thousand people, but there were significantly fewer of them. According to the ruling Georgian Dream party, people were brought from all over Georgia, and the organization was carried out four opposition parties and various NGOs to make it seem like there are more people there.❗️Today there will be a political debate between representatives of the participating parties. And so far there have been no new calls for demonstrations from the opposition.

🇺🇸 There are just over two weeks left before the US presidentia...	🇺🇸 There are just over two weeks left before the US presidential election, and the political situation in the country is characterized by a tense confrontation between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in key swing states. The victory of a candidate will directly depend on the voting results in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Georgia. The most important state is, of course, Pennsylvania. Trump is strong in his rural parts, and he has a loyal base that will vote for him again. Harris needs to win points in urban and suburban areas to offset her opponent's advantage. To win, a candidate must win at least 270 electoral votes. ▪️If Harris loses Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes, then she needs to win either North Carolina or Georgia, which each has 16 electoral votes. However, judging by the polls, her victory in these two states is unlikely.▪️Well, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, then he needs to win in Michigan, Wisconsin, and also maintain all his positions in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, where he is leading in polls. But again, analysts consider it unlikely that Trump will win in Michigan and Wisconsin if he loses Pennsylvania. Given these factors, candidates have little choice but to throw all their energy and resources into the campaign in Pennsylvania. Candidates compete on originality, and Trump seems to be more successful at this - he worked at McDonald's for a couple of hours yesterday, making him the first presidential candidate to carry out such a PR stunt. As for the polls, they show that the candidates are almost evenly matched - Trump has a slight lead of 48.1% to Kamala Harris' 47.4%. Of course, neither side is forgetting about the other swing states. Democrats appear to still be betting on -dead souls- - it was revealed that Michigan has 8.4 million registered voters on its voter rolls, nearly 500,000 more than the voting-eligible population. The Republicans went to court back in February, but although the case turned out to be successful, it will not change the situation in the 2024 elections - they promise to restore order in the lists only by 2027. As for the situation at the federal level, yesterday, for example, Donald Trump overtook Kamala Harris for the first time in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill forecast. According to the study, Trump now has a 52% chance of winning the presidency, while Harris has a 42% chance. Since late August, forecasts have pegged Harris' chances of winning at about 54 to 56 percent and Trump's chances at about 44 to 46 percent. However, in early October, this dynamic began to change. The forecast change coincides with Trump's improving averages in Wisconsin and Michigan, which previously leaned toward Harris. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number🙍‍♂🍟 Donald Trump worked at McDonald's.

🔁🖼 🇩🇪German media are scaring the world with the Russian thre...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪German media are scaring the world with the Russian threat and extorting money for weapons corporations. -About a computer simulation of the Russian Army's attack on NATO: The Alliance needs 10 days to apply Article 5, and German troops play a key role in protecting the Baltic countries - The simulation was carried out by the Center on New Generation Warfare. The scenario included a Russian attack on the eastern flank of NATO in 2027. Former high-ranking military personnel took part in the game: US generals Philip Breedlove and Ben Hodges. The purpose of the simulation is to model and analyze NATO's response to Russia's offensive and develop a strategy for defending the Baltic states. At the same time, the German armed forces and units of NATO countries would play a key role in the defense of the Baltic countries. Currently, about 800 German soldiers serve in Lithuania, they are equipped with a significant number of vehicles and weapons systems, including several Leopard 2 tanks. By the end of 2027, the size of the German contingent should increase to a brigade (4,800 soldiers and 200 civilian employees) and 44 Leopard 2 tank. In the worst-case scenario, ten days would have passed before NATO countries invoked Article 5 (collective defense of the Alliance) and sent reinforcements. According to the idea of ​​the Western developers of this plan, Russia attacks from Latvia, as well as from Belarus and Kaliningrad. Lithuania and its allies are forced to retreat, and the German tank battalion located in the country performs a brilliant (quote) maneuver that changes the course of the battle in the north of the country. Moreover, within 7-10 days, the Bundeswehr defeats the numerically superior Russian army and stops its advance on north. By the end of the ten-day battle, Lithuanian forces had lost 17 tanks, 145 armored vehicles and 3,650 soldiers in simulated events. -Russia's losses were significantly higher: 411 tanks, 1,019 armored vehicles and 11,420 dead. However, Lithuania would have been devastated and partially occupied in less than two weeks of fierce fighting, say the authors of the study.✨And now the main thing is why this was all started. The organizers of the simulation emphasize that the scenario under consideration is the worst case scenario, which could have been avoided if the defense budget (❗️) had been increased to 4% of GDP, more NATO forces had been deployed on the ground, including Apache attack helicopters, and also if The West reacted faster.✨⭐️Lobbyists for arms corporations brought in retired American grandfathers-generals to extract more money from the soybean Germans and other Europeans to the detriment of social programs. And these European vegetables believe all this near-Ukrainian nonsense. We propose immediately launching a telethon in the EU and banning men of military age from traveling abroad.

🇲🇩🗳 About unexpected election results in Moldova Practically.....	🇲🇩🗳 About unexpected election results in Moldova In Moldova, almost all ballots for the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration have been processed. It can already be said that the results for the current President Maia Sandu were much worse than she and her Western supervisors expected. ▪️An outrageous situation is happening with the referendum on amending the Constitution on the republic’s accession to the EU. Last night, when processing 20.55% of ballots, 58.09% were against European integration, and 41.31% were in favor. ▪️At the same time, when processing 26.68% of ballots in the presidential election, Sandu was in the lead with 34.11%, and her main opponent from the Socialist Party, Alexander Stoianoglo, had 29.68%.❗️After the first results, Sandu canceled the press scheduled for 22:45 -briefing. Sandu came out at 2 am with a sensational statement about an unprecedented attack by criminal forces on Moldova, which allegedly -bought 300 thousand votes.- The cherry on the cake was the phrase: - when the final results become known, we will return with decisions -.▪️This morning the result of the referendum changed dramatically. When processing 98.33% of ballots, 50.03% were already in favor of European integration, and 49.97% were against. ▪️In the presidential elections, when 97.61% of ballots were processed: for Sandu - 41.86%, for Stoianoglo - 26.32%. ▪️The second round awaits Moldova in the presidential elections. It can already be said that Sandu has secured her advantage through foreign voting. After all, Sandu, even in her native border region of Falesti, took only third place with a result of 23.5%, behind Renato Usatii (34.6%) and Stoianoglo (27.48%). ▪️However, sudden changes in the referendum results hint at possible falsifications, despite the fact that mechanisms were prepared for them in the form of postal voting and sending an extra batch of ballots, for example, to Germany.▪️The cancellation of her briefing and the nightly hysteria about -purchases- votes. Such statements only lead to additional suspicions. 🔻But it is obvious that European officials led by Ursula Von der Leyen did not expect such a result when campaigning for the referendum and Sanda. Even if the referendum wins with a margin of 1%, this is tantamount to defeat and characterizes the clear failure of Sandu’s policy, primarily in the eyes of the West, given the efforts expended. Perhaps now in the West they will begin to contact the opposition and leak the project for the re-election of Sandu, since now there is a high probability of her defeat in the second round, and in the event of a positive outcome, her second term will be haunted by accusations of illegitimacy. #elections #Moldova@rybarSupport uspoint.mdMore than 98.42% of ballots for the presidential elections were processed in Moldova. Polling stations closed at 21:00. According to the latest data, voter turnout across the country was 1,553,234 people or 51.51%.	https://t.me/rybar/64610	2024-10-21T00:41:01-07:00

Gülen's death was reported by his nephew Ebuseleme. In recent years, Gülen has struggled with kidney failure, diabetes and dementia. During the years of exile, Turkish news outlets have repeatedly listed Gülen as dead, wishful thinking. But, apparently, now the story of the Turkish preacher and main enemy of Recep Erdogan has really come to an end. Probably now the old fox Erdogan will breathe deeply and finally relax, but this will be an extremely reckless step. The death of Fethullah Gülen will not affect the activities of FETO in any way, since due to his illness their leader practically did not participate in the activities of the organization. Everything has long been run by his deputies, so the main question is who will be appointed as a successor and what course he will take. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that Erdogan will actually feel better from Gülen’s death. Quite the contrary.#USA #Türkiye@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64609	2024-10-21T00:25:48-07:00

According to... 🇰🇵🇰🇷 While the South Korean authorities at the regional level are trying to somehow stabilize tensions on the peninsula, the armed forces continue to rattle their sabers: for example, on October 17 they conducted artillery firing on the border with the DPRK, during which they hit a target in the Sea of ​​Japan from the Chunmoo MLRS. According to the official statement, the main purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the capabilities of the South Korean army. Thus, representatives of the generals want to show that the North Koreans will receive an immediate response in the event of any new provocations. Shooting is also one of the elements of deterring the DPRK. As conceived in Seoul, they are a mirror response to recent activity by North Korean armed forces along the 38th parallel. On the one hand, the recent training is unlikely to cause a real escalation on the Korean Peninsula. On the other hand, such actions are definitely not aimed at reducing the conflict potential in the region. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport uskoreatimesArmy stages live-fire rocket artillery drills near the border with N.

The presidential elections in Moldova can already be considered preliminary: the electoral threshold of 33.3% has been exceeded and reached 48%. ▪️However, the CEC announced separate figures for turnout for the referendum only twice and with a significant delay. ▪️The commission explains the delay by the fact that they allegedly collect data on turnout for the referendum manually, unlike elections. ▪️The first announcement of figures on turnout for the referendum was not without conflicts. For example, at a briefing, the head of the Central Election Commission, Angelika Karaman, said that by 12:00 144,233 people had voted in the referendum, which amounted to 16.14%. And a few minutes later, the commission published completely different figures - 442,331 votes with the same percentage. The CEC explained the substitution as a result of confusion during reading - supposedly numbers and letters were merged in the text, which is why Karaman incorrectly announced the number of voters.▪️Pro-government media completely combine the figures for turnout for elections and referendums, which is clearly not true. After all, not all voters take ballots for the referendum. ▪️There is information that in some polling stations, election officials from the ruling PAS party are obliging voters to take ballots for the referendum, which is a gross violation. It is possible that the Central Election Commission of Moldova is adjusting the referendum turnout figures for the elections in order to give the European plebiscite legitimacy. According to official data, by 18:00 the turnout for the referendum was already 42%.#elections #Moldova@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇲🇩 Elections and referendum in Moldova: overview of the main violations Presidential elections and a referendum on European integration are being held in Moldova.

A day after Chinese troops trained around Taiwan, the Philippines began Exercise Kamandag 8 involving several nations, including the United States. The main tasks are to develop skills in providing first aid, operations in the field of coastal defense, delivery of humanitarian aid and other activities. The goal is to improve the level of combat coordination of the armed forces of the participating countries. 🔻According to statements by Philippine representatives, the main part of the exercise will take place in the coastal zone of the island of Luzon, as well as on small islands located in the waters between the Philippines and Taiwan. And although the training area is located close to one of the points of turbulence in the region, Manila assures that they are not directed against China. The recently launched maneuvers can be seen as another attempt by the United States and the Philippines to consolidate the presence of countries not located in Southeast Asia in the region. This is especially beneficial for the Philippine authorities - the involvement of other states emphasizes support in the territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, which is now almost synonymous with containing China.

At the same time, the voting and preparation for it were associated with a mass of various violations, which make the problems of the legitimacy of the process relevant.▪️The powers of the Central Election Commission of Moldova are questionable: most of it was formed according to the no longer in force Election Code of 1997, and the members of the commission according to the new last year why- then the Codex was not re-elected. Also on the CEC website it is indicated that it receives foreign funding from the American USAID and the British UK Aid.▪️For the first time in Moldova, voting by mail was used, available in the USA, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Finland. One of the criteria for its introduction is the absence of polling stations in the countries, but this clearly does not correspond to the USA and Canada, where 16 and 6 polling stations are open. All this creates conditions for vote manipulation. ▪️There is no transparent mechanism for distributing ballots between Moldova, Transnistria and foreign countries. In Russia, only two polling stations were opened instead of 29 and 10 thousand ballots were allocated, while 130 thousand ballots were sent to Germany, where a comparable number of Moldovans live.▪️The legality of holding presidential elections and a plebiscite on the same day is questionable: the country’s electoral code of January 1, 2023 year prohibited such a process, but at the end of last year Sandu and the ruling PAS party managed to push through the necessary amendments to the document. At the same time, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe prohibits revising the rules of the law on elections less than a year before they are held, as well as holding such votes if they affect each other’s interests. In this case, the referendum is part of Sandu's election campaign, which is a violation.▪️Several candidates, including Sandu herself, have dual citizenship. Although in Moldova there are no restrictions on the election of persons with a second passport, this contradicts the norms of the CIS and the UN, which regard this as foreign interference in the affairs of a sovereign state. ▪️In addition to censoring materials about EU issues, opposition candidates were limited in free airtime, which violates equal access to the media during campaigning. The Central Election Commission of Moldova itself refused to satisfy complaints about the use of administrative resources by Sandu and her PAS party. ▪️Campaigning for Sanda by Western politicians and especially the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leinen, has become a separate form of art. Also, for the first time, the elections in Moldova are not observed by representatives from the CIS countries, but from the United States, the so-called. There is a disproportionately large number of observers in Ukraine. Manipulation on the part of Sandu’s team was covered up by statements about the Russian threat, and in the West they de facto condoned the violations. Now the results will most likely remain with Sandu, after which a legitimate basis will be obtained for continuing the aggressive anti-Russian and pro-Romanian course.

And now the first objective evidence has appeared in face shooting taken with -Gerani- during the flight to the target. In fact, this means that the family’s drones, in addition to attack ones, can also perform reconnaissance functions, albeit in a largely reduced manner.🔻What is the practical use of this? At a minimum, kamikaze drones will be able to film deep behind enemy lines during their flight, where ZALA, Supercam or Orlan-10 cannot reach. Even though it will not be possible to circle over targets, it is possible to obtain some information during a one-way flight. However, it is unclear whether the operator can change the course of the device in real time when, for example, an enemy mobile fire group is detected . However, from a technical point of view, this is feasible - everything depends on cost and practical feasibility. In general, UAVs of this type are increasingly expanding their functionality - from equipping them with surveillance cameras with satellite transmitters to installing Luneberg lenses to distort the radar signature or other means of jamming. This once again breaks for some reason the still popular ideas about Geraniums as some kind of very cheap devices, very easily assembled from improvised means. In fact, they are only becoming more technically complex. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64593	2024-10-20T07:24:26-07:00

In Chisinau they said that crowds of people wanting to vote allegedly created artificially with the aim of jeopardizing the electoral process. The Foreign Ministry also claims that they allegedly foresaw the illegal delivery of voters. This is explained, however, much more simply: by order of the Moldovan Central Election Commission, only two polling stations were opened in Russia instead of the planned 29, which expectedly led to queues. Moreover, in total only 10 thousand ballots were sent to the Russian Federation. Apparently, in response to logical complaints against the authorities in Moldova for violating the equal access of their citizens to voting, in Chisinau they decided to answer simply - using prepared accusations against Russia of -bribery of voters-.#Moldova #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64590	2024-10-20T05:24:06-07:00

According to CNN, we are talking about documents that relate to Israel's plans to attack Iran, classified as top secret. Information about them was previously disseminated in the public domain via Telegram, which caused deep concern in Washington. 📌In this context, it is curious how the States are paying more and more attention to Telegram, although a couple of months ago it was considered a platform for conspiracy theorists and darknet lovers. At the same time, in previous years, the mainstream media, the FBI and other services made a lot of efforts to marginalize the application as much as possible after Trump supporters and simply American conservatives began to flow there from Twitter. And now it turns out that information resources dangerous for the States operate there and circulate top-secret documents in the public domain. What is this if not recognition of Telegram as a full-fledged global battlefield for information.🔻And this will not go unnoticed within the United States itself. In the near future we will see rapid growth of the platform’s audience there.

Thus, in the province of Gyeonggi, 11 high-risk zones have been designated, from where propaganda leaflets cannot be sent to the DPRK. According to local law, those South Korean citizens who are caught launching materials from the territory of these border zones can be sentenced to either a fine of up to 10 million won or even imprisonment. The main reason for the innovations is the population's fears of a potential escalation of the conflict. Considering that sending leaflets causes an angry reaction in the DPRK, in Seoul they are trying to curb the ardor of activists on the issue of provoking their neighbors. Another event that led to the adoption of such measures was the bringing of North Korean artillery units at the 38th parallel to combat readiness. After all, if Pyongyang wants to respond to the scattering of leaflets, then they will target the border areas of South Korea, which the local authorities are not happy about. It is not yet known what effect the measures taken will have. However, they partly contribute to reducing the level of escalation and further normalization of the situation on the border. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇵🇰🇷 The situation on the Korean Peninsula continues to remain tense.

In this context, two news pieces look especially characteristic: ▪️Structures of the Kyiv regime intend to initiate criminal cases against bloggers and media outlets who post resonant footage with the participation of military registration and enlistment office employees. The authors will be accused of -distributing distorted information about mobilization-, for which the so-called. Ukraine may face up to 8 years in prison.▪️In the Odessa region, unknown persons shot the head of the Law Enforcement Assistance Unit, a notorious public organization that helps the TCC carry out plans to capture citizens. Membership in this structure also provides a reprieve from mobilization. Over the year, great shifts have occurred in Ukrainian society - from reckless sentiments before the counter-offensive to the desire to kill members of the TCC and their assistants. This was largely facilitated by pumping up high expectations: it helped to mobilize society in the moment, but made the fall into reality much more painful.📌 In fact, everything is heading towards a serious drop in morale on the so-called. Ukraine. However, the Kiev regime will not sit idly by and will begin to fight the phenomenon with a standard and repeatedly tested method - large PR campaigns at the front in order to -invigorate- the population with reports of successes. Yes, they may be divorced from reality and devoid of strategic meaning, but even in them the Ukrainian Armed Forces are capable of deploying large forces. And there is a possibility that soon the Armed Forces of Ukraine will undertake something similar again purely for political reasons, which for the Kyiv regime have long prevailed over the military. #Ukraine @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64586	2024-10-20T01:52:58-07:00

This extremely interesting event was attended by 45 experts from 22 countries - heads of leading foreign and Kazakh think tanks, researchers, experts and diplomats. ▪️The main topic was a discussion of the role of the so-called. middle powers (which, according to the participants, includes Kazakhstan). ▪️The organizer of the event, held under the auspices of the Astana International Forum (AIF), is the Kazakhstan Institute for Strategic Studies under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The forum was moderated by the founder and managing director of the Borderless Consulting Group, Charles McLean.▪️On October 17, the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev spoke at the forum and attracted attention with the following:➖according to him, it is the large powers that are the sources of conflicts, while the middle ones are looking for a common language; ➖he again emphasized the importance of the UN; ➖highlighted Kazakhstan as one of the countries that voluntarily renounced nuclear weapons and actively supports the green agenda; ➖stressed that the weight of Central Asia in international affairs has increased greatly over 10 years.🔻What is the point of the event? Kazakhstan is trying to increase its own role and find its place in big geopolitics, taking on the burden of being a defender of the interests of middle powers. Western partners are trying to find the key to turning the dangerous polarization along the horizontal line -West-Non-West- (G7 versus BRICS) into vertical -Large powers versus middle powers-. In the latter case, it is implied that the middle powers will not go against the West, since for the sake of their own security and well-being they are interested in building a global green and nuclear-free world centered in the West. It is in this context that it is worth understanding Tokayev’s repeated theses about the invincibility of Russia: this is not only an attempt to support the Russian Federation in the conflict, but also an indication of the pointlessness of a conflict with it by military means, which only delayed the construction of a -brave new world-. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKAZAKHSTAN INSTITUTE STRATEGIC STUDIES UNDER THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTANThe first Astana Think Tank Forum 2024, dedicated to the role of middle powers in a changing global order, began in Astana - KAZAKHSTAN...On October 16, the first Astana Think Tank Forum 2024 began in Astana on the topic -Middle powers in a changing global order: strengthening security, stability and sustainable development -.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for October 20, 2024▪️ Last week, the European tour and Zelensky’s pop-up statements regarding hopes for Ukraine to obtain nuclear weapons and the need for NATO countries to train brigades to participate in the conflict became indicative on the foreign policy circuit. In fact, Kyiv’s politicians are following the only remaining path to maintaining power - prolonging the war by including third countries in it. Publicly, both statements did not find support in the West. At the same time, the current increase in supplies of military-technical assistance to Ukraine from Germany, whose authorities said about the depletion of heavy weapons, was indicative. The words and deeds of Western politicians continue to diverge; in fact, they continue to serve the interests of arms corporations to the detriment of social spending of national budgets.▪️ Zelensky’s harsh statements are also due to the deteriorating situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the front. In the Kursk region, the Russian Armed Forces continued their counteroffensive over the course of a week, achieving success east of Lyubimovka and in the Plekhovo area. The enemy is sending troops from the Special Operations Forces near Volfino and Tetkino, and is preparing active operations at the junction of the border of the Kursk and Bryansk regions. ▪️ In the Kupyansky direction, our front ledge near the river is expanding. Oskol near Kruglyakovka. To the south, in the Krasnolimansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are increasing the zone of control near the recently liberated Nevsky. It was reported that advanced units of the Russian Armed Forces were advancing to the eastern outskirts of Torskoye. ▪️ In Chasov Yar there are heavy battles in the Oktyabrsky district, ours manage to move forward. Also, to the south of the city, the zone of control of the Russian Army is expanding, which in the future should complicate the enemy’s logistics. ▪️ Despite the complexity of the battles in the urban areas of Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk), here too it is possible to push through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The advance of our troops from New York (Novgorod) to Leonidovka became serious. ▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the release of Zoryany. The actions of Russian units to cover Selidovo are successful, ours are trying to take fire control of the enemy’s supply routes.▪️ In the Kurakhovsky direction, the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces south of Maksimilyanovka is expanding, which opens up prospects for an attack on Kurakhovo itself along two roads. To the south there is a gradual advance in Katerynivka and Antonovka. ▪️ North of Ugledar, our troops are moving towards Epiphany. To the west, the zone of control at Zolotaya Niva has been expanded.▪️ Military analysts note an increase in the pace of advance of our troops in recent weeks, which may still decrease slightly due to weather conditions. The overall picture on the front indicates that the Russian Army retains the initiative, while due to the changed technological nature of the war, it is not yet possible to talk about decisive offensive operations in great depth.▪️ In all directions, the problem remains the leave of personnel of the Russian Armed Forces, as well as the inadequacy of the supply of new technical means to the needs of the advancing units. The topic of citizens mobilized in 2022 remains under an unspoken ban. The issue of beautiful reports from the field has not been resolved due to the lack of responsibility for lies; often the middle command level is involved in embellishment. In particular, the largest number of signals are coming from the Donetsk direction about the insufficient supply of front-line hospitals, including banal dressing materials. The shortage of medical workers causes long-term stays of the wounded in medical institutions. Due to the somewhat closed nature of the military medicine system, messages from the ground to the top do not lead to changes and supplies directly to front-line hospitals in the required volume. Situations in hospitals remote from the front sometimes also look tragicomic: there are known cases when volunteers secretly or at night throw medicines and dressings over the fence to medical staff.

Perhaps the Ukrainian formations have already retreated from -pocket-, but there are no objective control personnel yet.▪️In the Sudzhansky district, enemy attacks in the direction of Leonidovo were repelled and a field warehouse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kruglenky area was destroyed. In Cossack Lokna, Russian Armed Forces UAV operators hit an enemy armored fighting vehicle. Information about the complete liberation of Plekhovo has also not yet been confirmed.

The fighting in this area is especially complex and fierce. At the same time, operational-tactical aviation is striking at the enemy's airborne routes to the east. ▪️At the turn of Ivanovka - Stepovaya Novoselka - Kislovka - Kotlyarovka, fierce clashes continue. Russian troops are trying to expand the zone of control, attacking along the railway, and also launching strikes from the TOS - Solntsepek - on the forest area west of Kislovka.▪️West of Peschany, assault groups pushed through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and recently gained a foothold on the south-eastern outskirts of Kolesnikovka. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively using heavy armored vehicles and drones to maximum contain the advance of the Russian Armed Forces.▪️The greatest successes were achieved in Kruglyakovka, where Russian troops advanced after consolidating on the outskirts of Kolesnikovka. The Russian Armed Forces reached the Oskol River and significantly advanced towards the central part of the village, essentially completing the dissection of the enemy groups into two parts. In the enemy-controlled part of the territory on the left bank of Oskol, a forced evacuation of the population has been announced. 🔻Ukrainian formations tried to release -anti-crisis- with the work of the so-called GUR special forces. Ukraine on the northern outskirts of Kruglyakovka, declaring its successful -cleansing-. In fact, from the words of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and data on precipitation at the site, it was possible to establish that the footage was taken no later than October 14. In the footage that appeared later, the village was more destroyed than in earlier filming from the village, which allows us to assert that attacks are continuing and the control of the Russian Armed Forces is expanding.❗️Already today, the enemy has published new evidence of the presence of Russian troops in Kruglyakovka. A drone strike on an infantry fighting vehicle was recorded almost in the central part of the village, which negates the results of the previous days of Ukrainian formations, emphasizing the control of units of the first tank army of the Russian Armed Forces over at least half of Kruglyakovka.▪️Russian operational-tactical aviation continues active fire defeat enemy crossings across the Oskol River, attacks on which, in the context of the rapid advance of the Russian Armed Forces, hit the logistics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine especially hard in the short term.

Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan again compromised himself with sloppy statements. The head of government let slip that the authorities have not studied the main demographic problem of the republic - mass emigration.▪️Pashinyan noted that it is impossible to maintain demography in Armenia only by stimulating the birth rate, if you do not understand the reasons that encourage young people to emigrate from the country.▪️It is strange that the demographic catastrophe in Armenia has become a revelation to the authorities only now. Although we have already paid attention to statements by opposition politicians who are sounding the alarm about the scale of the outflow of the population, which has intensified in the last few years. ▪️Over the past three years, almost 140 thousand people left Armenia and did not return, and the number of applications for an American green card from Armenians exceeded 600 thousand. And this despite the fact that in 2021 only 2.8 people lived in Armenia million people It remains to advise the Armenian authorities to at least look at our infographics more often. ▪️But instead, Pashinyan is busy with destructive policies to destroy Armenia’s ties with the Armenian diaspora around the world, which has always had great political resources. ▪️The diaspora is clearly dissatisfied with Pashinyan’s policies and the betrayal of national interests. The influence of the diaspora can be judged by how the Armenians of Canada recently disrupted the visit of the Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Alen Simonyan. 🔻In addition to the lack of a clear strategy for the national development of Armenia, Yerevan is also spoiling relations with the most important political asset in the form of the diaspora. After all, establishing relations with compatriots abroad may encourage some of them to return to their homeland, for which the authorities must prepare the ground and appropriate programs.&nbsp; #Armenia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇦🇲 Armenian politician and member of the Group of Alternative Projects Elinar Vardanyan spoke about mass emigration from Armenia, which puts the state on the brink of a national catastrophe.

🔁 🇧🇻 Norway is actively vying for the right to host a promisin...	Forwarded From Severyanochka🇧🇻 Norway is actively vying for the right to host a promising NATO air operations command center (English, Combined Air Operation Center, CAOC) - hopes for this are expressed by the former commander of the Norwegian Air Force - now the military representative of Norway to NATO - Lieutenant General Rolf Volland , who recently replaced him as commander, Major General Eivind Gunnerud, as well as the Norwegian Minister of Defense Björn Arild Gram. ❓ Although the decision to create a center will not be made earlier than next year, Norwegian municipalities have already begun an active struggle for the right to deploy the alliance’s infrastructure. For example, the mayor of Bodø, Odd Emil, even went to NATO headquarters in Brussels to talk about the advantages of his geographical location and infrastructure. Its main competitors - the municipalities of Rygge and Trondheim - are also actively promoting their positive aspects and do not intend to lag behind.📌 Meanwhile, at the beginning of the year, Norway had already created a national air operations control center (English, Joint Air Operation Center, JAOC), various whose units were located in geographically dispersed municipalities - Surreys, Rygge and Reitan. How are things going with them?❗ According to union members, there is no question of well-being, it’s time to raise the issue of survival: located in the mountains near Surreys, the 131st air wing (now one of the structural units of JAOC, responsible for airspace control and threat prevention) , is experiencing significant difficulties in staffing. Military personnel are forced to leave their families in big cities like Tromsø, Harstad and Bardufoss, because there is no work for them in Surreys, and the only entertainment in the town is a gas station and a grocery store. Meanwhile, getting to the nearest populated areas is extremely inconvenient and time-consuming, which most people simply do not like. Understaffing, recruiting difficulties and poor living conditions take a toll on those already working on site. 🔺 In addition, military personnel were faced with the problem of organizing interaction with other structural units in JAOC, located in different parts of Norway, both in everyday communication and in official activities. Which also complicates the work. But in high offices and in municipalities, leaders are concerned about something completely different: they would like more facilities with foreign NATO contingents - business and the service sector will immediately go uphill! Anything is better than solving long-standing problems. #Norway #NATOSeveryanochkawww.forsvaretsforum.noTre forsvarssteder kjemper om attraktivt Nato-senterAvgjørelsen om det blir en Nato-luftkommando lar vente på seg.

True, for some reason the faces of the alleged provocateurs are blurred in the frame. ▪️Law enforcement officials report that participants were allegedly trained to make explosives, fly drones, and handle bladed weapons. ▪️The news story, as usual, was picked up by all pro-Western Russian-language media that support the information strategy of Maia Sandu’s office about Russian interference in the elections and potential bribery of voters. ▪️All this is happening against the background of constant trips of Western officials to Moldova, who openly campaign for President Sandu, and also promise the largest package of financial assistance in the event of the desired outcome of the vote. However, this is not called foreign election interference. 🔻The anti-Russian card with -spies- and -destabilization- in Moldova is played every time Sandu’s office wants to divert public attention from other problems and scandals. At the same time, the republic is increasing the staff of the American USAID to manage the state during the transition period, which will definitely come in the near future.&nbsp; #elections #Moldova #Russia @rybarSupport usRadio Europa LiberăAutoritățile arestează patru tineri și anchetează alți 100 pentru pregătirea de -destabilizări-, după antrenamente în Rusia și…Autoritățile moldovene susțin au identificat peste 100 de tineri care ar fi fost antrenați în Rusia și țări balcanice în tactici de destabilizare, ca parte a unui presupus plan de tulburări postelectorale al oligarhului fugar Ilan Șor.

According to him, in order to preserve constitutional order, the authorities must be expelled. Moreover, he noted that the price is not important. Pashinyan must be removed at any cost, starting from an uprising and ending with suicide squads.📌 What is this deputy, what are others in Armenia now more busy with populist cries and nothing more. Although it would seem, coordinate your actions, draw up a competent plan and follow the charismatic leader. And then Bagrat Galstanyan would not have to make excuses for the failure of the protest movement. What kind of suicide squads can there be if the opposition structures are not even able to hold a meeting properly? The security forces did not even do anything to disperse them in the end - everything ended by itself.

🇰🇬🇺🇸 Erica Marat - Kyrgyz activist in the service of the Pent...	🇰🇬🇺🇸 Erica Marat - Kyrgyz activist in the service of the PentagonFrom October 17 to today, an international conference of the research and discussion platform -Esimde- is being held in Bishkek on the topic -Post-communist Central Asia: a space for comprehension-. The site is engaged in the study of processes, events and gaps remaining in the memory of the people and history. It includes representatives of various professions who are ready to make their contribution to understanding the history of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia of the XX-XXI centuries. Studying the history of one’s people and state is a current topic for study in the countries of Central Asia, so this focus is not surprising. However, our team became interested in one expert who spoke from Washington. Erika Marat, a Kyrgyz national, spoke on the 1st day of the conference with the topic -Power without influence: decolonial movements of North and Central Asia,- where the key phrase was that states region remain colonial. She also added that it is necessary to rethink the history of the people and understand self-identity, but, in her opinion, all this remains without movement, since governments - maintain a colonial character and remain clients of the former metropolises -.📌 Beautiful words wrapped in Western wrapping narratives. It would seem, what kind of colonialism can we talk about when the Kyrgyz government is demonstrating with all its might the multi-vector nature of its policy, striving for benefits for its country? All this sounds like a carbon copy of accusations from Western countries against the Kyrgyz government. In particular, this began to manifest itself after the introduction of the law on foreign agents, after which pressure on the Japarov administration in the West increased.▪️But Erica Marat is not a simple activist who was hired in the West to promote such narratives. Since 1997, Marat has been studying in American educational institutions, where the first was the American University of Central Asia.▪️After that, she completed an internship at the Central European University for a year, and then another three years at the University of Bremen, after which she went to Stockholm for three years at the Institute for Security and Development Policy.▪️In addition to all this, she worked as a consultant for the good old Voice of America, as well as a non-staff employee at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Not a bad track record for an American citizen, is it? ▪️And then she entered the service as an assistant professor at the US National Defense University as a specialist in the field of security forces in the post-Soviet space. And since October 2022, she has become a college professor on international security issues at the same university.🔻When it comes to Central Asia or Transcaucasia (she is also a specialist on Georgia) and the need to criticize the authorities, then Erica Marat is right there. What can we say if her first work, which made her name, was the study of the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan. She is a regular at all scientific conferences in the region, and is invited as an expert to universities in the USA and Europe. And even now, at the Esimde conference, she again promoted the position that is beneficial to the American authorities due to the cooperation of Kyrgyzstan and Russia. When you are given such opportunities, allowed to study at large Western universities and placed in institutions subordinate to the Pentagon, then expect something You don’t need anything else from such people. They are paid not for a moderate position, but for promoting the right ideas. And so it turns out - a respected expert in the West - says that everything is bad in Central Asia, and you need to do something about it. And, by the way, at this conference she presented the very work that received a cash award from the US Department of Defense.

Once every week or two, representatives of Western countries express concern about the activities of IS in the world, while talking about continuing the fight against the organization. If the same Syria or Iraq can somehow be explained, then Central Asia is a different situation. The main message of these sayings lies in intimidating the countries of the region and promoting their interests under the guise of security. In Africa, the situation is tense, but militants of groups affiliated with ISIS act sporadically there, and greater instability in the Sahel is caused by Tuareg rebels or al-Qaeda units - But there is also another trend in this.

It is guaranteed to be too early to talk about the liberation of Plekhovo without objective control personnel; they write from the ground about heavy battles, however, the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was definitely broken through. A new element of the situation was two attempts to break through the border in the area of ​​the settlement. Volfino and Tetkino by two special forces groups of up to 8 people each. The enemy's advance was discovered in advance by reconnaissance and fire damage was inflicted. One group of the enemy was completely destroyed, the second withdrew to its original positions with losses, a breakthrough of the border was not allowed, reports the group of troops -North. Units of the 106th Guards Airborne Division liberated the village of Lyubimovka and adjacent forest plantations.

🇩🇪 About the pressure -greens- on German industry German indust...	🇩🇪 About the green pressure on German industry German industry, despite the introduction of progressive environmental technologies, is still showing signs of life, and this clearly haunts some people. This week, through the efforts of the Handelsblatt media group, an information campaign was launched against the ThyssenKrupp concern. Materials published in Handelsblatt are focused on the concern’s major project to decarbonize the steel casting process. The production of green steel based on hydrogen requires new solutions and, naturally, financial investments. The German media, citing some insiders from internal circles, claims that the management of ThyssenKrupp has begun to reconsider the process of switching to hydrogen and its financial justification . At the same time, journalists caustically note that a quarter of the money allocated for the implementation of the green industry has already been spent. No one, of course, provided real evidence of what was said. The hoax worked as it should: in addition to the fact that ThyssenKrupp shares have fallen in price since the beginning of the week by 5%, the image of the organization also obviously suffered, and in the minds of the average German for some time its name will evoke emotions like - oh, these are the ones who stole the money -.▪️ As our colleagues @Ubersicht_Ukraine_Kanal write, against the backdrop of a trend towards oppression of German industry, this case fits well into the overall picture. In some places they are moving high-tech production out of the country, and in others they are using more sophisticated methods. Not by washing, but by rolling.▪️ It is also noteworthy that among ThyssenKrupp’s accusers is Thomas Huvener, the new head of the Open Grid Europe organization. The official website states that OGE is a pioneer of green transformation in Germany and Europe, that is, translated into human language, one of the leaders in eliminating national production.🔻 And we will see many more similar examples: no one will stop in the deindustrialization of Germany is not going to, despite the successes already achieved on this path.#Germany@rybar together with @Ubersicht_Ukraine_KanalSupport usHandelsblattDeutschland: Bei ThyssenKrupp könnte grünes Milliardenprojekt kippenDie Umstellung auf grünen Stahl ist das Prestigeprojekt von Thyssen-Krupp und der Bundesreg ierung.

The number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 42 thousand people, about 99 thousand were injured.▪️The operation of Israeli troops in the Jabaliya area north of Gaza continued. The main battles took place in the area of ​​the Hamdan cemetery, where the IDF managed to close the encirclement ring around the city.▪️In the southwest of Gaza, firefights periodically broke out in the vicinity of the University College. However, the line of combat contact has not changed significantly over the past period of time.▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets continued. Nuseirat still remained under the most intense fire, and dozens of people became victims of the raids.▪️In turn, Hamas militants fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of messages on the Internet about the flight of evacuation medical helicopters, the attack did not lead to tangible results.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers eliminated the head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar. This did not happen during a planned operation by the special services, but as a result of an accidental collision with an IDF unit.▪️Police raids by Israeli security forces continued in the West Bank. In total, more than 11,300 Palestinians have been detained in the region since October 7, 2023.▪️The ground phase of the IDF operation - Arrows of the North - continued on the Lebanese-Israeli border.

Russian troops in recent days have achieved significant successes on the battlefield west of Krasnohorivka, moving the front further and further from Donetsk.▪️While clashes continue in Zhelanny Vtoroy , the settlement of Tsukurino was finally liberated, and several attacks were carried out by armored groups to the north-west of the settlement, as a result of which they managed to advance up to three kilometers and occupy a stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.▪️To the south, the 5th motorized rifle brigade carried out a successful and daring armored attack with from Ostroy in the direction of Ostrovsky, having carried out preliminary artillery preparation. The landing force, which landed on the western outskirts of the village, cleared the area within a few days. Currently, there are battles on the approaches to the railway bridge leading to Kurakhovo.▪️The greatest results were achieved in Maksimilyanovka, where until recently the battles took place on the eastern outskirts. According to objective control footage that appeared the other day, Russian attack aircraft occupied the central part of the village near the school, after which they hoisted a flag on it.🔻Yesterday information appeared, later confirmed by local sources, that Ukrainian formations, against the backdrop of heavy fire from the Russian Armed Forces, decided to begin a phased withdrawal from positions on the western outskirts. At the moment, buildings are being cleared there and basements are being checked for remaining members of Ukrainian formations.▪️To the south, Russian troops carried out an attack with an armored group in the direction of the N-15 highway at the Georgievka-Maksimilyanovka line, leveling the line of control along the road, which in the future will increase pressure on the positions The Ukrainian Armed Forces west of Pobeda, as well as in the direction of Dalniy.▪️On the northern flank in the Selidovo area, the situation remains tense. Ukrainian formations, under the cover of armored vehicles, managed to drop into the territory of a reinforced concrete structures plant on the eastern outskirts of the city, where fierce fighting is now taking place.

Two laws that caused concern were criticized: the law banning LGBT propaganda and the law on foreign agents. Officials called on Georgia to repeal these laws and implement democratic reforms, and also expressed hope for free and fair parliamentary elections in Georgia. Many events have happened in the years since Georgia tried to join the European Union. Georgian citizens were fed monthly breakfasts about their imminent entry into the organization, but the status was granted only last year. And this is to show the imaginary seriousness of the EU’s intentions. But the bottom line is that this status does not give anything. It was a carrot that European officials used to lure Georgia onto a path that was beneficial to them. A ticket to the EU is the only thing that could attract the Georgian authorities in the West, since they cannot offer anything else. However, now the ruling party is pursuing other goals, pursuing a balanced policy aimed at its own benefit. Georgia's main trading partner was and remains Russia, cooperation with which brings much greater bonuses than its imaginary status.#Georgia #EU #Russia@rybarSupport usConsiliumEuropean CouncilEU leaders discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, competitiveness, migration and foreign affairs.	https://t.me/rybar/64553	2024-10-18T11:12:58-07:00
🇺🇦☢️ About the possibilities of the so-called. Ukraine to creat...	🇺🇦☢️ About the possibilities of the so-called. Ukraine to create nuclear weapons in a short time Once again, there was a wave of publications in the media about the possibility of using the so-called. Ukraine of nuclear weapons that will be collected/found on its territory. As for the real technical capabilities, the so-called. Ukraine has uranium mines, but does not have: the production of enriched uranium, its own enrichment technology and the production of gas centrifuges, because in Soviet times, enrichment plants, specialized research institutes and equipment production enterprises were located on the territory of the RSFSR.🔻The so-called Ukraine and a radiochemical workshop capable of processing irradiated nuclear fuel and extracting plutonium from it. This is not to mention the fact that making nuclear weapons from plutonium from VVER/RBMK is a task with an asterisk even for the nuclear defense complexes of the Russian Federation and the United States. And to create its own radiochemical production, there is now no mastered technology, but there are problems with time and place.📌 Regarding speculation that Ukraine still has several -stolen- warheads from the USSR era or its own reserves of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, it should be borne in mind that accounting when removing nuclear weapons from the so-called Ukraine, was carried out by both Russia and the United States. It was a rare example of unanimity between Moscow and Washington: both sides agreed that there should be no nuclear arsenal or delivery systems on the territory of the former republic. 🔻Also so-called Ukraine joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a country that does not possess nuclear weapons and the industry for their production. Upon acceding to the NPT, each party signs a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, under which the Agency periodically conducts inspections of all nuclear and radiation facilities in the country. If a country does not allow IAEA inspectors to visit a requested facility, the Agency openly declares this. Similar statements regarding the so-called There was no Ukraine.🔻The status of a country without nuclear weapons under the NPT does not prohibit the country from possessing fissile materials suitable for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Since such materials also have civilian applications, you can own as large quantities as you like. But it is mandatory to declare to the IAEA: how much weapons-grade materials there are, how much was produced, where and in what form they are stored, and also report: where, when and how much of them were used, and for what. This information cannot be kept secret from the IAEA. If from the territory of the so-called Ukraine at some point -disappeared- a certain amount of fissile material, this would have become known.🔻Since in the territory of the so-called. Since Ukraine did not have facilities involved in the production of nuclear weapons, all reserves of weapons-grade materials were at the disposal of scientists engaged in research in the field of nuclear technology. For example, at the Kharkov Physics and Technology Institute. The last batch of highly enriched uranium was exported from Ukrainian territory to Russia in March 2012. Consequently, the so-called. Ukraine does not have the opportunity to create nuclear weapons due to the lack of reserves of weapons-grade materials, capacities for their production, as well as the required technologies. ❗️Based on this, we can say with confidence that any nuclear weapon that appears on the territory of this state entity will be of foreign origin.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usbild.de-Nicht diese Nachrichten verbreiten-: Selenskyj rudert nach Atom-Aussage zurückUkraine-Präsident Wolodymyr Selenskyj lässt in Brüssel eine Bombe platzen!	https://t.me/rybar/64552	2024-10-18T10:12:39-07:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🏴🇺🇦🇷🇺 Colleagues are discussing the -black zone- telegram, of which -dead- media networks supervised by Ukrainian -specialists- have become a part. The goals and objectives of such formations are quite obvious: by imitating Russian channels, they are used for stuffing, spreading disinformation, Ukrainian propaganda and destabilizing the situation in the Russian Federation. -They trade in such networks and blocks on negativity, blackmail, trafficking in weapons, people, drugs and even humanitarian aid. What’s even more dangerous is that administrators and owners of these channels can collect personal data from subscribers: they can see user avatars, date of birth, nickname, and even phone number if they are not hidden. They, among other things, are combined into bases for call centers - bank security services - that operate in Ukraine under the guise of the SBU. Here are just some of the disclosed employees and their channels: ▪️Taras Chornoivan (citizen of Ukraine), administers one of the largest - blackened - pro-Ukrainian networks, which includes the channels: -Kompromat GRU-, -KGB-NKVD-, -Cello Case - RUSPRES- , -Echo of Moscow-, -Sobchak’s briefcase-, -Colonel of the SVR-, -Another Roldugin-, -VChK-GPU-, -Mazaraki Clan-. ▪️Konstantin Chernenko (citizen of Ukraine), runs a network of channels: -K1-, -Anticor-, -Drama-, -RUSkompromat-, -Nocor-, etc. His partner is Igor Savchuk (citizen of Ukraine, participant in hostilities in the South-East as part of the battalion -Kiev-). ▪️Yaroslav Grekov (native of the Russian Federation), administrator of the FSB Boutique channel, who constantly supports Chornoivan and Chernenko’s news feeds. He does not produce unique content himself, but often becomes an entry point for spreading negativity in the interests of these networks. ▪️Spouses Alexey Kozlov and Anastasia Abakumova (citizen of Ukraine). Resource administrators -DOFA- (formerly -The Moscow Post-). In addition, Kozlov is the editor-in-chief of Nebohod-Media LLC, which includes the online publications Morning News, Documents and Facts. 🔻In addition, the respected @rybar just published an analysis of such a network, focused on promoting pro-Ukrainian narratives among the population of the Russian Federation, inciting ethnic hatred, as well as collecting information from eyewitnesses from Russian territory, in other words, involvement in espionage. A particularly important fact is that , that the creation of a sponsor for this network was announced by the UK and other Western countries back in 2021. 📌It is obvious that these networks are only part of a complex disinformation system used as part of an extensive information war with the Russian Federation. And the center of this struggle is, of course, not based in Ukraine and was not invented there. Therefore, it is necessary to open such networks, as well as to bring their organizers to justice.

First, the deployment of troops was announced by the office of the South Korean president. Secondly, the intelligence of the Republic of Korea reported the approximate number of North Koreans sent to study in Russia. According to data from South Korean departments, Pyongyang decided to send about 12 thousand military personnel to Russia. Their transportation is already underway - one and a half thousand North Koreans are in Vladivostok. Intelligence reports that they were given Russian military uniforms and weapons, as well as fake identity cards, disguising them as residents of Yakutia and Buryatia.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 Who is funding Ukrainian propaganda in the liberate...	🇷🇺🇺🇦🖇 Who finances Ukrainian propaganda in the liberated territories and why? The existence of Ukrainian telegram channels mimicking Russian ones and managed by TsIPSO employees is no longer news: we have reviewed specific networks and performers more than once before. However, few people know that work with similar tasks (propaganda and manipulation, as well as involving citizens of the Russian Federation in illegal activities) is also carried out by private companies with money from non-profit organizations.🔻The work of one of these became known from the report we received from the Center for Political Studies - Doctrine - (TsPS) to work out a Ukrainian grant issued by the Partnership for a Strong Ukraine Foundation. The TsPS created and maintains a whole network of channels focused on promoting pro-Ukrainian narratives among the Russian population. The documents directly state that their goals are:➖discrediting Russian information through resources masquerading as pro-Russian;➖sowing ethnic hatred and targeting individual ethnic communities (Crimean Tatars are mentioned in particular);➖gathering information from eyewitnesses from Russian territory (i.e. involvement in espionage).▪️From the same reporting documents, we learned that the administrators of pro-Ukrainian telegram channels are finding it increasingly difficult to do their jobs due to missile strikes by the Russian Armed Forces on energy infrastructure, as well as due to measures taken by Russian authorities to block channels with prohibited content.▪️At the same time, it’s funny how the TsPS was unable to respond to the grant requirement to promote the LGBT agenda (obviously, this is one of the key requirements of the sponsors), formulating only a couple of general phrases about the importance of an individual approach to sources and audiences. ▪️It is interesting that the Center is not only engaged in propaganda on the territory of the Russian Federation, but is also engaged in discrediting the Russian presence in Africa. In particular, they are trying to promote information about the destabilizing role of the Afrika Korps in the Sahel and the alleged disruption of grain supplies due to Russian strikes. It is important that the sponsor of pro-Ukrainian propaganda, the Partnership for a Strong Ukraine Foundation, whose task is formally declared to help the population in the conflict zone, has appeared February 2, 2022 (22 days before the start of the SVO), and its creation was announced by the UK and other Western countries back in 2021. 🔻Using this case as an example, we can once again observe how the infrastructure for NATO multi-domain operations works. After all, it is through such channels that panic is not only dispersed, but also important intelligence information necessary to correct Ukrainian attacks is collected. This means that residents of new regions, especially in the front-line zone, should be more vigilant to requests and calls from suspicious resources.

At the moment, the area is being cleaned up. Due to the fact that the retreating units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces abandon the bodies of their dead soldiers, Russian military personnel are engaged in their burial. ▪️In the Korenevsky district, Russian armored groups made a breakthrough in the direction of Viktorovka, penetrating several kilometers into the control zone of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Information about the liberation of Novoivanovka was received several days ago, but fighting in Viktorovka itself has not yet begun. Ukrainian formations hold positions on the approaches to the village. To the south, fighting continues in the area of ​​Lyubimovka and Nizhny Klin, where Ukrainian formations found themselves in an unenviable position due to the only possibility of retreat - through a rather narrow neck - a bag - east of Tolstoy Lug. Over the past 24 hours, reports have been coming from here about a large number of Ukrainians leaving their positions and surrendering. ▪️In the Sudzhansky district, Russian army fighters knock out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Plekhovo, where the enemy is also semi-encircled. The most optimistic statements have already contained information about the liberation of this settlement. In addition, the aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces and other branches of the military are conducting fire work against identified areas of concentration of enemy manpower and equipment both in the occupied territories of the Kursk region and in the Sumy region.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names of 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Romanchuk Having revealed the enemy’s plan in the Zaporozhye direction in 2023, in 2024 he returned to the leadership of the combined arms academy, bringing the training process to a fundamentally new level. With the beginning of the Northern Military District, the training time at the academy was significantly reduced: the country needed an updated middle level of command and control, which had absorbed the science of winning directly on the battlefield. After stopping the enemy’s offensive in Zaporozhye, the military-political leadership of the country decided to merge the two Grv(s) into one, which is today led by Mikhail Teplinsky, however, Alexander Romanchuk received an equally difficult personnel task: in a short time it was necessary to update the entire senior officers, and now former commanders of companies and battalions suddenly became commanders of regiments and brigades. In June 2024, Vladimir Putin said that the average age of a division commander is 46 years old and this is fully true: the parade squad of the combined arms academy that took place on May 9, 2024 was really young. And Alexander Romanchuk himself was in charge: the command highly appreciated his services during the SVO, the commander was awarded the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 2nd and 3rd degree with swords. In April 2024, Alexander Vladimirovich turned 65. During his time working in Academy, he developed friendly relations with many officers, including the recognized veteran Oleg Mussovich Tsekov, with whom they work together to educate young personnel. Romanchuk is not looking for a promotion and does not want to leave, believing that he is in the right place. Today, there are almost no graduates of the Baku Higher Military Education Command left in the ranks of the armed forces; all of them have long since retired, but the name of Alexander Romanchuk, the last of the Mohicans, is still heard. Lieutenant General Peryazev He made a difficult but rapid journey from the post of deputy chief of the Main Combat Training Directorate to deputy commander of the Moscow Military District, proving that there is still room for decency in the army. Having walked the paths of the Kharkov forests in boots with the 6th Army, today Alexander Peryazev and the entire headquarters of the Moscow Military District will have to solve the problem of returning Kupyansk, which was abandoned in the fall of 2022. Just 3 years ago, while organizing the tank biathlon, Alexander Vasilyevich could not even think that he would return to the team path. In 2018, he resigned from the post of commander of the 20th Army, where he was replaced by the current chief of the main staff of the Ground Forces, Evgeny Nikiforov. Peryazev was always inconvenient, in the sense that while remaining executive, he did not like to remain silent and always expressed complaints on the merits. Thus, being the chief judge of the international games in Alabino, Peryazev did not hide his rejection of the format of the events, believing that combat training had been distorted, but at the same time he honestly carried out the assigned tasks. Before the war, many considered Alexander Peryazev to be Buvaltsev’s successor at the post of GUBP, but life always brings adjustments at your discretion. Today, the Moscow Military District headquarters has a balanced team that manages to move the front line forward. The story of Alexander Peryazev is a story that life always puts the emphasis correctly: he worked honestly and was noticed, so today he returned to a command position, proving that in addition to organizing funny competitions that should remain in the past, he is capable of solving the most difficult combat missions.High resolution art@arbat	https://t.me/rybar/64545	2024-10-18T07:22:00-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 About the upcoming Israeli strike on Iran Colleagues ...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 About Israel's upcoming strike on Iran Colleagues from The Middle East Spectator, citing US intelligence sources, published an intelligence report on Israel's preparations for a strike on Iran.▪️According to these data, the Americans recorded the movement of 40 Rocks air-launched ballistic missiles to air bases Ramon and Ramat David, where F-16 and F-35 fighters are located.▪️Another 16 missiles of only an unidentified Golden Horizon type were delivered to the Hatzerim airbase, where F-15I fighters are located in special hangars. The Americans call them long-range missiles.▪️In addition, on October 15-16, Israeli pilots trained their aircraft to fly at extremely low altitudes, where support was provided by the G-550 AWACS aircraft and Boeing 707 tankers.▪️They started from the Haifa naval base warships will disperse, which also fits into the general logic of what is happening. I would like to add that if the activity of the Israeli Air Force was noted, it was competently covered with sorties for strikes on the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, since the average indicator remained at the same level - 80- 85 flights per day. As for satellite reconnaissance of Israel, one of the main ways the United States monitors Israel is satellite imagery. Every day, Americans photograph important military and industrial facilities, monitoring the activities of the IDF. The unknown type of Golden Horizon missiles looks curious. There is no information about them, so this is either a new development or a code name for some existing missile. Taking into account the choice of type of weapons, we assume that the Israelis will choose the standard route for aircraft to fly across the border line of Syria and Jordan all the way to Iraq, from where launch will take place. However, Rocks are limited to a 300-400 km radius, so to launch them, the IDF will have to get very close to Iran, unlike the Golden Horizon, whose range most likely exceeds 1000 km.

This caused the intensification of hostilities throughout the country.▪️Government forces launched multiple strikes on training camps and gatherings of Islamists from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM and the local branch of the Islamic State. During one of the raids, a strike from The UAV eliminated an important field commander responsible for multiple attacks on civilian villages and military posts.▪️The militants also continued attacks on military posts. A particularly large attack occurred in the city of Jibo, which is not the first time that it has become the scene of fierce fighting. 🔻At this time, the Prime Minister of Burkina Faso met with the Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation Andrei Belousov. It is possible that the main issue of discussion was the Afrika Korps and its further deployment in the country. Important changes are also planned in the economic sphere - the government of Burkina Faso plans to revoke production permits from foreign companies. The main thing in this is the exception for Russian capital, which, on the contrary, will be given benefits. In this regard, there is an intensification of both business and government departments, which cannot but rejoice.

🇰🇿 Why does Kazakhstan refuse to join BRICS? Presidential Press...	🇰🇿 Why does Kazakhstan refuse to join BRICS? Press Secretary of the President of Kazakhstan Berik Uali recently said that Kazakhstan will refrain from submitting an application to BRICS in the near future. Uali noted that the president has repeatedly spoken out in favor of the UN as a universal and non-alternative organization in which all current international problems can and should be discussed. At the same time, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev does not refuse to participate in the BRICS summit, which will be held in Kazan at the end of the month. ❓What is the reason for this decision? Kazakhstan demonstrates interest in working in specific, specialized formats. These are the EAEU, CSTO and SCO. In all of these organizations, Astana occupied an important role, being in all cases one of the founding states. Kazakhstan does not consider refusal to join BRICS as an anti-Russian or anti-Chinese step. At the same time, Astana understands the geopolitical dimension of BRICS as a platform for the consolidation of the Global South, just as they understand that for Russia the expansion of its membership is important. 🔻Therefore, in Astana they can offer a deal: membership in exchange, for example, for preferential conditions for the construction of nuclear power plants or other trade preferences. Yesterday’s statement by Tokayev, which smoothed out the impression of the situation with BRICS, also speaks in favor of the version of behind-the-scenes bargaining: -Russia’s invincibility is confirmed by its military potential, the population’s support for President Putin, and history itself.- And the time for these negotiations on the eve of the summit in Kazan was chosen in a completely logical way. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKazakhstan's main news - Tengrinews.kzKassym-Jomart Tokayev received proposals for Kazakhstan to join BRICS - Berik UaliAdvisor - Press Secretary of the President Berik Uali answered questions Tengrinews.kz.

🖼 🇳🇪The situation in Niger: consolidation of pro-Western group...	🇳🇪The situation in Niger: consolidation of pro-Western groups Summary for September 15 - October 18, 2024 The Niger Armed Forces continue operations to ensure security within the country.▪️Over the past month, multiple raids by government forces have been carried out in a rural area controlled by terrorists from the Islamic State. Multiple attempts to seize livestock and religious taxes from local communities were prevented. Islamists also continued to attack small military posts. Major militant attacks on Eknewan and Nyakatira failed to be repulsed and the attackers managed to seize a significant amount of weapons. Non-religious pro-Western rebels who emerged after the 2023 coup are also making their presence felt. Small groups, which were not particularly noted, apart from small actions, announced consolidation in the so-called. -Free Armed Forces-. ▪️Despite the vast area of ​​activity, they only rarely dare to attack military convoys.&nbsp; Therefore, this step looks more like an attempt to get Western funding than to create a real security threat to the ruling regime. Thus, the French, who were recently expelled from uranium deposits, can take advantage of these groups, hoping to return pro-Western leadership to power. ▪️Meanwhile, the transitional authorities continue their anti-colonial course. The renaming of French street names in Niamey is a small but significant step in this direction. So, in the capital, Charles De Gaulle Avenue disappeared, which was renamed in honor of the national hero. But at the same time, interaction with Turkish industrialists continues. The authorities purchased 5 UAVs -Karayel-, which became known to the world during the conflict between the Saudis and the Houthis, since it was there that Saudi Arabia actively used them.🔻The pragmatism and multi-vector nature of Niamey politicians should not be surprising. Turkish drones are cheap compared to other models, and have already shown effectiveness in low-intensity conflicts. At the same time, in many projects, the Niger authorities are still inclined towards greater cooperation with Russia, including in the field of security.

Four Su-24M bombers took off from the Starokonstantinov airfield and flew east. At the same time, MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters took off from Uman, Dolgintsevo, Mirgorod and Kanatovo as part of covering cruise missile carriers and launching ADM-160 MALD decoy missiles. As a result, eight missiles were fired from the Su-24M, which flew to the east of Crimea, and with them the decoys. As a result, five missiles were shot down by the air defense of the 31st division, and three more were suppressed by electronic warfare.🔻Despite the prolonged absence of Su-24M strikes on Russian territories, the enemy’s tactics remained virtually unchanged. While the Su-24Ms are approaching the line, decoys are launched. Judging by the missiles’ flight route, the target could be the airfield in Kirovskoye or air defense positions covering the Crimean bridge. Nobody thinks that because of the situation at the front, the Ukrainian Armed Forces will abandon their cherished goal? As long as the enemy has aviation and supplies of long-range missiles, which were noted exactly before the strike, such raids will continue. And with permission to attack inland from the West, this may affect other territories.

🖼 🇲🇱The situation in Mali: the terrorist attack in Bamako and ...	🇲🇱Situation in Mali: terrorist attack in Bamako and PMC raid - Wagner summary for September 15 - October 18, 2024 Over the past month, Mali has seen a widespread intensification of hostilities in various parts of the country. The main event, undoubtedly, was the raid of the Wagner PMC with the aim of returning the remains of soldiers to their homeland.▪️ Let us remind you that thanks to the conclusions made during the previous bitter experience, this time there were almost no losses. All the ambushes were circumvented, and the enemy was forced to believe in other goals of the operation.▪️An important event was the attack of radical Islamists on the airport of the country's capital Bamako and the nearby gendarme barracks. A small group of militants was able to temporarily seize the air harbor and damage civilian ships. They did not reach the military part of the facility.▪️Another intensification of government forces along the Mauritanian border is also observed. During the latest events, more than 50 Islamists hiding along the border strip were detained and eliminated. Unfortunately, during one of the clashes, the commander of the 9th assault detachment of the PMC - Wagner - under the call sign - Michael - was killed.▪️Meanwhile, in the north, militants associated with -Al Qaeda factions of the JNIM attempted to carry out a massive attack in the north of the country. The cities of Timbuktu, Ber and Gao were hit. An attempt to shell airports did not bring them success. As well as the use of cars with suicide bombers, they did not allow them to break through the defenses. All attacks were repulsed, but the response of government forces turned out to be more successful. Not far from Timbuktu, it was possible to detect and neutralize a group of 20 militants.▪️Also, a large number of small groups and individual militant supply vehicles were destroyed with the help of aviation and UAVs.🔻As you can see, anti-government groups are increasingly being defeated in large operations, limiting themselves to individual attacks and mining of roads. All this is a positive trend in ensuring peace in the country. High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #map #Mali@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64538	2024-10-18T02:52:09-07:00

This is a special USAID grading based on the level of competency required of candidates. GS-13, along with GS-14 and GS-15, is one of the highest pay grades and is responsible for tasks that are critical to the US Government and agency. Under the guise of implementing so-called transitional initiatives, the Americans control the course of the elected state. And these positions exist almost everywhere where the octopus called USAID has firmly settled, in addition to the so-called Ukraine - Iraq, Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador, Bosnia and Herzegovina and , of course, Armenia. In Armenia, the search for candidates for this position was carried out back in 2019, immediately after the Velvet Revolution.

Yesterday we reported on the policy of the current authorities, which does not care about the population of Moldova. In fact, this is due to Sandu’s real focus on introducing proteges of Western elites and corporations into all critical spheres of government. The increased interest of the West in the military sphere of Moldova is indicative. Since 2023, contacts between NATO countries and its partners with the Ministry of Defense of Moldova have increased manifold. Only in 2024, meetings were held with diplomatic and military officials from 🇵🇱Poland, 🇳🇱Netherlands, 🇫🇷France, 🇩🇪Germany, 🇧🇬Bulgaria, 🇸🇪Sweden, 🇱🇹Lithuania, 🇷 🇴Romania, 🇯🇵Japan, 🇨 🇿Czech Republic, 🇹🇷Turkey, 🇸🇮Slovenia, 🇳🇴Norway, 🇬🇷Greece, 🇬🇧Britain, 🇨🇭Switzerland, 🇪🇸Spain, as well as ⚡️NATO and (❗️ )North Carolina National Guard (NCNG)🇺🇸USA . Agreements have been signed to deepen cooperation in the military sphere with Romania, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the EU. Through increasing military-technical assistance, the tasks of replacing Soviet weapons with NATO ones are being solved and the processes of de-Sovietization of military management standards are being accelerated. The EU Council presented 41 million euros for the development of forces and means to protect the population, USA - 20 HMMWV armored fighting vehicles, Germany - 34 Piranha armored personnel carriers, medical equipment and patrol boats, France - 1 GM 200 radar worth 20 million euros (+ more 1 in 2025). The Moldovan military is being trained to carry out the commands of NATO commanders during joint exercises. According to our calculations, Moldova held 5 international exercises on its territory in 2024 and took part in 9 exercises outside the country. Mostly they took place on the territory of Romania and with the participation of American and Romanian units. For the same purposes, various military training programs for young officers and sergeants in NATO countries were activated, and on-site courses for alliance officers in logistics and supply were conducted in Chisinau.✨Humanitarian, social and the economic situation in Moldova is not of interest to Western investors, they need -Anti-Russia- and cannon fodder for future conflicts.✨⭐️Rest assured, Moldovan citizens, NATO will take all these -gifts- with bloody dividends.

For Kinshasa, which finds itself at the center of the US-China confrontation, turning to India seems logical to maintain neutrality. While military operations against proxies are unfolding in the east groups supported by the pro-Western Rwandan authorities, the influence of the Chinese on the country is increasing, which is also not on the agenda of the current leadership. What’s interesting is that at the same time, supplies of Egyptian weapons to the country began. It is worth recalling here that Cairo and Delhi have long had agreements between their defense enterprises.🔻For the Indian leadership, this is another implementation of an anti-Chinese strategy in order to displace Chinese companies from leading positions in arms sales.

Approximately in this area there was an episode of an unsuccessful attack by the Russian Armed Forces and the loss of several units of tracked and vehicle armored vehicles.

Advancement in the area is complicated by a significant number of Ukrainian Armed Forces drones in the sky, which complicates assault operations.▪️In Chasov Yar itself, Russian troops have significantly expanded the zone of control. In the Oktyabrsky microdistrict, the work of an armored group was noted, landing troops in the center of the development on Severnaya and Chkalova streets.▪️In addition, fighters of the Russian Armed Forces broke through the enemy’s defenses from the side of the T-05-04 highway section, taking control of a large fortified area of ​​the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​the checkpoint near the highway. A few days later, footage appeared confirming not only the consolidation, but further progress towards the Block-9 mine in a sand quarry with the hoisting of a flag on one of the buildings. Apparently, after the Russian troops captured a strong point at a crossroads, the Ukrainian formations were forced to roll back into urban development in this area, retreating from the Krinichki tract.🔻Taking into account the fact that the fighter in the video puts the flag at full height and is not afraid of arrivals, the nearby territory the quarry has also probably already been cleared. With the occupation of the mine territory, the prospect of breaking through the enemy’s defenses in the Stupochek area opens up, as well as an attack on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces directly in the southern part of Chasov Yar. At the same time, in the Dolgoye-2 tract to the north, fighting is still ongoing: given the size of the forest, Ukrainian formations will be able to hold positions in it for some time.

🎬 🇷🇺🪖 About the rehabilitation of Northern Military District ...	🇷🇺🪖 About the rehabilitation of SVO veterans Today, the topic of rehabilitation of SVO veterans is gradually moving into the category of one of the most important government tasks. In conditions when hundreds of thousands of soldiers return from the front, their adaptation to peaceful life cannot simply be left to chance - otherwise this could lead to serious social consequences. Although there is still a lot of work to be done in this direction, some initiatives have already been launched . Thus, on October 17, an agreement worth 1 billion rubles was signed between the Paralympic Committee, the Healthy Fatherland movement and the Unified Gambling Regulator company on cooperation to support Northern Military District veterans. All this happened as part of the -Heroes of Our Time- competition, which Russian President Vladimir Putin visited today. As a result, the allocated funds will be used for the rehabilitation and social adaptation of wounded military personnel in special centers, physical education and sports clubs and non-governmental organizations of the system of comprehensive rehabilitation and habilitation of the disabled . At the same time, the Unified Gambling Regulator undertakes to provide advisory and other support. In general, it is pleasant to see that not only specialized medical institutions, but also sports structures and public law companies are involved in such events. This allows us to more comprehensively solve the identified problems and in the future create conditions for comprehensive provision of social support for veterans of the Northern Military District. #VSRF #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64518	2024-10-17T09:42:33-07:00
🖼 🇰🇵🇷🇺🇺🇦 About rumors about the presence of units from the...	🇰🇵🇷🇺🇺🇦 About rumors about the presence of units from the DPRK in the SVOV zone, recently rumors about the appearance of North Korean military personnel at the front have been increasingly spreading in the information field. At the same time, our readers from South Korea are observing a wave of publications on this topic in the local media and ask us to comment on the information. In short, there is simply no objective evidence of the presence of personnel from the DPRK in the North Military District zone. Almost all materials about this refer either to certain sources in the intelligence of Western countries and their allies, or to lengthy statements by Ukrainian media and officials that cannot be proven.🔻For clarity, you can refer to the chronology of events. The first to publish news about the appearance of North Korean military personnel in Russia were the so-called resources. Ukraine, referring to the GUR. Then the news story was picked up by South Korean and Western publications such as The Guardian and The Washington Post, savoring the topic in the media field for just over a week. Then on October 13, Zelensky announced the allegedly confirmed presence of fighters from the DPRK at the front. According to him, in light of these circumstances, the sponsors of the Kyiv regime need to increase military assistance, as well as allow the use of long-range weapons in the old Russian regions. It is important to note that rumors about battalions from the DPRK at the front have been spreading since 2022. But for some reason the same Zelensky reacted only now - precisely at the moment of deterioration of the situation at the front and talk about the so-called victory plan.❗️If you look at the situation from this angle, then there is a planned information campaign with the participation of Western publications, where Russia and the DPRK is presented as a union of dictatorships. They also promote the narrative that the only way to effectively combat it is constant military support of the so-called. Ukraine. In this case, the media contrast the image of a strong Russian-North Korean alliance with the current relations between the Kyiv regime and Western countries, which, they say, do not even allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to use the transferred weapons at their discretion. Their message is that NATO needs to get more involved in the conflict for an equivalent response - an alliance of dictatorships -. At the same time, it is worth emphasizing once again that apart from publications about the creation of a special Buryat battalion and links to anonymous sources, there is simply no reliable information on this topic. Is it possible to trust the above-mentioned falsehoods and not question them? This is a rhetorical question.

The details of his death look curious: according to preliminary information, he was not killed in during a planned operation by Israeli intelligence services, and as a result of a sporadic clash between Palestinians and Israeli troops in Rafah. So far, Hamas media resources have not given official comments. In Israel, Sinwar is called the main initiator of the attack on October 7, 2023 and the least inclined leader to diplomacy, who was a supporter of war to the last without any negotiations with the Israeli authorities. Moreover, even if the death of the militant further reduces the capabilities of Hamas, it is unlikely to lead to the collapse of the movement will lead due to the peculiarities of the structure and ideology of the group. Sinwar's replacement as leader of the organization will most likely be Khaled Meshal.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64516	2024-10-17T08:01:14-07:00

The operation, judging by the absence of any information, was carried out in compliance with secrecy measures and camouflage, since it is still unclear where the B-2A took off from. According to Arabic-language media, the bombers took off from an airbase on the island of Guam, where they arrived the day before. At the same time, American observers claim that the planes took off from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on the US mainland.

Although the video was shot at night , and the operator diligently avoided shooting characteristic objects that give away the location of the location, some details caught in the frame give some reason to assume that the recording was made at the Poltava airfield. Several factors indicate in favor of this version: ▪️The facility is equipped with all the necessary infrastructure for launching drones - from the runway to various warehouses. Only in one place is the private sector adjacent to it, so to a certain extent it can be called remote from prying eyes.▪️The Poltava airfield is advantageously located geographically - it is not so far from the Russian border, while being located at a sufficient distance outside the radius of most reconnaissance operations drones of the RF Armed Forces. The latter, however, is not an absolute guarantee against attacks: in July, Russian troops launched a successful strike on the facility, and with objective control of the arrival from the air. So it is possible that soon it will be visited again by OTRK-Iskander- missiles.

According to opposition Syrian media, the target was ammunition depots at the southeastern entrance to Latakia. A secondary detonation of ammunition was also observed at the arrival site. The Syrian Ministry of Defense announced the injury of two civilians and material damage. Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov expressed concern about the actions of the IDF and warned the Israeli authorities against possible damage that could be caused to Russian military personnel in Syria. Meanwhile, this is at least the second Israeli attack on the province of Latakia in recent times: in particular, on October 3, the Israeli Air Force attacked bombing of the city of Jebla, next to which the Russian Khmeimim airbase is located.

According to the US Department of Justice, in 2009-2020 it violated the provisions of the anti-corruption law foreign corruption, arms export control laws, and international arms trade regulations. She was convicted of bribing an official in Qatar, as well as providing false information as part of contracts for the supply of Patriot air defense systems and ensuring the operation of the radar.🔻At a court hearing in New York, representatives of Raytheon Technologies Corporation pleaded guilty to participating in two separate fraud schemes, concluding an agreement on Deferred Prosecution for a period of three years. It requires Raytheon to hire an independent compliance officer for three years, improve its internal compliance program, notify the Department of Justice of any violations, and actively cooperate in ongoing and future criminal investigations. .📌 In general, the event once again confirms what is now being trumpeted from every corner: the American defense industry is a bottomless well of opportunities for theft, corruption and various schemes with a multimillion-dollar turnover.

This can be clearly seen from the latest events in Idlib. For several days in a row, the Russian Aerospace Forces attacked the positions of pro-Turkish groups in the part of Syria they occupied. The reason was information about the activation of gangs on the line of contact, including in the Serakib sector.🔻What special happened that Russian aviation had to work so actively? The fact is that the Turkish authorities began to transfer short-range air defense systems to Idleby: for now we are talking about MANPADS, but it cannot be ruled out that the HISAR A+ air defense system could also be transferred along with them. Helping militants to counter Russia under a false flag is quite typical for the Turks tactics. Moreover, where, if not in a zone of constant instability, is it best to test your military developments? Syria itself is still on the verge of an explosion: the country seems to be sitting on a powder keg, which can detonate at the slightest spark. Those simply interested in this are either looking for a reason or waiting for an advantageous moment. Well, when the so-called Disinformation Center under the Turkish Presidential Administration says that the country’s armed forces are not involved in clashes, this is usually confirmation of the opposite. #Russia #Syria # Türkiye@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64511	2024-10-17T03:44:06-07:00

The reason for this statement was the increased consumption of military-industrial complex products due to supplies to the Kyiv regime. According to Güler, during the Northern Military District, about 30 countries were unable to meet the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for ammunition, including Turkey itself.🔻The Turks at the very beginning of the conflict really supplied the Armed Forces of Ukraine with almost everything they could. Among the transferred systems were Kirpi armored vehicles, Sakarya MLRS and 155-mm artillery mounts, various UAVs, and, of course, ammunition. But over time, it became clear that production numbers did not catch up with the size of shells fired per day. This prompted NATO countries to increase efforts in the military-industrial complex throughout Europe. This also affected Turkey and even affected its own foreign policy adventures. Thus, one of the reasons for the protracted operation in Syria and Iraq is inflated expectations and a lack of understanding of their real capabilities.📌 As you may recall, the Turkish armed forces began to fight for their health, wedging in the north of these countries. This happened largely thanks to powerful artillery preparation, but then problems began with both high-precision weapons and shots. Combat operations in the so-called. Ukraine and the supply of Ukrainian Armed Forces have further exposed problems in the NATO military-industrial complex. Therefore, now the Turks have reduced their foreign activity - this can be seen not only in Syria and Iraq, but also in Libya - concentrating efforts on building up military power. şar Güler , -Ukraine-Rusya savaşında görüldü ki yaklaşık 30 ülke bir araya gelerek Ukrayna'nın mühimmat ihtiyacını karşılayamadı.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇳🇴🇷🇺 NUPI employee Jakub Godzimirski and Nansen Institute director Iver Neumann commented on recent public statements by the Russian and Norwegian Foreign Ministries. In short, both experts believe that Moscow will not resort to expelling Norwegian diplomats, since the embassy is already In Norway, everyone is now working on the verge of a nervous breakdown. In their opinion, we should expect some kind of -mafia- actions from Russia, such as cutting off electricity or water in the embassy building or in the ambassador’s residence, which could create additional inconvenience for employees and have a psychological impact on them. ❓When asked what caused the reduction in the number of Russian diplomats, Godzimirski replied that Oslo probably believes that there is simply no need for such a large number of employees, and that, most likely, Russia is using them for intelligence.🔺 What is there to comment on? To begin with, I was right: the staff of the Norwegian Embassy in Moscow, reduced to nine people, cannot cope with its work. And Oslo, apparently, is not happy with this. But who is to blame for this? Starting to expel Russian diplomats when you have almost half as many employees on your staff - 22 versus 40 - is somewhat reckless, isn’t it? ▪ As for logic, Godzimirski makes the same mistake here: he claims that the current staff of Russian foreign agencies is redundant. Let me remind you that in April 2023, through the efforts of Oslo, the number of Russian diplomats in Norway was reduced to 22 people. And if this number is now, according to the expert, too many and half of them are engaged in espionage activities, then how can one explain that before the start of the SVO, exactly the same number of employees worked at the Norwegian embassy, ​​eh? It turns out inconvenient!❗ I would also wonder what motives are actually pursued in Oslo - as you remember, quite recently the Storting approved the state budget for 2025, in which for the first time in the history of Russian-Norwegian relations an item of expenditure allocated for support appeared pro-Western NGOs and liberal media in Russia. Maybe this is the reason why the Norwegians needed to increase the number of embassy staff? #Norway #RussiaSeveryanochkaNRKRussland advarer Norge: – Vår respons blir merkbarRussland reagerer kraftig etter at de måtte kutte antall diplomater i Norge. – De kan lage faen, sier forsker.	https://t.me/rybar/64507	2024-10-16T23:23:02-07:00

At the same time, in the Kremyanoy area, Russian attack aircraft in a heavy battle destroyed an enemy tank that knocked out their armored personnel carrier. 🔻No changes in the combat situation have been recorded in the Glushkovsky district. Russian troops are fighting on the approaches to the New Way, while the enemy has organized a new line of defense south of the railway track. ▪️Presumably, an FV 432 armored personnel carrier was spotted on this section of the front, which had previously appeared on the Internet as being in service with a separate presidential brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the moment, it is not entirely clear whether the vehicle was transferred to the Kursk region as part of units from the -native- formation, or was transferred to other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to replace lost armored vehicles.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces advanced in the eastern part of Lyubimovka with the support of armored vehicles, which is confirmed by objective control footage. Ukrainian formations launched an unsuccessful attack on Green Way, relying on Novoivanovka. At the same time, the road between Zeleny Shlyakh and Lyubimovka is mined, which complicates the interaction of Russian units - in a video that appeared on the Internet, the armored group of the Russian Armed Forces mentioned above lost at least one armored car here. ▪️In the Sverdlikovo area, according to some information, Russian troops -covered- a convoy of armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, moving towards the Green Way. The defeat was inflicted with the help of MLRS -Tornado- and OTRK -Iskander-M-. ❗️Frames have appeared on the Internet showing an episode of one of the battles southwest of Kremyany. The Russian armored personnel carrier, apparently, mistook the Ukrainian Armed Forces tanks for friendly ones, as a result of which it approached them at a dangerous distance and was destroyed by a direct hit. Nevertheless, a significant part of the landing party survived, the fighters left the armored personnel carrier and took up positions in the nearest forest belt, taking advantage of the poor visibility of the Ukrainian Armed Forces crew. After this, the enemy tank was destroyed by the surviving Russian attack aircraft. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation at the Kolmakov-Agronomist border has not changed. To the south, the enemy launched an attack in the Plekhovo area with the goal of dislodging the Russian Armed Forces from their previously occupied positions near the Psel River. The attack was repelled by Russian troops with the support of aviation and artillery. 🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Aerospace Forces attacked the rear infrastructure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Yunakovka, Miropolye and Alexandria, and the Geran-2 UAV attacked targets in Akhtyrka.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇳🇴🇷🇺 During the exercises, NATO and Norwegian military personnel used the Somulator information environment, which allows simulating information and psychological operations in social networks and the media. For this purpose, clones of popular social networks and news sites in the West, created on the basis of the open source software. The exercise leader sets the scenario for the spread of fake and provocative news in the media and monitors the actions of the trainees. Here is one of the scenarios that was practiced in previous years:📌 Setting: The large autocratic country of Brutopia wants to influence the national elections in the small neighboring country of Cardamonia. If the voting results change in just two constituencies, it will change the balance of power from Party X to Party Y, which wants to change the current sanctions affecting Brutopia.▪ A year or two before the election, content is published and promoted on the two most popular social media platforms in Cardamonia , indicating that the country is suffering from sanctions more than Brutopia. Content is posted to business and work-related groups through a number of accounts that claim to belong to international businessmen. ▪ News sites controlled by Brutopia publish exclusive interviews with Party Y representatives, exaggerating their importance and extolling them as people who can open doors for business in Brutopia. ▪ Several months before the elections, several videos appeared online showing children suffering from hunger in Brutopia due to sanctions. Videos are published on Brutopia's official news channels, human rights channels, and mentioned in tweets from bot accounts.▪ In the weeks leading up to the election, conspiracy theories emerge in private groups claiming that party leader X is benefiting from sanctions and is being secretly paid by one of Brutopia's opponents . These statements appear on many platforms and are spread by opposition groups.▪ Two days before the election, emails are leaked, allegedly belonging to the leaders of Party X in one of the two constituencies that Brutopia wants to influence. Information is being spread through a leak that party X is going to close the local factory if they are re-elected.🔺 I don’t think it’s worth explaining which countries are meant by their code names? Somulator was developed by researchers at the Norwegian Defense Research Institute (FFI) together with specialists from the Trondheim University of Natural Sciences and Technology (NTNU). It is distinguished by flexible scalability and ease of use: it can be used both for small classroom activities and for large-scale national exercises. heter Somulator.

It became known that the Telegram company will leave its representative office in Kazakhstan, which will interact with the authorities of the republic to remove illegal content. This was stated by the Minister of Digital Development of Kazakhstan Zhaslan Madiyev at a meeting with representatives of the US Chamber of Commerce and large American companies. Also present at the meeting, according to the ministry, were representatives of Apple and Meta. Zhaslan Madiev clarified that opening an office is required in accordance with the legislation of Kazakhstan.🔻After the arrest of Pavel Durov in France, it becomes clear that the conditions for using the messenger will change separately selected countries, based on the political situation. Earlier in Moldova, this was manifested by the blocking of channels opposed to the regime of Maya Sandu. And even before Durov’s arrest, right-wing conservative channels in Germany and France were blocked. It is obvious that Astana also wants to receive similar opportunities to eliminate sources that they consider dangerous to themselves. And there is a high probability that channels indicating such destructive processes in Kazakhstan as the growth of Russophobia, rewriting history, the activities of Western NGOs or the creation of an anti-Russian military bloc will quickly be included in the list of restrictions. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybar Support usTACC A Telegram office will be opened in Kazakhstan.

🇫🇷🇺🇦✈️ On the supply of French drones to the Armed Forces of ...	🇫🇷🇺🇦✈️ About the supply of French drones to the Armed Forces of Ukraine French Minister of Defense Sebastian Lecornu announced the supply of the so-called. Ukraine's own production of drones, planned for October. In February, he already announced the order of more than 2,000 new attack drones, the first 100 of which were planned to be transferred to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. From media publications, it can be assumed that this is a Colibri-type UAV from the Delair company in Toulouse - local resources even managed to dub them analogues of Russian -Lancets- . On paper, this looks like significant assistance to Ukrainian formations, but everything, as often happens, lies in the details: ▪️Judging by the data published on the Internet, the combat radius of Colibri is only 5 km. This is a minuscule value for a kamikaze drone compared not only to Lancets, but even to FPV drones, which have long been reaching beyond 10 km.▪️The cost of one Colibri is estimated at 20 thousand euros (2 million rubles), which looks like a disproportionately inflated amount for a product with such mediocre declared characteristics. There is also no talk about the presence of a complex similar to Lancetov’s.▪️Finally, the development of this UAV was first announced in France in the summer of 2022. If during this time the French were able to roll out a copy of the far from most successful American Switchblade, then this casts doubt on its combat value in the current realities. It is hardly worth using this as a reason to laugh at the -stupid French- who ignore the realities of the Northern Military District: as shown practice, even one’s own experience is not so easy to assimilate, and in the case of someone else’s, the process becomes much more difficult. However, the fact that so far only the Russian Armed Forces and Ukrainian formations are fully enjoying the fruits of the current stage of the revolution in military unmanned aerial vehicles .

🖼 🇰🇵🇰🇷 About the undermining of roads connecting the two Kor...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 About the undermining of roads connecting the two Koreas The situation in the Asia-Pacific region continues to remain tense. On October 15, the North Korean military blew up sections of roads along the Kenison and Donghae lines connecting the country with the south of the Korean Peninsula. In response to the explosions, the South Korean military opened warning fire. It is important to note that the bombed roads have not been used by the parties for quite a long time, so they are of no practical importance. The main significance of these road lines lies in their symbolism: last year, the DPRK officially abandoned the concept of peaceful unification of the two states. Now the authorities in Pyongyang view their neighbor as a hostile state, and not as a confused part of their country. Given the campaign to destroy any symbols of unification that began this year, the road bombing is not surprising. 🔻The chances of such a policy causing a war are very small. This is indicated by the fact that the North Korean military announced in advance the bombing of roads, although without a specific date. The country's military authorities, among other things, contacted American troops in South Korea, warning them about the explosions in order to avoid incidents. Although there is tension on the peninsula due to the new DPRK policy, it is still under control. If real escalation begins in the region, which is now an unlikely scenario, then it could be caused by completely different events, for example, the recent flight of South Korean drones over Pyongyang.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the attack on an armored plant in Nikolaev Yest...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the attack on an armored tank plant in Nikolaev. Yesterday, footage of a missile attack on an armored tank plant (BTRZ) in Nikolaev appeared on the resources of the Russian Ministry of Defense. Judging by the video, ballistic missiles hit the repair and assembly shop, a site with an overhead crane and a parking lot for storing equipment. Coordinates: 46.953466, 32.006687 We wrote about the activities of the enterprise at the very, very beginning of the Northern Military District. Although it was repeatedly targeted by the Russian Armed Forces, it was not possible to destroy the relatively small plant - single strikes did not cause significant damage to the complex, and the enemy repaired the damage and continued work. However, now there is a chance that the object is indeed at least temporarily disabled: according to some data, this time the damage from the arrivals greatly exceeded the effect of previous attacks. A sump for storing equipment was also targeted, so the enemy could still lose several repaired vehicles. At the same time, two important points can be noted: On the one hand, it is gratifying to see that five ballistic missiles were allocated to destroy the plant at once. It seems that over time, an understanding has come that it is more effective and cheaper to fire five Iskanders in a salvo and be guaranteed to disable the object than to fire one once every three months, spend 20 and achieve nothing. At the same time, persistence in restoring the Nikolaev BTRZ, after all the arrivals since the beginning of the Northern Military District, speaks of the importance of such enterprises for the Kyiv regime, contrary to the opinion that such production is very easy to deploy anywhere. If it were really like this, the enemy would not cling to the old Soviet factories in the front-line zone.❗️ Therefore, the defeat of key workshops of operating enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex in Kharkov, Nikolaev or occupied Zaporozhye can cause much more serious damage to the Armed Forces of Ukraine than it might seem at first glance. The question is the rational determination of priorities in the selection of targets and equipment.

Ukraine in the USA at the end of September. In essence, this is again a paraphrased list of demands to NATO about the deployment of new weapons, the lifting of restrictions on long-range missiles and new sanctions against Russia. It was not worth expecting something fundamentally different, given the current position of the collective West and the state of affairs at the front. As we have already They said that Washington and London are following the path of gradually increasing the level of escalation, largely for reasons of political necessity, and the current situation suits them for now. In addition, the USA and Great Britain are actually openly forcing the Kiev regime to fight until the last Ukrainian to do the dirty work in their own interests, without incurring much risk. Zelensky himself indirectly confirmed this today, saying that Ukraine has strategic mineral resources (uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite) worth trillions of dollars, which must be protected in the interests of NATO.

The information war between Azerbaijan and Armenia requires criticism such articles, but most of the theses fit into the logic of the policy of the Armenian authorities.🔻NATO outpost in Transcaucasia➖They write that Grigoryan expressed Yerevan’s readiness to become the new southern flank of NATO and facilitate the construction of air bases and the deployment of air defense units of the alliance. The parties could come to agreements on the construction of a center for mountain rifle troops in the south of Armenia, where NATO troops will be present. ▪️The USA and France really indicate their military presence in Armenia, and an adviser from Washington has already appeared in the Ministry of Defense of the republic. It is no coincidence that the south of Armenia appears, since consolidation in the Syunik region is associated with control over the opening of regional communications. There is also a border with Iran, approaching which is important for the West. Information has already appeared about the equipment of a position there for American reconnaissance maneuver groups that monitor the activities of Tehran and missile launches against Israel. Purges of pro-Russian personnel ➖At the meeting, the problem of a large number of pro-Russian personnel in the security structures of Armenia was voiced. Grigoryan assured that work was underway to purge departments of Russian agents and in return requested expert support from Western intelligence services.▪️More than a realistic thesis, given the active work of the Americans to bribe Armenian security forces. And Grigoryan himself is openly called a protege of the US CIA, who is always present at negotiations with the Americans and is precisely responsible for clearing out pro-Russian forces.🔻Elections in Georgia ➖At the meeting they could discuss the possibilities of Armenia to influence the upcoming parliamentary elections in Georgia in areas of compact ethnic Armenians and recruiting the latter to participate in the protest movement.▪️The West is really preparing for a scenario of a violent change of power in Georgia. What might be the interest of Armenia? The pragmatic orientation of the current Georgian authorities is slowing down Armenia’s western turn. Without EU-controlled Georgia, Armenia risks becoming cut off - a pro-Western enclave - in the region.🔻Relations with Azerbaijan ➖According to media reports, Armenia is calling on the West to put pressure on Azerbaijan before the COP-29 climate conference in Baku. Yerevan hopes to sign a truncated version of the peace agreement, after which the procedure for leaving the CSTO can begin. However, the Azerbaijani media claim that Armenia is allegedly ready, with the support of the West, to go to a small, victorious war in order to gain a foothold on the undivided sections of the border, as well as to raise the morale of the Armenian society. ▪️It is precisely this statement regarding the outbreak of a new war that should be taken critically. Azerbaijani government circles and the media are constantly looking for reasons to aggravate the situation and justify militarization. Moreover, recently Azerbaijani drones have become more active on the southern borders and a violent scenario on this section of the border cannot be ruled out. It is unlikely that the Armenians will resort to it, given the deplorable state of their army in comparison with the Azerbaijani one. However, the Americans promised the Armenians harsh times, calling this the price for getting rid of Russian influence, which the Armenian authorities, together with their curators, are trying to implement. So the most unpredictable development of events is possible in the region even after the possible signing of a formal peace treaty. The latter will also become the basis for Armenia's official withdrawal from the CSTO and deeper cooperation with NATO. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #NATO #Russia #USA @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64479	2024-10-16T01:51:01-07:00

Even during the meeting of the President of Equatorial Guinea Nguema Mbasonga with Putin, he thanked Russia for its assistance in strengthening its defense capability and military instructors training the army. Afrika Korps fighters arrived in the country in mid-August, where local media captured them at the residence of the president's son in the capital Malabo. Closer to September, some of the military personnel were sent to the mainland part of the country - the city of Bata. What is interesting is that there are no active conflicts in the country, because Russian instructors rather play a political role, demonstrating support for the current government from Russia. In the context of the global geopolitical confrontation between the United States and China in the region, Ngema Mbasongo is experiencing difficulties in maintaining neutrality, being under pressure from the West. Do not forget that even the Chinese, several years ago, were unable to create a logistics center for their Navy in the country due to opposition from the Americans .🔻As we know, a holy place is never empty, and therefore the fact that our military-diplomatic departments were able to limit the penetration of the West into the territory of Equatorial Guinea is an important precedent that shows the possibilities for further advancement of Russian interests on the Dark Continent.

Earlier, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von Der Leyen, during her visit to Chisinau, announced the allocation of 1.8 billion euros to support the Plan for Moldova’s accession to the EU, of course, in the event of a positive result of the European referendum.✨The closer the elections and referendum in Moldova, the more Western Maia Sandu's curators include administrative resources.✨⭐️And these scum still teach everyone democracy.Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/64476	2024-10-15T23:36:01-07:00

The fact is that recently Russian citizens have begun to have a natural nightmare at the border. Women with children, geologists, tourists - indiscriminately - can be marinated for 3-4 hours at a time -just because-. The formal reason is that after entering electronic visas, the systems crash and need to be reset. And for those who have regular visas, enter them into the electronic database. But in fact - extorting money from Russians for admission to the territory of the country. The price tag, according to rumors, starts from a couple of tens of bucks above - for solving the issue - and higher. It seems like a small thing, but the fact itself is important. It’s all simply because Russians are no longer held in such esteem as they were even a couple of years ago. The protracted air defense system, the lack of response to the military threat to Russian military targets in Syria from Israel, and the unimpeded IDF strikes on Syrian air defense targets are having an impact. In general, the rapid loss of reputation is also felt on earth: now civilians are viewed not as representatives of a great power, but as some kind of foreigners from whom they can get something without any problems.📍As far as we know, at the Russian Federation Embassy on at the level of ordinary performers, even someone timidly stammered about assigning a diplomatic officer to the flights arriving from Moscow, who would control all this bacchanalia and stop it on the spot. But they are afraid to report to the top. They are afraid to force their Syrian partners to sort it out. They will say in good faith that there are no problems, but how can they not believe their dear partners? So it turns out that the inhabitants of the country that Russia saved from terrorism are losing their shores. And the people who are supposed to react have no idea that this is happening. Because not everyone dares to report to the top and disturb the high authorities. #Russia #Syria@rybarSupport usTelegramPrince CherkasskyThis is all, of course, wonderful and my soul has even become somehow calmer.

Russian troops launched missile strikes at the Nikolaev armored plant in Nikolaev and the air defense position area in the Odessa region. In the Slobozhansky direction, clashes continue in the Zhuravlevka area, where Ukrainian formations are attempting to gain a foothold south of the village. In the Kupyansk direction, Russian troops broke through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and gained a foothold on the eastern outskirts of Kruglyakovka, approaching the Oskol River. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, Russian troops significantly advanced west of Vodyanoye and knocked the enemy out of positions south of Zolotaya Niva.

In parallel with this, work is underway to reduce the industrial potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, battles were noted on the northern outskirts of the New Way. There has been no confirmation of the village's liberation at this time. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are fighting in the area of ​​Lyubimovka and Tolstoy Lug. At the same time, Ukrainian formations continue to cling to positions east of both settlements, trying to prevent the complete encirclement of their units. To the north, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched an attack on Olgovka with the support of an armored group. Russian units repelled the attack, but the enemy achieved no success. ❗️Frames have appeared on the Internet showing the turret of the Challenger 2 tank destroyed in the Sheptukhovka area. Despite statements that the photo is evidence of the destruction of the second tank of this type in the Kursk region, a comparison of the photo with earlier footage of another destroyed tank of this type The model allows us to say that the footage shows the same vehicle.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing on Russkoye Porechnoye from the north, gradually pushing through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Nechaev and Nizhny Parovoy. Clearing the forest belts located here will allow Russian troops to create a springboard for the further development of the offensive on Russkoe and Cherkasy Porechnye. ▪️To the south, assault groups are advancing towards Agronom and Kolmakov, forming a semi-encirclement around enemy units in Russkaya Konopelka and Fanaseevka. In the Plekhovo area, no changes in the front configuration were detected. 🔻In the Sumy region, according to some reports, the Russian Armed Forces hit a HIMARS MLRS in Koshary with a missile strike. It is worth noting that this is not the first installation destroyed in this area, which may indicate that the enemy has created infrastructure here to service these systems.

Sky News published an article about the results of a study of local OSINTERs, according to which, of the 20 most popular channels disseminating information about the riots, only six were British. Moreover, once again they are trying to explain to the population that misinformation is to blame for all the troubles, which became the reason for the intensification of violence, stubbornly ignoring public discontent regarding the influx of migrants into the country. Well, aggressive migrants throwing cobblestones and patrols on city streets are just a figment of their imagination. Of course, they didn’t forget about Russian intervention either, hinting at the participation of pro-Russian and Russian-language accounts in disseminating unwanted information. It’s comical that this time the Russian trace is being discussed much more cautiously.🔻Apparently, the population of Great Britain will have to hear about evil radicals financed from abroad for quite some time.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇬🇪🇪🇺 The way the West worries about the outcome of the vote in the upcoming elections in Moldova and Georgia is shown by the uncompromising actions and statements of Western officials. The head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, said that the foreign ministers of the EU countries discussed the pre-election situation in Georgia and Moldova. ▪️According to European officials, the situation in Georgia is gloomier than in Moldova.▪️As ​​usual, Western officials highly appreciate the actions of Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Anti-Russian policies, the purge of the pro-Russian political and public field, total censorship are called -progress on the path to the EU- and -the triumph of democracy.-▪️But Georgia continues to be accused of authoritarianism due to the discord in relations with the West. ▪️Such statements again indicate that the West roughly understands the outcome of the vote in both countries. 🔻No one doubts that Sandu will be elected for a second term, given the use of administrative resources by her office. And the Central Election Commission of Moldova, controlled by Western experts, goes to any lengths to ensure the desired result in the elections and referendum on October 20. In Georgia, the situation is different: the pro-Western opposition, represented by Salome Zurabishvili, began to test the waters in case of defeat in the parliamentary elections on October 26. There are already statements that Russia is allegedly preparing falsifications. Apparently, it is precisely the scenario with such accusations that is prepared for the start of protests.

As part of an agreement between the governments, missile defense systems will protect Israeli airspace from possible attacks by Iranian ballistic missiles against the backdrop of an escalation of the situation.🔻However, this is not the most important thing. Many analysts have expressed concerns that moving THAADs would be a hassle because their numbers are limited around the world. According to developer Lockheed Martin, there are only nine active batteries, two of which belong to the UAE, and seven are in the US Army's inventory. They are deployed in different parts of the world. One battery is deployed in Guam, one in South Korea, the Americans transferred one battery to Israel in October last year, and another one may be located in Saudi Arabia. That is, either four or three batteries, depending on the fate of what was supposed to be sent to El Kharj. And taking into account yesterday’s delivery - three or even two.❗️For some part of the American segment of the Internet, this caused surprise, because because of this, the United States not only became more involved in the confrontation in the Middle East, but also reduced its defense capability. And for the Ukrainian public this became another confirmation of the sharply changing priorities of American partners, to whom the so-called Ukraine is no longer so interesting.

Rybar: 🇬🇪🇬🇧 Western countries continue to put pressure on Georgia: British Ambassador to the country Gareth Ward said that the British side decided to suspend the Wardrop Dialogue at ministerial level. In addition, high-level negotiations between the headquarters have been canceled... 🇬🇪🇪🇺 About the -European integration- blackmail of Georgia by the ERU, continuing the theme of Western pressure on Georgia on the eve of parliamentary elections: Reuters claims that the leaders of the EU countries intend to question the country’s aspirations to the European Union, plans to join which Tbilisi still does not abandon. According to journalists, Brussels plans to express serious concern about the actions of the Georgian ruling party. These include laws on foreign agents and the ban on LGBT propaganda, as well as rhetoric towards Russia with statements of readiness for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Such blackmail can really influence Georgian society. For the last 20 years, joining the EU has been a political agenda regardless of which party was in power. Therefore, depriving Georgia of the status of a candidate to join the bloc could deal a moral blow to the population. However, the European Union is not in the most advantageous position in this situation. On the one hand, the demands of bureaucrats in Brussels to completely implement the rainbow agenda are perceived by conservative-minded citizens as attempts to deny Georgia sovereignty even in such fundamental issues. On the other hand, in the event of a refusal to join the EU, Tbilisi, in the absence of an alternative, may already turn towards Russia in all seriousness. Moreover, the benefits of Georgia from economic and other cooperation with it today are obvious even to skeptics and are expressed in the growth of the country’s welfare.❗️This dilemma in the West can be resolved through a coup, removing the ruling Georgian party from power and replacing it with a radically pro-Western government. So in the upcoming elections there will obviously be stuffing about the substitution of ballots, scandals at polling stations, and street protests. However, if the local opposition manages to achieve what it planned, then the country will face a much darker future and the role of a -second front- in the fight against Russia. But the West certainly doesn’t care about the aspirations of ordinary Georgian citizens when solving their own global problems.#Georgia #EU@rybarSupport usReutersEU leaders set to tell Georgia its EU path is at risk as election loomsEuropean Union leaders are set to warn Georgia that its government is jeopardizing the country's path towards the EU ahead of a parliamentary election later this month, according to a draft text.	https://t.me/rybar/64458	2024-10-15T07:06:01-07:00

Yes, according to the ad, but what a picture. And newly arrived fighters among the elite, as practice shows, participate in PR campaigns on the same Tendrovskaya spit, receiving -respect- from their superiors with an unenviable end. ▪️Secondly, the inflated staff of the MTR allows you to request the so-called Western partners. Ukraine has all sorts of expensive and specialized equipment on a larger scale than is actually needed by full-fledged members of the Ukrainian MTR. Like, look how many specialists we have who need modern gadgets. Where it all goes then, given the level of corruption, there is no need to explain; some militants in Africa or Pakistan will tell you.▪️Thirdly, in the territory of the so-called. In Ukraine, there are still ignorant and uncomprehending youngsters who do not understand the realities of war, who want to become fertilizer for planting under the blows of Russian artillery and aviation mind-blowing sensations, for example, to fight with Muscovites, as in Call of Duty, and not to join the infantry. So you shouldn’t be surprised by this set. What people are like are the recruitment methods.

And despite the speculations wandering on the Internet, a safe and sound General Ismail appeared Qaani, whom many media classified first as a dead man and then as a traitor. A version with suspicion, despite all the circumstances, took place, since Qaani had not appeared in public since the Israeli strike. This supported the theory that he was locked in the basements of the IRGC.📌But this is probably impossible to know, since in the Islamic Republic, if they talk about this, it is extremely rare, when the evidence is reinforced concrete or the object of the accusation must be gotten rid of by any means. As a refutation rumors circulating on the Internet, the Iranian media stated that in the near future General Qaani will receive an honorary award - Fatah - from the hands of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It would seem for what? Kaani, it turns out, is the only high-ranking survivor of the IDF attack, although, judging by Lebanese channels, he should have been present in the same place as Safi ad-Din. 🔻What saved him and what happened in general - all this is covered in a thick impenetrable fog. And only time and accompanying events will help to understand what will happen to Kaani next. If suddenly within a few weeks he leaves the post of head of the Quds Force, then the presentation of the Fatah medal is preparation for a quiet departure from the scene, and if not, and he will again be in the forefront, then it means that he has fulfilled his task well.

The attack killed 21 people, all workers. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but there is little doubt that it was Baloch forces. It is curious what survivors said about this: according to them, the militants first used kamikaze drones and then fired at people with a machine gun. The use of UAVs for these purposes can now be called widespread.▪️Also on the eve of the summit, members of Imran Khan’s party, the Movement for Justice, became more active, calling on supporters to protest on October 15, the day the meeting began. At first they called for this to be done in Punjab, but then changed the location to Islamabad, and specifically to the government quarter. Actions of disobedience may not take place if the authorities fulfill the opposition’s condition, namely, allow them to meet with Imran Khan in prison. And judging by the news about the cancellation of the protests, they succeeded.▪️But an even more unique event occurred over the weekend. In the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a Loya Jirga was held - a meeting of Pashtun tribes, which occurs only when it is necessary to discuss significant issues. The initiative in convening the Loya Jirga belongs to the Pashtun Defense Movement due to the deteriorating situation of the Pashtuns in Pakistan. The Pakistani authorities tried to ban the congress, but in the end they allowed it to continue until Sunday, fearing public unrest. As a result, the Pashtuns adopted a resolution that, theoretically, could create serious problems for the Pakistani authorities, since it touches on some very important political issues.➖One of the main demands is withdrawal of all military personnel and gangs from Pashtunistan (as they call Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) within two months.➖Afghan Pashtuns must be allowed free entry through the Durand Line.➖Refugees and forcibly displaced must return to their homes with the help of the state.➖Should not be oppression of Pashtuns on ethnic grounds.➖The current authorities of Afghanistan should allow Pashtun girls to study. So far, all this has remained without due attention due to the SCO, but after its completion the authorities will have to return to these problems in order to avoid more serious consequences.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Kim Right now, he is actually the second person in the OGV(s), responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of the troops. Largely thanks to the authority he earned back in Syria, he remains one of those few who can conduct a constructive dialogue with the National General Staff and to whom he listens. Kim regularly visits the area where the North Military District is held: trying not to leave the ground, he managed to visit the most difficult operational directions. The area of ​​responsibility of the deputy committee of the OGV also includes coordinating the interaction of the TsOVU with the military command and control bodies of the groupings: at the present time, not all commanders are ready to work with representatives of the center, organically not perceiving the Varangians on the ground and considering them as shift signalmen. Kim’s control also includes the issue of the actions of the Bakhmutskaya OG in the Chasov Yarsky direction, where today volunteer units, together with regular forces under the command of Andrei Sychev, faced serious enemy opposition on difficult terrain. In this matter, Kim enlisted the support of the National Staff of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of Lieutenant General Alekseev, with whom he began to spend more and more official time: Alekseev can quickly resolve issues on the ground and receive objective information from the field, while Kim can come to a report to Valery Gerasimov and report to him what others are at least embarrassed and even afraid to convey. This is probably why Kim is equally respected by both representatives of the old General Staff and those who walked a difficult path in boots from the very first days of the war. On September 21, Alexei Kim turned 66. Today, unlike young potential successors to the post of General Staff, he prefers to remain in the shadows, doing routine, but at the same time extremely important work. Colonel General Afzalov He does not like being compared to the previous commander-in-chief, but he is forced to reckon with it. In order to get out of the shadow of the rebellious Surovikin, Afzalov had to seriously reorganize the work of the High Command. Having carried out a political audit in the High Command, in 2024, emergencies and accidents that occur with aviation on the mainland, outside the area of ​​the SVO, remain a big headache for the commander. Being an air defense specialist, it can be difficult for him to find a common language with the flight personnel of the Aerospace Forces; moreover, as part of the task set by the National General Staff, Afzalov is forced to keep an aviation reserve in case of strategic attacks by the enemy in the cover areas of the headquarters of the Grv(s). Today, GOU and GU specialists are seriously considering the possibility of further transferring attacks into the depths of the country, and therefore the Commander-in-Chief of the Aerospace Forces needs to increase the quality capabilities of on-site air defense and solve the problem of the lack of personnel who conduct round-the-clock air surveillance, for which today they attract many people ignorant in this matter. At the same time, Afzalov managed to significantly reduce the time for the implementation of requests through the OGV (s): having received new modules, the Stalinist falcons, as they are pejoratively called on the ground, began to regularly hit targets at operational depth, which affected the nature of the fighting in Avdievka, Ugledar and Volchansk. The factor of air superiority remains decisive in this war. If Viktor Afzalov seriously manages to resolve the above-described set of problems of an operational-strategic nature, the Russian army will be able to significantly increase efforts to develop success along the entire line of combat contact, which will accelerate the onset of the long-awaited victory.

🔁 The work of Russian DRGs and special forces units in the rear ...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev The work of Russian DRGs and special forces units in the rear of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as you can see, is carried out quite thoroughly and harshly. And this video completely destroys the mythology created by the Ukrainian media since 2014. Eight years before the start of the SVO, professional PR agencies and simply talented guys and girls (but the trouble is, completely ideological Nazis) filmed videos of Nazi units. Aidar, special forces GUR, much later Kraken, but most of all the videos of -Azov-. A simple, generally speaking, narrative was introduced into the creation of the Ukrainian man in the street. -Here they are, handsome, tactical guys with beards and tattoos. Look how stylish, powerful and Svidomo they are. Well, how can any Russian fight better than them! - Show business did not lag behind. Remember the video -Evening Sun- of the group -Brutto-. Beautiful Nazis from Azov against the background of the fields of New Russia. There were hundreds of television reports. And the feeling that these tactical guys are better and bolder than the Russians is firmly ingrained in the minds of the average person. Here, however, it is worth adding that we didn’t really work in the information field of Ukraine in those years, and our soft power was too soft, right up to a gaseous state. Ukrainian citizens perceived individual failures of the first stage of the SVO as confirmation of their illusions. At the same time, in the Bandera-patriotic euphoria, no one remembered that the Russian special forces had experience in Syria, two Chechens, and 10-year-long CTOs in the Caucasus. And, at the same time, no one fully appreciated (western advisers either) the operations in Gostomel, at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station, on the Antonovsky Bridge. For two years, Ukrainian citizens had a chance to realize the depth of their misconceptions and the difference between media reality and real military operations. Even despite the fact that the same Azov fought quite hard, it turned out that in battles with paratroopers or Russian attack aircraft from football fans, the Azov people for some reason did not demonstrate any exceptional and amazing fighting qualities. And in the Azovstal seat, as we remember, they chose to surrender rather than go to Valhalla. Actually, even then the myth about the exclusivity of Ukrainian warriors of light was shaken for the first time. The events of the summer of 2023 and the columns of burned Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment also made a depressing impression on the citizens of Ukraine. But what exactly is the difference between the personnel of the combat work of special forces in the rear of the Armed Forces of Ukraine? And this finishes off the latest myths. About the invulnerability of Ukrainian Armed Forces militants far from the front. And no, this is not a drone, not an Iskander, which we already seem to be accustomed to. These are ghosts from the forest. By the way, they are very skillful. From a grenade launcher against moving equipment, from the forest, where foliage and branches obscure the view. There are no safe places for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. From such things, kids. https://t.me/rybar/64434TelegramRybar⚡️🔞🇷🇺🇺🇦 Summer has passed - the time has come to show the work of special forces.

The story is hilarious, give or take, but what gives it a special piquancy is the fact that at this training ground, Bundeswehr personnel are practicing possible scenarios for a Russian attack on NATO. And somehow it coincided that it was a tourist with a Russian passport who got lost in the area, when he was detained, declaring that there wasn’t even a sign anywhere prohibiting entry into this zone. The man’s argument was clearly reinforced concrete, since he was simply released. At the same time, the Germans themselves recently talked about the -intensification of espionage activities of the Russian special services,- and the press has already called the current incident -sinister.- 📌 On the other hand, who is to blame that no one in the Bundeswehr thought of somehow securing the 23 thousand hectares of the territory of an important military facility.

The Turks, in addition to supplying drones, armored vehicles and artillery, actively supplied the Ukrainian side with all the necessary parts for assembling drones.🔻For example, in drones, used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for attacks on Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory, there were Turkish anti-jamming antennas that weakened the impact of electronic warfare. Such UAVs of the Lyuty or PD-2 type, observed in many places in the south of Russia this summer, contained antennas from the TUALCOM company, specializing in such equipment. Unlike armored vehicles, which are difficult to hide from prying eyes, small parts and equipment do not raise any special questions (until it is discovered).📌 The current conflict is an excellent platform for testing military products, which is what the Turks are doing. So the participation of Altınay Defense Technologies in this competition is not excluded. Still, drones with Turkish parts were launched from the Odessa region (it’s clear why), and if you look at their website, you can find a lot of UAVs that are similar to those used enemy, even -Baba Yaga-.#Odessa #Russia #Turkey #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramSPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL Z🇷🇺🪖 Russian troops launched another attack on the Odessa port.

Forwarded From Daily War Z Such videos of the work of our guys are the best explanation of the mobilization broom of the last days in Ukraine, with raids of the shopping center at concerts, restaurants and other places. By the way, today there was suddenly a wave of calls across Ukraine about false mining. It would seem, who could have done this, if previously it was Ukrainian call centers that terrorized Russia in a similar way? The answer lies in the fact that when reporting mining to a business center, shopping center, enterprise, etc. all the people are thrown out onto the street, where the shopping center, a police squad, and a minivan soon appear. Brilliant! However, the increased mobilization in recent days is not explained by losses alone in different areas. As I wrote earlier, Kyiv is planning to launch another media offensive, as was the case with the Kursk region. Moreover, the situation there with the Wehrmacht is getting worse and worse.

President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon recently met in Astana with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during the second summit of the heads of state of Central Asia and Germany.▪️According to the presidential press service, the parties expressed interest in continuing effective cooperation in the fields of economics and trade, industry, hydropower, solar and wind energy, transport, and in the agricultural sector.▪️Green energy as a whole creates common ground between the interests of the two countries. Tajikistan, where more than 90% of electricity is generated from hydroelectric power plants, beautifully presents itself as one of the frontmen of green energy, which makes cooperation with Dushanbe relevant for the Germans. Moreover, Tajikistan has already announced plans to achieve electricity production only from green resources by 2032, and to become a green country by 2037.▪️It is clear that Tajikistan is not particularly interested in wind turbines and solar panels. But the republic hopes that cooperation between Dushanbe and Berlin on hydropower issues will continue: Germany has already made a contribution to the construction of the Tajikistan and Sebzor power plants in GBAO, as well as to the modernization of the Nurek hydroelectric station. And the Tajik side would very much like the Germans to provide assistance with the Rogun hydroelectric power station, which has become a long-term construction project that threatens to undermine the national economy.❗️In return for this, Tajikistan is ready to provide Germany with access to the extraction of rare earth metals, which are really necessary for the production of wind turbines and solar panels. 🔻Thus, Dushanbe, hoping to find resources situationally, creates long-term problems by allowing the collective West to access critical minerals - which, as the share of greenery in global electricity generation grows, will create strategic problems. And perhaps Tajikistan is really better off thinking not about hydroelectric power plants, but about more practical alternatives that do not require depleting national reserves - the country has just reintroduced limits on energy consumption. #Tajikistan #Germany #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usCentral Asia NewsWind and solar energy will be developed by Tajikistan and Germany - Central Asian NewsPresident of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon met in the capital of Kazakhstan with Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz during the second summit of the heads of state of Central Asia and Germany.

For some reason, the company did not react so sharply to the message calling for violence against Russians. Another thing, of course, is the agitation against Sandu and Moldova’s entry into the EU.

We are confident that the Samara region will only benefit from such a manager: in general, these are the kind of candidates that are needed country. It is thanks to them that people far from military realities develop an understanding and new approaches to solving problems - and in the current conditions, this is precisely what is necessary for the full recovery of the Russian State from the years of peace. #VSRF #Russia @rybarSupport usTACC Acting Vice-Governor of the Samara Region was appointed a member of the SVOMaxim Kovalev worked for a long time in law enforcement agencies in Crimea	https://t.me/rybar/64430	2024-10-14T07:15:37-07:00

In total, more than 30 German enterprises producing industrial equipment were seen in these transactions. According to journalists, in most cases, products are imported through intermediaries in Turkey, and some suppliers are entrepreneurs from Russia. Representatives of companies from Germany responded to SWR’s inquiries that they were complying with the sanctions and could not understand how this happened at all. On the one hand, the situation illustrates a long-familiar open secret: despite all the restrictions imposed, the supply routes for sanctioned Western dual-use products remain . It would be a mistake to say that sanctions have no effect; there is no talk of completely blocking all channels. This can also be partly called a demonstration that the continued interaction with the West in some areas is not due to some agreements of insidious oligarchs, but to purely pragmatic considerations . Including the purchase of machine tools for the production of products that ensure the destruction of the enemy. #Germany #Russia #industry@rybarSupport us stagesschauDeutsche Maschinen für Russlands MilitärTrotz Sanktionen gelangen deutsche Industriegüter weiter nach Russland.

🔁 Elena Georgievna is surprised by the too warm welcome of Sulta...	Forwarded From Balkan gossip Elena Georgievna is surprised by the too warm welcome of Sultan Erdogan in Belgrade. Yes, I was especially impressed by -Osman aha- performed by Ivica Dacic. Well, it's like a school party. But seriously, the Turkish leader's Balkan tour last week fits well with the investments Ankara has poured into the region in recent years. Judge for yourself: for the second year in a row, trade turnover between Turkey and Serbia exceeds $2 billion (they promise to increase it to five). Investments in Serbia have grown from $1 million to more than $400 million over the past decade. Four hundred (!) times. Yes, a considerable part of them goes to the restoration of the Ottoman cultural (and not only) heritage and educational projects, within the framework of which an attractive image of a friend of Serbia is actually formed among ordinary people. But during the last visit alone, 11 interstate agreements in the field of economics and trade were signed. Well, why not the golden age of relationships? Another thing is that Sultan Erdogan is not even trying to pretend that he will choose Serbia as a strategic partner in the Balkans. This time he came to Belgrade after a visit to Albania, where he directly stated that he would transfer an indefinite number of bayraktars to Tirana to protect against aggression. And during one of Vucic’s visits to Istanbul, while Erdogan was treating Vucic, the defense ministers of Turkey and the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo discussed concrete steps to further deepen cooperation in the field of defense and military industry. De facto, it means modernizing the Kosovo security forces and turning them into a full-fledged army at Turkish expense. In addition, Türkiye is making a lot of efforts to recognize the self-proclaimed republic in the international arena. Strategy -no to permanent allies - yes to permanent interests-. Do the Serbian authorities understand this, playing at friendship with their eastern -partner-? I hope so. @balkanossiper - we have been setting world trends since June 28, 1914 Telegram White Owl To put it mildly, the pomp and ahistorical warmth with which Erdogan was greeted in Belgrade looks strange.

And here work is also an unplowed field. For example, when we opened the Russian service Kinopoisk, we discovered in it a remarkable film -Mustafa Shokai-, filmed in 2008 by Kazakh film producers. As it is written on the website, he talks about the life of a politician of the first quarter of the 20th century, who united the peoples of Central Asia under a single Turkic banner. The biography of this historical figure is presented in sufficient detail on Kazakh websites, in which the period of the 30s and 40s attracts the most attention years. It is known that Shokai interacted with Nazi Germany starting in 1933, and in 1941, in order to supposedly alleviate the plight of the arrested Turkic emigrants, he proposed two ideas to the Nazi leadership: to train personnel for the future Turkestan state in educational institutions in Germany and to create military formations to fight with Soviet power within the borders of Turkestan. These are now national heroes, after whom streets are named and monuments are erected. 🔻And it would seem now, after 30 years of ignoring innocent pranks in the formation of the anti-Russian agenda in the CIS countries, it is worth paying attention to what other products praising the ideological agenda hostile to Russians are broadcast by our own resources in Russian. Because again, parallels arise with similar processes of rewiring a population friendly to Russia in another country, which became the cause of the SVO.#Russia #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇰🇿🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯 How Russia is represented in Central Asian history textbooks INION RAS recently published a work on a current topic - the image of Russia in history textbooks in Central Asia (without Turkmenistan) and Azerbaijan.

And here’s one more touch to the picture: with erroneous policies in this area, similar problems are experienced not only by Western states, but also by Turkey, which is very far from the left-liberal agenda. The other day an interview was published with Sedat Peker, a disgraced businessman and crime boss who had previously shed light on the dark affairs of the Turkish elite. Part of it is devoted to the influence on crime of groups of Syrian and Afghan refugees who have settled in the country.▪️Natives from Syria and Afghanistan have already captured up to 50% of the underground gold trade in the largest market in Istanbul. They are also acquiring their own drug laboratories and distribution networks, although until recently they were at the beck and call of local bandits. ▪️Groups of refugees live separately, remaining closed and inaccessible to Turkish law enforcement agents. Under these conditions, they were able to organize schemes to launder funds received from illegal activities and transfer them abroad.▪️According to Peker, in the next six to seven years, factions of Syrian and Afghan refugees will become so strong that they will displace Turkish criminal groups from the criminal market. He called this a huge danger for the country. When reading this, a strong feeling of déjà vu may arise, even down to the coincidence of small details. Indeed, to see some of the problems described, it is not necessary to go to Turkey - just open domestic criminal reports. Well, in particular, the situation is another illustration of the fact that ambitious foreign policy projects by themselves cannot eliminate the consequences of the failures of the same migration policy. After all, if you launch millions of carriers of an alien culture into the country at once, then no pan-Turkism or anything else can suddenly digest them.#multinationalism #Turkey@rybarSupport uswww.sozcu.com.trSedat Peker suskunluğunu bozdu: Türkiye'de Afgan ve Suriyeli suç kartelleri oluşacak - Sözcü GazetesiHer dönemin kendine ait bir dokusu olduğunu söyleyen Peker, Türkiye'nin Meksika ve Kolombiya gibi bir sürece girdiğini söyledi.

The main purpose of the training is to test the capabilities of conducting joint operations of the troops of the Eastern Combat Command Zone of the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China. During the exercises, combat patrols of sea and air space, blockades of key ports and areas of Taiwan, as well as strikes against sea and ground targets are practiced. The main prerequisite for the training, and perhaps the reason for its start, was the speech of Taiwanese leader Lai Qingde during the celebrations dedicated to the 113th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. And although most observers note that Lai's speech was not as provocative compared to his inaugural address in May 2024, this did not stop the PRC authorities from demonstrating their position through exercises. 🔻By the way, after the inauguration of the Taiwanese leader, the People's Liberation Army of China (PLA) also conducted training called -Joint Sword - 2024A-. Thus, these actions confirm predictions about a series of exercises, each of which will be timed to coincide with one or another action of the Taiwanese leader Lai Qingde, no matter how loud they may be. It is also important to note that the Chinese coast guard is participating in the exercises. For the first time, department ships began participating in training to encircle Taiwan in May 2024 - then they took place near the islands controlled by the Taiwanese administration. This time, the Chinese coast guard is already covering the waters around the island. 📌 This gives a small hint of how the Chinese authorities will put pressure on the island administration as they implement plans for reunification. One of the main scenarios, -isolating- Taiwan, involves using the Chinese coast guard to conduct inspections of ships sailing to local ports and cutting off the island from key trade flows. And although there are reports in the news feed that the exercises are a dress rehearsal for the start of hostilities in the Taiwan Strait, there are no clear prerequisites for war. In addition, the PRC has much more flexible tools in its arsenal to put pressure on the Taiwanese leadership, such as an economic blockade and the aforementioned -isolation-.

Since September 26, the operation of Congolese security forces against the FDLR group (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda) - Hutu militants who formally oppose the Rwandan authorities. Previously, they were allies of the Congolese, but after agreements with the Rwandans with the mediation of Angolan partners, they agreed to eliminate the group in the name of peace (but in reality they simply ceased to be useful). Now the goal of the Congolese army is to neutralize the leader of the FDLR in order to appease the authorities in Kigali, for whom the group allegedly poses a threat. According to the Luanda agreements, this will be followed by the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from the territory of the DRC. Only at the moment the group numbers at most a thousand people and its members are hiding mainly in refugee camps near Goma. And many rebels have already been integrated into the army of the DR Congo. Accordingly, the rhetorical question arises - will the Rwandans fulfill their part of the agreements, and even more so will the American curators, who receive enormous benefits from Rwanda’s participation in supporting border rebel groups (such as M23), allow them to do this? ?High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #DRC #Rwanda@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64422	2024-10-14T01:16:58-07:00
🔁 Reading the post of comrades about -ancient-Azerbaijan, it is ...	Forwarded From Two Majors Reading the post of comrades about -ancient-Azerbaijan, it is necessary to note not only the formation as such of the Azerbaijani nation thanks to the USSR (for those interested, look up the historiography of the state of Azerbaijan before Soviet times), but also the tragedy of divided peoples after 1991. Then, after the collapse of the USSR the border was drawn along the Samur River. A huge percentage of Lezgins (the second largest ethnic group after Azerbaijanis) remained outside Russia. Mainly in the northern regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan. For years, people across the river went to each other's weddings and funerals - and yours too. The sovereign’s border, which, against the backdrop of the chaos in the Caucasus after the beginning of the Supreme’s reign, could not but be strengthened. After all, militants, weapons, money and -left- documents also came from Azerbaijan. For a long time, within the framework of the state policy of Baku, Lezgins were -converted- into Azerbaijanis. They changed the endings of surnames, added -ogly- or -kyzy- to patronymics, and did not (they say this is still the case) government or officer positions if a citizen of Azerbaijan called himself a Lezgin. More often, these were sent to serve in Karabakh, they were given rights in accordance with the best traditions of eastern despotism in a new way, characteristic of all Caucasian republics during the period of cyber-feudalism. Of course, Turkey played a role in the formation of the new Azerbaijan, which only the lazy did not write about. It was only after 2014, after the Russian Spring and tricolors in some regional centers of northern Azerbaijan, that the border began to be patrolled more often by Israeli UAVs, which was a technological novelty of those times.

This is especially evident if we compare his statements about this idea even before his appointment as prime minister. For example, the Asian equivalent of NATO was not discussed by Ishiba at the recent summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The Japanese politician emphasized the continuation of the course of the country's former leader Fumio Kishida, aimed at in-depth interaction with the countries of the region. ▪️In Japan they clearly understand that the idea at this stage is not popular among potential members of the organization, so they do not raise this issue again. 🔻However, the very fact that Ishiba is advocating for the creation of an analogue of NATO indicates ambitions to create new or strengthen existing regional blocs directed against China, even if the idea of ​​a military alliance completely fails. In any case, the proposal, as can be seen from the statements of the LDP representative, remains relevant for the Japanese authorities, who hope for its implementation in one form or another. And the working group will deal with similar issues, including, possibly, developing proposals to convince the United States to support the initiative. #Japan@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe MainichiJapan's ruling LDP to begin debate on PM Ishiba's Asian NATO visionTOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party will begin discussions on the idea of ​​creating an	https://t.me/rybar/64420	2024-10-14T00:13:58-07:00

According to some reports, the enemy has already left the village. Several attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces were repelled from Tolstoy Lug and in the direction of Pokrovsky. 🔻The Internet was actively discussing statements about the allegedly unlawful execution of Ukrainian prisoners of war in the Sudzhansky district. South of Zeleny Shlyakh, Russian troops, during the clearing of a strong point located at the intersection of roads, eliminated enemy UAV operators, who, according to Ukrainian speakers, -shot back to the last bullet.- ❗️In the conditions of battles with occupation forces in the -old- part of Russia, which even the Russian Ministry of Defense officially declared terrorists in briefings, members of the Ukrainian formations, perhaps, should not have expected anything else. In addition, UAV operators are always a priority fire target for both sides, so their elimination is justified. ▪️In the north-west of the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of artillery strikes on enemy positions in Russky Porechny, the configuration of the front in Cherkasy Konopelka was clarified. North of Martynovka, near the village of Kruglik, Russian UAV operators hit the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Thus, the forest belt south of the village is currently held by Ukrainian forces.

Here, the other day, an enemy tank and pickup truck were hit by drone strikes on a fiber optic cable. ▪️In the sky over Sudzha and the surrounding area, over a dozen cases have been recorded in recent days of Ukrainian interceptor drones shooting down Russian reconnaissance drones. So far, UAV losses have not led to significant consequences on the battlefield, however, the increase in the number of effective strikes against drones of the Russian Armed Forces in several areas at once is worth taking into account.▪️In the Sumy region, Russian troops are hitting various enemy targets both in the administrative center and behind it outside.

A significant resonance in this regard was caused by an attack on a military base near Haifa, where soldiers of the Golani infantry brigade were located. Currently, the Israeli media publishes quite contradictory information. Most reports put the number of injured between 50 and 80 people. Helicopters are used to evacuate victims. 🔻Hezbollah confirmed involvement in the raid, presenting it as a response to the actions of Israeli troops in Lebanon. Meanwhile, Arabic-language media are actively disseminating information about the attack, interpreting it as a demonstrative response to the presumptuous Israelis. Be that as it may, the strike itself demonstrated the continued ability of the Lebanese group to inflict, albeit episodic, significant damage on Israeli troops in the face of constant concentrated attacks on the south of Lebanon and fighting in the border areas. At the same time, the Israelis will most likely not delay in responding and will carry out massive bombings of the southern suburbs of Beirut, which, however, they have hit repeatedly over the past week. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64408	2024-10-13T11:21:57-07:00

In particular, in May of this year, the Western community was shocked by the news of the arrest of a Portuguese-Belgian citizen in the Central African Republic and an employee of the American NGO -FHI360-. The company, as stated, is engaged in field research - on the development of human potential - and receives funding directly from USAID. ▪️ For Joseph Figueira Martin, the organization created a legend of his stay in the country, and also selected guides and travel routes to collect data on the activities of the PMC - Wagner - . The fact that he was detained in the city of Zemio, until recently occupied by UPC militants, where he could only get with the complicity of bandits, confirms this version. In addition, the CAR court stated that there is both audio and written evidence including money transfers and arms deliveries in which Figueira appears. In addition, it is known that he has had contacts with the leadership of the groups since 2021. It is noteworthy that in the same 2021, French citizen Juan Remy Quinolo was detained, who was also caught having connections with militants. However, the increase in the activity of Western intelligence services, especially the CIA, in Africa - this is a trend in recent years. We have already seen the story of the unsuccessful entry into the CAR by the Bancroft PMC, the expansion of the American embassy in Bangui, as well as how agents are directly recruited on Internet recruiting resources in the interests of the Americans.

Attention to the Arctic region is growing every year, and the approval of the new US Arctic Strategy in July 2024 only confirmed this. A key role in this strategy is played by the countries of the North, which are actively developing a full-fledged role as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance, acting at the forefront of NATO policy in the northern latitudes. 🔻On October 9, in the Kattegat and Skagerrak straits, connecting the Baltic with the North, the quadripartite exercise Marex Autumn began, in which three Scandinavian countries and Germany take part. The main stage of the exercise is concentrated in the area of ​​​​the island of Hönö, where a naval formation has already been formed for joint training in the defense of the Swedish coast and adjacent waters of the Baltic Sea. Sailors of the four countries, in addition, will carry out mining of the straits, a conditional blockade of shipping, and will also conduct joint training to protect air and sea space from UAVs and unmanned boats.❗️The key point should be considered the blocking of shipping through the Kattegat Straits and the Skagerrak, since in such a scenario communication through the Baltic will stall, and Russia will be the main victim. If you remember, in the first half of the year NATO worked on blocking the Gulf of Finland, but if this plan is considered as a last resort option, then the straits into the North Sea , to which Russia has no territorial rights, is a completely different matter.

Forwarded From SPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL Z🇷🇺🪖 Missile strike on the Limanskoye airfield At night, high-precision weapons struck the Limanskoye airfield in the Odessa region, which is located in the western part of Ukraine near Transnistria. Surveillance cameras recorded one arrival on the territory of a military base. The target of the strike was objects located at the airfield, as well as those stored in hangars. Limanskoye is one of the main landing sites for Ukrainian drones, which the enemy launches in the direction of the Crimean Peninsula. UAVs are also assembled there. The distance from Odessa, which is often subject to attacks by the Russian Armed Forces, and a convenient runway made the facility most suitable for these purposes. At least a third of all UAVs launched took off from Limansky. Another reason for attacks on Limansky is the proximity to railway lines, including from Moldova. The railway flow through Tarutino and Zatoka to Odessa and from there to other regions has been operating for almost a year. Fuel, various parts and equipment, including for the assembly of drones, are delivered to Ukraine through Moldova. There were similar workshops at the airfield in Artsyz, Belgorod-Dnestrovsky and Limansky. Archangel of Special Forces. Subscribe.	https://t.me/rybar/64404	2024-10-13T08:06:30-07:00

Very often in the memoirs it was emphasized that the snipers and mercenaries might not have survived to be captured. In the Donbass in 2014, the militia had a separate account for the artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine who fought in Lugansk and Donetsk. However, these scores have not gone away. I know that in many armies and terrorist organizations they instruct what to say if you are captured. That's why everyone always pretends to be cooks and never shoots at anyone. I remember how a captured mercenary from Georgia sat in front of us. The Ukrainian Armed Forces recruited him, pulling him out of the pre-trial detention center. We knew little about him, but he said that he had not shot at anyone and generally loved Russia. Then, having already gone to his page on the social network, we saw a photo of our deceased soldier with insults. But this mercenary lived to be captured, and was not even beaten. Both sides are held back from the escalation of violence by the fact that the prisoners are exchanged. As you do, so do you. Otherwise, it would all slide into a Middle Eastern massacre, the horrors of which simply pale in comparison to this conflict. But FPV operators have a separate account in this war. Why - not only because of the losses they cause to the military. But also what they do to civilians. Especially in the Kursk and Belgorod regions. Even yesterday’s video is an ordinary case, alas. S.

The situation in this area after the completion of the cleansing in Staromayorsky and Urozhainy over the past weeks was characterized by positional battles. ▪️Last ​​summer, the Russian Armed Forces withdrew from Levadnoye during the enemy’s counter-offensive and secured positions several kilometers south of the village. Now the marines of the Baltic Fleet from the Storm detachment of the separate 336th brigade made a breakthrough and completely knocked the enemy out of the populated area. Enemy resources disseminated information that motorized infantry units of the Russian Armed Forces took part in the attack, and their successful actions were due to the low readiness of the Ukrainian formations to repel attacks. ▪️Current control footage appeared on the Internet, recording a significant advance of Russian fighters to the north. The relevance of the materials was confirmed by our local sources; at the moment the flag is hoisted on the north-eastern outskirts of Levadnoye. ▪️Information is also being received about the advance of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of Novodarovka, located to the northeast. Here the Russian army has the opportunity to advance along the highway connecting the village with the Russian Priyutny. In the Novodarovka area, a self-propelled gun 2S22 -Bogdan- was hit.▪️On the right flank of the direction, there is still a lull north of Staromayorsky and Urozhayny, where earlier a sapper unit of the Russian Armed Forces blew up a bridge near Makarovka, and attack aircraft expanded the control zone on the left bank of the Mokrye Yala River.

The statement said his actions to supply the rebels contributed to the ongoing siege and humanitarian crisis in El Fasher. Algoni was the chief negotiator at the Geneva conference to resolve the situation in Sudan under the patronage of the United States. Despite all the efforts of the Americans, they led to almost nothing result, because the official authorities failed to call on them. The result was only the creation of humanitarian corridors to preserve the image of the United States as a peacemaker. At the same time, of course, no one in the SBR was going to support these corridors. So the sanctions against Algoni look more like a formal blow of the whip for failure to comply with instructions from Washington.❗️But in response to this, the rebels reacted almost immediately, and in an extraordinary way. A couple of days later, Hamedti accused the Egyptian leadership, which Washington considers its ally, of bombing of the rebel camp in Karari. He especially emphasized that the aircraft used American bombs, which could not have happened without the approval of the Americans. The rebels did not provide any evidence regarding this incident. Later they only added accusations towards Egypt about the Cairo authorities sponsoring the Islamists - the Muslim Brotherhood - and supporting the Sudanese army with ammunition.🔻Although this skirmish characterizes to some extent the unsuccessful strategy of American diplomacy, in fact this case does not mean that the Americans will stop using the SBR as their proxies in the region. Probably similar steps will soon follow from Washington against the government in Port Sudan under the pretext of purchasing Iranian and Chinese drones for the army. And for Russia, once again there will be additional time and a window of opportunity to get involved in the process and more actively support the official authorities in Sudan.#Africa #Sudan@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇸🇩 The situation in Sudan: the offensive of the armed forces in Khartoum as of October 9, 2024Decreased combat activity the activity we saw due to the rainy season is fading away.

The most likely location for the nuclear power plant is the north of the Chui region. The southern regions of the country are not suitable for the construction of nuclear power plants due to the large number of tectonic faults and increased seismic activity. ▪️On October 10, the Minister of Energy of Uzbekistan, Zhurabek Mirzamakhmudov, announced plans to build a large nuclear power plant (NPP) in the country by 2040. This step, according to the minister, is necessary to achieve carbon neutrality. At the same time, Uzbekistan does not abandon its plans for the construction of low-power nuclear power plants by Rosatom.▪️In 2023 and 2024, information appeared about the interest of the authorities of Tajikistan and Mongolia in cooperation with Rosatom in the construction of nuclear power plants, but the information background created by the referendum has not yet had an effect on them. 🔻However, in any case, we can conclude that the referendum held by the Kazakh authorities activated the peaceful nuclear agenda in the region and accelerated the implementation of existing projects and the development of new plans on this issue. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia @rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇰🇿☢️ About the results referendum on nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan On Sunday, October 7, a nationwide referendum on the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan was held.

🔁 🇸🇯 On Friday, Norwegian police detained two men at Bergen ai...	Forwarded From Severyanochka🇸🇯 On Friday, at the airport in Bergen, Norwegian police detained two men on suspicion of human trafficking. The victim of the criminals could be a 14-year-old boy - a foreign citizen. If the police receive the necessary evidence and initiate a criminal case, this could be the first such case in the last couple of years. Because the statistics do not inspire optimism: in 2023, the police investigated 27 cases of human trafficking (of which 17 had signs of sexual exploitation, eight cases had signs of illegal labor exploitation and two cases were not classified), and none of them were prosecuted criminal case. This means that not a single human trafficker was punished. ❓It should be noted that degradation has been going on for several years. So in 2022, in 32 similar cases, only two criminal cases were initiated (one person was convicted), and in 2021, six criminal cases were initiated, 12 people were convicted. This suggests that despite the existence of appropriate legislation and international cooperation, actual government efforts to combat human trafficking have declined significantly in recent years. 🔺In international terminology, Norway is largely a -country of destination- - a country where victims of human trafficking arrive for exploitation, both sexual (more than 60% of all cases) and labor. The most common victims are women 30 years of age and older, who come from Africa, Eastern Europe and South America. In recent years, the number of victims from Thailand and, of course, Ukraine has increased: in the country, since the beginning of the SVO, a criminal business has been actively developing, offering Ukrainian women asylum in Norway or other European countries in exchange for sexual services.❗ In general, the situation with public safety in Norway is causing concern questions. The main reason for all the failures in the fight against human trafficking is the lack of personnel and the lack of specialized units in the Norwegian police. Often the police are forced to devote all their efforts to solving more pressing problems, such as drug trafficking. And for the victims of European looters in Norway there is practically no hope of salvation. Politiet vil varetektsfengsle dem.	https://t.me/rybar/64397	2024-10-13T03:40:13-07:00

Of course, most of the ships and personnel are represented by India, but from the USA, Australia and Japan there are also warships, as well as anti-submarine helicopters. Main the emphasis is on actions as part of a multinational naval group, including patrolling water areas, protecting merchant and civilian ships using all types of onboard weapons.❗️ Of course, this is all training. But every exercise pursues some goal, and in this case it sends a clear signal from the anti-Chinese QUAD bloc, created precisely to counter the Celestial Empire. The interests of the NATO leadership are increasingly concentrated in Asia, and India plays an important role in this. After all, before Malabar, the Indians took part in an exercise with Italy in the Arabian Sea. The aircraft carriers Vikramaditya of the Indian Navy and Cavour of the Italian Navy practiced joint patrols in a region atypical for Italians. And this is precisely one of the consequences of the adjustment of the interests of the West to the East.

🇰🇿🇺🇸☢️ About cooperation between the USA and Kazakhstan in th...	🇰🇿🇺🇸☢️ On cooperation between the United States and Kazakhstan in the field of nuclear research Joker DPR published documents with fresh details of cooperation between the United States and Kazakhstan on the safety of nuclear materials and the dismantling of related infrastructure at the Semipalatinsk test site. It should be noted that experts from the United States have been studying the former Soviet nuclear test site with great attention since the 90s, and not at all out of concern for the environment. 🔻The Semipalatinsk test site is of interest as a way to study nuclear weapons from the times of the USSR. Each adit and cavern can tell its own story: what power was the ammunition, what scheme was it used, which ammunition continued to be improved and tested, and which were considered dead-end branches and abandoned. In this sense, the approach to continuing such research should be considered as desire to quietly carry out your research. The irony is that such study interferes with the actual reclamation of the landfill. Perhaps, in light of Rosatom’s recent successful work with the Soviet nuclear legacy in Tajikistan, the US authorities are concerned about ensuring the safety of their position at the test site. As for fissile materials in Kazakhstan, in principle, the lion’s share of them is located at the spent fuel storage site of the BN-350 reactor on the territory of the Mangistau Nuclear Power Plant, because there it was a fast neutron reactor and highly enriched uranium was used as fuel. At the same time, there is no need to look for connections with a resonant event - the decision to build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan, because:▪️ control over the circulation of nuclear materials at nuclear power plants is usually assigned to the operating organization with the supervision of government bodies,▪️ fuel for nuclear power plants is made from low-enriched uranium, and therefore, it is not a weapons material and, therefore, cannot be an object of interest on the part of DTRA.❗️However, it is not a fact that US officials will not try to enter this territory. Only they will do this, with a high degree of probability, not through DTRA, but through the Ministry of Energy. For example, a very profitable proposal will arise to create a system of radiation monitoring and physical protection of fissile material storage facilities, closed to the United States. #Kazakhstan #USA@rybar Support usTelegramJoker DPR The United States is actively trying to undermine Russia’s position in key areas of cooperation with Kazakhstan, including the field of nuclear research.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for October 13, 2024▪️ Over the past week, an important event at the front was a series of counterattacks by the Russian Army in the Kursk region. Olgovka and several villages in the Lyubimovka region have been liberated; attacks are underway near Plekhovo. In addition, in the Glushkovsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been pushed back to the border. In heavy battles, observers note increased skill in controlling our troops: the enemy receives attacks from several directions, is surrounded, or is forced to retreat under the threat of such. The liberation of part of the Kursk region from the enemy is still far away, but the enemy is forced to withdraw elite units for replenishment, replacing them with mobilized ones. They report difficulties with the enemy's logistics: it is becoming increasingly difficult for him to transfer heavy equipment to the region, which he spent a fair amount of on his strike. An important facility under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces remains the gas metering station (GIS) -Sudzha - - the only remaining route for gas transit to the EU, namely to Austria, Hungary and Slovakia, whose leadership is accused by globalists of excessive -sympathy- for Russia.▪️ A series of counterattacks is ongoing. The Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region became the backdrop for Zelensky’s visit to Europe, whose authority in the West continues to fall against the backdrop of the incompetent victory plan he presented in the United States before. The -plan- did not contain anything new and resembled a -shopping list-, as the Western press writes. It, as expected, contained demands from Ukraine to take it into NATO and give it even more weapons and equipment. However, the West continues to supply military supplies. New large aid packages are being allocated (the United States and its satellite, Germany), and they are writing about France’s plans to supply its aircraft to the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2025. ▪️ The Russian Armed Forces are trying to destroy supplies from NATO. During the week, for 4 days in a row, the port infrastructure of the Odessa region was under attack by Iskander and Geranium, warehouses with arriving ammunition were hit, and a sea container ship in the port was damaged.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces continue offensive operations. Tsukurino is occupied, there are battles around Selidovo, our troops are on the outskirts of Mirnograd. The pocket will be slammed east of the Desired Second. To the south, our troops occupied Ostrovskoye, which opens the way to Kurakhovo - an important node in the enemy’s defense. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the success of the Russian Armed Forces is developing after the capture of Ugledar: the offensive is going on Katerinovka (Ekaterinivka) and Antonovka, from Vodyanoye and the mines to Bogoyavlenka, and the zone of control at Zolotaya Niva is expanding. ▪️ An unpleasant moment was the -beautiful reports- from the Seversky direction, which led to the impossibility of hitting the occupied areas with fire weapons and aviation, since they were subordinate to the senior command, which was informed of -full control- of areas of the area. After a series of publications uv.tov. Rybara, the situation has not changed, they write to us from the field: - They unsubscribed, they got rid of fake videos. Reports on science fiction continued.▪️ In addition, the judgment of the head of the State Duma Defense Committee Andrei Kartapolov that -blocking the Discord messenger will not affect the organization of communications between the military- became strange. He said that -For the most part, fighters use ordinary push-button phones for communication and radio stations. And you can’t fit Discord anywhere. The judgment is extremely strange, since there are a lot of photographs on the Internet using Discord at the front. By the way, there are alternatives to it, but the blocking of the software used (until the implementation of a new one) indicated some inconsistency in the actions of federal executive authorities.▪️ On the foreign policy circuit, joint statements by the military leadership of Poland and Lithuania about the need to prepare for war with Russia and the determination to strike at St. Petersburg, including, without waiting for permission from NATO. Thus, the West is preparing new countries to conduct military operations against our country, without applying Article 5 of the NATO Charter on collective defense.

At the same time, active work continues to destroy enemy industrial facilities in the rear. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, the Russian Armed Forces are fighting on the northern outskirts of the New Way. Ukrainian formations are holding positions south of the railway track and are accumulating forces to carry out a counterattack in the area. The artillery and aviation of the Russian Armed Forces regularly strike the rear communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, reducing their combat potential and complicating the supply of forward units. Thus, over the past 24 hours, the positions of Ukrainian formations in Pavlovka, Katerynivka and Iskriskivshchyna were hit. 🔻The battle for Lyubimovka continues in the Korenevsky district, where enemy units are semi-encircled. It is likely that in the near future the Ukrainian formations will be forced to either leave the village or carry out counterattacks in order to improve their position. ❗️Earlier, information appeared about the advance of Russian troops towards Sverdlikovo. To date, this has not been confirmed either by objective monitoring personnel or by data from our sources on the ground. It is difficult to determine the current configuration of the front in this sector due to the high rate of change in the combat situation. 🔻In the north of the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of artillery strikes on enemy positions in Russian Porechny. To the south, assault groups of Russian troops advance along the railway towards Kolmakov and Agronom from the direction of Russkaya Konopelka. ▪️On the southern outskirts of Makhnovka, Russian UAV operators destroyed an enemy tank using a drone with a fiber optic cable. This type of drone is gradually gaining more and more popularity among the troops against the backdrop of its successful debut in the Kursk region. ▪️In the Plekhovo area the situation is hidden -by the fog of war-. Judging by reports from the Russian Ministry of Defense about strikes on the territory of the village, Ukrainian formations are still present in the village. At the same time, Russian troops are expanding the zones of penetration into the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, trying to reach the Psel River and completely cut off the enemy from supplies. 🔻In the Sumy region, Russian troops, using the Geranium-2 UAV, launched a series of attacks on industrial enterprises in the administrative center of the region. The facilities were used for the repair and maintenance of heavy equipment, including Western models, in the interests of the enemy group in the Kursk region.

It is worth noting that that talk of a possible Israeli invasion did not appear yesterday. Just last month, reports were actively circulating on the Internet about how IDF special forces carried out an airborne operation near Masyaf, capturing several Iranian officers, after which they left as if nothing had happened.🔻In the case of a direct Israeli entry into a neighboring state, the following is important : the primary source of such high-profile information was once again Syrian opposition publications, in this case Horan Free Media, covering the activities of militants in the south of the country. Meanwhile, the Israeli media this time chose to ignore the stories of the Syrian anti-government media. The news itself appeared yesterday, but was not further developed. And it was only about a limited raid for the purpose of carrying out engineering work.❗Even if what happened turns out to be a hoax, this does not mean that destabilization of the situation in Syria is still far away. Just look at the attempts to provoke the Druze in Es-Suwayda and the tribes in Daraa into an armed conflict with the central government in Damascus. Well, don’t forget about the already well-known players in the Syrian arena, whom the Israeli ultra-Orthodox will also not disdain to use on occasion.

The head of British counterintelligence MI5 Ken McCallum said that - the Islamic State - a few years later, he is again trying to export terrorism to the territory of Foggy Albion. According to McCallum, although the Islamic State is not in the same position as in 2014-2015, their capabilities again pose a threat. He also mentioned that al-Qaeda is gaining strength to become active around the world. If we do not take into account the already standard statements about the threat from Russia and China, then the trend about the growing danger of forgotten terrorist groups is gaining momentum. And if with Afghanistan, the main goal is to intimidate the countries of Central Asia and strengthen influence in the region, then, mentioning IS in Syria and Iraq, the situation is somewhat different due to the general destabilization in the Middle East. The capabilities of IS due to the virtual cessation of the fight against them over the past two years have increased, and the actions of Israel and the West in the region contribute even more to this. Remember about the imminent withdrawal of the Americans from Syria and Iraq. By the time the United States withdraws at this rate, the situation for these two countries will have worsened significantly, which will only benefit the collective West.

🔁 Why does respected deputy Kartapolov believe that our military...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Why does respected deputy Kartapolov believe that our military does not use Discord? Perhaps his colleague is right that Andrei Valerievich simply does not communicate with those military personnel who actually carry out combat missions. And at the level of receiving reports, military commanders do not delve into what is being used at the front. Or, communicates with those who really do not use this messenger. Those who conduct combat operations understand what Discord is for, and how modern combat is conducted, what control subsystems it includes and through which channels information is transmitted. Let’s imagine that a respected deputy says something like the following. -Discord is unreliable software and the messenger is viewed by the enemy. We have our own software, they use it at our control points, we have other developments and we are implementing them. This would sound much more convincing than statements that no one needs Discord. By the way, we have analogues of the enemy Starlink, but does the military need Starlink itself or not? I would really like to hear the opinion of the distinguished deputy. Discord, meanwhile, is still used by the military at the front. Even though everyone understands the risks. But it is also wrong to consider our military fools who are not able to understand that such programs must be worked carefully. Smartphones and tablets are also still used by the military. From artillerymen and drone pilots, to scouts and medics. No, not to call. Offline maps, programs for calculations. But in principle, one can believe that at the front they only use radios and push-button telephones, and it was the ban on gadgets that improved the quality of the offensive actions of our units. The main thing is that with this faith, you really don’t command anything.

Minister Nurzhan Nurzhigitov spoke about this during a meeting with residents of the Kyzylorda region. According to him, this will be the beginning of the second stage of the project for the conservation and development of the Northern Aral Sea, which will be implemented jointly with the World Bank. The first stage, which resulted in the construction of the Kokaral dam, has already been completed. A third stage is also expected. The Ministry of Water Resources describes it as updating the information base and water management systems. 🔻To control water resources, the Northern Aral is one of the key points, as the largest reservoir in the western part of the region. Previously, attempts have already been made to -research- the sources of Central Asian rivers and use the Aral problem for the penetration of Western NGOs into the region.

At the same time, in the area of ​​Leonidovka and Dachnoye, the RF Armed Forces are consolidating their positions. ▪️After the liberation of most of Druzhba and Kirovo, units of the Russian Armed Forces attack at the Dachnoe - Dyleevka line. Ukrainian formations are still holding positions in forests and shelterbelts on the approaches to populated areas and are constructing new ones along the railway track. ▪️In Dzerzhinsk, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually moving along the streets in the north of the city. In the area of ​​the Central City Hospital named after. Lenin, Russian troops knocked out the enemy from buildings on Pushkarenko, Dogaev and Kemerovo streets, reaching Shchorsa Street. In a few days they also managed to establish control over the traffic police department on the approaches to the mine. Dzerzhinsky. To the north, the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control along Mayakovsky Street and started fighting in the area of ​​kindergarten No. 8. ❗️Despite statements from individual sources, it is still too early to talk about liberating the territory of the facility. The specifics of urban battles complicate the establishment of the exact configuration of the front due to the layering of positions of the RF Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. A fairly common situation is when assault groups from both sides may be present on different floors of the same building, sometimes not even aware of the proximity of the enemy. In such a situation, each entrance can represent a stronghold, the detection of which is difficult in a dynamically changing environment. ▪️In the southern part of the city, the Russian Armed Forces advanced along one of the sides of Sverdlov Avenue and reached Blagodatnaya Street. Thus, both claws of the semi-environment reached the approaches to the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky, establishing control over which will make it possible to encircle parts of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in urban areas to the southeast. In turn, the enemy is using various types of drones, trying to prevent the concentration of Russian Armed Forces personnel in this area to storm the mine territory. To the east of Sverdlov Avenue there is currently a vast -gray zone-. Russian attack aircraft are engaged in fierce battles here, and the current zones of control of the parties may differ greatly from the latest data received due to the dynamic change in the situation. ▪️The situation at the Leonidovka-Shcherbinovka border is currently hidden -by the fog of war-. After reports of the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces in this area at the end of September, there was an information lull here.

The main issues concerned military interaction between the countries within the framework of the new French approach to Africa.▪️The key point of the meeting was the discussion of the future fate of the base in Port Bouet and the 43rd Marine Battalion of the French Army, which is located there. According to preliminary agreements, along with the transfer of military facility under the sovereignty (although it is assumed that access will be shared) of Côte d'Ivoire, the French will build training and communications centers on it, leaving their presence solely as instructors. A month ago, in a similar way, French military personnel left the base in Lomo Nord.▪️In addition to this , the question was raised about further interaction between the military structures of the two countries. In particular, it is proposed to increase the joint military exercises that already took place in early September of this year. Taking into account the fact that the Americans have already agreed with the Ivorian authorities to build their own base for the redeployment of their military personnel from Niger, the reduction in the French contingent should not be surprising. However, as we expected, there will not be a full-fledged exit of the French from the country.#Africa #CoteIvoire #France@rybarSupport usL'Intelligent d'AbidjanCoopération bilatérale – Renforcement du partenariat entre les armées ivoirienne et françaiseLe processus de redéfinition et d'approfondissement du partenariat militaire entre la Côte d'Ivoire et la France a pris une nouvelle tournure à travers des échanges de haut-niveau entre le Chef d'État-Major des Forces Armées de Côte d'Ivoire (FACI), le Général…	https://t.me/rybar/64383	2024-10-12T07:43:58-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️NATO Eastern Flank Countries Strengthen Air Defense System 🇷🇴Romania, after approval from the US State Department, will acquire four AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel radar stations, auxiliary components and maintenance services. The contract value is 110 million dollars.&nbsp; The radar is capable of tracking up to 60 targets at a range of up to 120 km. It is significant that the AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel was designed for use as part of the NASAMS 2 air defense system, which is not in service with the Romanian Armed Forces, which may indicate the prospect of the appearance of such air defense systems in the Romanian direction (possibly on a temporary basis, transfer from the United States).🇧 🇬Bulgaria will become the owner of a NATO air defense system for the first time. In October 2024, the acquisition of the IRIS-T SLM air defense system was announced from Diehl Defense. As part of the contract, Bulgaria can also buy up to five additional SLM and one SLX launchers until 2032. Part of the cost will be offset by equipment supplied to Ukraine in 2024. It is significant that earlier Bulgaria refused to transfer the S-300 air defense systems currently in service to Ukraine, citing the lack of other air defense systems. Now, with the delivery of IRIS-T, the Bulgarian direction will include NATO's Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), which will expand the alliance's zone of control in the Black Sea region.🇱🇹Lithuania bought one NASAMS air defense system, and also ordered&nbsp; modernization of two NASAMS 3 batteries purchased in 2017 from Norway for 109 million euros. In addition, in the interests of countering drones, from 2026 to 2029, RBS70 NG short-range MANPADS mounted on JLTV armored fighting vehicles with a Giraffe 1X radar will be supplied.

The second Indus Shield exercise started in Pakistan the day before yesterday. This event was first heard of last year, when 14 countries participated in it, and the main goal was the exchange of experience between pilots from different countries using different aircraft. This year there are only four participants - in addition to Pakistan and their F-16, JF-17 and J-10C, Saudi Tornado, Egyptian and Turkish F-16C/D fighters arrived in the Punjab province. In total - about 20 units.🔻Like last year, the main objective of the exercise is to assess the technologies and tactics of the participating countries using existing aircraft. Therefore, different types of fighters are involved in it. Moreover, one of the main aspects is to practice the joint use of aviation not only to carry out strikes, but also to repel an air attack. Taking into account the proximity of India, it is clear who acted as a conditional enemy. Against the backdrop of India’s increasingly intense involvement in military-political processes in the Asia-Pacific region, including as part of the anti-Chinese QUAD bloc, Pakistan also became more active and attracted its long-time partners.

We recently raised the topic of energy projects of Russian companies in Africa. Now you can see with your own eyes how they have more and more partners in this area on the Black Continent. In the context of the prospects for cooperation with the Ugandan authorities, it is also worth considering that the likely successor to the current president is an ardent anti-Western populist. He has already met with representatives of the Russian Armed Forces several times and is very interested in developing military ties. At the same time, Uganda itself, thanks to the efforts of the current authorities, remains a fairly stable country.

🔁 🇮🇷🇮🇶🇹🇷🏴 The Turkish authorities never cease to amaze. O...	Forwarded From Global Studies🇮🇷🇮🇶🇹🇷🏴 Turkish authorities never cease to amaze. Observers in the Middle East report that the Turks allowed the founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, Abdullah Ocalan, to contact the PKK and call on the organization's militants to lay down their arms. This happened in the wake of rumors that , that the Iranian leadership, due to the weakening of the axis of resistance, in particular Hezbollah, may conclude some kind of truce agreement with the PKK against the backdrop of a possible Israeli attack. I won’t talk about the reliability of this information, but the fact is that the Turks are seriously stuck in the quagmire called -Kurds- - this is a bold fact. And a solution, to some extent, through diplomatic means is quite possible. Although, if these words are true, this will greatly hit Turkish self-esteem, which is why they present all this as permission for the PKK leader to give the command to lay down arms, which he most likely will not do. The founder is the fundamental figure for any such structure, but the PKK, like pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria, has long decentralized the system of governance. The organization is not controlled by one or two people, but by several at once. This is done so that the group is not left without control in the event of the death or detention of one of the leaders, as was the case with Ocalan back in 1999. So this attempt by the Turks looks like a lost cause.📌 As for the prospect of concluding an agreement between the IRGC and the PKK, it is unlikely, but not excluded. It is unlikely in the sense that the conflict between the Kurds and Iranians is deep and cannot be hushed up so easily. But at the same time, the possibility of such a proposal from Iran is now not excluded against the backdrop of a possible Israeli attack. If an attack occurs, the Kurds can take advantage of the turmoil and attack border positions, as they have done more than once. Moreover, in Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan there is an Israeli presence in the form of businessmen and intelligence officers, so a coordinated attack could occur. And, by the way, this is what makes a truce unlikely.#Iraq #Turkey #terrorismGlobalistics - subscribe to the channelAl-Monitor: The Middle Eastʼs leading independent news source since 2012Turkey mulls peace talks with Kurds amid fears of Israeli strike on IranThree well-placed sources told Al-Monitor that exploratory talks for a possible resumption of negotiations between the Turkish government and imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan were already underway.	https://t.me/rybar/64379	2024-10-12T04:12:58-07:00

On October 11, the DPRK reported the detection of South Korean drones in the country's airspace. According to the statement, they were used to distribute propaganda leaflets. The North Koreans have threatened retaliation if similar incidents occur in the future and have also warned that they will put attack weapons on high alert. The South Korean military, as well as several organizations involved in sending propaganda to the DPRK, deny responsibility for the incident. According to South Korean media, the drones were sent by other activists advocating for the speedy democratization of North Korea. 🔻Without taking into account the political views of those who launched the drones, it can be assumed that such provocations may continue further. Activists understand that the South Korean authorities are on their side, which is due to the lifting of the ban on sending leaflets across the border earlier this year. Further escalation or de-escalation depends, in particular, on the activities of the South Korean authorities, who can again prohibit such actions at the legislative level. However, given the policy of the administration of the Republic of Korea towards its neighbor, they probably will not take such measures. #NorthKorea #SouthKorea@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramAwakening dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇰🇷 According to a recently released North Korean statement, South Korean drones have infiltrated North Korean territory several times recently to send propaganda leaflets.

In Yerevan, they want to use this money to improve the management of public finances and securities, as well as to develop new tools for financing business activities. AFD has recently launched active activities in the countries of the post-Soviet space. However, it is obvious that in exchange for loans and grants, the French are thereby promoting reforms that are beneficial to themselves and ensuring their economic and political interests.🔻At least from a PR point of view, the French in Armenia have already achieved some success, for example, by selling their military equipment in small quantities, which creates a feeling of security among Armenians and the emergence of a new guarantor of security in the region instead of Russia.

It turns out that for several months now, military personnel of the Armed Forces of Turkey and Azerbaijan, together with Aselsan engineers, have been equipping positions as part of the deployment of the Kayı early warning system. The complex operates on a modular principle and allows you to detect the movement of personnel and equipment, and even the movement of reconnaissance groups, detect aviation and UAV flights and detect artillery and air defense positions.🔻It includes:➖optoelectronic reconnaissance complex -Shahingoz-➖ground reconnaissance radar -Akar-➖acoustic reconnaissance complex -Seda-➖seismic sensor system -Midas-This is a promising system about which little is known. But for the first time, the Turks tested it in Syria, having equipped positions for these complexes along the Idlib de-escalation zone on the border of Hatay province. The question arises: why are the Turks installing their reconnaissance systems, which will allow them to control border areas up to 30-40 km, up to the movement of foot groups in Syunik , Vayodzor and Geghargunik regions? Of course, the Turks will say that the main goal is to warn about tremors and earthquakes, but if Midas serves this purpose, then the rest of the complexes and radars are purely military developments.

However, the European deputies have so far rejected it.▪️The head of the Gagauz autonomy, Evgenia Gutsul, called external demands for the de-Russification of the Gagauz people unacceptable. ▪️Former Prime Minister of Moldova Vasily Tarlev pointed out that Tarziu actually voiced that part of the agreements about which President Maia Sandu and the government of her ruling party, PAS, are so bashfully silent. At the same time, the Central Election Commission of Moldova is already trying to remove Tarlev’s candidacy from the presidential elections , which will take place on October 20. 🔻Romanian politicians have long been voicing their plans to seize Moldova and completely Romanianize the local population. Bucharest also does not deny that the most effective way in this case is the European integration of Moldova. Obviously, this is one of the reasons why Sandu’s Romanian civil society office declares any criticism of the republic’s accession to the EU to be disinformation. At the same time, censorship is being imposed in Moldova and any Russian-language content that does not correspond to the policy of the authorities is blocked.

🔁🖼 🪖 NATO’s Steadfast Noon nuclear exercise begins next week. ...	Forwarded From SPECIAL FORCES ARCHANGEL Z🇷🇺🪖 Next week in NATO, the Steadfast Noon exercise of the Alliance's nuclear forces begins.&nbsp;From October 14, an important combat training event will start in Western Europe to practice the use of the aviation component of NATO's strategic nuclear forces, which involves more than 60 units aviation.&nbsp;The exercise will last two whole weeks, during which the enemy will work out a scenario for the use of nuclear weapons, however, the aircraft participating in Steadfast Noon will not be equipped with nuclear warheads. &nbsp;This training takes place annually, and the main purpose is to test the combat readiness of aviation, which carries nuclear weapons. This list of tasks also includes testing routes for using aviation.&nbsp;Last year, the exercise took place in Italy, Croatia and in the Mediterranean Sea. The bulk of the exercise took place at least 1,000 km from the borders of Russia. This year, Steadfast Noon is planned over the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium, and is expected to involve American B-52N strategic bomber aircraft. A pair of bombers on October 8 made a flight from the United States, circumnavigating the UK and reaching the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium, which could be a test version of the use of the B-52N before an important exercise. The purpose of these exercises is as follows: to practice the withdrawal of historically nuclear forces of air-based nuclear warheads for transfer to the European theater of war actions. So to speak, deploy your planes in Europe, and then hit Russia. &nbsp;Despite the fact that the declared areas are far from Russia, flights of American aircraft in the direction of the Russian Federation cannot be ruled out. This is an elementary transfer of forces, which is carried out to practice striking Russia. &nbsp;It is worth adding that they conduct such exercises regularly, but the scale is not so large.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our soldiers are fully prepared. There is a developed counteraction toolkit, which involves not only the Aerospace Forces, but also other components of the army. Political pressure works primarily on us. And then to the internal audience.&nbsp;On the aviation side, they check the coherence of the crews, as well as interactions with ground services and other branches of the military. &nbsp;Since, in addition to the flight personnel, that side is actively using the naval group, satellite group and ground forces in the European Union.

The last time this was observed was during the demarcation of borders in the area of ​​disputed enclaves, but this was due to control over this process. Now there are no visible reasons for enhanced reconnaissance - even statements about shelling along the border are extremely rare. And the fact that this happened immediately after Pashinyan’s visit to Moscow looks suspicious. Moreover, now the Armenian air defense system is practically defenseless, since Russian radar groups were withdrawn from their usual positions near Lake Sevan, so the activity of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces UAVs could become news for the Armenian Ministry of Defense High resolution mapEnglish version#Azerbaijan #Armenia@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64359	2024-10-11T10:58:11-07:00
🖼 🇲🇱🇷🇺 About the operation to evacuate the remains of PMC-Wa...	- Wagner, the Company's forces carried out a successful operation to return the remains of fallen soldiers to their homeland.▪️Active activities began on September 30, and their goals were not disclosed by both Malian and Russian sources. What was mistakenly taken for an attack attracted the attention of Western media: along the route of the convoy, French media received satellite images to track its movement. ▪️In addition, the Tuaregs again mobilized their forces in order to follow on the heels of government troops and the forces of the Russian PMC. At this time, the Algerian authorities who patronized them, without waiting for the start of another crisis associated with migrants from Tin-Zautin, strengthened the border, marking it with ditches in the desert.▪️The fighters of the PMC - Wagner - definitely drew conclusions from the sad July experience. Thanks to the use of mock-up equipment and the involvement of local militias who knew the terrain, the column skillfully avoided ambushes. After arriving at the battlefield on July 27, the remains of the dead were collected, and the area was mined, including with decoys in the form of supposedly fallen UAVs -Cube.❗️ In fact, the enemy was convinced of their intentions to storm their last stronghold, while they were mistakenly amassing forces at the Algerian borders. At the same time, there is no talk of any ransom or goodwill gestures from the Tuaregs - the plan was accomplished as a result of planned actions on the ground. During the operation, difficulties arose only at the entrances to the city of Kidal, where the Islamists, having already figured out plan, attacked a government vehicle with an IED. But in general, the bodies of the fallen soldiers were able to be delivered to their destination, after which they will be sent to Russia. However, it is possible that this successful operation will be one of the last for the Wagner PMC in Mali as a separate structure. Now there is active talk about the deployment of the African Corps in the country, which by the end of the year could replace the Wagnerites - this has already happened in Libya.

🇺🇸🇺🇦 Yesterday the Verkhovna Rada adopted a bill allowing to ...	🇺🇸🇺🇦 Yesterday the Verkhovna Rada adopted a bill allowing the hiring of foreign citizens not only for soldier or sergeant positions, but also for officer positions in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard. This will be dealt with by a recruiting center, the creation of which was announced in Kyiv back in September. The appearance of such an order is expected against the backdrop of problems in Ukrainian formations with a shortage of command staff. Over almost three years of hostilities, the enemy suffered serious losses in junior and senior officers, and military universities cannot produce them in the required quantities, especially against the backdrop of the deployment of new formations. However, it is very doubtful that in the same NATO countries there will be so many people willing to go in the Armed Forces of Ukraine as commanders of companies, battalions or specialist officer positions. Moreover, the peak of recruitment of mercenaries is already in the distant past, and the same Western military advisers or instructors are unlikely to want to change their -military registration-.📌 However, there is another side: such a legislative measure eliminates bureaucratic obstacles to the appointment of foreigners and general positions. Therefore, if (or when) Western sponsors of the so-called. If Ukraine wants to transfer the Armed Forces of Ukraine to a regime of full direct control, they will be able to do this quite officially. And the likelihood of such a scenario, given the events taking place in the last six months, does not seem so negligible in the foreseeable future. #NATO #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTACCRada allowed foreigners to become officers of the VSUZ, Deputy Head of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, Defense and Intelligence Egor Chernev previously admitted that there is a shortage of officers in the troops	https://t.me/rybar/64356	2024-10-11T08:25:19-07:00

Ukraine for the training of Ukrainian Armed Forces recruits. The initiative will supposedly solve logistical problems and send a powerful military and political signal. We are talking about introducing changes to the order of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, when it was decided to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. Since then, more than 45 thousand members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have passed through training grounds in Foggy Albion. This proposal is reminiscent of recent conversations about the need to send coalition forces to the territory of the so-called. Ukraine. By the way, then ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs David Cameron did not support a similar idea with the mass dispatch of British instructors.📌 So what has changed since then? Apparently, in London they continue to prepare public opinion for the next round of escalation, Moreover, everything may not be limited to the training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Ukrainian territory by the British Army. After all, some time after this, Great Britain, together with other countries, may send a limited contingent to the western regions of the so-called. Ukraine in order to free up, albeit not the most numerous, units located on the border with Belarus in order to send them to the front line.🔻The initiative itself pursues several goals. On the one hand, theoretically this can reduce the economic costs of the preparation process and speed it up. At the same time, it is becoming more difficult for the British to disguise their presence against the backdrop of the scale of involvement in the conflict, so the official deployment of trainers will make this task easier. Well, the political signal the UK traditionally sends is quite clear: London is ready to fight to the last Ukrainian.#Great Britain&nbsp;#Russia #Ukraine@rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usThetimesUK could send troops to Ukraine on training missionGenerals consider money-saving deployment as Starmer hosts Zelensky at No. 10	https://t.me/rybar/64355	2024-10-11T07:12:06-07:00
🇰🇵🇰🇷 On South Korea's possible military response to garbage b...	🇰🇵🇰🇷 About South Korea's possible military response to garbage balloons North Koreans continue to send garbage balloons to the territory of their southern neighbor. This week, two launches have already been recorded, during which a total of about 220 balloons crossed the border between the countries. ▪️In response to this, the recently appointed South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun said that the military leadership knows the exact launch sites. This, in his opinion, makes it possible for the South Korean military to strike both them and the command and support structures involved in sending the balloons. ▪️According to the politician’s statements, the leadership will resort to such a response if the North Koreans -cross the line-. It was previously reported that the condition for a military reaction is a threat to the safety of South Korean citizens. ▪️For now, a military response seems unlikely. The main reason is the disproportion between the hypothetical strike on North Korean territory and the launch of the balloons itself. Yes, they do cause material damage, but they cannot definitely be called an act of military aggression on the part of the DPRK. 🔻In addition, the statements of the Minister of Defense diverge from the previously expressed point of view that the North Koreans are just waiting for a sharp response from South Korea to justify further actions, for example, shelling the islands in the Yellow Sea. And, most likely, Seoul understands that a potential military response could lead to an unnecessary escalation of the conflict. Maybe this is why the conditions for striking the territory of the DPRK are hidden under such vague formulations about lines that cannot be crossed. It can be assumed that the statements are more aimed at the domestic audience, which, according to the same minister, is worried about the launching of garbage balloons. Threats against North Korea are a way to show that the situation is not out of control, and the arsenal of measures against further launches has not yet been exhausted. with garbage This will happen if Pyongyang -crosses the line-, said the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Korea Kim Yong-hyun	https://t.me/rybar/64354	2024-10-11T06:03:03-07:00
🇷🇺🇺🇦 Effective strikes by the Russian Armed Forces in recent ...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 The effective strikes of the Russian Armed Forces in recent days on ships with ammunition in the ports of the Odessa region, accompanied by large detonations and flooding of dry cargo ships, led to a natural effect - an increase in the cost of insurance for ships heading to the so-called. Ukraine. Bloomberg, citing its sources, claims that after the Russian attacks, this figure increased from 0.75 to 1% of the ship’s price. And shipowners, in these conditions, insure against war risks of cargo separately from the ships themselves, which they were not previously interested in. It has long been no secret that the ports of Odessa have been operating at their previous capacity for a year and a half. This is caused by both the losses of the Black Sea Fleet, which, due to the threat of BACs and missile strikes, is actually locked in bases, as well as the difficulty of disabling the naval infrastructure - sea harbors cannot be destroyed by Geraniums or X-101. But the defeat of the ships themselves that go there is really capable influence Ukrainian maritime traffic, solving the problem of the impossibility (in current realities) of a blockade of the coast and the destruction of Odessa ports. At a minimum, making it more costly due to military risks. Yes, it all comes down to target designation - effective strikes on dry cargo ships in previous days were carried out thanks to Russian UAVs that successfully flew into enemy rear areas. But since such an opportunity still exists, it is quite possible to make the most of it.#Odessa #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comRussian Attacks Spark Surge in War Insurance for Ukraine GrainsThe cost of insuring vessels that transit Ukraine's shipping corridor in the Black Sea jumped this week after Russia ramped up attacks on key ports.	https://t.me/rybar/64353	2024-10-11T05:04:06-07:00

In addition, it was possible to clarify the situation in Medvezhye: Russian troops not only liberated the village, but also drove the enemy out of the adjacent forest belts. Thus, units of the 137th infantry regiment, 56th airborne infantry regiment, 51st infantry regiment, 155th infantry infantry regiment, 83rd airborne infantry brigade and 1434th regiment -Akhmat-Chechnya- almost completely knocked out the Ukrainian formations from the Glushkovsky district. The presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces remains only in the gully south of Krasnooktyabrsky and in the New Way, as well as a small triangle with forest belts south of the railway. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces were also able to make significant progress in the vicinity of Lyubimovka - Zeleny Shlyakh, the villages of Pokrovsky and Nizhny Klin came under control. At the same time, in Lyubimovka there are still oncoming battles, the enemy is clinging to the settlement, finding himself semi-encircled on the outskirts and in the village of Tolstoy Lug.▪️At the same time, it is curious that in the fields south of Olgovka and west of Kremyanoy, according to some sources, there are still Scattered enemy groups remain, cut off from the rest of the forces. Apparently, it will be possible to find out about their future fate soon.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, fighting also continues and the Russian Armed Forces are advancing. According to our information, the village of Fanaseevka, contrary to recent rumors, remains under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but in the Plekhovo region the Russian Armed Forces have made significant progress. Thus, Russian troops are advancing from the direction of Ulanka through swampy forests near the Psel River and have now half-covered Plekhovo, disrupting the enemy’s supply, bypassing him from the south and north. ▪️In the north, a large forest has come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces; according to preliminary information, highway 38N-515 in the Plekhovo-Makhnovka section has already been cut. To the south, Russian troops took several strong points, including those created by the enemy from scratch. ▪️Even further north - in the area of ​​​​Russkaya Konopelka - fighting continues: neither side has complete control over the settlement, but the Russian paratroopers have the initiative here. To the south, the Russian Armed Forces are moving along the railway towards Kolmakov and Agronom, taking control of stop point 66 kilometer. If the rate of advance is maintained, the enemy will either be forced to withdraw from Russkaya Konopelka, or will simply end there. To the southwest of the railway there is also an advance of the Russian Armed Forces. The enemy has been knocked out of several forest belts east of the gas station, for which battles are taking place, and after some time it is very likely that there will be reports of battles already for Cherkasy Konopelka. ▪️Thus, units 810 OGVBRMP, 40 OGVBRMP, 11 Guards Oshbr, 1220 MSP and -Akhmat-, having gone on the offensive some time ago, were able to make significant progress, pushing towards Sudzha and the suburbs from the south. ❗️At the same time, yesterday, extremely contradictory information appeared about the breakthrough of Russian troops already to the outskirts of Sudzha. However, for now this looks doubtful, although a certain probability of such a scenario exists.

Last week, a list of members of the cabinet of the new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was published, which did not include the position of curator of economic relations with the Russian Federation. According to authorities, the Japanese leader personally decided to eliminate it. This post was created back in 2016 by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Then the authorities considered it as the main instrument for the development of bilateral economic relations necessary to achieve progress in resolving the issue of the Kuril Islands. Work on this channel was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. After its completion, it was needed for the exit of local companies from the Russian market, forced to leave it due to Tokyo sanctions. 🔻Given that the position of curator of economic relations has recently looked more and more like a rudiment, there have been no large-scale changes in Japanese policy. However, in fact, Ishiba is thus abandoning the legacy of Abe, who did a lot to develop relations with Moscow. This decision can be interpreted as a sign that under the new prime minister, relations between Russia and Japan will remain at the same, almost zero level, or will become even worse. #Russia #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usSouth China Morning PostJapan axes Russia cooperation post in sign of tougher Moscow stanceThe move reflects Tokyo’s growing frustration at stalled negotiations over disputed islands and marks a departure from Shinzo Abe’s policies.	https://t.me/rybar/64349	2024-10-11T03:07:58-07:00

We can recall the FPV drones - Ghoul - which have come a long way from the assembly of small batches in the basement of a former printing house to actually full-fledged industrial production and development of technologies -machine vision-. The same can be said about the unmanned boats -Murena-: after months of struggle in the offices and justification of the need to promote this project, the resolution to provide support to Russian BECs was received.🔻And yesterday, colleagues Two Majors presented a development that was financed by public donations, and it is already in full use by our troops on the line of combat contact. Judging by the footage shown, it was quite successful. Using a hoverboard as a kamikaze drone looks like a non-trivial solution. Their maneuverability and small dimensions, coupled with a relatively large warhead and the ability to be used within a radius of 5 km, can be of great help in storming strongholds. When used in combination with other reconnaissance and fire weapons, such vehicles act as a very formidable weapon in conditions of trench warfare. Let's hope that their use by Russian troops in the offensive against fortified areas will soon become widespread. #industry #Russia@rybar Support usTelegramTwo Majors✨Combat work of kamikaze vehicles -Two Majors-✨Self-propelled vehicles, designed on the basis of popular hoverboards, are already widely used at the Front.

Parliamentarians demand personal restrictions against the founder of the ruling party of Georgia -Georgian Dream- Bidzina Ivanishvili for -his role in the deterioration of the political process in Georgia-, as well as for -turning towards Russia- and moving away from the West. The resolution of the European Parliament contains criticism of recent legislative changes in the country, which, according to European bureaucrats , indicate a retreat from democracy. They see these measures as -tools- used by the government to suppress freedom of expression, restrict civil society and persecute minorities. MPs are calling for a freeze on all EU funding for Georgia until the government repeals -undemocratic laws-.🔻Former Prime Minister Republic Irakli Garibashvili criticized the resolution as -another blatant interference in the internal affairs- of the country.

Exercise Sama Sama 2024 began recently in Philippine waters, with military personnel from the Philippines, the United States, Australia, Japan, Canada and France participating. The main goals of such exercises are always similar - increasing interoperability and strengthening security ties between regional partners. The military personnel will practice anti-submarine and anti-ship operations, as well as measures aimed at combating air targets. 📌It is important to note that Sama Sama 2024 is an annual exercise that initially only involved Filipino and American military personnel. However, in the last few years, training has been conducted in a multilateral format, which once again provides an opportunity for military personnel from non-regional countries to deploy equipment in Southeast Asia. As stated, training locations are limited to the territorial waters of the Philippines. In addition, the exercises will not be held near the disputed Scarborough Reef, the site of frequent skirmishes between the Philippines and the Chinese in the South China Sea. But even despite the statements, it is worth understanding that it will not be difficult for the parties to go beyond the territorial waters into the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines. And since the PRC considers this part of the waters to be theirs, the Chinese military will once again be able to send ships to monitor military activity unfolding in the disputed part of the region.

Just 10 days before the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration, the head of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, decided to support the election campaign of the current President Maia Sandu.▪️The foreign official directly participated in political campaigning, calling on Moldovan citizens to vote in the referendum for joining the EU. ▪️For positive consolidation, Von der Leyen announced the allocation of the largest financial assistance package for Moldova - 1.8 billion euros. ▪️The head of the EC promised to provide this amount to the republic within three years. Obviously, there should have been a clause here that the money would come to Moldova in the event of -good behavior-, that is, Sandu’s re-election and positive votes in the referendum. ▪️To achieve this, the president’s office is doing everything possible: from blocking sites criticizing Moldova’s European integration to police seizing propaganda leaflets of the Communist Party, in which citizens are urged to vote against. The security forces justified the latter with -misinformation- in the materials, because now any propaganda that contradicts Sandu’s course falls under this definition. 🔻The string of high-ranking Western officials who come to Moldova as part of Sandu’s election campaign once again demonstrates the decisive intentions of the West in the republic, from which they are making another NATO training ground. #EU #Moldova @rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majorsThe EU directly interferes in the elections and the European referendum in 🇲🇩Moldova On October 10, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, during a visit to Chisinau, announced the allocation of 1.8 billion euros to support the Plan for Moldova’s accession to the EU.

The advanced groups of Russian troops reached the Green Way by the end of the day, which allows us to assert that there was at least a partial breakthrough of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Russian troops are repelling enemy attacks south of Vesely, trying to prevent the advance of Ukrainian formations to highway 38N-052, leading to the administrative center of the district. Despite the problems in other areas, the enemy continues to attack here.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of attacks on the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. An advanced armored group of Russian troops was spotted chasing an enemy tank northwest of Zeleny Shlyakh. The settlement is located a little less than five kilometers from the previously noted front line in the Lyubimovka area, while the armored group of the Russian Armed Forces itself was moving from the north. Russian troops broke through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to the north in the Kremyanoy area and actually cut off the ledge at the front that abutted Korenevo and Olgovka. Control over the Green Way will allow Russian troops to block the enemy’s supply lines through the 38K-030 route, which plays an important role in the logistics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Also, footage of the passage of Russian Armed Forces equipment on the Korenevo-Sudzha highway towards Zeleny Shlyakh appeared on the Internet, which also confirms the success of the attack near Olgovka. In the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops also went on the offensive in several sectors of the front and achieved tactical successes. So, according to some reports, they liberated the settlement of Novaya Sorochina and are now moving towards Malaya Lokna. There is also information about a deep breakthrough of Russian troops into the defense line of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in one of the sectors, but it is still impossible to assess the scale of the advance, and rumors about reaching the northern outskirts of Sudzha look overly optimistic. At the same time, to the west of the city, another use of the UAV -Inokhodets- was recorded, which may indicate preparations for the assault. There is information from the ground that Russian troops have also made significant progress in the Plekhovo area from Ulanka and Borok, but there are no more detailed details of the attack yet.❗️The success of the double strike of Russian troops in the Korenevsky district may lead to the encirclement of significant forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, but before that At the moment, there are still several settlements to go through, which have been occupied and fortified by the enemy for quite some time.

We have already written more than once about a series of scandals involving expelled British Embassy employees who were in contact with Russian oppositionists, supported the work of anti-government media and were directly coordinating protests, and also tried to influence migration politics in the Russian Federation. Some of them did this by directly supervising fairly well-known journalists and NGO leaders, but the activities of some not so public persons turned out to be no less interesting and potentially much more dangerous in view of the current crime and migration situation.📌According to the FSB, one of those who lost accreditation of diplomats - Blake Patel - specialized in working with Russian Muslims. According to official data, this gentleman was in contact with representatives of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Russian Federation, namely, the head of the science department of the Department of Science and Education, Ilyas Sadulin, who, according to some sources, participates in international visits as an assistant to the Russian mufti. Some characterize these contacts as consultations with subject matter experts, in which there may be nothing reprehensible, however, if we take into account the peculiarities of the activities of one of the structures of British intelligence - the Directorate of Eastern Europe and Central Asia - everything may not be so simple. 🔻Read more in our new article #Great Britain #article #Russia @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64323	2024-10-10T11:01:50-07:00
🔁 🇷🇺🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯🇰🇿🇹🇲 About the security of the migration f...	Forwarded From DTM🇷🇺🇰🇬🇺🇿🇹🇯🇰🇿🇹🇲 On the security of the migration field of Russia and the countries of Central Asia▪️After the expulsion of British diplomats from Russia for espionage, general attention was attracted by the fact that employees of the English embassy, ​​among other things, coordinated projects on foreign interference in the migration policy of the Russian Federation.▪️In particular, diplomat Jessica Davenport supervised foreign agent Svetlana Gannushkina, whose public activities were closely related to the liberalization of migration legislation, the importation of foreigners into the country and their illegal settlement in Russia. The British financed Svetlana Gannushkina’s projects.▪️A little later, an investigation appeared about how international structures, for example, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), working under the UN, were doing approximately the same thing.▪️In coordination with diasporas and an extensive network of pro-Western NGOs, IOM has been implemented for years in the processes of -improving- Russian migration legislation, created a favorable environment for the consolidation of visitors to the Russian Federation and their penetration into all sectors of the Russian economy.▪️ Among the sponsors of IOM projects are such well-known donors of color revolutions as the World Bank and the UK Department for International Cooperation and Development.C What is the reason for the obsessive desire of foreign benefactors to help a sovereign state in matters of migration? It's simple: control over the flow of visitors is a weapon that can be used in your own interests.▪️Accordingly, establishing order in the migration legislation of the Russian Federation is a security issue. Including for the migrants themselves, since Russia has seriously taken up the transfer of all foreign labor flows into a completely legal channel and invites its neighbors to join in this work.▪️Do the neighbors need this? If you think that migration is a weapon in the hands of the West, directed only against Russia, think again. The same IOM implements projects throughout Central Asia. For example, the organization’s partner is the Center for Employment of Citizens Abroad under the Ministry of Labor of Kyrgyzstan, which is also friends with USAID. Such are the things.▪️Numerous foundations, associations and other NGOs financed by foreign structures, under the guise of human rights and educational activities, have long been organizing the import of foreigners to republics friendly to Russia. Yes, not on the same scale as people from the region come to Russia, but citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and other countries of the Global South also go there to work. At the same time, the number of visitors, as well as those who stayed as guests, is steadily growing through the efforts of networks of pro-Western NGOs.▪️Needless to say, in this way, immigrants from countries with a very unstable military-political situation and widespread radical religious teachings enter the territory of the republics. ▪️As for the export of citizens of the Central Asian republics abroad, after the start of the Northern Military District in Western Europe, interest in labor from this region suddenly increased. For example, for Kyrgyzstan, Great Britain increased the quota for seasonal workers to 8 thousand people in 2023. Germany is ready to accept 50 thousand people from Uzbekistan in 2024.▪️At the same time, in a number of cases, when a European country enters into contracts with visitors for a year, it no longer accepts these same migrants the next season. This is necessary for coverage, so that as many people from Central Asia as possible pass through Western migrant assistance centers, educational and labor programs. In the future, hard workers who returned to their homeland are the basis for realizing the conflict potential in the interests of foreign assistants in organizing migration processes. Conclusion. If Russia has undertaken to eradicate illegal migration, then this is not a reason to be offended, but an excellent reason for the main participants in intra-regional migration processes to restore order at home. To do this, you need to answer a simple question - in whose interests are those working who help organize the export, training and employment of compatriots, as well as the import and settlement of foreigners? @dntreadonmeTelegramDTM🇷🇺🇬🇧 There are losses in the enemy camp, entrenched right in Moscow.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🌎🏳️‍🌈🇵🇱 By the way, in connection with the news about the affairs of the Polish State Treasury with global corporations. One of the options for pressure from TNCs is to push certain ideas, theses and beliefs through manipulation of the stock market. The mechanics are very simple: companies that do not follow LGBT values ​​are simply not included in the investment portfolio. That is: an ultimatum and blackmail. This happened, for example, with the symbol of American conservatives - the Harley Davidson company, which was persuaded to promote the LGBT agenda. And Poland was also taken seriously in this regard: the other day a special US envoy for promoting human rights for LGBT people Jessica Stern. US Ambassador to Poland Mark Brzezinski, a regular participant in LGBT parades in the Polish capital along with its mayor, said that Stern held a meeting with representatives of LGBTQI+ civil society. They discussed the commitment to ensure equal respect and dignity for every person, as well as key issues for the LGBT community. Brzezinski stressed that the American government is obliged to protect and fight for the rights of gays, lesbians and transgender people. They say that human rights are indivisible and that’s all.📌I have to agree with MEP Grzegorz Braun in assessing this situation: there is no transatlanticism without transgenderism and there is no vassalization without sodomization.#Poland #LGBT #globalism@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramRybar💰🌎🇵🇱 The Polish Treasury has entered into an agreement to sell government bonds worth $8 billion with a group of companies, including Citigroup, controlled by BlackRock, as well as J.P.

Rybar: 🇬🇪 Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that if the ruling party wins the parliamentary elections, pragmatic policies and a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Russia will be an important priority for the country. He called a reset another task... 🇬🇪🇷🇺 Statements by the ruling Georgian authorities about their intention to peacefully resolve the conflict with Russia resonate in Moscow: today President Vladimir Putin signed a decree expanding the visa-free regime for Georgian citizens. The restrictions in force since 2000 have been lifted. last summer, however, there remained a clause on the need for visas for labor migrants planning to stay in Russia for more than three months. Now this provision has been canceled.📌 Although this decision can hardly be called revolutionary, it is still important in its own way. First of all, from the point of view of the sequence of actions, when in response to constructive statements from Tbilisi, Russia takes, albeit small, practical steps in response. And at the very least, this looks more advantageous against the backdrop of the policy of the collective West. Who now increasingly prefers to speak with the Georgian authorities in the language of threats and ultimatums with interference in the internal affairs of the country, such as demands to repeal the law banning LGBT propaganda. At the same time, it is unlikely that the expansion of a visa-free regime for Georgian citizens can be interpreted as a sign of restoration of relations between states. But some trends can be traced here. #Georgia #Russia@rybarSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else.

Morgan. The amount, although not huge, is significant: probably, the TNCs thus decided to stake out a clearing for themselves, and at the same time bind the local authorities more closely to themselves, in order to continue to determine the economy of Warsaw, and therefore its politics. It is no coincidence that the agreement also includes -assessment of Poland's resource potential - a kind of audit of future assets of corporations. After all, it is obvious that Poland, already experiencing significant economic problems and having no prospects, will not be able to give money to creditors. This will lead to the fact that all assets will end up in the hands of corporations, which will get them at a bargain price.📌 Thus, a fairly typical scenario for globalists is being implemented in Poland, the goal of which is usually to destroy or reformat the country. One of his points: to bring the country’s economy to bankruptcy in order to buy everything for next to nothing. This is usually done by cutting off supplies of cheap energy resources, inflating inflation and selling government bonds. They are being bought by Western investment funds - the already familiar BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street and others. And then they need to reduce the value of assets that serve as collateral for government bonds. This is possible through a local market collapse or military conflict. And for those who are already actively pushing the Poles into battle as cannon fodder, the choice of plot twist is obvious. #globalism #Poland @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramTomasz Szmydt - Fundacja -Polska Prawda- / Tomasz Schmidt - Foundation -Polish Pravda-Ostatnie resztki polskiej suwerenności zostały sprzedane amerykańskiemu -BlackRock-Dzień dobry.

Forwarded From Belarusian security officer 🇧🇾Yesterday, many swore at Rybar and his series of posts about Verkhnekamenka, as well as the situation in the Seversky direction in general. Like, why does Rybar help the enemy and refute the capture of some settlement. It’s not even about Rybar and not even specifically in this case. This is not the first year that the war has been going on and at the front - fighting on debt - this is often a habitual activity. If someone doesn’t know, then -to fight on duty- is when your commander has already marked on the map the settlement/support/landing that was behind the enemy as taken and reported this above. That is, you continue to fight further, trying to complete the assigned task, but now in debt. And well, if everything ended on maps and reports, there would be no collateral damage. When it is reported that some conditional settlement or square has been taken, then the corresponding adjustments are made in the General Staff, on their maps, and all this makes direct adjustments when planning further advancement. This is where the phrases that have already become jokes, but are still notorious, were born: -Don’t be afraid, go there, we are in these plantings.- This directly affects the work of the art and the number of BCs.

The agreement will allow Qatar to use military training grounds on the territory of Kazakhstan. In addition, the ratified agreement covers cooperation in the fields of military education, medicine, military science, cultural events and consultations in peacekeeping operations.📌 Apparently, this is another echo of Tokayev’s visit to Qatar earlier this year, when several agreements were concluded between the countries. But the fact that one of them was interaction in the defense sector is extremely interesting. Therefore, an interesting combination comes to mind: Qatar is a British gas station, and on its territory there is also a large American military base called Ed-Dhafra. That is, the following picture emerges: the British signed a strategic partnership agreement with Kazakhstan in the spring, which affected everything possible except the military sphere. ❗️And now one of the main British partners in the Persian Gulf has gained access to military training grounds and other defense facilities of Kazakhstan, a member of the CSTO. It’s hard to call it a coincidence.🔻Well, it’s also worth noting that Kazakhstan is preparing for a serious fuel shortage due to a shutdown for repairs at the Atyrau Oil Refinery.

The Canadian Foreign Ministry warned back in 2021, that among the victims were members of the SS and Nazi collaborators. However, plans to open a memorial in the center of Ottawa in November 2023 were prevented only by a scandal with an ovation for Jaroslav Hunke, a member of the SS-Galicia division, in the Canadian Parliament. The completed memorial has remained closed to the public since then. Heritage Canada, which is responsible for the memorial, has been vague about ongoing reviews, and activists and organizations, including Jewish ones, have called for 330 names to be removed from the list of victims of communism. 📌This is not the first scandal with the memorial. When the project was approved in 2009, the memorial was planned to cost $1.1 million and be funded entirely by private donations from Tribute to Liberty, an organization founded by politicians and businessmen whose families fled communist countries. However, the project budget subsequently ballooned to $5.5 million, and the remaining amount was covered from the state budget.🔻 -The Memorial to the Victims of Communism is just another example of how the descendants of Ukrainian nationalists who fled to Canada after the Second World War are trying to rewrite history and pass off the crimes of their ancestors as -the fight against the Soviet regime-. And the diaspora will try with all its might to bring the project to completion, until the costs of scandals outweigh the political benefits of supporting the so-called Ukraine.#Canada #Ukraine@rybarSupport us ottawacitizenVictims of Communism memorial faces call to remove over 330 names linked to Nazis, fascistsA Canadian Heritage report obtained by the Ottawa Citizen recommends removing more than 330 names from the memorial.	https://t.me/rybar/64313	2024-10-10T05:06:01-07:00
🖼 🇬🇦🇬🇶 About the territorial dispute between Gabon and Equat...	🇬🇦🇬🇶 On the territorial dispute between Gabon and Equatorial Guinea On September 30, the International Court of Justice began hearings regarding the ownership of a small group of Mbanje islands by African countries. According to the position of the authorities of Equatorial Guinea, a piece of land in the Gulf of Corisco belongs to them, according to the colonial division of French and Spanish territories in 1900. Gabon considers it theirs, according to a convention dating back to 1974.❗️The small islands became the subject of a diplomatic dispute due to the discovery of oil reserves around them in the 1970s. And already in 2003, the Gabonese army occupied them. On this occasion, the Malaga authorities referred the conflict to the UN international tribunal, and in Liberville they expressed their readiness to recognize the court’s decision. And until recently, the conflict hung in limbo. Against this background, the trip of the President of Equatorial Guinea to Russia in search of economic and political support is noteworthy. It is likely that Nguema Mbasongo fears that the UN court will rule in favor of the pro-American junta in Gabon, creating additional reasons for popular discontent. Political circles in the West can take advantage of the latter, increasing their pressure on Equatorial Africa.

The situation has become so tense that daily incidents with migrants have become commonplace. At the same time, it is one thing to talk about one high-profile incident and another to draw conclusions based on more detailed data throughout the country. In this regard, it was interesting to analyze the statistics of the Prosecutor General’s Office for 2024 on the crime situation in Russia, namely crimes committed by foreigners.▪️ Their total number, compared to the nine months of 2023, decreased by 3.1% and amounted to 30&nbsp;231 crimes. Although there is one nuance: the number of migrants themselves who committed these crimes decreased by 4.3% (22&nbsp;762).❗️It is interesting that there are 7,469 fewer persons involved than the crimes they committed. An extraordinary difference, isn't it? It is due to a special counting system in the field of drug trafficking. Bookmarks, which have long become a meme, are classified as a separate independent crime. They caught the courier, found 20 packages of bookmarks on him and received 20 crimes for one person. And 5&nbsp;566 such sales were identified.▪️Serious crimes increased by 19.7% - 6&nbsp;456, but the number of especially serious crimes decreased by 21.1% - 6,548 crimes. This includes 1,209 corruption crimes, and 88 crimes of an extremist nature.▪️The fact of document falsification and corruption should be considered important from the point of view of the migration problem. Fraud with documents increased by 14.6% (from 4&nbsp;520 to 5&nbsp;181), and economic crimes by 23.5% (from 1&nbsp;790 to 2&nbsp;211).▪️Another worrying position can be called an increase of 2 % of crimes against sexual integrity - 861 cases. Compared to 2023, there are 9 more rapes and 32 more indecent assaults. ❗️Despite the low numbers in the increase, these types of incidents cause a large reaction among residents, and their increase should be of serious concern to security forces.▪️In other categories, such as property damage (i.e. theft, robberies, robberies) and attempts on life and murders, there is a decrease of 5.8%, which significantly corrected the statistics. Summarizing the statistical data, it should be noted that these are only numbers that are a dry and not always reliable indicator of the real situation. We cannot exclude the human factor, the corruption component and the elementary impossibility of keeping track of everything. Even now, when the general figures show a decrease in the number of crimes among foreigners, a closer examination reveals those pain points that we have been paying attention to for a long time.➖Cases of forgery of documents grew by a large percentage. This is one of the main factors of the current problem, due to which shadow migration has become a routine and the number of illegal immigrants has increased hundreds of times.➖Corruption, namely the giving of bribes to officials, has not disappeared anywhere. Bribery and nepotism have led to increased influence of ethnic communities in Russia and, as a result, complicity and concealment on the part of some security officials and politicians have become the norm.➖And, of course, it is worth remembering the bureaucratic component. One of the main criteria for a successful service was and is - correct reports - in which a positive trend in any issue should be visible from year to year. Taken together, all this led to many years of indifference to the problem that was growing like a snowball, to which was added the high activity of Western intelligence services and the non-profit organizations they finance.

In this case, the Americans ask their Tajik colleagues to assist in improving the educational program for primary school, since the current LTA project ends in September next year. Among other questions, the Americans asked one very interesting question: what are the entry points into the educational system of Tajikistan in the development of emotional intelligence and soft skills (flexibility)?

The term -Central Asia- will be replaced by -Turkestan- in order to strengthen national identity among future generations. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan noted that work will be carried out shoulder to shoulder with the countries of the region to make the coming period the era of the Turks within the framework of the vision of the Turkish Century. in the Organization of Turkic States. According to Turkish experts, these changes are part of a broader strategy to strengthen ties and unity in the Turkic world, including the creation of a common history, literature, maps and alphabet.📌 In past centuries, the region of Central Asia was called something like the same . During the time of the Russian Empire, there was a Turkestan Governor-General, and only in the 20s of the last century the term -Central Asia- came into use. And there seems to be nothing sacred in this, something like changing Turkey to Türkiye - to amuse one’s vanity. However, the general situation in which the Turks have significantly accelerated the integration of the countries of Central Asia into the UTC looks indicative. After all, they call the region -Turkestan- not with good intentions, the Turkish authorities are seeking to restore imaginary greatness by integrating the region into the pan-Turkic project of the UTC.❗️And the Organization of Turkic States , created under the control of British curators and acting in their interests, acts as an ideal springboard for uniting these peoples into one supranational bloc.

Ukraine. The fire included the port infrastructure in the Odessa region, a machine-building plant in Kramatorsk, and the positions of the Patriot air defense system southwest of Dnepropetrovsk. Ukrainian formations carried out another launch of drones across Russian regions. The most massive attack took place in the Bryansk region, where the main target of the raid was the territory of the 67th arsenal of the GRAU of the Russian Ministry of Defense near Karachev. In the Kursk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces repelled enemy attacks in the vicinity of Lyubimovka in the Korenevsky district. There were also reports about the liberation of the Pokrovsky farm, but the footage presented as filming from the populated area was recorded in another place. In the Seversky direction, despite the victorious reports of individual patriotic media and reports confirming the progress, the configuration of the front has not changed significantly - Grigorovka, Belogorovka and Vyemka remain under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces are storming the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Dzerzhinsk.

After the publication of the analysis of what is happening in the Seversky direction, questions like -Why refute reports about the capture of villages if this is an element of information warfare?- They say that the enemy himself is ready to believe in them loss, and there is no need to interfere with him. Alas, everything works a little differently here. A false report about the capture of a particular location not only misinforms the higher command and contributes to making erroneous decisions, but in addition also cuts off one’s own combat capabilities.📌 First of all, this applies to work with large calibers, such as FAB with UMPC. If we paint over the conditional Verkhnekamenskoye without establishing real control, then an airstrike on targets inside the village from above simply does not agree. Indeed, why attack the village, which on the map is already our rear? But no one removed the tasks of moving further to Seversk, so the troops have to catch up with false reports and liberate what is already ours on paper. But this already has to be done without the use of -large calibers- for the same destruction of enemy strongholds.❗️ That is, such -false-reports lead to a decrease in the ability to inflict fire damage in the interests of the advancing group. And this, in turn, entails losses of personnel and equipment. Which, contrary to the beliefs of some people, tend to end very quickly if used thoughtlessly. Therefore, comrades who justify such situations with -competent IPsO- are somewhat in a parallel world. The realities are still completely different, and at the cost of fraudulent reports about successes are the lives of our people.

🇮🇱🇮🇷🇺🇸 Journalists from The Wall Street Journal write that ...	🇮🇱🇮🇷🇺🇸 Journalists from The Wall Street Journal write that the Israeli government is refusing to disclose to the Biden administration details of its plans to respond to Iran. American officials are frustrated that they have been repeatedly caught off guard by Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, and they are trying to prevent further escalation. At the same time, in the United States there is no information about the time and purpose of the proposed strike, and in Washington they expected to receive this data during the visit of Defense Minister Galant, which was postponed at the request of Netanyahu.🔻Sounds good, doesn’t it? Especially after the media trumpeted that the Israelis notified the United States of the planned assassination of Hassan Nasrallah and the start of an operation in Lebanon. And before that, the Israeli leadership tells the Americans more than enough about the progress of other events in the Gaza Strip. And the Pentagon was directly involved in planning the response to the Iranian attacks. Do you think why the head of the Central Command, Michael Kurilla, came to Israel? And the picture of US ignorance in the controlled media is needed to justify why the White House does not prevent the Israelis from committing genocide of the Palestinian and Lebanese peoples.

🔁 As military correspondent Simonov and Rybar write, the reason ...	Forwarded From Colonelcassad (Boris Rozhin)As military correspondent Simonov and Rybar write, the reason for the excessive shading of the map on the Seversky ledge lies in incorrect reports from the field on the basis of which reports were given about the complete control of Verkhnekamensky. In fact, this is a remake of the situation in 2022, when there were premature reports about the release of Popasnaya, who was stormed for a long time. Now such cases have become rare, but nevertheless they still occur. The reduction in such episodes was a consequence of the competent policy of the Russian Ministry of Defense with the delay in publication of the liberation of settlements only after the completion of cleansing and establishment of full control, even several days after they were declared captured on the Internet. Advancement in these areas of the Seversky salient is taking place this is confirmed by objective enemy control, but is not as impressive as on published maps. The flag in Grigorovka confirms the very fact of entering the ruins of the village (in which the enemy, apparently, was not present at all), but there is no complete control there yet, so rapid throws through Grigorovka to the northeastern outskirts of Seversk are not yet relevant. But only for now. The liberation of Seversk is inevitable. In the case of Verkhnekamensky, the enemy still maintains its presence in the ruins of the village (which confirms objective control). Well, it’s also worth noting that the flag in the First Zhelanny (Red Army direction) was mistaken for the hoisted flag in Verkhnekamenskoye. This is most likely just an information defect. The Russian Armed Forces now have enough real successes in a number of directions, but in the eastern part of the Seversky salient there is still work to be done , in order to achieve the same pace as in the Krasnoarmeisky or Kurakhovsky directions. The Seversky ledge will certainly be cut off. The only question is the timing. Telegram Call sign Bruce 📌 This has never happened before and here we go again. I checked with my friends and confirm that the situation in the Seversky direction is not as rosy as some local commanders present it to the higher leadership. Unfortunately, Rybar is right.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Lieutenant General Flyustikov The permanent head of the Special Operations Forces, who became the head back in 2018, this year for many turned out to be a controversial and uncomfortable figure, raising questions, but at the same time deserving of respect. After a difficult situation from a positional point of view struggle in 2023, the SOF commander decided to return to the classic use of deep reconnaissance means: sabotage and subversive actions behind enemy lines. Flustikov is a man of pragmatic views, for whom there can be no excuses for cowardice and weakness: regardless of injuries received, titles and awards, PT is mandatory for everyone. In addition, the commander, by his personal order, forced those who were not organically involved in such work, namely personal protection specialists, to go on ambushes. Today, MTR combat commands are synonymous with the word success. Specialists operate successfully in all operational and tactical areas, however, as in any army structure, management problems begin to arise at the headquarters level. The problem of receiving state awards today remains one of the main ones in the forces: for -ordinary- militants, it remains a mystery how staff members continue to receive one Order of Courage after another, when they receive simple medals of Suvorov and Zhukov. In addition, staff workers do not hesitate to go too far during official proceedings, the reason for which today can be the most minor offenses: honored veterans are deprived of an increasing coefficient, for which they subsequently receive less money. Today, many formations and associations suffer from staff illness The Russian Army, however, is sad to realize that the most famous special forces of Russia are beginning to fall ill with this disease. The future of the MTR depends on the decisions of Valery Flyustikov, because as you know, the most expensive resource of any commander is personnel. Major General Savitsky The favorite of all Cuban militants, who received the nickname -Sava- behind his back. The main antagonist of the special operations forces, whom many see as the successor of Valery Flyustikov. For several years now, Savitsky has been tipped for the position of a big boss in civilian life: he is wooed to the position of a federal official, but each time he refuses, consciously choosing military service. During his tenure, he managed to build trusting relationships not only with the higher command, but also with the heads of other special forces units in the FSVNG and FSB, with whom the Center regularly exchanges experience, as well as with representatives of business circles who are ready to help the Russian army free of charge from patriotic motives. Largely thanks to the mentality of the boss, Kubinka specialists today remain among those few in the Russian army who are allowed to wear long hairstyles and grow beards. It is also significant that Savitsky himself is not afraid of traveling to the military training area, and also holds meetings and informal evenings with ordinary specialists and their families, where they can substantively discuss everything that cannot be discussed within the walls of a military unit. The boss cannot always be satisfied with the interests of his subordinates: often the command puts pressure on him and he has to choose, but so far Savitsky has managed to maintain a balance between these two groups. Today, the Cuban center remains leading in terms of combat performance, returning from missions with minimal losses, and this merit largely belongs to its chief, Andrei Savitsky.

The fact is that first there was a report from the Ministry of Defense on the clearing of the settlement, and then a report from Izvestia appeared as confirmation. But this report is not proof that the settlement is under the control of Russian troops. (Believe me, we would be the first to really rejoice at this moment and are ready to admit that this is not so if any objective facts of control appear). As far as we know, Verkhnekamenskoye is in the zone of responsibility of the Cossacks of the 6th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade, and it is they who are responsible for the conduct of actions in this area and the success (as well as failure) of certain assault actions.🔻What’s wrong with the report - Izvestia -?▪️The footage from the car was obviously filmed on territory controlled by the Russian Armed Forces and is not of great value. Judging by the speed of movement and the bushes outside the window, this is not Verkhnekamensk at all. ▪️At 0.13 - resource map of Lostarmour, Verkhnekamenskoye -colored over - according to the statement of the Ministry of Defense some time ago, but in complete isolation from the existing objective control personnel in this area. To the south on the same screen, by the way, the Recess is shown, which is not under the control of the RF Armed Forces, and at the moment the same Lostarmour is -painted-. With Grigorovka it’s a different story - in the shown section of the map it is not painted over, but is now under the control of the RF Armed Forces.▪️At 0.56 - a strike on the ruins of the Seversky Dolomite Plant, which has been regularly hit almost from the very beginning of the Northern Military District. And it is extremely unlikely that this particular strike has anything to do with the fighting near Verkhnekamensky. ▪️Frames from 1.13, according to which the journalists had already taken a walk to Verkhnekamenskoye - the author of the report himself posted with a caption about the Desired Second back on October 7. There is a separate report on this on the Izvestia website. ▪️Next, at 1.16, there is another frame with the Russian flag, and it also has nothing to do with Verkhnekamensky. This is filming from the Russian Ministry of Defense from Desired First. Coordinates: 48.0751, 37.42584 ▪️And only at the very end, at 1.25, the Russian flag is clearly visible on a house on the western outskirts of Verkhnekamensky. However, the banner is not installed on some kind of flagshot, but simply lies on the roof, obviously dropped there from a drone, and not installed there by hand. Coordinates: 48.86256890414785, 38.16919919278926 ❗️In general, if we consider only this individual case concerning Verkhnekamensky, we can see how, at first, an incorrect report from the field forms an incorrect idea of ​​the leadership of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation about what is happening at the front. And then unprofessional military correspondents and journalists, acting in the interests of liars, film low-quality reports that do not deal with reality at all.📌 The Rybar team may admit that they are mistaken in their judgments. Well, if this is so, we would be happy to see footage of real control that confirms that Russian troops have established stable control over Verkhnekamensky. And the words that this is impossible, will endanger the fighters operating in this direction, believe me, are definitely not an excuse for our groups that publish online footage of the actions of the East and Center troop groups, which are the most effective to date based on successes on the front line. Well, a trend about effectiveness has appeared, but, alas, there is no actual effectiveness in certain areas.

At the moment, a presentation of the enterprise has already taken place before representatives of military and law enforcement agencies. It is planned to establish production of a new model of the 8-wheeled armored fighting vehicle RILA 8×8 (RILA 8×8 IFV), which will enter service with the Bulgarian Armed Forces. In addition, the company's products include a light reconnaissance vehicle (LRV), a GUARDIAN armored personnel carrier, an armored rescue vehicle SENTINEL (ARV), etc., which will be supplied to the armed forces of EU and NATO countries against the background of the growing need to build up the military power of Western countries.✨ A typical example of how the Russian threat brings money to transnational corporations and corrupt Western bureaucrats.

Simply put, the Afghan factor, namely imaginary problems with terrorists and a long humanitarian and social crisis, create convenient conditions for lobbying their services to the countries of the region. And on October 8, a meeting was held between the Special Representative of the President of Uzbekistan for Afghanistan, Ismatulla Irgashev, and the head of the EU delegation in Tashkent, Toivo Klaar, within the framework of cooperation between the parties. The head of the EU Delegation noted the need to continue regular bilateral contacts to coordinate efforts in the Afghan direction and highly appreciated the efforts of the Uzbek authorities to solve the Afghan problem.📌 The collective West is trying to coerce the authorities of the countries of Central Asia not only through military methods. Elementary economic and political interaction, embellished with beautiful words, is also in use.

🖼 🇸🇩 The situation in Sudan: the offensive of the armed forces...	🇸🇩 The situation in Sudan: the offensive of the armed forces in Khartoum as of October 9, 2024. The decrease in military activity that we observed due to the rainy season is fading away. Across the entire front, there is an intensification of both the Rapid Reaction Forces of the rebel General Hamedti and the country's armed forces.▪️In the capital of the country, Khartoum, the army went on the offensive from Omdurman. Through the bridge connecting the two cities, a large column of equipment was able to advance up to three kilometers in depth, breaking through to the blockaded parts of the country's general headquarters. In addition, aviation is actively helping in the offensive, carrying out strikes throughout Khartoum. In response, the RRF fired at Karari and tried once again to attack the blockaded parts of the armed forces. They did not achieve any success in this direction.▪️In the west of the country in El Fasher, the rebels were successful: they managed to occupy several blocks of the city. They carried out pogroms in the occupied territories, destroying and burning houses. In response, Sudanese aviation attacked them, including using the Il-76 transport aircraft for this purpose. The success of the attackers is associated with a huge numerical superiority. RRF recruit militants from controlled territories. More than two hundred people were recruited from El Geneina alone. At the same time, one of the commanders of the advancing rebels was killed during the fighting.❗️An interesting incident occurred in a deserted, uncontested zone. On October 2, a convoy of armed forces passing to the west of the country came under attack by the rebels. During the bloody battles, as stated by the RRF, they managed to destroy about a hundred army vehicles. There were also battles along the Chadian-Sudanese border, where the RRF attacked the army-controlled city of Kalbus, but were unsuccessful.▪️Fighting continued on the Sennar salient -, mainly in the area of ​​​​the city of Dinder, which changed hands several times, but is currently controlled by the armed forces. The RRF also tried once again to carry out an offensive at El Obeid, but without apparent success. Meanwhile, the government air force carried out a raid on Nyala airport, controlled by the rebels. The reason was the landing of unknown planes, presumably from the UAE. The extent of the damage is unknown, but explosions were recorded throughout the harbor.🔻Amid ongoing fighting, Sudanese President Fattah al-Burhan visited the capital of South Sudan, where he met with the local president. The topic of discussion was the occupation of oil-bearing areas belonging to Juba by the SBR. Burhan intends to take advantage of this to unite around a common enemy and establish supply routes. While the leaders of the RRF were busy participating in the Geneva Peace Conference under the patronage of the United States, in Beijing the Sudanese authorities continued to seek support from both the Chinese and other regional players. At the moment, there is no end in sight to the war, but as recent events show, the world community is increasingly leaning towards Burhan.

Due to the active use of UAVs by the enemy and the lack of cover in the required quantity, the attack is akin to a one-way ticket. Moreover, their scenario has not changed for a long time: armored groups of the Russian Armed Forces are moving from the direction of Verkhnekamenka or Zolotarevka, landing troops in the east of the strong point . The soldiers find themselves in open, broken trenches, coming under artillery and UAV attacks: the assault groups die, and the remnants are captured or killed by the enemy.❗️Over the past months, this has happened not once or twice. Such unconditional clumsy tactics, which do not change even after all the significant losses in people and equipment, can be safely called sabotage. Verkhnekamenskoye itself is also under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces - it cannot be taken without a successful assault on the heights to the north and south, which it still occupies enemy. The Russian flag on the western outskirts of the village, footage of which was replicated on the Internet, was in fact simply dropped from a drone, while other video evidence was passed off as footage from the DPR. 🔻On the southern front of the Seversky direction in the area of ​​Sporny and Ivano-Daryevka, the real advance of Russian troops was still recorded. However, it occurs in forest belts without pompous statements and is confirmed mainly by footage of objective control by the enemy. The situation is different with Vyemka and the railway station of the same name, also allegedly liberated in accordance with previous statements of the Ministry of Defense. Judging by the videos popping up on the Internet from both sides, the stopping point is still occupied by the enemy, and Russian troops are operating on the southern edge of the Zmeiny Yar nature reserve and the heights to the east. That is, there is no talk of any capture of the village. ❗️In general, in almost all the areas mentioned, the situation remains complex and tense. Reports of great successes are a hoax and a banal deception of the leadership, which obviously affects the credibility of such reports. But for what purpose near Verkhnekamensky and Belogorovka, routine attacks continue month after month with the expenditure of not at all infinite personnel is a question for the authorized structures. Somehow there are too many lies for so many errors.

🖼 ❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Seversk direction: you can make mistakes, you can’t...	❗️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Seversky direction: you can make mistakes, you can’t lie, part 1 Situation as of 16.00 October 9 For the last few days, victorious reports have been coming from Seversky direction from several sections at once without stopping, which have nothing to do with reality.🔻Some resources managed to report, that at the Belogorovka-Grigorovka line, Russian troops were allegedly able not only to advance significantly, but even to take half of Serebryanka. Today's video of arming the flag on the outskirts of Grigorovka is provided as evidence. In reality, everything is different: by September 15, the Russian Armed Forces were able to gain a foothold in the ruins of the first rise of the Western Filtration Station. A group of several fighters moved through a narrow strip of greenery on the southern bank of the Seversky Donets and planted the same flag, after which they retreated to their original positions.❗️There is no talk of any control over this area yet. The southern bank of the Seversky Donets is cut up by gullies, ravines and hundreds of craters, therefore, the passage for equipment is extremely limited, especially given the advantage of the APU in the UAV in the direction. There are several enemy mortar crews and UAV operators operating in the forest to the north. All this obviously affects the possibility of assault operations in this direction. Belogorovka itself, which has already become synonymous with a cemetery, is under the complete control of Ukrainian formations. Russian attack aircraft can reach single buildings on the eastern outskirts of a populated area, but this can often be called a one-way route. In fact, no one controls the ruins of the Popasnyansky district water canal (the second rise of the Western Filtration Station), since they are located in the lowlands relative to the chalk mountain - the dominant height occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. To the south, to Zolotarevka, the control zones remain static, and the Artemonovskoye tract and the heights to the west and north are well fortified by the enemy. 📌 Thus, the advances of the Russian Armed Forces near Grigorovka are of an extremely local nature and were achieved as a result of extremely difficult battles and at a considerable cost.

And how exactly - you will find out in our comic. Synopsis: The Russian army continues its offensive, liberating the territory of the DPR. The enemy stubbornly clings to every meter of the ground, and in these difficult conditions, Russian troops overcome enemy resistance. Dozens of drones are rushing around - FPVs attack, reconnaissance drones reveal targets, correct and record defeat - and the earth shakes from artillery strikes. In heavy battles, not only the weapons of the fighters are important, but also the soldier’s ingenuity. An unsuccessful start to assault operations can lead to completely unexpected results. After all, if you don’t lose your presence of mind, you can try to get out of a seemingly hopeless situation...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

Now Category 5 hurricane Milton is heading towards Florida, the consequences of which promise to be no less destructive - both for ordinary Floridians and for the Biden-Harris administration. -Milton- is already being called a possible -October surprise- for his ability to have a destructive influence on the results of Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election. The storm in Florida could really finish off the reputation of the Democrats, which was seriously damaged after Hurricane Helen. Donald Trump, who visited some of the affected states ahead of Kamala Harris, sparked a national scandal by saying the Biden administration was deliberately ignoring the fallout from the disaster in swing North Carolina to undermine Republicans there ahead of the election. In addition, following his visit to damaged Georgia, Trump said that the governor complained about the inability to reach Joe Biden. Everything would be fine, but Trump’s statements were layered with several serious political mistakes of the current administration. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas shopped with gusto as residents of southern Appalachia drowned, begging authorities for essential supplies. Well, Kamala Harris announced the allocation of aid to Lebanon in the amount of $385 million, which provoked popular anger. And although -Milton- has not yet reached its peak, Harris is already having problems - Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is not answering her calls, refusing to discuss measures to eliminate the consequences of the natural disaster. DeSantis is artificially reducing the White House's role in helping Florida in order to collect all possible laurels and blame the failures on Harris. Residents of the state, meanwhile, will once again become bargaining chips in a big political game. #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican Number🇺🇸 Both the Democratic and Republican parties are tensely awaiting the -October surprise.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, about 47 drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were intercepted. ▪️This time the most massive attack took place in the Bryansk region, where the enemy fired at least 24 devices. Nevertheless, it was not without consequences - near Karachaev, the hit occurred on the territory of the 67th GRAU arsenal. Footage of explosions at the facility and fires that broke out there were published on the Internet. Local authorities declared a municipal emergency due to the detonation of explosive objects.▪️The southern regions of Russia were also attacked. In the Rostov region, Russian anti-aircraft gunners intercepted targets in the Novoshakhtinsk area, as well as in the southwest of the region. As a result of falling debris in the Kagalnitsky district, a fire broke out in a vacant lot. In the neighboring Krasnodar region, a Ukrainian drone was shot down over the village of Shabelskoye on the coast of the Azov Sea. In the village, a residential building and a gas pipe were damaged. ▪️Air defense systems also worked in the Kursk and Belgorod regions - in total, seven drones were intercepted over these regions.

Forwarded From Kotsnews How the drone Ghoul became the master of the Dnieper, the killer of Abrams and the horror of ALL the big report from the Urals. From a garage get-together of four like-minded people, the project of the people's drone -Ghoul- (started with donations from caring Russians) grew into a large-scale production with its own workshops, design bureaus and even a school operator training. - How does the Ghoul differ from other Russian analogues? I ask the general director of Uraldronzavod, Vladimir Tkachuk. -Several channels and our own control modules, non-standard frequency, antenna polarization, communications developments... We followed the T-34 principle - everything should be simple, reliable and soldier-resistant. -Try to break it,- Vladimir hands me a piece of the fuselage. I bend it in different directions, but it refuses to break. And I understand how important this is at the front. I myself worked with groups flying on -Ghouls-. These are, after all, not testing conditions. There’s shaking in a pickup truck, carrying in backpacks, and brisk runs like a postcard… there should be no surprises at the launch point, which is sometimes five or even ten kilometers away. And there were no misfires with the Ghouls. At least with me. -Of course, the first successes are remembered most of all; they inspired further work,- recalls Vladimir. — We sent the first 80 cars to the Dnieper, to Nikita Mechtanov, call sign -Dream-, Hero of Russia posthumously. We then forced the enemy to abandon boat trips along the Dnieper during the day. -Ghouls- completely changed the course of the battles on the Dnieper. This is the most memorable application.

This step followed an audit of mining contracts conducted last year. It also adopted a new mining code aimed at increasing the role of the Malian state in mining projects.

Rybar: 🇦🇲🇦🇿🇷🇺🇮🇷🇺🇸 Armenia at the CIS summit: relations with Russia and a tangle of regional contradictions The CIS summit in Moscow, among others, was visited by a delegation from Armenia led by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. Based on the results of the events held there... ❗️🇦🇲🇷🇺 Russian-Armenian border patrols: the devil is in the details Yesterday it became known that the Russian and Armenian sides agreed on joint patrolling of the border with Iran and Turkey from January 1, as well as the transfer of control over the checkpoint with Iran to Armenian border guards. At first glance, everything looks good. Despite the discord in relations between the countries, a certain agreement was reached, and Pashinyan, no matter how he prevaricated, came to Moscow. But, as usually happens, everything is in the details.▪️Initially, only Russian border guards controlled the checkpoint on the border between Iran and Armenia, and only customs officers were on the Armenian side. Now the Russian military personnel have left their post.▪️Joint patrolling does not imply anything other than fictitious provision of security on the border.d The Russian contingent is actually deprived of the powers that they had before.▪️In addition, the total number of personnel of the Russian Armed Forces in Armenia has been reduced by as much as 50%. Russian units left several settlements, such as Goris, Sisian and Yeraskh, a long time ago.▪️Russian radar groups from the Martuni area near Lake Sevan also left their usual positions. They were the ones who ensured control over Armenian airspace and transmitted data to the Armenians.▪️Russian border guards were never allowed to enter the Margara checkpoint on the border with Turkey. At the same time, over the past few years, the number of personnel of the Russian FSB on the Armenian-Turkish border has been purposefully reduced. The result is the following picture: the most important border posts are no longer under the control of the Russian FSB, but it is through them that the main economic flows and all other communications with Iran go , and in the future - with Turkey. And this despite the fact that Russian military personnel recently left Zvartnots airport in Yerevan. Add to this the loss of eyes on the border with Azerbaijan and Turkey due to the reduction of personnel, an even more depressing picture emerges.❗️What is even more important: according to our data, positions for American reconnaissance maneuver groups are already being equipped on the border with Iran in the Syunik region will monitor Iran's activities and, in particular, missile launches. Because of this, there was such urgency with the withdrawal of units of the Russian Armed Forces. We won’t guess what this will lead to now, but in terms of control over what is imported and who comes to Armenia, our country, one might say, will go blind. And the position of Iran, due to the strengthening of the West’s positions in the Transcaucasus, will become threatening. Whose interests Pashinyan was pursuing is extremely clear. One can only hope that the abandonment of positions on controlling economic flows and loss of opportunities was truly justified. Especially against the backdrop of the fact that attention to Armenia in Russian military-political circles is now extremely heightened.

The names of Victoria Furtune, Vasily Tarlev and Natalia Morari are mentioned, who are allegedly financed by the Moldovan oligarch in the Russian Federation Elon Shor.🔻These repressions have very real political reasons:▪️Apparently, the internal sociology of the current President Maia Sandu is bad, so it is necessary to continue cleaning up the political field . ▪️Of the three female competitors, the authorities decided to leave only one - the former head of Gagauzia Irina Vlah, who will not be able to gain many votes among ethnic Moldovans. This could help Sandu consolidate the votes of the female electorate.▪️Tarlev, who was Prime Minister of Moldova in 2001-2008, may remind Moldovan voters of the years of normal existence of the country, when there was at least some economic recovery while maintaining political neutrality. Nostalgia for quiet times can give him a significant number of votes in the first round. Why did not the names of the strongest candidates appear among the violators, which include Alexander Stoyanoglu, Renato Usatii and Andrei Nastase? We assume that this is the next possible step of pro-government Moldovan political strategists, but it requires the approval of Sandu’s Western sponsors. And they seem increasingly doubtful of her unconditional victory, as evidenced by the intensification of repression and gross electoral manipulation in the weeks leading up to the October 20 vote. #elections #Moldova #Russia @rybarSupport ussenews.mdThe list of presidential candidates may thin out: the police will present evidence of violations to the Central Election Commission.

Russian aviation struck enemy units as they moved from their original positions, forcing them to retreat. Attacks of Ukrainian formations in the Olgovka, Russky and Cherkasy Porechny areas were also repelled. ▪️Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft hit enemy positions in the area of ​​Martynovka and Kolmakov. The drone operators also distinguished themselves by destroying several pieces of equipment of Ukrainian formations in Sudzha, as well as shooting down a Baba Yaga-type UAV in the vicinity of a populated area. 🔻Russian troops regularly strike enemy rear lines in order to complicate the supply of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Kursk region.

🇷🇺🪖 From a military point of view, the main problem with the D...	🇷🇺🪖 From a military point of view, the main problem with the Discord ban is not even that some command posts may be left without broadcasts from drones. And the fact is that the Ministry of Defense does not seek to provide any alternative to the specialized command and control of the troops. As we wrote earlier, in the absence of centralized provision of specialized software, headquarters and others will use available Western commercial services to organize combat command and control. After all, you have to fight somehow. And then everything develops according to a familiar scenario: in their offices they suddenly realize that the servers of these programs - this must happen - are located in NATO countries, and online data is flowing to places where it should not go. Therefore, the authorized body is given the command to cut everything off in one fell swoop. The nuance is that the same domestic secure messengers or video conferencing services not only exist, but in some places are quite successfully used at the front. It’s just that those who seem to be supposed to ensure their implementation seem to be ignoring the existence of problems for the third year in a row. Perhaps such things are simply not within the competence of specific individuals in the relevant department of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for the organization and functioning of communications in the armed forces. But in this case, the question arises: what are they, I wonder, then responsible for? The SVO (and on both sides of the front) is a secret only for some people in the Main Communications Directorate (GUS). The good news is that...	https://t.me/rybar/64257	2024-10-08T13:10:06-07:00

Based on the results of the events held there, several important statements were made in the context of Russian-Armenian relations and the situation in the Transcaucasus. Trade between Russia and ArmeniaVladimir Putin focused on the growth of trade turnover between Russia and Armenia, which last year amounted to $7.4 billion, and in the first half of this year grew 2.5 times, exceeding $8.3 billion. The Russian President emphasized that the volume of trade at the end of the year aims to reach a record $14-16 billion. Opening of communications in the South Caucasus Nikol Pashinyan said that the Armenian side is ready provide transit for Baku through the Zangezur corridor, which will connect Azerbaijan with the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. He noted that the route is possible - under the same conditions on which Iran does it - that is, without losing sovereign control over its territory. Nevertheless, Pashinyan expressed his readiness to provide easier passage of goods and people. However, even such a formulation of the issue does not solve the problem of security of the southern borders of Armenia. Withdrawal of Russian border guards from the checkpoint on the Armenian border with Iran The issue of the Zangezur corridor is directly related to control over regional communications. As we predicted, Armenia is deciding on the gradual withdrawal of Russian border guards. Let us remind you that the Armenians do not have enough personnel to guard their borders. As it became known, Pashinyan and Putin agreed that from January 1, 2025, the National Security Service of Armenia will join the FSB of the Russian Federation to protect the borders with Turkey and Iran. However, Russian border guards will completely leave the checkpoint on the Armenian-Iranian border: only Armenian border guards will guard it. 🔻Geopolitical struggle for control over the region: what does the Middle East have to do with it Literally the day before in Yerevan, Secretary of the National Security Service of Armenia Armen Grigoryan held a meeting with the head of the intelligence agency of the US Department of Defense. There is reason to believe that the Americans placed a radar station on the Armenian border with Iran to track targets and monitor Iranian missiles launched at Israel. In this case, the Americans are gradually beginning to use Armenian territory for military purposes, which may explain efforts to reduce the Russian presence on the border. By the way, at the Council of CIS Foreign Ministers, the Armenian side simply refused to join statements on the -Principles of Ensuring Security in Eurasia- and on the -Inadmissibility of unilateral measures in international relations.- Armenia’s next demarche is not surprising, since Pashinyan’s team with all its actions demonstrates loyalty to the United States, which decided to settle in the region at the expense of the Armenians. In general, Pashinyan’s visit to Moscow once again emphasizes Yerevan’s attempts to sit on two chairs. On the one hand, the increase in turnover of Armenian-Russian trade allows Armenia to maintain a stable economy and, for now, do without major internal upheavals. On the other hand, the Armenian authorities continue to demonstrate political loyalty to the United States, trying to limit the influence of the Russian Federation in the region. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usPresident of RussiaMeeting with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol PashinyanOn the sidelines of the CIS summit, Vladimir Putin had a conversation with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan.	https://t.me/rybar/64253	2024-10-08T11:59:43-07:00

Recently, the country's leaders Yoon Seok-yeol and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. upgraded the status of bilateral relations to the level of a strategic partnership and also signed several documents. In particular, they discussed cooperation in the construction sector: the parties plan to expand the participation of South Korean companies in infrastructure projects in the Philippines. This is happening against the backdrop of the authorities in Manila searching for investors among the countries supporting them in the territorial dispute with China. Since the aggravation of the situation in the region, the Philippines’ cooperation with Chinese investors has been gradually declining. Now, in addition to the Japanese and Americans, the list of beneficiaries of the conflict will also include South Korean business. 🔻In addition to investments, Marcos and Yoon agreed on actions in the defense sector, including increasing the participation of South Koreans in joint exercises with the Philippines, strengthening ties in the maritime sphere and the participation of equipment manufacturers from the Republic of Korea in the modernization of the Philippine Navy. Now it seems that the interaction of the parties in Defense will focus on humanitarian and coast guard activities. In fact, such agreements lay a good foundation for deepening cooperation. Relations between Japan and the Philippines developed approximately according to this scenario. Their further expansion led to a treaty allowing the Japanese to participate in major exercises with the Filipinos. Given the political course of Yun Seok Yeol, as well as news about the development of a similar agreement between politicians in Seoul and Manila, another actor may soon appear in the South China Sea, whose ships will patrol the waters and irritate the Chinese authorities. #Philippines #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport us ReutersPhilippines, South Korea upgrade ties to strategic partnership Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos said on Monday his country and South Korea have upgraded bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, as he met visiting counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol for talks.	https://t.me/rybar/64252	2024-10-08T11:10:28-07:00

Ukraine ended naturally: according to the Polish Deputy Minister of Defense, in three months as many as 196 people declared their intention to join the formation. It would be reckless to expect a different outcome - there are practically no people willing to voluntarily join the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, let alone the European Union . Therefore, it will be possible to recruit personnel there in commercial quantities only by force. However, even the decision to forcefully mobilize Ukrainians living in Europe is unlikely to lead to the result expected by the Kyiv regime. On the one hand, this is not so easy to implement even from an organizational point of view. On the other hand, the level of desertion in such a legion will be much higher than average.

🇹🇼🇨🇳 Not a week goes by without the appearance of analytical ...	🇹🇼🇨🇳 Not a week goes by without the appearance in the media of analytical articles and forecasts about the attack of the Chinese army on Taiwan. However, for some reason, the analysis of other measures that the PRC authorities can take to achieve the desired result often remains behind the scenes. Thus, experts from the American think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies predict that it will not be a military invasion that will lead to the reunification of the island with the mainland. According to a new report, the most likely scenario is economic pressure on Taiwan. 🔻Based on the modeling results, analysts claim that Beijing may, for example, ban the import of agricultural products from the island, massively sell shares of Taiwanese companies, and freeze payments between mainland and Chinese banks. And, of course, the list does not end there. Due to the ongoing economic ties between Taiwan and the PRC, citizens living on the island will feel the full consequences of such measures. This could lead to discontent, under pressure from which Taipei must agree to negotiations with the Chinese authorities. But a much more interesting point is the recommendations that experts give to the Taiwanese administration to avoid such a scenario. In addition to calls for a change in export direction, analysts have suggested moving Taiwanese business and production to other countries, such as the United States. 📌 It is obvious that such proposals are more in line with the interests of the Americans than the Taiwanese. They also reflect the current policy to attract foreign companies to the States, including Taiwanese enterprises. These recommendations reflect the essence of the American approach to the Taiwan issue in practice, which is the desire to make as much money as possible from a conflict that has not even begun. And intensifying the Chinese threat and inflating it in the media is precisely what helps the United States achieve what it wants. #China #Taiwan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usFDDTargeting Taiwan-The complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and it will definitely be fulfilled, - declared Xi Jinping on the 110th anniversary of the Chinese Revolution of 1911, underscoring Taiwan's reintegration into China as a core element of its…	https://t.me/rybar/64250	2024-10-08T09:17:16-07:00

Ukraine. The delivery of about 200 units of this type was agreed upon in May of this year. Based on the characteristic features, our OSINT team was able to determine the location of the platform from which the filming was carried out: the footage was taken in the Czech city of Usti nad Labi on the border with Germany, from where the train arrived with equipment. These armored personnel carriers are not the latest development of the Swedish military-industrial complex, originally from the 60s, so at the moment they are considered obsolete. However, on both sides of the front you can also find more rare examples of weapons from the Cold War era. Also, Swedish engineers periodically modified their Pansarbandvagn 302, retrofitting them with AT-4 anti-tank grenade launchers and RBS-56 ATGM systems - they will probably also be transferred to Ukrainian formations. The train itself will most likely head to Poland, from where it will arrive in Lviv by rail through Krakow. a route that has been tried and tested for a long time.

The purpose of the event is to practice actions for the defense of Malaysia and Singapore. Therefore, in addition to ground forces units, the training also involves the air forces and naval ships of five states. Such maneuvers take place every year, so they can hardly be called a response to the latest Chinese activity in the region. This is also indicated by the area where they will take place - most of them are located in those areas of the South China Sea where the Chinese authorities do not claim territory. The composition of the participants in the exercises also does not look fundamentally strange or unusual. In particular, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Malaysia and Singapore have been participating in the Five-Party Defense Agreement since the Cold War. 📌 And although its main purpose is the defense of the two countries mentioned, this treaty was created largely to preserve the remnants of the British military presence in Southeast Asia. Until recently, very little was said about it, but recently the media have begun to write about it more and more often. The Five-Party Defense Agreement itself is not directed against the PRC. However, given the importance of the region for Chinese trade, as well as the position of Great Britain and Australia regarding Chinese military activity in the South China Sea, this format in the future could become another force creating problems for the authorities in Beijing.

At the same time, on the northern front, the front is gradually approaching Kupyansk.▪️In the Sinkovka area, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in the forest to the west of the settlement, where, if successful, they will be able to reach the outskirts of Petropavlovka - an important stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the eastern approaches to Kupyansk.▪️To the south, Russian troops improved the tactical situation in the area of ​​Kislovka and Stepova Novoselovka. The last settlement was considered liberated for a long time, however, footage of attacks on Ukrainian Armed Forces positions in its vicinity published on the Internet indicate a lack of physical control of the Russian Armed Forces over it. Moreover, in fact, the village exists very conditionally - even before the start of the Northern Military District, its population was no more than 20 people. The offensive in this area is supported by crews of the TOS-1 -Solntsepek- flamethrower systems, inflicting significant losses on the enemy in manpower.▪️West of Peschany, Russian troops overcome the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the Kolesnikovka-Kruglyakovka line, driving a wedge deeper and deeper into the enemy’s formations. Today, the assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are located less than four kilometers from the Oskol riverbed, access to which will make it possible to physically cut the O-21-19-42 and R-79 highways. In this case, the Ukrainian Armed Forces group on the left bank will be cut up, which will complicate its supply. Also, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a series of attacks to expand the zone of control: to the north-west of Tabaevka, attack aircraft knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several strong points, and to the south of the village they cleared the territory of Berestovoy.▪️Russian Aerospace Forces aircraft regularly operate against targets in Kupyansk, hitting temporary deployment points and Ammunition depots of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian troops are also actively attacking pontoon crossings - eight attacks have been recorded on them over the past three weeks. To maintain communication across the river, Ukrainian formations create sand embankments, which also become targets of attacks by the Russian Armed Forces. Thus, three air strikes were carried out on two crossings in the area of ​​​​Kupyansk and Kupyansk-Uzlovoy over the past four days. At least one example speaks to the intensity of the destruction of such objects: recently a video appeared on the Internet of the destruction of an armored vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by Lancet at one of the recently restored crossings, and today it was again destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.

President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev put forward an initiative to organize a Regional Center for the widespread introduction of water-saving technologies in Central Asia in cooperation with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). ▪️Later, the President took part in a meeting of the AIIB Board of Governors. Since its founding, the Bank has invested more than $3 billion in projects in Uzbekistan. ▪️Uzbekistan has also begun implementing large projects to save 15 billion cubic meters of water by increasing water use efficiency by 25% in the next five years.▪️Despite the fact that the AIIB is not solely a Chinese bank (in addition to China, India also owns large shares in the management, Russia, South Korea, Australia, as well as a number of the largest EU countries), its headquarters is located in Beijing and decisions on financing certain projects are made there. 🔻Apparently, China is not going to wait for the American water strategy to bear fruit. Mirziyoyev, who was hosting the Bank's retreat in Samarkand (and for the first time in Central Asia), also did not fail to take advantage of the chance for productive cooperation with Beijing. Like Russia, China is not interested in water conflicts in the region that would undermine its logistics strategy.

Another task he named was the reset of relations with the EU and the United States, as well as European integration. The statements illustrate the course of the authorities in Tbilisi - to remain in the orbit of influence of the collective West, but not to participate in its adventures and to benefit from cooperation with Russia. As part of this, they are precisely fighting the radically pro-Western opposition, including through the law on foreign agents. Another thing is that in Washington and Brussels such initiatives are treated without enthusiasm, and improvement of relations with Russia is even less acceptable. The White House has already hinted to the ruling Georgian party that no one will so easily put up with such independence and deviations from the foreign policy line of the West.📌 In these conditions, the question of what the US and EU will ultimately do in putting pressure on the current Georgian authorities. There is no particular doubt about the attempts to instigate street protests by the opposition during the elections, but there is a high probability that this will not be the end of the matter. And we are not just talking about direct sanctions: the same European bureaucrats, for example, can suspend aid to Georgia or revoke the status of a candidate for EU membership.

Earlier, the President of the Fifth Republic, Emmanuel Macron, announced the delivery of five aircraft of this type. According to Lecornu, the aircraft are currently being equipped with electronic warfare and air-to-surface weapons at the Air Force Combat Training Center (CEAE) in the city of Cazeau. The latter clearly means SCALP-EG cruise missiles and AASM aerial bombs. On the one hand, sending Mirages will increase the potential of the Ukrainian Air Force, which has sagged for almost three years. On the other hand, the emergence of a new type of machine will cause familiar problems of the zoo-aviation equipment, which will significantly complicate the maintenance and operation of the machines. By the way, representatives of the Ukrainian Armed Forces themselves pointed this out. Well, the bottleneck for the air force is the so-called. Ukraine still has a shortage of flight and engineering personnel, especially given the loss of the lion's share of experienced pilots in 2022-2024.

🖼 🇮🇷🇸🇾🇹🇷 On the prospects for destabilizing the situation ...	🇮🇷🇸🇾🇹🇷 On the prospects for destabilizing the situation in Syria The Iranian government publication Tasnim, citing sources in Syria, reports that pro-Turkish formations in the Idlib de-escalation zone are preparing to intensify battles against the Syrian government. According to the Iranians, militants of the Hayat Tahrir groups al-Sham, the Syrian National Army and other factions have agreed with the Israeli government to conduct simultaneous operations against the backdrop of fighting in Lebanon. Another potential front against the Syrian leadership is the southern regions of Syria. We are talking about the provinces of Daraa, Quneitra and Es-Suwayda, where the Druze live, creating unrest in southern Syria in recent months.🔻According to our data, work has been going on in Es-Suwayda since the spring to create an armed tribal council, which may be involved in the future against the government, and funding is provided by coalition forces.▪️As ​​for the Idlib zone, the evacuation of local residents has begun from the outskirts of An-Neirab, Afes and Kafr Nuran, and near the government Serakib, militants are actively equipping positions of anti-tank systems, mortar and artillery crews. In addition, , mobile air defense systems were supplied to terrorists from Turkish territory. If you remember who has been carrying out airstrikes on the positions of gangs for several months now, then you can guess against whom.▪️In the same row we can include increasingly confident evidence of the partial restoration of the combat potential of the Islamic State, which in recent years has been hiding in the Syrian deserts and no, no, yes attacked on the sly, demonstrating their capabilities. In addition, we must not forget the rumors about the recent escape of terrorists from a Kurdish-guarded prison in Al-Baghuz. This fact was not widely publicized on the Internet, but if you remember previous years, militants fled from Kurdish-American guards more than once.▪️Well, the icing on the cake is that the Americans in the Al-Tanf zone intensified their preparations in these two years tame militants (former special forces group -Magavir al-Saura-) to conduct local operations in urban areas. Moreover, this was done secretly, and where the militants left after is a mystery.❗️Now imagine what will happen if suddenly all these forces in Syria, from Druze protesters to IS militants, begin simultaneous actions against the Syrian government and Iran and Russia supporting it ?Of course, all this looks like a conspiracy theory, but the question arises: who oversaw the Islamic State during the war in Syria and Iraq? Who is behind -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- and -Syrian Democratic Forces-? Who is influencing the Syrian Druze? In terms of consequences, such a complex operation will not only put an end to any prospects for the normalization of life in Syria, but will also jeopardize the Russian presence in the country.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are gradually advancing into Lyubimovka, a key enemy transport hub in the north of the Korenevsky district. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, battles were noted on the approaches to Vesyoly. Ukrainian formations are not abandoning attempts to physically cut off highway 38N-052 east of the village, but enemy attacks are repelled by units of the Russian Armed Forces. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops repelled an attack by an armored group of Ukrainian formations towards Obukhovka. During the battle, the enemy lost one infantry fighting vehicle and a group of infantry, while Russian troops captured the banner of one of the Ukrainian Armed Forces units. ❗️The route of movement of enemy units allows us to say that the neighboring Pokrovsky farm is currently under the control of Ukrainian formations. ▪️To the north, the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions on Srednyaya Street in Lyubimovka. At the same time, the ownership of the forest belts adjacent to the street remains in question due to the lack of objective control personnel. Also on the main street of the village, UAV operators destroyed a Roshel Senator armored car abandoned by the enemy crew. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched attacks in the area of ​​Cherkasy Porechny and Plekhovo, all of them were repelled by the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, Russian aviation hit the rear infrastructure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Sudzha, Cossack Lokna and Staraya Sorochina. 🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed an enemy ammunition warehouse located in one of the buildings south of Osoevka.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Zaporozhye direction: the offensive of Russian troops...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Zaporizhzhya direction: offensive of Russian troops in the Kamensky area situation towards the end of October 7, 2024 In the Zaporozhye direction, the past 24 hours were marked by an intensification of attacks by the Russian Armed Forces on the eastern bank of the former Kakhovka reservoir. The sector, which had remained static for a long time, began to move, which could create new difficulties for the enemy experiencing an operational crisis on the Donbass front. ▪️Russian troops managed to push through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Kamenskoye, entering the village both along the bank of the former reservoir and through the bed of the Yanchekrak River. At the same time, part of the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was isolated by attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces, after which the remnants of the enemy on them were destroyed by groups of the second echelon. It is noteworthy that in the video that appeared on the Internet, Russian military personnel are moving towards the enemy position from the north. This may indicate that already at that time the front line had advanced deeper into the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Separately, it is worth noting the high efficiency of UAV units, which suppressed firing points and observation posts of Ukrainian formations, as well as exposed weak points in the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This allowed Russian troops to advance into low-rise buildings without significant resistance. ❗️At the same time, it is too early to talk about consolidating the RF Armed Forces in the achieved positions - there are no objective control shots indicating this. At the moment, the enemy is transferring reserves to the site to stop the successes of Russian troops and strengthen the defense lines. ▪️The Zaporozhye direction was static for quite a long time, and some of its sections did not appear in the media field for more than a year. The main fighting here took place in the area of ​​​​Pyatikhatki and Rabotino - the sites of fierce battles of last year's unsuccessful counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Nevertheless, the intensification of offensive actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kamensky area allows us to speak about the intentions of the Russian command, if not to achieve a deep breakthrough of the front in the direction, then at least to achieve significant tactical successes. 🔻In light of the operations being prepared by the enemy in the Energodar area, which we wrote about earlier, the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces may be aimed at disrupting preparations for their conduct. Units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, withdrawn to rear areas for training and replenishment, can be involved in repelling the attack, which will allow Russian troops to eliminate the threat to an important section of the southern front. It is likely that in the near future we will see attacks by Russian troops similar to Kamensky, aimed at the weakest places defense of Ukrainian formations, -relaxed- from the long calm on the southern front. Moreover, there are many such quiet places in this direction.

🇨🇳🇵🇰🏴 Another terrorist attack occurred in Pakistan yesterda...	🇨🇳🇵🇰🏴 Another terrorist attack occurred in Pakistan yesterday. A powerful explosion occurred in the administrative center of Sindh province and also the largest port of Pakistan in Karachi. The detonation occurred on the highway near Jinnah International Airport as a result of a collision between a fuel tanker and a car with an explosive device installed on it. As a result, three people were killed and 11 others were injured varying degrees of severity. Two of the dead are Chinese citizens whose companies operate in Karachi. Responsibility was claimed by militants from one of the branches of the banned separatist group - the Baluchistan Liberation Army - - the Majid Brigade.🔻The relationship between the Baloch separatists with the government and, in particular, China, certainly cannot be called stable. For many years, the Baloch have been carrying out terrorist attacks against Chinese citizens and companies. Due to the actively developing cooperation between Pakistan and China, in which the Chinese are issuing huge loans and investing a lot of money in the development of the CPEC economic corridor, Balochistan is being developed by enterprises from the Middle Kingdom. And local groups, in addition aspirations for independence, oppose Chinese expansion. Similar terrorist attacks occur over and over again in the troubled province.📌 Pakistani authorities, as expected, condemned the terrorist attack. For Pakistan, China is the main economic partner, thanks to which the economy stays afloat, so the security of their investments is paramount for them. But Islamabad is simply unable to solve the problem. Local operations and strikes are carried out, but only to create visibility. A full-fledged war with the Baloch is not only unaffordable, but also useless. It will be something like the -sluggish- Turkish fight against the Kurds. It will be like that now. To reassure the Chinese partners of their serious intentions, the authorities will probably conduct another counter-terrorism operation along the border with Iran and Afghanistan.❗️But the Pakistanis have practically no time for this. In almost a week, Pakistan will host the SCO summit, which, by the way, the Baloch separatists threatened to disrupt. , which is scheduled for October 15-16 in Pakistan.📌 So what, but the Baloch separatists can really do this.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Admiral Kostyukov With the outbreak of war, his department faced the biggest challenge in its history since the Second World War. Having recovered from mistakes and changed approaches to intelligence work, today the abbreviation GRU again inspires fear and respect among Russia’s principled opponents around the world. Kostyukov continues to process and make decisions every day on a various range of issues, but strategic intelligence remains his exclusive prerogative: he personally supervised the withdrawal and exchange of Russian intelligence officers through the GRU, and also, together with specialists in operational legends, managed to develop non-trivial forms of operational cover, which allowed Russian military intelligence to multiply their efforts after striking attacks against legal stations. Largely thanks to the actions of GRU officers in regions with the most difficult operational situations, the Russian army today receives samples of modern UAVs, and the amount of primary information received and processed is constantly growing. However, the main problem still remains the interaction of the linear units of the center with services on the ground , as well as the rejection by combined arms commanders of the KRC and SPN officers, but it seems that Igor Kostyukov was able to find a solution to the eternal problem of perception of mentalities and this solution bears the name of Lieutenant General Alekseev. Lieutenant General Alekseev Few people know what feelings Vladimir Stepanovich actually experienced , when in January of this year an unprecedented action was carried out against him, during which they wanted to remove the chief of staff of the GRU from his post and erase him forever, but he held on and again proved to everyone that intelligence is immortal. Being a simple product of military intelligence, Alekseev never did not organically come into contact with intelligence work, but always remained a part of the infantry commanders, and this factor began to play a decisive role in critical days for the RF Armed Forces. With the outbreak of war, the chief of staff of the GRU fell on the entire burden of conducting operational reconnaissance and conducting operations on the territory of Ukraine. When the Russian army was critically short of people, Alekseev came up with a way to unite scattered volunteers along the entire line of contact, creating a volunteer assault corps under the auspices of the GRU, which today includes about 30 BARS. By confusing the enemy and without violating the norms of federal legislation, Alekseev managed to create a fundamentally new system of army recruitment, which became known as Redut, but not everyone appreciated this decision. All year Alekseev was under pressure: this was due to both professional competition and personal envy - in realizing their political ambitions, these people did not hesitate to resort to the dirtiest tricks, using the resources of the enemy, which we, for our part, tried to actively counteract. Alekseev himself, since the time of the assault on Bakhmut, has had impeccable authority among ordinary military men: he is not afraid to appear on the front line and wears insignia, so many servicemen of the SPN brigades, as well as corps volunteers, respect him. Alekseev knows a lot, but remains silent. Recently, he has been moved away from administrative and economic activities and therefore he has focused all his efforts on work in the UGA, which this year has increased both in analytical and operational work: the increased number of equipment struck in the depths of Ukrainian territories is striking, has increased significantly satellite reconnaissance capabilities, which is confirmed online by means of objective control. Today, when the Russian army has the strategic initiative, it is critically important for the UGA command not to lose contact on the ground with ordinary field commanders who are fighting for the future of Russia. Alekseev remains one of the few who maintain this connection and tries to increase it. Art in high resolution @arbat	https://t.me/rybar/64227	2024-10-07T10:15:37-07:00

At the same time, he believes that the amount of money allocated to fight the terrorist group will be stolen without even leaving the region. ❗️But the problem of sending militants from Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia and Kosovo and Metohija to the Middle East, as well as the problem of their return to the region and the organization of sleeper cells in Europe, is more acute than ever. But the authorities of the self-proclaimed republic are not going to solve it. 📌But it was the Kosovo Albanians who first massively joined the ranks of the terrorists Jabhat al-Nusra in 2012, and then formed the basis of the Jemati Alban group. Upon returning to their homeland, Kosovo terrorists, as a rule, receive formal sentences: for example, Fitim Ladrovtsi returned from an IS training camp, served a couple of years, and then, as if nothing had happened, continued to agitate local residents for war with the infidels. 🔻We have already paid attention to how the Western press has recently extolled the threat from the Afghan branch of the Islamic State - Vilayat Khorasan -, scaring the countries of Europe and Central Asia with it, but at the same time clearly underestimating the seriousness of the threat of the group’s revival in Syria.

Back in July, the authorities tightened conditions for foreign companies. However, at a meeting between Traore and Nordgold management, the parties discussed preferences for Russian business. Then Russian Ambassador Igor Martynov emphasized that the restrictions would not affect Russians, and cooperation would be accompanied by increased security at the mines. This is definitely a positive signal: for a long time, the cream of military success in the Sahel went to Western companies.

🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 Where the Israel Defense Forces can strike - Rybar's ...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 Where the Israel Defense Forces can hit - Rybar's analysis On the Internet, gossip continues about what objects the Israelis will hit if such a decision is made. There are already maps and a description of why and for what purpose Israel should do this.🔻The main emphasis of various media is on nuclear infrastructure facilities in Iran. There are four largest facilities in this area in Iran. Five, if you count it together with the military research complex in Parchin. The most important of them, of course, is the nuclear research complex in Netenz, where the uranium enrichment plant is located and all the main tests in the field of peaceful atom are carried out. This facility has already become the target of an Israeli terrorist attack in April 2021. Then one of the buildings was blown up, but after some time the center resumed functioning in full.▪️In addition, in the spring of 2022, Iran was beset by a series of strange deaths of high-ranking IRGC officers, as well as scientists associated with Iran’s nuclear program. One of these was a nuclear scientist from the laboratory in Netenz. At the same time, a Quds Force soldier, who was responsible for the production of warheads at the complex in Parchin, died. The Israeli media called Parchin the place where missiles were equipped with a nuclear warhead.🔻Another option, which for some reason everyone forgets about, is the oil refining industry, on the export of products in which the Islamic Republic’s economy, and therefore the well-being of the people, depends. The loss of one or more large Refineries, such as those in Abadan or Shiraz, can have more fatal consequences from a domestic perspective. The protests of 2022 in this situation may seem like flowers. Due to sanctions pressure, high inflation and popular discontent, the protest potential remains at a high level. If the situation changes seriously for the worse, everything can suddenly flare up again. 🔻Of course, these are not the only targets that the Israelis can choose to strike. There are both military and government facilities that can give the desired political effect, especially if the Israeli response is staged. At the same time, the Israelis need to take into account both the Iranian preparations for strikes and the fact that attacks on facilities such as the Bushehr nuclear power plant will entail consequences not only for Iran, but also for the entire Middle East due to the proximity of the nuclear power plant to the Persian Gulf.❗️Therefore, it is impossible to say unequivocally that one or another target will be chosen. And Iranians should certainly be prepared for any, even the most daring scenarios, since the Israeli media is accelerating the narrative about Iran testing nuclear weapons at the Semnan test site. Recently, an earthquake of 4.4 points was recorded at the test site of the IRGC aerospace forces, which many associated specifically with the test Nuclear weapons. However, we hasten to inform you that such tremors are now being observed throughout the region due to the movement of plates, including the Iranian one. If you look at the monitoring resources that track seismic activity, tremors are observed from Turkey to China. So at the moment, statements about testing nuclear weapons in Iran look far-fetched.

However, this phrase was followed by -but-. The Romanian prime minister said that -Russia is not a guarantee for Moldova- and -will lead the republic to isolation and poverty.- While Romania and the EU are about -security and development-. ▪️Colaku, in order not to spoil Sandu’s election race, even softened his rhetoric towards Moldovans, calling them -brothers-, and Moldova just -a neighboring state-, and not part of -Greater Romania-. Recently, the politician was distinguished by harsh statements about the lack of identity of Moldovans and language, and called his origin from the historical region of Moldova -offensive-. ▪️Colaku also held a meeting in Chisinau with the head of the Bessarabian Metropolis of the Romanian Church, Metropolitan Peter (Paduraru), to whom the Romanian government provides financial and political support. ▪️According to Ciolaku, citizens of both countries need a spiritual connection, which can only be achieved through the church.▪️ Let us recall that the Metropolis of Bessarabia, with the support of the authorities of Romania and Moldova, is waging a political struggle with the Metropolis of Moldova, a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church. ▪️And although Sandu stated that she had good relations with both metropolises, the president not long ago called the Moldavian metropolitanate a relay of Russian propaganda and a threat to the country. 🔻The visit of Romanian Prime Minister Colacu to Chisinau apparently completes a series of trips by Western leaders to Moldova to express support for Sandu’s candidacy in the October 20 presidential elections. However, in the case of Romania, it is obvious that after Sandu’s re-election, Bucharest will continue an aggressive attack on Moldovan sovereignty. In particular, we should expect the approach of a church schism, which they decided to postpone in connection with the elections. #EU #Moldova #Russia #Romania #church @rybarSupport usRFICiolacu, la Chișinău: Rusia nu este nicio garanție pentru R.Moldova și va duce țara în izolare.

Judging by the lack of detailed information about the work of air defense over the populated areas of Crimea, the drones were shot down either in the coastal strip or over the sea.▪️The enemy also used two ATACMS operational-tactical missiles, which were fired from the territory of the Kherson region. The target was the oil depot of JSC - Marine Oil Terminal - in Feodosia, which was hit.▪️ Two explosions were recorded on the territory of the facility, at least five tanks with flammable substances were damaged - two of them were destroyed. At the moment, the fire is being extinguished; significant resources of local emergency services have been involved in it. ❗️A video from a drone is also being actively distributed on the Internet, demonstrating the destruction on the territory of the oil depot. Presumably, it was removed by Emergency Situations Ministry employees to assess the damage and plan further actions to eliminate the fire. Its appearance in the public domain once again demonstrates the gap in the information security of local services. How and why the enemy quickly received footage of the results of his strike is an open question.▪️To ensure the safety of citizens, local authorities blocked Fedko and Geologicheskaya streets, and train traffic on the section from Feodosia to Vladislavovka was also temporarily suspended. At the moment, the city is in a man-made emergency mode, and therefore two temporary accommodation points have been deployed. At least three casualties are known as a result of the enemy attack, but no deaths were reported. In Feodosia, power outages were also recorded, but there was no information about damage to energy facilities. 🔻False statements about the evacuation of the population in the urban district of Feodosia and a possible fuel shortage in Crimea are being spread in the media space. In fact, at the moment there are no more than two dozen people in temporary accommodation centers, and no interruptions in the supply of petroleum products have been recorded either.❗️Nevertheless, the choice of the oil depot, which is the largest in Crimea, is not accidental. The goal, as in the rest of Russia, is extremely simple: to cause a fuel shortage not only on the peninsula, but also in other regions. And we must not forget that today is Vladimir Putin’s birthday. This is the date on which the enemy and his curators are trying to carry out large-scale attacks, as happened a couple of years ago on the Crimean Bridge. So the activation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Black Sea direction today is probably not the last.

The general accused the ambassador of -undiplomatic- behavior, without specifying what exactly he meant by this term. If there is no apology today, then the Ugandan authorities, according to Kainerugaba, will demand his departure. The general’s claims were a response to US sanctions against four Ugandan police officers on charges of human rights violations and torture. In addition, in September, several high-ranking Ugandan officials faced American sanctions. In Uganda, this is associated precisely with the activities of Ambassador Popp, who took office just in September. The context in this situation is interesting: most recently, Muhoozi Kainerugaba announced his intention to participate in the presidential elections in 2026, but in September announced that he would not run, preferring the support of 80-year-old Museveni. However, many consider him a potential successor. The general is actively building up political capital, skillfully using anti-colonial Pan-African rhetoric, strengthening ties with the Russian Federation and China, and creating the image of an independent leader ready to resist Western pressure.#Africa #Russia #Uganda@rybarSupport usKampalapostGen Kainerugaba Gives US Ambassador Ultimatum: Apologize or Leave | The Kampala PostGeneral Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Uganda's Chief of Defense Forces, has issued a stern warning to the current US Ambassador, stating that if the ambassador does not apologize personally to President Yoweri Museveni by Monday morning at 9:00 am for his -undiplomatic…	https://t.me/rybar/64218	2024-10-07T05:21:58-07:00
🔁 Espionage, attempts to influence the domestic Russian agenda, ...	Forwarded From Andrey Lugovoy. State DumaEspionage, attempts to influence the domestic Russian agenda, provoking social tension... It would seem, how does all this relate to the study of xenophobia problems and human rights activities? Rybar reported details of the work of the information and analytical center -Sova-, which has long been recognized as a foreign agent. Human rights activists, as they call themselves, were engaged in teaching Russian society a tolerant attitude towards migration, working on the tasks of provoking internal conflicts in Russia. That is, after this Russophobic office collected invoices for foreign intelligence services at rallies of non-systemic opposition, spoke out against the SVO, its leader was thrown out of the Human Rights Council - they safely continue their subversive activities. The list of their sponsors is not surprising either. Based on the British Foreign Office documents leaked in 2021, it turned out that -Sova- worked under the patronage of the Article19 organization, which in turn received financial support from Western states and organizations. This year, Article19, which promotes, among other things, the abolition of the article for discrediting the army, was recognized as undesirable in the Russian Federation. The donors include the Soros Foundation, the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, which called for not recognizing the elections to the State Duma, and other long-familiar haters of Russia. Thus, human rights activists received 5.5 million rubles from the Foreign Office to combat -incitement of hatred towards the LGBT community.- That is, the British, Norwegians and other Westerners also pay them for instilling intolerance towards our traditional values. Despite the fact that in 2023 the legal entity ROO Center -Sova- was liquidated by a court decision, they still operate, but as a human rights research center -SOVA-. Although, given their 20 years of Russophobic experience, it is appropriate to call them not human rights activists, but a center of Russophobia. It turns out that at home the Anglo-Saxons are taking draconian measures to stop the British rebellion against the dominance of migrants. And here they want to create the same hell: to shake up the situation, catching up with illegal immigrants through the use of controlled NGOs. The interference of the Britons in the internal affairs of Russia, their launch of Russophobic projects must be stopped. And as the recent expulsion of British spies who supervised foreign agents showed, work in this direction is underway.➡️@lugovoyandrey | 💬Discuss in the chatTelegramRybar🇬🇧🇷🇺🖇 Protecting terrorists and illegals: what does the Owl center do in the Russian Federation with money from the British crown?

The Neustrashimy ship is the lead ship in Project 11540 Yastreb and is capable of performing a wide range of missions: from anti-submarine defense to striking surface targets and supporting amphibious operations. His participation in the first such festival in the last five years attracted a lot of attention from South Africans. In general, for South Africa, participation in such an event is more than just a display of military equipment. This is a signal that the country is ready to demonstrate an independent foreign policy and actively participate in the affairs of BRICS. And China's economic influence plays a key role here. According to various estimates, South Africa's debt to China is about 4% of GDP, and Chinese investments in energy and logistics infrastructure amount to billions of dollars. But not everyone likes it: South Africa’s rapprochement with China is drawing criticism from Western countries and the local opposition. However, the South African leadership clearly understands that maintaining neutrality in the current confrontation between Russia and China with the collective West is the key to economic stability and the possibility of obtaining new loans.#Africa #Russia #South Africa@rybarSupport usBusiness Insider AfricaRussian warship makes an impression at South Africa's naval paradeThe Russian frigate Neustrashimy made an appearance in South Africas naval parade	https://t.me/rybar/64216	2024-10-07T04:12:58-07:00

This is a good reason to remember that under his leadership Russia has already gone through several difficult historical stages, and the key leitmotif of recent years has been the protection of sovereignty and strengthening the country’s defense capability. Today, Russia is more active than ever before in modern history in declaring its rights in the international arena. At the same time, Putin’s personal initiative played a key role in coming forward and challenging our opponents, with whom many would prefer to continue to negotiate. And despite all the challenges and restrictions, Russia continues to develop economically, which is certainly the key to a stable and prosperous society.

Forwarded From Warrior DVDTwo majors publish footage of the successful assault on Zolotaya Niva by the assault group of the 40th Guards Marine Brigade. The assault on the village began yesterday morning with the support of artillery and the active work of drone pilots. By the end of October 6, the village was virtually freed from the presence of the enemy. As of this morning, several more boys are hanging out in the forest belt to the southwest of the population, but this will not last long. We would like to once again note the competent work of both the attack aircraft themselves and the drone pilots of the 40th Guards. The latter managed to destroy 3 units of enemy evacuation equipment in less than a day, knock out a very rare M577, and with dense strikes drive away an enemy tank platoon that was coming from Shakhterskoye. We also managed to knock out one infantry fighting vehicle, and the second was also forced to advance in the opposite direction.

🖼 🇰🇿☢️ About the results of the referendum on nuclear power pl...	🇰🇿☢️ About the results of the referendum on nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan On Sunday, October 7, a nationwide referendum was held on the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan. The turnout was 63.07% in the country and 81.06% when voting abroad. The majority - 71.12%, according to preliminary calculations of the Central Election Commission of the Republic of Kazakhstan - spoke in favor, which will allow the Republic of Kazakhstan to use the possibilities of the peaceful atom. 📌The referendum itself passed calmly yesterday. In the morning, all the officials, from the head of the Ministry of Energy to the Minister of Culture, and even the first President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, came to vote after the country’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. ▪️It is interesting that before the referendum, Western NGOs (and, first of all, USAID) tried to distance themselves as much as possible from the self-created headquarters of opponents of the nuclear power plant, trying to blame everything on the fugitive corrupt official, oligarch and organizer of the contract killing, Mukhtar Ablyazov. The odious -investigators- from Bellingcat even taught a lesson to Kazakh journalists and helped -connect- the headquarters activists with the failed opposition party -Alga, Kazakhstan-, connected to Ablyazov by the same sources of income.▪️The second no less interesting touch was the absence of OSCE observers (who referred to their too busy schedule) and in general any observers from organizations of the countries of the enlightened West - and this despite the fact that a delegation of the European Social and Economic Committee was in the country. ▪️A few days before the referendum on the nuclear power plant, it became known that observers would only be from the CIS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Organization of Turkic States and the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. At the same time, for some reason, traditional parliamentary observation institutions such as the CIS IPA and the TurkPA were absent from the referendum, which also reduced the positive effect of international monitoring of the vote.🔻So if the referendum was intended as a demonstration to Western partners of the victory of democracy in Kazakhstan separately, then the West’s response has become an ignorance that leaves a loophole for challenging the results of the people's will, if such a need arises. #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64204	2024-10-07T00:59:01-07:00

The ISS motivated the bans by the high level of misinformation on the listed sites. ▪️In addition, the Moldovan media report bans on showing the most popular Russian-language cartoons - Smeshariki - and - Three Cats -, which is associated with the authorities’ demand to limit television content in Russian. ▪️Journalists have already called Moldovan children the most discriminated against part of the population due to the ban on cartoons.

At the same time, the bans on Russian cartoons are organically connected with the impending vote, because the pro-Romanian authorities, after re-election, will strengthen the trend to fight the Russian language and will do their best to separate the younger generation from the cultural influence of Russia.

In addition to the southern suburbs of Beirut, Tripoli, the country’s second largest city, came under fire for the first time since the beginning of the escalation. In the border zone, IDF units continue raids on the Kafr Kila-Al-Adisa and Yarun-Aitarun borders. At the same time, the presence of Israeli troops in the center of Yarun, where a large mosque was blown up, is confirmed. The Israelis also attacked several targets in northwestern Syria. In Homs, an Israeli drone attacked a car, and near the border of Al-Qusayr, it hit targets involved in smuggling into Lebanon. And The Washington Post published an article according to which Israeli intelligence in 2015 introduced booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies with a device for listening to conversations of Hezbollah members into Lebanon.

The most resonant hits occurred in Deir al-Balah, where two schools and one mosque were destroyed. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids, detaining several dozen local residents on charges of links to Hamas. The most violent clashes occurred in Tubas. In the south of Israel, another terrorist attack occurred in Beersheba - there, at the central bus station, a resident of a Bedouin settlement attacked an IDF soldier and opened fire on passers-by with her weapon.

🖼 ❗️🇮🇱🇵🇸 Battle for Jabaliya: the beginning of a new IDF ope...	❗️🇮🇱🇵🇸 Battle for Jabaliya: the start of a new IDF operation Situation as of 19:00 October 6, 2024 In the north of the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops began another ground operation in Jabaliya. Prior to this, IDF units operated in the settlement in May - then they occupied the southeastern part of the camp in three weeks, after which they left the settlement, reporting the destruction of terrorist infrastructure and the elimination of Hamas militants. The IDF press service associated the new offensive with the receipt of intelligence information about the restoration of Hamas' combat potential in the populated area. At the same time, the operation involved the forces of 162 divisions, which were transferred from the territory of the border - Philadelphia corridor - in the south of the Palestinian enclave. ▪️In the morning, the IDF press service announced the evacuation from the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Residents were advised to leave their homes and travel south to the expanded humanitarian zone. Meanwhile, Hamas tried to prevent the evacuation of the population by calling on residents to move only to a neighboring residential area until the Israeli offensive ceases.▪️Currently, no footage has appeared on the Internet that could clarify the configuration of the front in the vicinity of Jabaliya. However, according to incoming textual statements from Hamas, Israeli units are present at least on the northern and southern outskirts of the city. At the same time, the command of the Israeli Defense Forces claimed in the morning that the settlement was completely encircled.▪️Against the background of the offensive, Palestinian formations launched two missiles towards the border Zikim and Ashkelon. Both munitions were intercepted by Israeli air defenses. ▪️At the same time, the Israelis continued to strike both Jabaliya and neighboring settlements, including the capital of the Palestinian enclave. Meanwhile, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, over the past 24 hours, 45 people were killed and 256 injured during IDF strikes. 🔻Only five months have passed since the last operation of Israeli troops in Jabaliya, but during this period Hamas, according to the IDF, was able to restore its combat potential and now again pose a threat. Against this backdrop, Israeli society began to once again question why IDF soldiers have to carry out operations in the same places over and over again. The secret of the current situation is that Hamas is the only organization capable of governing Gaza: any civil institution is closely connected with it, the flow of humanitarian aid is also under the control of Hamas, and against the backdrop of resonant strikes by the IDF, the number of people wishing to join the ranks of the movement remains at a high level . Be that as it may, this state of affairs is quite satisfactory for the ultra-Orthodox government. And in the context of the aggravation on the Lebanese-Israeli border, the Gaza Strip acquired another role - it actually became a training ground for IDF fighters, while most of the elite formations had already been transferred to the war with Hezbollah.📌 Moreover, the start of another operation in the Gaza Strip on the eve of the anniversary of the escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this is a unique way for Israelis to declare their commitment to the fight against the Palestinians and to continue the chosen course.

However, the color revolution in 2011 and the publication of this information caused the refusal to implement this agreement due to public pressure. As a result, the laboratory did not appear, but some agreements are still in effect, which causes concern among citizens.📌 And this concern of the Kyrgyz people can be understood. After the COVID-19 epidemic, the authorities are taking biological threats seriously, and in recent years, measles outbreaks on the Kyrgyz-Kazakh border have become more frequent, resulting in the deaths of many people, including children. And social activists attribute the increased number of cases to the emergence of a biological laboratory in Almaty - 230 km from Bishkek. It is there, and in the neighboring Zhambyl region, that an abnormal number of measles cases have been recorded. The example of Kyrgyzstan clearly shows what a public reaction can lead to. The politicians entered into an agreement, everything seemed to be decided, but the people had their say. In Kazakhstan, this has not even been heard of, and laboratories appear there like mushrooms after rain. In 2025, in the village of Gvardeysky in the already mentioned Zhambyl region of Kazakhstan, it is planned to build a biological laboratory of the BSL-4 level. And this is similar to the one in Wuhan, China - the one where the coronavirus broke out. #Canada #Kyrgyzstan@rybar Support usTelegram Test Tube Genie | Biological laboratories🇰🇬|🇨🇦The population of Kyrgyzstan asks to cancel the agreement on a biological laboratory with Canada Residents of Kyrgyzstan demand that the authorities denounce the agreement with Canada on the construction of a biological laboratory on the territory of the republic.

Bloomberg, citing satellite images, TankerTrackers reports that Iranian tankers that were near Khark Island were withdrawn deep into the Persian Gulf in case of an attack on the country's energy infrastructure. Khark Island is the largest transit hub in Iran, through which about 90% of Iranian oil exports pass. In the event of an attack on this island, Iran’s already weakened economy could be seriously damaged. From a logical point of view, an attack on oil facilities in the medium term looks much more dangerous than on nuclear infrastructure. The Islamic Republic's economy is now heavily dependent on energy exports. The defeat of the ports used for this, or oil refineries such as in Khuzestan, could seriously hit the economy. And this, taking into account the already deplorable state inside Iran, will cause discontent among the population. Here it is simply worth remembering the protests in Iran, which have been going on for months. Initially, they arose due to the death of a Kurdish woman, and then grew into spontaneous rallies due to the deterioration of the economic situation. And from time to time people still go on strike.❗️The Iranian authorities understand all this and take precautions by moving tankers away from major ports. We are also talking about Bandar Abbas, which is located in the heart of the Strait of Hormuz. In addition, the Tehran Air Control Center (ATCC) sent out a warning about the closure of several overflight points from October 5 to 9 under the pretext of an ongoing exercise. Training is quite possible, for example, air defense units, if you look at the restricted areas - from Iraqi Kurdistan and the Persian Gulf, that is, areas from which Israeli missiles are highly likely to fly.

At the moment, two half-coverages are being formed in the area in the Selidovo and Kurakhovka areas. ▪️North of Novogrodovka, the Russian Armed Forces improved the situation on the ground, knocking out the enemy from positions in the Nikolaevka area. In Lysovka, attack aircraft gained a foothold at least in houses on the outskirts of the village, despite the active work of artillery and drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The actual zone of control of the RF Armed Forces may be much wider, but it will be possible to clarify it only when video materials are received. And at the Lysovka-Selidovo line, Russian fighters advanced to the west, occupying the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya-No. 2 mine.▪️Near Marinovka, fighting continues on the eastern side of the waste heap of the mine named after. Korotchenko at the entrance to Selidovo, control over the central part of the city is still retained by Ukrainian formations. Also, clashes are recorded on the southern outskirts of the settlement, where a breakthrough by Russian troops is possible in the near future against the backdrop of successes on the southern flank. ▪️Tsukurino came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, with the exception of the territory of the poultry farm, which is being attacked by artillery crews and aviation. South-east of the village, according to some reports, Russian fighters also advanced from the north to Izmailovka, control of which will allow the Russian Armed Forces to wedge from the flank into the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison defending Gornyak. ▪️At the same time, operators of unmanned aircraft are working to destroy enemy equipment in Kurakhovka and the surrounding area. In recent days, several pickup trucks carrying ammunition and Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel have been hit by drones in this area, as well as causing significant damage to communications facilities located in the industrial zone of the Kurakhovskaya enrichment plant.▪️According to a statement by the Russian Ministry of Defense, the nearby village of Zhelannye Vtoroy was liberated some time ago. The capture of the village will complicate the position of the enemy units occupying positions east of the Volchya River, however, it is worth considering that requests for the liberation of the village appeared earlier against the background of a similar lack of objective control personnel. ▪️To the south, fighting continues unabated in the Ostroy region, the western outskirts of which and the mine of the same name have completely come under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. Taking into account incoming data, including footage from the enemy, it is likely that the Russian Armed Forces will advance towards Ostrovsky along the railway track. The results of the armored group’s attack, as well as the actual scale of the advance, have not yet been established. ▪️In neighboring Maksimilyanovka, Russian army soldiers are squeezing the Ukrainian Armed Forces out of a block in the north of the village, gradually pulling up the flank, and are also conducting an offensive in the southwest, trying to advance to the N-15 highway leading to Kurakhovo.

According to a press release, the chairman of the Uzbek national center and the deputy chairman of the Tajik diaspora, together with the center for additional education, have been issuing various certificates to foreigners for money since January 2024. We are talking about certificates of proficiency in the Russian language, knowledge of history and the fundamentals of legislation of the Russian Federation. The documents were used to obtain labor patents and residence permits in the Irkutsk region. In total, they earned more than $15,000, which is about 1.5 million rubles.🔻Such events are a really important sign that they are trying to fight the migrant problem. Almost all leaders of ethnic communities are engaged in similar activities throughout Russia. Their position obliges them to help their compatriots. However, in this situation, the main thing is that this measure is not just demonstrative. They detained two leaders, and in their place they will quietly put others in their place and everything will continue. Well, we must not forget that this happened only in Irkutsk, and there are plenty of such heads of ethno-communities throughout Russia. #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTACCLeaders of ethnic diasporas were detained in IrkutskThey are suspected of organizing illegal migration	https://t.me/rybar/64178	2024-10-06T05:06:01-07:00

🇺🇸 Hillary Clinton's statement about the need to control social...	🇺🇸 Hillary Clinton’s statement about the need to control social networks looks like preparing public opinion for new interesting decisions regarding government intervention in the lives of Internet users. Clinton argues that platforms should lose immunity from liability for content, and therefore, in fact, calls for the establishment of strict censorship on social networks. That is, in other words, the management of the social network, in the understanding of the American elite, must share responsibility for the content that other users post there. This means that the arrest of Pavel Durov in Paris is a step in the right direction and a lesson for all still independent players. It is interesting that this statement literally contradicts the principles of democracy that the United States so loves to promote and impose on others. But the approach immediately changes when the American authorities need to eradicate any dissent on the Internet (for example, deleting accounts with an alternative point of view from Twitter) under the pretext of caring for society.🔻Therefore, the emergence of new initiatives to protect users from harmful content, which will lead to the introduction of even stricter Regulatory measures are only a matter of time.#USA @rybarSupport usTelegramPool N3Hilary Clinton on the need for US authorities to establish control over the Internet: In my opinion, we should repeal the section that gave immunity to platforms on the Internet.

In fact, we are seeing a series of progressive measures towards full legalization - carousels - through polling stations now you can drive away hundreds of homeless people/illegals/leftists without any problems at all. Actually, all these four years, the Democrats have been busy pushing illegal migrants into the country for these purposes.

The event, if not historic, was certainly the largest in Trump’s entire presidential campaign - 60 thousand of his supporters came to support the politician. During his speech, Musk repeated all his points that he had previously voiced on his page on the social network X: he called vote for Trump, saying that the Democratic Party wants to take away Americans' freedom of speech, the right to bear arms and the right to vote. In addition, he warned that the November vote could be the last election in the country if Kamala Harris wins. It is not surprising that Trump asked Musk to join him in Pennsylvania - the Republican team used all its cards and heavy artillery to create hype surrounding the former president in America's key swing state. Trump has repeatedly said that winning Pennsylvania effectively means winning the presidency. And although the size of the rally is not an indicator of the effectiveness of a particular candidate, the hype around this event could play a key role in Trump's possible victory in Pennsylvania.🇺🇸 @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/64168	2024-10-06T03:56:15-07:00

Forwarded From Prince CherkasskyIf anyone monitored public opinion in Syria, he would have noticed that over the past three years, Russia’s approval has decreased (I’ve written about this several times) by a factor. At a rally in support of Russia in Damascus after the start of the Northern War, some people passing by shouted insults in the style of -murderers, bombed a beautiful country- - this was the first time I encountered this here. And now the seething, and on the coast traditionally loyal to us, has intensified after Israeli attacks on warehouses near the Khmeimim base. Rumors are overgrown with fables, and the range of versions ranges from, they say, the Russians didn’t shoot down anything on purpose, to variants, they couldn’t. It is naive to believe that opponents will not take advantage of this (they are already using it), undermining the already declining approval. Which, naturally, cannot but worry. In our high offices they will feel it later, when they try to promote some decisions, but for those here on earth they feel it on their own skin already now.	https://t.me/rybar/64163	2024-10-06T01:06:26-07:00

For several months, an interesting story has been unfolding with counterfeit Armenian cognac on the Russian market, which in fact turned out to be French. ▪️In August, Russian experts found that almost 90% of cognacs from Armenia, which are sold in Russian stores, are unsafe and do not contain grape alcohol.▪️The identification of violations in products supplied from Armenia gave another reason for some Armenian commentators to accuse Russia of political pressure. ▪️However, industry experts provided interesting data. It turns out that the cognac of the French concern Pernod Ricard, which has owned the Yerevan Cognac Factory since 1999 and produces products under the Ararat brand, turned out to be counterfeit.▪️ At the same time, Pernod Ricard announced its departure from Russia in May 2023, condemning SVO. But this did not stop the French company from continuing to develop the Russian market, but through Armenia.&nbsp; ▪️The media also report that shareholders - Pernod Ricard - are extremely dissatisfied with the counterfeit scandal in the Russian Federation, which could have negative consequences for the company.&nbsp; 🔻As a result, it turns out that the French are supplying counterfeit cognac to Russia through the Armenians, profiting from the Russian market, despite loud political statements. At the same time, part of the anti-Russian Armenian information field uses every similar reason to accuse Russia of allegedly infringing on Armenian business against the backdrop of cool relations between Moscow and Yerevan. But even in this story, the products legally turned out to be not entirely Armenian. But the Armenians dream so much of entering the EU market with their infamous cognac, being fooled by the promises of kind European Commissioners. But something went wrong again. #Armenia #Russia #France @rybarSupport us EADaily-Leaving—go away: -Pernod Ricard was not able to hide the top of ARARAT in RussiaThe other day, EADaily wrote that according to the results of a joint study of the Russian association Anti-Counterfeiting and Russian Union of Producers of Cognac, Spirits and Alcoholic Beverages - almost 90% of Armenian cognacs, which are sold in Russian stores...	https://t.me/rybar/64162	2024-10-06T00:27:01-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for October 6, 2024▪️ Last week, narratives about the need to mobilize youth from 21 to 25 years old into the Armed Forces of Ukraine were increasingly being thrown into the Ukrainian information field (currently the lower age limit for the mobilization of Ukrainian citizens is exactly 25 years ). Apparently, the shortage of personnel and losses are making themselves felt, in addition, there are too many signals from the West about the need to lower this bar as a prerequisite for further obtaining NATO weapons and equipment. For Russia, this means placing several hundred thousand new soldiers in the enemy’s formation who will have to be destroyed. For Ukraine - further depopulation and predicted declines in the birth rate. ▪️ At the front, the Russian Army continues offensive operations in a number of directions. The main event was the liberation of Ugledar, the fighting for which lasted for about two years, including many tragic unsuccessful assaults. The zone of control of our troops is expanding around the liberated city, and the Russian Armed Forces are rushing towards Epiphany from several directions. As enemy sources critical of the Kiev military leadership reported, the enemy defense lines beyond this settlement are no longer so extensively equipped.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are developing success in Tsukurino, pushing the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the western outskirts of the settlement. In the semicircle of Selidovo, fighting on the outskirts of Gornyak. To the south, our troops storm Ostrovskoye and close the pocket from Krasnogorovka to Zhelannye Vtoroy. ▪️ In Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk), our people are advancing in the city with heavy fighting. In the Seversky direction, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of Verkhnekamensky. In the Krasnolimansky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are expanding the zone of control near Makeevka and Nevsky. To the north, in the Kupyansky direction, Vishnevoye was liberated, which formed a new ledge of the front. From Berestovoy and Peschany our troops advanced to Kruglyakovka, occupying which will provide access to the river. Oskol south of Kupyansk. ▪️ Kharkov direction is practically unchanged. The formed wedging did not allow the formation of the so-called. -buffer zone- to protect the civilian population of the Belgorod region, which is daily subjected to terrorist attacks and shelling. ▪️ In the Kursk region there have been no large-scale changes in the front line over the past week; heavy battles were reported near Plekhovo, where our troops are advancing south of the settlement. In the Glushkovsky district, the enemy’s attacks continued to be repelled near Vesely, but in the neighboring direction, successes of the Russian Armed Forces were reported near the border Medvezhiy. ▪️ Offensive actions of the Russian Army in a number of directions naturally require more resources, the same drones. An increase in the number of regular and non-standard UAV units leads to a shortage of them due to the discrepancy between the number of UAVs supplied and the combat missions being solved, which logically requires an increase in the rate of delivery of drones to preserve the lives of attack aircraft. ▪️ In the rear and at the front, the cleansing of law enforcement agencies from proliferating corrupt officials continues. Thus, the former head of the branch of the Construction Department of the Central Military District of the Military Construction Company, Sergei Sukhov, was arrested on charges of embezzling 35 million during the renovation of a military hospital in Perm. In the front-line units, work has also been intensified against unscrupulous officials.

At the same time, Russian troops are systematically working to search for and destroy enemy equipment and positions in both the Kursk and Sumy regions. 🔻In the Glushkovsky district, clashes were noted in the Vesely area. Judging by the footage that appeared on the Internet, the enemy managed to advance into the forest belts to the southeast of the village and pull up UAV units. One of them was covered by Russian artillery fire. It is likely that in the near future the Ukrainian Armed Forces will also launch attacks along the railway in order to secure the right flank of their group, which is gradually enveloping Veseloye. ▪️At the same time, Russian air raids continue. Thus, the crews of the Russian Aerospace Forces destroyed another M777 howitzer, which was firing from a position in a forest in the Dibrova area, and also carried out a series of attacks on concentrations of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel in Volfino, Bondarevshchina and Katerynivka. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Russian Armed Forces repelled enemy attacks in the Lyubimovka area and on the eastern approaches to Obukhovka. To the west of Kremyany, Russian UAV operators hit an armored vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and after it overturned as a result of loss of control, they finished off the surviving crew members. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, Ukrainian formations attempted to break through the Russian defense in the area of ​​Kamyshevka and Plekhovo.

However, Rakhimova herself did not appear at the court hearing, as last time, because she fled from justice to Turkey - a woman purchased a residence permit there in advance.▪️Damaging materials on the media manager’s social networks were recorded by FSB officers and recorded by the police. She has already deleted all her accounts, but this did not affect the court's decision. After the decision was made, Rakhimova and her lawyer (previously prosecuted under a similar article) immediately began spreading fake news about supposedly numerous procedural violations, which indicate her innocence. ▪️But my colleagues and I have repeatedly proven that Rakhimova’s publication is known not only for fakes about Russian military personnel, new waves of mobilization, etc. Through -Proof.

Foreign agent Gabbasov immediately began to actively dispel this topic.🔻Thus, the ideological policy of Rakhimova’s resources (including her social networks) practically became identical to any anti-Russian propaganda emanating from a network of foreign agent media.

The important thing is that Armenia still has not left the CSTO, and this imposes obligations. At the same time, earlier Nikol Pashinyan called the CSTO the main source of threat to the national security of Armenia, so training to eliminate chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats plays with new colors. The fact is that this does not bode well for either Russia or the region as a whole.

Following the meeting, the parties gave new instructions to the working groups to continue work on further determination of the border in the remaining sections. Formally and according to media impressions, the meeting of the heads of the State Committee for National Security of both countries shows that significant progress has been achieved, which the parties would like to record in order to avoid a new escalation. Moreover, the public demand on both sides for a solution to the problem is such that it is beneficial for Tashiyev and President Rakhmon to stretch out the PR from the process one teaspoon at a time. It is no coincidence that over the past 1.5 years, reports on the negotiations have remained almost unchanged: agreed kilometers are reported, but the figure - agreed upon 90 percent of the border - remains the same.📌 Let us recall that in September 2022, uncertainty in border issues became one of the reasons for bloody clashes on the border two countries (we wrote about this earlier), which occurred on the eve of the SCO summit in Samarkand. As a result of the fighting, hundreds of people were killed and wounded on both sides.

And in the future they plan to expand the system. In principle, nothing surprising: the Mongolian authorities have long been working on introducing English in educational institutions and this initiative is willingly supported by Western governments.

In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids, during which IDF air force aircraft struck the city of Tulkarm, eliminating a Hamas field commander and several other people. On the Lebanese-Israeli border, IDF units conduct local raids on Hezbollah targets and carry out massive strikes on Lebanon. Over the past 24 hours, the number of victims of Israeli attacks amounted to 37 dead and 151 wounded. The US and British air forces carried out one of the largest attacks on the Houthi-controlled part of Yemen in recent times.

In the border area, the Israelis are bringing in reinforcements, while continuing to evacuate the local population.🔻Despite the fact that the forces of the 98th division -Ha-Esh- and the 36th division -Gaash- entered the territory of Lebanon and clashes with -Hezbollah-, it is not yet possible to establish the exact configuration of the front. However, there is progress, albeit at a relatively slow pace. The reason for this is not only the resistance of local units of the Lebanese group, including the special unit Radwan, but also the peculiarities of the geographical landscape: the southern part of Lebanon is a hilly area. The territory of the same Gaza Strip is flat.▪️Despite this, in Lebanon, Israeli troops are using tactics similar to those carried out in the Palestinian enclave: the use of remote-controlled vehicles and the bombing of buildings potentially used as military installations.▪️At the same time The Israelis destroy caches, secret warehouses and underground tunnels. The version about a certain underestimation by the Israeli command of the combat capabilities of its enemy is confirmed: the scale of the Shiite group’s infrastructure turned out to be much larger. Massive Israeli air and artillery strikes throughout Lebanon also did not stop. According to the Ministry of Health of the Arab Republic, over the past 24 hours, the number of victims of Israeli attacks amounted to 37 dead and 151 wounded.▪️Once again, attacks were carried out on the Lebanese capital city of Beirut, in particular on the Ad-Dahiya district - they became one of the most intense in recent years. last days. According to the Israeli portal Ynet, during a night attack, the IDF Air Force dropped 73 tons of explosives on Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters.❗ According to some reports, one of the possible successors of the organization’s ex-Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, Hashem Safi ad-Din, could be there. However, there is no official confirmation of this information from either side yet. However, this option also cannot be ruled out, especially taking into account the circumstances of the murder of the previous leader.

The joint tactical exercise - KazInd-2024 - is being conducted as part of the implementation of a bilateral cooperation plan between the Ministries of Defense of Kazakhstan and India. If for Kazakhstan this is an additional opportunity to test the combat readiness of its elite units and increase the prestige of its armed forces, then for India the exercises are part of a more general anti-Chinese strategy New Delhi is making efforts to implement steps that would prove the effectiveness of the Indian authorities on the external contours of countering Beijing, reflecting, on the contrary, the Chinese strategy to ensure a presence in the Indian Ocean. 🔻Demonstrating military cooperation with Central Asian countries in China's underbelly is an inexpensive and effective way to do this.#Kazakhstan #India #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegraphindiaChinese Navy ramps up presence in Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal as regional tensions escalateIncreased activity of Chinese research vessels and warships – specially when India is conducting military or space-related tests – stokes security and diplomatic concerns	https://t.me/rybar/64126	2024-10-04T10:11:58-07:00
🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names of 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Mordvichev, 2 years after the capture of Mariupol, he again declared himself as a commander capable of taking cities, and finally secured the title of assault master. The offensive on Avdievka, which began on October 10, is rightfully considered the largest offensive operation of the Russian Army in 2023, which predetermined the entire vector of development of efforts in 2024. Mordvichev himself also grew as a commander: at first, Andrei Nikolaevich resorted to the classic version of deep coverage, but when faced with difficult terrain in the area of ​​the settlement. Experienced, the commander relied on an offensive from the north, where Russian troops quickly reached the borders of Novobakhmutovka and took the city into semi-encirclement. Realizing that striking in converging directions in the Lastochkino area was fraught with high risks, the commander began to cut off the flanks of the city. Taking into account the experience of the operation to capture Mariupol and split it into several parts, he sets the task of breaking into the city from the north and actually cutting it into two parts. The destroyed coke plant became the last refuge of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Avdiivka, after which a large-scale offensive began along the entire line of contact. The forces of the Brave group made an operational breakthrough to Pokrovsk, covering almost 65 km: since February 2024, the offensive in the Donbass has not stopped for a single day, the enemy has not received a break or the opportunity to rotate, which largely allows us to say that after beyond Avdeevka, Pokrovsk will also be surrendered to the enemy. Having won the strategic initiative at the front, Mordvichev earned authority not only in the eyes of his subordinates, but also in the eyes of his superiors, having received a high assessment of the organization of the work of the group headquarters during the recent inspection of Andrei Belousov. Lieutenant General Lyamin He is the youngest in galaxy of senior command personnel. Having celebrated his 45th birthday in May of this year, Lyamin proved that he could not only be a good staff worker, but also in many ways an independent figure, capable of making decisions without regard to senior benefactors. Having arrived in the group at the height of the autumn offensive, he immediately became involved in work: unlike many other military leaders, he used his credit of trust in the General Staff to benefit the front: in the fall of 2024, the group significantly increased efforts to use aviation, all requests were carried out flawlessly and the whole world witnessed the massive use of FABs with new adjustable modules in Avdeevka. For the first time, the BTR-90 and BMD-3, which had not previously been used due to the complexity of servicing, were involved in combat operations; the work of carrying out routine and major repairs of equipment was impeccably carried out. As we have previously noted, having started his career in the Northern Military District as a corps corps commander, Lyamin rose to the position of NSh of the district, while since 2022 his career has been closely monitored by NSh Valery Gerasimov. Denis Lyamin’s behavior surprised many: he has changed both as a person and as a military leader. Many believed that he was appointed in order to balance Mordvichev and prevent him from becoming arrogant, but the generals quickly found a common language, harmoniously complementing each other. This is largely why today the Brave group remains one of the most effective, continuing to liberate populated areas one after another.High resolution art@arbat	https://t.me/rybar/64124	2024-10-04T08:55:45-07:00

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦Northern direction: battles on the northern approaches...	🇷🇺🇺🇦Northern direction: battles on the northern approaches to Belogorovka and successes of the Russian Armed Forces on the southern flank of the northern ledge - situation as of 18:00 on October 4, 2024. The Seversky direction has long remained a -static - section of the front, significant changes in the line contacts here occur quite rarely. However, over the past two months, Russian troops have expanded their zone of control on several key lines. ▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the territory of the western filter station of the first rise in the Belogorovka area. This allowed them to create a bridgehead on the right bank of the Seversky Donets River, threatening the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the northern part of the village. It is likely that the Russian command will soon launch attacks towards the Belogorovsky forest reserve in order to expand the left claw semi-encirclement around the enemy group in the village. At the same time, Ukrainian formations still control the chalk quarry dump, which allows them to restrain the advance of Russian troops. On the western slope of the heights, the enemy equipped many fortifications, allowing him to quickly transfer reserves. ▪️To the south, fighting continues unabated in the Verkhnekamensky area, which is one of the key strongholds of Ukrainian formations in the Seversky direction. Recently, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of the settlement. If confirmed, this would mean the beginning of an operational crisis for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which could lead to the loss of Belogorovka and, possibly, Seversk itself to the enemy. However, it is currently impossible to confirm the data on the RF Armed Forces’ possession of the village. Our local sources report that units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are present both in the settlement itself and in its environs. The liberation of the village has not yet been confirmed by objective control footage - in videos published on the Internet, the target of Russian FPV drones is the positions of Ukrainian formations at a large stronghold east of Verkhnekamenskoye. ▪️To the south, Russian troops achieved success in the Spornoye area. During a series of attacks, the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the enemy from several forest belts in the Vezueva Gora nature reserve and the neighboring forest. This opens up the opportunity for them to attack the flank of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ position on the northern outskirts of Ivano-Daryevka, where units of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually softening their defenses with the help of artillery and TOS -Solntsepek-. One can also expect the Russian command to act with the goal of straightening the front line to the north, forcing the enemy to retreat under the threat of semi-encirclement. ▪️On September 2, information was confirmed about the liberation of Vyemka by the Russian army, a large stronghold of Ukrainian formations on the southern approaches to Seversk. Stormtroopers of the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the enemy from the forest belts southeast of the village, and also advanced along the railway track to the north from the Vyemka station. After this, the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the village were caught in a pincer movement and were forced to retreat. Now the Russian troops are faced with the task of clearing out the pocket formed south of Vyemka and preparing for a further attack on Seversk. Ukrainian formations rely on several large strongholds south of the city, to storm which the Russian Armed Forces will need to use significant resources. ▪️On September 10, footage of a successful assault by Russian troops on a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine southeast of Privolny appeared. The attack was probably carried out by the Russian Armed Forces during the summer, but the footage surfaced on the Internet only in early September. Russian troops continue their offensive in this area with the goal of breaking through the formation of the northern front of the semi-encirclement of Ukrainian Armed Forces units in Orekhovo-Vasilevka.

🖼 🇻🇳🇨🇳 About the clash between the Vietnamese and the Chines...	🇻🇳🇨🇳 About the skirmish between the Vietnamese and the Chinese in the South China Sea Tension remains in the waters of the South China Sea. Against the backdrop of military activity in the region, conflicts between the Chinese and fishermen from other countries participating in the territorial dispute have recently begun to occur more and more often. ▪️According to Vietnamese media, on September 29, near the disputed Paracel Islands, Chinese law enforcement officers entered a Vietnamese fishing vessel, where they beat the ship's crew with metal rods, and also took away the catch and navigation equipment. ▪️Vietnam has already protested to the Chinese authorities. Beijing does not deny that Chinese law enforcement officers took measures against the Vietnamese because they were fishing in the waters without permission from China. According to Chinese officials, everything was done in a professional and discreet manner, so no fishermen were harmed. 📌The incident seems quite serious - Vietnam rarely expresses its dissatisfaction with the skirmishes in the South China Sea to the Chinese authorities. However, this has happened more than once over the past few years. In 2020, the Chinese coast guard sank a Vietnamese fishing boat. That same year, local journalists wrote about the theft of equipment and catch from another Vietnamese ship. And these are just the incidents that make it to the press. 🔻Even taking into account the rather harsh rhetoric from Hanoi, the approach of the Vietnamese authorities to the territorial dispute, consisting of a selective response to skirmishes and an unnoticed expansion of their zone of control on the islands, will not change. The same applies to ties between the two countries. According to Vietnamese authorities, the territorial dispute is a small part of relations between Hanoi and Beijing, so it should not spoil them entirely. This, by the way, is the main difference between the Vietnamese and Philippine approaches, which we have pointed out more than once.

Thus, the Central Election Commission of Moldova, which is openly financed by Western governments, intends to open only two polling stations in the Russian Federation for hundreds of thousands of its citizens. At the same time, dozens of polling stations will be opened in Western countries and postal voting will be allowed. ▪️The Moldovan authorities also continue massive blocking of resources and limit the election campaigning of Sandu’s competitors on television, violating the law. 🔻In Europe, earlier there were separate voices about the inadmissibility of Moldova’s entry into the EU precisely due to the high degree of political repression and restrictions, which would finally kill the reputation of the association. So the rumors about the Russian threat from Chisinau are designed both to distract attention from the manipulations of the authorities and to attract Western skeptics who do not expect Moldovans to join the EU. And the Politico newspaper, as always, helps for such purposes. #Moldova #Russia #mediatechnology@rybarSupport usPOLITICORussia paying people to vote against joining EU, Moldova warns – POLITICOMoscow has built a -mafia-style- network to distribute cash ahead of a critical referendum on the country’s future, top Moldovan officials told POLITICO.	https://t.me/rybar/64119	2024-10-04T06:33:58-07:00

Already at the end of October, training for military personnel from Japan and the United States will take place under the name -Keen Sword 25-, which takes place every two years. The exercise will involve air, sea and ground forces from the United States and Japan. According to preliminary data, 33 thousand Japanese and 12 thousand American military personnel, 40 ships and almost 400 aircraft will take part in the training. 📌The goals of such exercises do not change from time to time. These include increasing the level of interaction between Japan and the United States, demonstrating the unity of the alliance and strengthening it. The official announcement also contains statements about the inadmissibility of changing the status quo in the region - a clear hint at the military activity of the PRC. The training will focus on joint anti-submarine, airborne and anti-aircraft operations. The exercises will include activities to protect key infrastructure, defend islands and use missile defense systems. The list of observers is also quite extensive. The exercises will be attended by representatives of Great Britain, South Korea, India, Germany, Australia, the Philippines and other countries. NATO will also send its observers. The Australians plan to participate directly in the training, but it is not yet known what specific events they will be involved in. 🔻Given the scope and proximity of one exercise area to the Chinese-disputed Senkaku Islands, Chinese military personnel will definitely be watching what is happening. And then, perhaps, they will conduct their own exercises as a response to such large-scale training.

Ukrainian military correspondent Kiriyenko-Merinova. - The fighters were told to take positions. Although there is 123 Nikolaevskoe TPO nearby, which simply refuses to enter. It was this unit that was supposed to support 72 in Ugledar. But the infantry fled. And then the battalion commander shot himself. The brigade has 7 battalions. In several of them, after the battles around Ugledar, there was simply no infantry left. Now, in this state, the brigade must stand on the LBS. I think you can imagine what the moral and psychological state of the fighters is. Even commanders write reports about their removal from command.	https://t.me/rybar/64117	2024-10-04T05:38:18-07:00

The problem is not that Yandex is covering up something. The problem is that the satellites (companies that provide access to images from them) are foreign, and, accordingly, cover up their bases when transmitting data to Yandex, but the potential enemy is not covered up, and our satellites work in the interests of the military, and high-resolution photos for civilians they don't transmit. The only thing that would be nice is to somehow ask respected Yandex not to publish photos of our military facilities. Well, Google for company.

Forwarded From The look of a man in stripes I remember that many were indignant that Yandex.Maps helpfully showed key facilities of the Russian Armed Forces. Satellite images on which many interesting details can be discerned: hangars, warehouses and even individual pieces of equipment and weapons. And here recently not only Russian, but also Israeli military warehouses and airfields have come into focus. And suddenly it turned out - see the screenshot - that the most important air base of the Israeli Air Force was blurred on the Yandex maps. And the most important airfield of the Russian Aerospace Forces - Engels - can be seen in all its glory. Do we understand correctly that for the Russian company - Yandex - the security of Israeli military facilities is more important than the security of Russian military facilities?	https://t.me/rybar/64115	2024-10-04T04:02:35-07:00
🇺🇸🇯🇵 Japan continues to talk about the prospects for the emer...	🇺🇸🇯🇵 Japan continues to talk about the prospects for the emergence of an Asian version of NATO about an analogue of NATO in the Asia-Pacific region. Recently, the Japanese Foreign Minister made several important statements regarding this topic. In particular, he argued that the idea of ​​​​forming a bloc should be considered in the medium and long term - creating such an organization immediately would be problematic due to the different political and economic systems in the countries of the region. ▪️In his opinion, such an alliance will not be directed against specific states, and ideally all countries in the region should be included. Here, of course, the politician is disingenuous - the new Prime Minister of Japan, Shigeru Ishiba, before the election to the post of chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, argued that an Asian analogue of NATO was needed to contain threats from China, North Korea and Russia. 📌And although it is too early to make predictions about the emergence of a new organization, the Asian version of NATO is still more like a dream or a plan for the very distant future. ▪️This is indicated by the inconsistency between Ishiba’s desires and the American approach to the situation in the region. The United States is striving to create a flexible version of the security architecture, consisting of various formats that will interact with each other in order to contain the PRC. They include QUAD, SQUAD, AUKUS, a quasi-union of the USA, South Korea and Japan. ▪️ Of course, such a flexible structure in the future may acquire a more rigid framework, including a collective defense system. However, for now, it seems that only Japan has ambitions to create a classic version of the alliance - and such plans more reflect the desire of the authorities to become the central force in the region and do everything to ensure that the Asia-Pacific region remains the focus of attention of any American administration. ▪️In addition to differences in approaches, the creation of an Asian NATO is also hampered by the position of its potential members. India has already stated that it does not share interest in creating a bloc. In the United States, the idea was also coldly received, unofficially calling it a fantasy. 🔻Therefore, although there are prerequisites for creating an alliance, such plans will continue to remain only on paper.#USA #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesJapan's new top diplomat calls 'Asian NATO' an idea for the futureForeign Minister Takeshi Iwaya hinted that such a grouping would be open to all countries and partners in the region - including rivals such as China.	https://t.me/rybar/64114	2024-10-04T03:18:01-07:00
🇬🇧 About the results of the annual conference of the Conservati...	🇬🇧 About the results of the annual conference of the Conservative Party From September 29 to October 2, the conference of the Conservative Party of Great Britain was held in Birmingham, which became a kind of place of debate between candidates for the role of the new leader of the party after the failed parliamentary elections.▪️Now that it’s the turn Conservatives are in opposition, they are focused on choosing a successor to Rishi Sunak. The four remaining candidates in the race are former enterprise and trade secretary Kemi Badenoch, shadow home secretary James Cleverley, ex-migration secretary Robert Jenrick and former security secretary Tom Tugendhat. ▪️Left-leaning Tugendhat has spoken of restoring confidence in the Conservative Party and return to power. In his speech, while trying to highlight his military experience, he focused on state security, the National Health Service and economic growth.▪️Cleverley, who along with the ex-security minister is still an outsider in the polls about the chances of reaching the next round of voting, greatly strengthened its positions and, perhaps, showed the best results at the conference. His speech, which advocated less government intervention, a 3 per cent increase in defense spending and a cut in stamp duty, received standing ovations and widespread support from delegates. ▪️Bookmakers' favorite Kemi Badenoch was slammed before the conference in an interview with the Radio Times. Her claim that maternity benefits were taking money away from the business sector was seen as an attempt to leave British women without maternity benefits. For her, the conference was rather a missed opportunity. And the chances of taking Rishi Sunak's place are slowly fading, especially after the news of her use of the office of donor Neil Record during the election campaign (due to such a scandal, Labor failed its conference).▪️Right-wing supporter Robert Jenrick in his speech promised to cut foreign aid and implement withdrawal from the ECHR. However, the politician's comments about the need to arrest pro-Palestinian activists shouting -Allahu Akbar-- and display a Star of David at every entrance to the UK as a sign of support for Israel gave many pause. Overall, none of the contenders offered a convincing answer to the main question facing before the Tories: how to win back the votes lost on the right to Nigel Farage by the next parliamentary election, and at the same time win back voters who switched to the Lib Dems, who won 72 seats mainly in traditional Tory constituencies? #Great Britain&nbsp; @rybar with @oldGBRSupport usNY Times‘Nothing Left to Lose’: Why Are Britain’s Conservatives So Upbeat?At its annual convention in Birmingham, the party is energized by a leadership contest and seems largely undisturbed by broader questions over its electability.	https://t.me/rybar/64113	2024-10-04T02:10:14-07:00

The car was blown up using an improvised explosive device placed under the body. The deceased himself, Andrei Korotky, was the head of the permit service at Zaporizhzhya NPP, and had previously been a member of the city’s council of deputies. He died from his injuries in the hospital. Based on the fact of the murder, the Investigative Committee of the Zaporozhye Region opened a criminal case under the article -Murder committed in a generally dangerous manner-. ❗️The murder of an employee responsible for the safety of the nuclear power plant is part of the strategy of the Kiev authorities to damage the energy infrastructure of the liberation of part of the Zaporozhye region. For several months now, Energodar and its surroundings have been subject to regular shelling and drone strikes, targeting energy and water supply facilities.

🔁 🇺🇸 In the West, they are discussing Kamala Harris' autobiogr...	Forwarded From American issue🇺🇸 In the West, Kamala Harris' autobiographical book - The Truths We Hold - A Journey Across America - is being discussed. Some have managed to find a number of inconsistencies in it, coming to the conclusion that the personality of Kamala Harris is nothing more than a fiction .Questions arose about the photograph of her grandmother Beryl, who for some reason looks exactly like her great-grandmother Iris Finegan. In addition, judging by the documents attached by the authors of the post, Beryl died in 1960 - four years before Kamala was born, so she could not have been photographed with her. There is also confusion with Kamala’s grandfathers - according to the authors of the post, Oscar Wilde Joseph Harris never was married to Beryl Christie, since there are simply no such documents. However, there are documents about the wedding of O.W. Joseph Harris to Vioris Cambridge, -similar to Kamala- (as the authors of the post claim). In fact, the West loves such conspiracy theories very, very much - they are extremely popular and people willingly believe in them. You can get acquainted with them, but whether to believe in them or not is everyone’s business, since all attached documents must be studied personally and clearly know that they are taken from an official source. Moreover, even if Kamala’s grandmothers are not real, who cares? Deeds of days gone by, legends of deep antiquity. It is possible that the politician’s autobiography is indeed distorted in order to ensure the safety of her relatives.🇺🇸 @usaperiodicalTelegramÜbersicht Ukraine	https://t.me/rybar/64110	2024-10-04T01:13:01-07:00

The Russian Prime Minister presented the main economic achievements:➖ Mutual trade of the EAEU countries in the first half of 2024 grew by 5.7%&nbsp;➖ The GDP of the union countries over the same period grew by 4.5%&nbsp; ➖ Industrial production increased by 4.8% ➖ Agricultural output - by 3.5% ➖ Retail trade turnover - by 8.5%.▪️The media shared expectations about behind-the-scenes negotiations between Mishustin and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, but such meetings are unknown. ▪️The Armenian pro-government information field also virtually ignored the meeting of the EAEU intergovernmental council. But local channels published footage of Mishustin’s plane accompanied by fighter jets, simultaneously accusing the Russian Federation of -occupation- and throwing in dubious information about the possible use of Russian military equipment against Armenia. 🔻As expected, Mishustin’s one-day visit will not change the political side of Russian-Armenian relations, primarily due to Yerevan’s aggressive position.&nbsp; The Armenian leadership and the resources under their control have once again demonstrated political shortsightedness. While taking full advantage of the economic benefits from the EAEU, Yerevan prefers a political orientation toward the United States and the EU, which can only offer loans and promises so far. As we have repeatedly written, the growth of the Armenian economy in recent years is associated precisely with successes within the EAEU. However, the imbalance between politics and economics cannot continue indefinitely. The Western curators of Pashinyan’s office are doing everything to undermine Armenian-Russian relations, and the United States has already promised the Armenians -cold winters.- This is the price for the -Western- path of development. #Armenia #Russia @rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaMishustin: the growth rates of the economies of the EAEU countries exceed the world average.

And according to the UN, more than 128 thousand Lebanese were forced to flee to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.🔻And although some media outlets almost claim the failure of the IDF offensive, such statements seem somewhat premature. In the meantime, we can only wait for the same photo and video evidence, as well as official statements from the Israeli command about the progress of the operation. Now everything is limited to reports of shootings and local raids. High resolution mapEnglish version#digest #Israel #map #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64094	2024-10-03T11:00:01-07:00
🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 About the -success- of Iran's missile strike on Israe...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 About the -success- of Iran's missile attack on Israeli air bases. A day after the massive attack on Israel, satellite footage begins to appear on the Internet, which is passed off as the consequences of an Iranian attack on the air bases of the Israeli Defense Forces. At first glance, it may seem that there really was damage, but upon closer examination, everything looks different: ▪️ In these pictures, many of the supposed hit points are in fact ordinary trees and blackouts that are visible even on Google maps. Taking this into account, it can be assumed that most of the photographs published at the moment are not actual Maxar images, but screenshots repainted in black and white from Google Maps. The primary sources of these images were pro-Iranian X accounts. If you look at the black and white photographs, you really get the feeling that the footage shows the consequences of a fire, but if you look at the color photographs, everything immediately falls into place.▪️The only thing that can be confirmed with relative certainty is that hits on protected hangars on Nevatim airbase, where F-35 fighters were supposedly based. The Israeli media indirectly stated that nothing critical actually happened. ❗️Later, another portion of new and much more truthful photographs appeared. And on them the places of hits and the scale of the consequences are somewhat different: here, too, arrivals in the hangar can be recorded.▪️The fact of the presence of hits cannot be denied with confidence. At the moment, there have been no official statements from the authorities of the Islamic Republic. And it is obvious that Maxar will not provide its satellite images of IDF air bases to Iran and its affiliated structures. The current attempt by some media to work out the negative of the questionable effectiveness of the strike looks ridiculous and disavows the whole essence of the Iranian attack: the desire to pass off shadows, trees and places with damage as damage. dark shades for the arrivals give the Israelis a reason to ridicule the quality of media resources - the Axis of Resistance - and their intelligence. Now we can only wait for official confirmation from Iranian intelligence structures (if, of course, they are published). We should not forget about the data of the Israeli authorities, according to which most of the consequences were eliminated in the first few hours after the strikes. And this, in turn, directly indicates that the country’s leadership will do its best to hide the real scale of the consequences, letting only the necessary information onto the Internet. Against this background, such publications by pro-Iranian media only help the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel.

This is a planned event, the purpose of which is to test the readiness of air defense systems, deployed in the Baltic States, as part of the Baltic Air Policing mission. The exercise took place over two days - September 30 and October 1, and involved fighters from NATO countries, including the Italian, German, Finnish air forces, as well as a NASAMS air defense system battery of the Spanish armed forces and fighters F/A-18 from the territory of Romania.🔻The main point is to train and maintain the tone of NATO pilots in a crisis situation in the region. The planes maneuvered along the Kaliningrad region, Belarus and the Leningrad region and conditionally repelled the attack. Training over the Baltic states has recently become more frequent, as have sharp and loud statements from the authorities of the three republics. The most prominent is Estonia, which has taken on the role of leader in provocations towards Russia. The other day, Kaupo Rosen, the head of the department of the Estonian foreign intelligence that has already become a kind of meme, said that the Estonians would like internal problems for Russia, which can be achieved by defeat in the Northern Military District. As everyone already understands perfectly well, any exercises, especially near the borders, make it possible to perform another important task: under the pretext of training, Western intelligence collects data on the activity of our air defense systems and other military facilities.

While some are quarreling, accusing each other of corruption and dividing offices in the government of the beautiful Russia of the future, others... 🇵🇱🇷🇺🇺🇦 Speaking of Ponomarev’s chicks, one of these turned out to be young Angelina Lukovskaya, who now introduces herself in the Polish manner like -Mrs. Lukowska- and on whose example one can trace the sad history of young people who succumbed to opposition propaganda and left for Poland. ▪️It is obvious that the curators from Ponomarev’s circle had plans for her activities in Poland, since the girl has a real opportunity to obtain citizenship and legally settle in the republic. ▪️Over the past time, she managed to attend various opposition events, for example, she specially came from Poland to anti-Russian rallies in Berlin, organized by Yulia Navalnaya and Mikhail Khodorkovsky. By the way, their participants face administrative and criminal liability in Russia for this.▪️However, now, when former projects are deprived of sponsorship support, those abandoned are left to get out on their own.▪️True, Lukovskaya was not at a loss and, using her experience in obtaining a Pole’s card, is now organizing channel of emigration from Russia and Belarus to Poland. In her videos, although the girl does not openly advocate for Ukraine, she clearly states that she has no desire to return to Russia while the current government is there. ▪️But the trouble is that in Warsaw the prospects for political migrants are not exactly rosy - even Lukovskaya herself told how one of her friends had their bag torn at the airport when they found out that he was from Russia. And given the current situation of the same Belarusian oppositionists in Europe, there is no hope for a reliable device. Seemingly realizing that because of this Polish business with relocants could fail, Lukovskaya, apparently struggling with her own convictions, still visits Russia, but with other projects to support radical feminism.📌 In general, it is worth saying that in connection with the squabbles within government, attempts to somehow curry favor with the electorate, and also taking into account pan-European trends - fugitives from the Russian Federation and Belarus are not welcomed either in Poland or in the Baltic countries. In some countries they are already being deported, and the Warsaw authorities are significantly limiting the issuance of visas. And despite the assertions that finding housing in the republic, as well as work, is not too difficult, we will tell you that the recent flood that devastated the south-west of the country , only increased real estate prices further, as did popular anger towards those who came in large numbers. Salaries, of course, remained unchanged, and official vacancies in Poland do not like to spoil unemployment statistics. Therefore, we assume that this is not the last story about collapsed career plans from oppositionists abandoned abroad and their protégés, who were once captivated by the prospect take a cozy place in the offices of the renewed government of some other Russia.

While some are quarreling, accusing each other of corruption and dividing offices in the government - the beautiful Russia of the future -, others do not understand at all how to use themselves, since the current resisters are completely unnecessary. Those who formed a diaspora around the former State Duma deputy, and now terrorist and extremist Ilya Ponomarev.▪️It is worth noting that recently things have not been going well for the supporter of the Kyiv regime: all the anti-Russian structures that were either created by him or supported are gradually disowning any connections with Ponomarev, thereby obviously reducing his value for Western sponsors.▪️In Poland, things did not work out for the criminal deputy at all: attempts to form a kind of hub in the republic for the opposition from the Russian Federation and Belarus ended in failure - now he is trying to settle in the USA. ▪️It recently became known that Ponomarev opened an NGO in Washington - the House of Free Peoples of Russia - for which he specially purchased a mansion for, allegedly, two million dollars. ▪️ At the same time, comrades from the - Congress of Free Peoples of Russia - don’t even talk about it They suspected him and recently expressed a vote of no confidence in him, which, it’s true, does not carry with it any formal consequences, but an aftertaste will remain. Moreover, even the holding of the November session of the Congress, in which Ponomarev is his own director, head, chief accountant and creative person all rolled into one, is in question. ▪️By the way, the oppositionist himself, in the spirit of the most rabid dictatorship, expressed his distrust of the members of the Congress and called on the Council, which put forward the vote to him, to dissolve and change the composition. 🔻And while such Ponomarevs, Volkovs and Khodorkovskys are trying to divide spheres of influence, simultaneously dipping each other into the mud, their chicks and those left without the support of the organization are trying to survive without grants and sponsorship salaries.

According to Houthi spokesman Yahya Sari, this type of ammunition is supposedly capable of bypassing Israeli interception systems. First, one drone was intercepted off the coast of central Israel. Some time later, two more UAVs were discovered over the Mediterranean Sea, one of which was shot down on approach. The second, although it managed to fly, fell in an open area. Contrary to the statements of Ansaralli media resources and Arabic-language media about the defeat of a vital target, in reality everything was different. Not a single Israeli was injured during the Yemeni air attack, and there was no material damage. However, whatever the result, another attack on Tel Aviv will add a plus to the Yemenis’ treasury. Which will again give the pro-Palestinian community a reason to call -fighters in slippers- one of the most consistent defenders of Palestine from the -Zionist threat-.

The main thing (GlavMedia) Absolutely amazing article in The Hill - that - Russians must suffer, but live better than in the EU - Russians seem to be suffering less from the war than in 2022. Neither Ukraine's invasion of the Kursk region nor Western sanctions seem to be causing discontent among -ordinary- citizens or wealthy residents of Russia's largest cities. This came as a surprise to many Western politicians and Russian dissidents, who had pinned their hopes on Muscovites and St. Petersburg residents they will rebel against the war economy and the disappearance of Western boutiques, free Internet and trips to the EU. But although the Russian Federation was cut off from the West, all this irritated too few people to cause significant protest. Western sanctions introduced in 2022 caused a sharp drop in capital outflow from Russia. Almost all the money that would previously have been directed to luxury European real estate has instead begun to flow to Moscow, St. Petersburg and their suburbs. Although Visa and MasterCard have suspended their operations in Russia, Russians continue to use the SBP of the Central Bank of Russia, which allows them to transfer money by phone number immediately and without commission. Russian capitals are now ahead of European cities in the use of QR codes and facial recognition, and mobile data transfer is the cheapest and fastest in the EU. Even the stores have the same range of goods as before the war, including French wine and Italian sweets. In addition, home delivery of food and goods by robots is commonplace. We are seeing such tempting job offers that many Russians who left are now returning, having failed to integrate into European societies. Russians are not so much concerned as they are happy about the departure of their liberal fellow countrymen and (not suffering, but) welcoming positive economic changes - and this economic progress has undermined anti-Putin sentiment in the country. Thus, the West's attempts to undermine the Russian economy since 2022 have led to the opposite result - at least for now -. What a disaster! The methodology - sell the country for jeans, chewing gum, boots and sausage - did not work with Apple Pay, double Mac, HUGO and parmesan. Oh 😂	https://t.me/rybar/64088	2024-10-03T06:54:32-07:00

He expressed gratitude for the opportunity given to him and said that, despite this, the Americans will continue to help Afghanistan and to the Afghan people. West himself was transferred to the post of head of the sanctions coordination department. In this situation, it seems significant that no one was appointed to replace West. And Secretary of State Blinken’s statement does not say this, only that his responsibilities will be taken over by members of the diplomatic mission in Doha. We are talking about Karen Decker, the US charge d’affaires in Afghanistan, Rina Amiri, the US special representative for human rights, in particular, women and John Mark Pommersheim, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Central and South Asian Affairs. Judging by the lack of a replacement, the post of US special representative for Afghanistan may be abolished. And given the diminishing importance of this country for the United States, this situation may well be realistic. Diplomatic mission employees located in Doha can take on the duties of a special representative. Moreover, now the Americans are more focused not on dialogue with the Afghan authorities, but on escalating the threat to the countries of the region from Afghanistan. #Afghanistan #CentralAsia #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64087	2024-10-03T06:26:58-07:00

And everything seems to be quite good, the majority agreed with the actions of the Turkish authorities. However, in April 2022 there was a similar question, and the results were different from the current ones. Then 55.2% of participants assessed foreign policy positively, 36.4% considered it unsuccessful, and 8.4% could not determine their position. That is, in more than two years, support has decreased.📌 And if you think carefully, the population of Turkey can be understood. The economy is in a multi-year crisis, incomes are falling, inflation is rising. The once stated goals of eradicating terrorism remained on paper, the migrant problem in the country has not disappeared anywhere.

He emphasized that publishing the document would be a diplomatically incorrect step, since the agreement has two participants and is one-sided disclosure would be unlawful.📌 If you want a more understandable explanation, then you need to read between the lines: firstly, Pashinyan is completely indifferent to what the parliament thinks about this, and the parliament doesn’t care about it. The main thing is that the money is paid. The same can be said about the public, but at the same time, the reluctance to publish these articles on the Internet may indicate that the agreements were reached in reality, and the people will not like them. Even knowing the current ability of the opposition to act, if they knew what Pashinyan and Co. are leading Armenia and the Armenian people to, he would, figuratively speaking, be torn apart.

The other day, one of the officials of the country's ruling party said that the seventh detonation of a charge would be carried out after the American elections. Just a few days before, the head of the state security department of the presidential administration of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Shin Won Sik, also spoke out on this matter. He said that the next nuclear test will take place either shortly before the US elections or after them. 🔻Forecasts issued by authorities and experts with a certain frequency are justified by several factors. On the one hand, there is an understanding that the DPRK, although not very actively, is preparing to conduct a test: this is also indicated by satellite images that show activity at the nuclear test site, although no obvious signs have yet been observed. At the same time, experts understand the importance of conducting the test for Pyongyang itself. According to some analysts, it is necessary to achieve progress in further miniaturization of nuclear warheads. That is why such forecasts appear very often - especially on the eve of important political events. Speculation about a nuclear test was made, for example, before the inauguration of South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol in 2022. Now such an event is the elections in the United States. There is a logic to conducting a nuclear weapons test after the election of an American president - in a similar way, the DPRK authorities will draw attention to the Korean Peninsula, creating a very resonant news feed.

This was said in response to the words of the commander of the State Border Protection Service, Rustam Lyubaev, who previously reported that border guards have neither the legal authority to shoot down air targets nor the weapons with which to do this. The timing of the amendments has not been announced, the military departments are trying To say that knocking down balls of this kind is too extreme a measure. The fact is that military personnel will potentially also have to be involved in this matter - only military radars can detect the balls, border guards simply do not see them. The military personnel themselves, although they observe flying objects, do not comment on their tracking - due to the sensitivity of radar information -. To assert that the border guards will really shoot down something (provided that one of the balls recently fell right in the area of ​​​​the capital's airport) would be quite populist - but intensifying the discussion about the allocation of funding for the armament of certain structures can still serve the local authorities well. borderlands, they know very well that precipitation differs from location to location: somewhere it is in the form of meatballs, somewhere it is cocaine, and somewhere cigarettes are in special demand.

Last week it became known that the Japanese destroyer Sazanami for the first time passed through the Taiwan Strait, the waters of which China officially considers internal. As they write in the press, the Japanese ship was accompanying ships from Australia and New Zealand. They were heading towards the South China Sea to conduct joint exercises with Philippine and American sailors. 🔻In this way, the Japanese authorities responded to the increased military activity of the PRC near the shores of the island state, which we talked about recently. At the same time, in Japan itself, it seems, they did not plan to openly report about the passage through the Taiwan Strait. This is indicated by the lack of confirmation or denial of this news from the authorities and the military. New Zealand also did not mention the Japanese destroyer, although they confirmed the participation of an Australian ship in the maneuvers.▪️This policy may have been chosen in order not to provoke action from the PRC, whose authorities recently softened their position on the release of water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. . Also, demonstrative statements by the Japanese could provoke a negative reaction from the Chinese public against the backdrop of spreading anti-Japanese sentiment in local social networks. In any case, the Chinese armed forces observed the passage of the ships, and a representative of the country's Foreign Ministry expressed protest. Considering that the new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will most likely continue to continue the foreign policy of the former leader of the country towards China, such a policy may be applied by the new authorities in the future. #China #Japan@rybar in collaboration with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News +Japan defense force ship sails through Taiwan Strait for 1st timeA Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force vessel has sailed through the Taiwan Strait for the first time at Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's direction, sources familiar with the matter say, triggering an immediate backlash from China.	https://t.me/rybar/64078	2024-10-03T00:34:58-07:00

This morning, the news spread in the Arab segment that Israeli aircraft struck the territory of the Russian Khmeimim airbase. In fact, it turned out that the attack was carried out on the city of Jebla, which is located nearby. Some of the missiles were shot down by air defense systems of the Russian Armed Forces, but some reached their target. The target of the attack was a warehouse used by Syrian and Iranian military personnel, and the Israelis used Dalila anti-radar cruise missiles and, according to some reports, GBU family guided bombs for the attack. There was no blow to Khmeimim himself. And in principle, an attack was unlikely at this stage, because it would lead to unnecessary escalation. But at the same time, there are even more questions from the Syrians about why Russian air defense does not help repel IDF attacks.❗️ This incident adds another brick to the wall of mistrust on the part of Syrians towards Russia. Although the target was Jebla, Israeli missiles posed a serious danger. An explosion, detonation of warehouses that were used by the Iranians, Syrians, no matter who, in such close proximity is a threat to the base. And we’re not even talking about what it looks like from the Iranian side. After all, no one is stopping the Israelis from conducting a disinformation campaign and declaring that it was the Russians who took and leaked the location of the Iranians (surely a similar narrative is already spreading through controlled media resources in the militants’ territory). And given the fact that the Israelis are now acting with impunity, and the Russian side is limiting itself exclusively to calls stop the escalation of violence and return to the negotiating table, in the future such incidents may increase in scale and lead to more tragic consequences.🔻For example, striking the territory of a Russian air base, that is, de facto territory of the Russian Federation in Syria, under the pretext that there will be an Iranian delegation or plane there. And the Iranians, let us remind you, are allies of Russia (a strategic agreement was signed not so long ago, which assumes that we, in principle, have a common enemy and a common course towards the Israelis). But in fact, these are all just words at the moment.❗️Thus, serious reputational damage is caused to the Russian contingent of troops. And the Israelis see that if the Russians did not intervene now, then they can continue further. And who will guarantee that the ultra-Orthodox government will not choose the Khmeimim airbase as its next target?#Israel #Iran #Russia@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64077	2024-10-02T23:45:31-07:00

The list includes nine structures, including the Youth Organization of Ukrainians in Georgia - Svitanok and the Jewish Cultural and Educational Fund. In accordance with local regulations, the criteria for a foreign agent include media or NGOs that received more than 20% of income due to milestone. In total, 476 organizations submitted documents for voluntary registration in the register, although the total number of such legal entities in Georgia is estimated at 31 thousand.📌 In this case, we can say that Tbilisi has begun practical steps to reduce the capabilities of various grant-eating organizations that have been active in the last 20 years took root in Georgia and actually created the collective West’s own electoral base. The goal is, through long-established methods, to bring to power a radically minded pro-Western government that would open a second front against Russia, nullifying all beneficial economic cooperation.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Summary for the morning of October 3, 2024▪️ Night strikes on enemy targets occurred in the enemy’s capital region, Kharkov, Vinnitsa, Rivne, Khmelnytsky, Cherkassy, ​​Ivano-Frankivsk, Poltava regions. In Kharkov, the enemy is trying to pass off the destruction in a high-rise building as a strike by a Russian FAB with UMPC, but the footage shows that for such a powerful type of weapon the destruction is very limited. Apparently, this is an erroneous work of air defense or the enemy’s own artillery of the Kharkov garrison, as evidenced by data from local residents who recorded the work of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ artillery in their residential areas.▪️ In the Kursk region in the Glushkovsky district, 4 enemy soldiers of the 47th were captured brigades.

Ours advanced from Sporny towards Verkhnekamensky, Belousov at night congratulated the 6th Guards Omsbr on the liberation of Verkhnekamensky.

As a result, a declaration was adopted, according to which a single map of the Turkic world will be created, as well as a working group of representatives of civil and military cartographic institutions. It would seem that there is nothing special about the exchange of cartographic information and the expansion of cooperation in this area. However, if you think carefully, thanks to such accurate data you can obtain a huge array of important information. This includes, for example, key transport arteries, large mineral deposits, terrain, and key government facilities. As well as military institutions, military units and other information of interest.📌 That is, in the OTG (and, therefore, in Turkey and the UK), there will be all the necessary information about each member of the organization, down to 3D maps of the area. Such data, as is easy to see, is used by Western countries when planning attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Russian territories. So, increased attention should be paid to these meetings with the participation of military cartographers from the OTG member countries, which will now be held regularly.#OTG #Türkiye@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/64059	2024-10-02T11:23:45-07:00
🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024 from the Children of Arbat. Colonel General Yevkurov A man who has been through many difficult political vicissitudes, but always emerged victorious. In the fall of this year, unexpectedly for everyone, he formed the most unobvious tandem, which not only brought a lot of new things into the organization of border defense work, but also largely changed the balance of forces in the military bloc of the Ministry of Defense. Evkurov began to be interested in the work of cover groups in the border region long before the Kursk events. During one of his working trips to Bryansk, he met with the commander of the cover group and also his old acquaintance from the Purvo Military District, Major General Zolotukhin. They were never friends, even in those years when Zolotukhin was the deputy chief of the district, and Yevkurov was the deputy chief of intelligence. They did not become friends later, when Zolotukhin became the leading combatant of the Western Military District, and Evkurov became the ZMO, but everything changed in July-August of this year. In the shortest possible time, taking into account the change in the disposition in the regions, it was necessary to build work with the regional governors, build interaction between security agencies and border departments, and also balance the created border security council, which Yunus-Bek Evkurov quickly dealt with. It is generally accepted to say that Evkurov today does not belong to any group and keeps to himself, which of course cannot but affect the attitude of a number of other high-ranking bosses towards him and therefore he needs support from below. Having taken one call sign between them, Evkurov and Zolotukhin managed to find a common language, which was a discovery for the old Moscow commanders and largely predetermined the further development of events: even after the Rostov events of June 2023, it became clear that Yevkurov had something to say and therefore he would play an important role in the upcoming transformation of the General Staff. Major General Zolotukhin He has no authority and does not tolerate rudeness towards himself. Most likely, under other equal circumstances, he would have long been a big boss, but his freedom-loving character openly irritates those whom he remembers as simple colonels. Vladimir Zolotukhin was among the first who, as the commander of the cover group, signaled the build-up of the enemy group in the border area. With the start of active hostilities in August, realizing that units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine could go on the offensive in the sector entrusted to him, he began to act forward: at that time, the construction of a third echelon of defense was already actively underway in the Bryansk region, but this was not enough, it was important to show the enemy intentions, and most importantly, multiple superiority in forces. To this end, having kicked out the old shielded 62s from the posts, Zolotukhin began to nightmare the gray zone, with his entire appearance showing the enemy not only his readiness to repel the attack, but also to engage in a counter battle, pushing forward the advanced units of the first echelon against the forces moving in the direction Rylsk. The Bryansk region today remains the calmest border region, and Zolotukhin himself was already publicly buried by the enemy twice during the Northern Military District. The commander himself is unlikely to seriously think about any career prospects, preferring to remain the boss in his place, but it seems that the current situational tandem can have far-reaching consequences for each of its participants.

Literally a week after the end of the Japanese-French training, a new activity was launched aimed at practicing airborne operations. According to an official announcement from the Japanese military, it plans to use US Air Force aircraft to improve the tactical skills needed to conduct airborne landings and increase the level of cooperation between the parties. The main goal of the training is to develop an effective response to various situations, including an attack on remote Japanese islands. This is the third time such exercises have been held this year; the last one took place in August. 📌 As can be seen, amid increasing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan continues to strengthen its defense capabilities through active cooperation with the US military. It is also important to note that the exercises demonstrate the Japanese desire to respond to potential threats from China. Indeed, in the event of a hypothetical outbreak of conflict in the Taiwan Strait, Japanese territories located near the island also risk coming under attack.

In Lukin’s statement, it was stated in a boorish manner that bloggers , unable to compose a text longer than 15 lines, wrote a denunciation against his subordinate. At the same time, the authors, according to him, allegedly demonstrated ignorance of the basics of journalistic and operational work. 📌 Therefore, we consider it important to state the following: ▪️ Rybar’s team conducted its own investigation using open sources and information provided to journalists of federal Russian media by the Central Election Commission of the FSB of Russia. ▪️ Working with information, first published on September 13, was reflected in a series of articles involving several journalists, oppositionists and public figures. ▪️We believe that Russian counterintelligence understands perfectly well what journalistic activity is, and they would hardly demonstrate operational materials regarding ordinary correspondents performing their official duties. However, the public (including on the main television channels of the country) was shown footage of a meeting with a British intelligence officer of this particular woman.🔻In this regard, we would like to ask the editor-in-chief of Kommersant a few questions.➖Why is it not Elena Chernenko herself who answers, but Mikhail Lukin?➖ Are Kommersant 100% sure that Chernenko’s meetings with Christopher Joyce are part of journalistic duties (or maybe an editorial assignment?), or is there something the publication doesn’t know? Elena Chernenko was generally asked about the content of the meetings or in the newspaper in absentia decided to take the line of justification?➖What will the editors do if it suddenly turns out that the journalist handed over to the enemy information entrusted to her during meetings of our government structures, highlighted the people the enemy needed and helped to reach them? Will the ID still protect such a person after such information? Or is the high rank of a journalist and a reputable publication a universal cover in any situation?➖According to Lukin, Chernenko is a highly professional journalist, and in journalism they understand perfectly well what the work of an intelligence officer is. That is, based on logic, she should have perfectly understood who she was communicating with, where the information provided could go, and what consequences this could lead to for people. Taking into account this entire list of questions, we come to the main thing: why Elena Chernenko has not yet come out from the shadows and did not tell the public about the content of the meetings? Was it an interview she conducted with an Englishman (if that was it, where are the articles?), or did he interview her, carefully recording the information he provided? We are absolutely convinced that the results of the investigations into the British spy scandal are public information and sweeping it under the rug, guided by the notorious shop-floor solidarity, means devaluing the work done and playing along with Russia’s opponents. You can get acquainted with materials on this topic by following the links:➖About British spies in Russia and the intelligence activities of the British Foreign Office➖About the propaganda department of the British Foreign Office➖Evidence for the British Foreign Office➖How Russian NGOs lobbied for migration with money from the British Foreign Office➖What unites the journalist -Kommersant- and representatives of Mi-6?

Now in the Middle East, at air bases in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, the Americans have about 60 aircraft stationed, including F-16, F-15, F-22A and even attack aircraft A-10. It is still unclear where and exactly how many aircraft will arrive this time. But to be surprised by this is a completely thankless task, given that the Pentagon uses any escalation to short-term strengthen its presence. Demonstration of force and capabilities is a standard practice that is now required to put pressure on Iran, Syria and Russia, of course, against the backdrop of increased Israeli troops in Lebanon and retaliatory Iranian strikes.#Russia #Syria #USA@rybar Support usAP NewsThe US is sending a few thousand more troops to the Middle East to boost securityThe Pentagon says is sending a -few thousand- additional troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to be prepared to defend Israel if necessary.	https://t.me/rybar/64049	2024-10-02T07:31:06-07:00
🔁🎬🖼 What kind of wooden crap is that NATO secretaries general ...	Forwarded From Topics. The main thing (GlavMedia) What kind of wooden crap is that NATO secretaries general pass on to each other - they ask on social networks. This is the so-called NATO hammer, a smaller copy of the Viking hammer. It was transferred to the alliance by Iceland in 1963 and is considered a visual reflection of the alliance’s right to judge, punish and the embodiment of indomitable power. This gavel is used at special meetings and special sessions of NATO - for example, according to former participants in such meetings, it was with it that the secretaries general of the Alliance knocked after -sentencing- Yugoslavia and Libya. In a letter leaked to Wikileaks, one of the Western diplomats reasoned - probably one day he will knock about (an attack on) Russia. Also, for some reason, the former head of NATO took this hammer to a meeting with... Russian journalists. Stoltenberg, who had recently left office, handed over this hammer - for special matters - to the new head of NATO - Rygge, who immediately used it. Iceland (the birthplace of the Althing - the great-grandfather of all parliaments) donated the same chairman's gavel to the UN in 1962. It differs only in the engraved phrase - The world must be built on the basis of laws - (we know this - a world based on rules -, thank you). The blow of the gavel announces the beginning of the meeting and its end, the approval of the agenda, the election of officials, the adoption of a resolution. And the UN gavel broke when the former chairman of the General Assembly broke it - trying to calm down Khrushchev, who had gone into a rage with his shoe, by knocking. In 2005, it turned out that the gavel of the UN chairman had disappeared - a copy of it is now in use, the original has not yet been found. During excursions around the UN, you can hear a story that at that time the UN was discussing the -Gypsy issue-, but there is no official confirmation of this. However, Russia has its own miracle hammer. More precisely - a fucking sized sledgehammer (not a fake!), which is always located in the central control center of the Strategic Missile Forces - to guarantee missile launches -.

Thus, in the United States, a ministerial meeting was held on the problem of the Islamic State, at which Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke. In his speech, he emphasized the importance of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and noted the successful work of the coalition against the Islamic State, which has grown from 12 to 87 countries. At the end of the speech, the Secretary of State announced the allocation of $148 million for operations in Africa, as well as $168 million for reconstruction in Iraq and Syria. The event as a whole shows how Americans are working to achieve their interests. They themselves created the problem (IS), they themselves set out to solve it, and now they themselves are reviving it again. By the way, in his speech Blinken also mentioned the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, saying that this will bring peace to the region. Apparently, he forgot what an important role Hezbollah played in the destruction of ISIS in Syria in 2014-2017. And the words about the allocation of money, of course, may sound good in the media, but the amounts mentioned are simply meager in comparison with the destruction that they brought behind the USA and the extremist animals they created.#USA #terrorism@rybar Support usUnited States Department of StateSecretary Antony J.

But that was not the case. It seems that no matter how much we (and you too) hide from mentions of the ubiquitous company CaseGuru - yes, the one that produces wireless headphones CGPods from - Tyumen Elon Musk - - we cannot ignore this news we can. Tyumen residents recently released a new -Customer Service Policy-, which openly stated that dogs and foreign agents are not allowed to enter and refuse to work with a number of clients, including: Ilya Varlamov, Yuri Dud, Lyubov Sobol, Dmitry Muratov and other popular liberal liberals views. Haters who don’t like the brand also fall under this category. We are of course curious how exactly CaseGuru will monitor the political preferences of its clients and how the FAS will look at such measures. But the very fact of the appearance of such restrictions on the Russian electronics market looks like a precedent. It’s even more interesting whether this case will become the beginning of a flash mob for other companies that might want to hype in the same way. We'll find out soon.#Russia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64045	2024-10-02T06:45:47-07:00

At the same time, as we said earlier, we are not talking about one nuclear power plant, but about the development of the industry as a whole, since Kazakhstan will need two or three stations in different regions of the country in the future.▪️The campaign period passed quietly and calmly. Supporters of the construction of the nuclear power plant formed a people's headquarters and held events in different regions of the country. The number of supporters of the construction of a nuclear power plant has grown to 72.9%, the turnout should be more than 60% of voters.▪️However, this blissful picture is spoiled by one circumstance. All protest activity was concentrated on social networks and pro-Western Internet sites. Active campaigning against the construction of a Russian nuclear power plant was carried out by the NPP is not needed platform, created by five Kazakh eco-activists, financed by USAID and structures of the Soros Foundation. Colleagues from Sputnik explained the structure of the platform well in their video. ▪️It’s funny that the oppositionists criticized the voting procedure, during which citizens were not given the right to choose who will build the station. As if such issues were no longer within the competence of the relevant structures, and if it had been immediately stated that the station would be built by a French or American company with no relevant experience, and not a proven Russian one, then the environmental situation in the country would have immediately improved.🔻Although there are doubts about the success of the referendum no one has, a new line of attack from pro-Western platforms, along with behind-the-scenes pressure and lobbying for Western risky projects, will cause many more problems and will shake the socio-political life of Kazakhstan until the announcement of the contractor. #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport usTelegramSputnik Near Abroad🇰🇿 For money - against!

Then there was no rapid advance by the IDF, and the media reported information about exchanges of fire in the border zone. However, today for the first time there was confirmation of Israeli units crossing the Lebanese border - they entered the settlements of Al-Adisa and Maroun al-Ras. The battles in these settlements were confirmed by Hezbollah representatives, although they focused on the significant losses of the Israelis. ▪️The day before, the 36th division of the Israel Defense Forces was deployed to the Lebanese-Israeli border, which includes the 1st Golani infantry brigade and the 188th armored brigade, previously involved in combat operations in the Gaza Strip. At the moment, forces of 98 and 36 divisions are operating near the border with Lebanon, while units of the 162 division are located in the border - Philadelphia corridor - in the south of the Palestinian enclave. Units of another reserve division (252) are located in the Netzarim corridor. ▪️Yesterday, the IDF press service called on civilians to evacuate from more than 20 settlements in Lebanon, located both near the border and on the Mediterranean coast. It is noteworthy that Marun al-Ras fell into the evacuation zone, but Al-Adisa did not. ▪️Throughout the night and morning, the Israelis attacked the border and rear settlements of Lebanon. More than ten hits hit the southern suburbs of Beirut, where two communication stations were destroyed.▪️In the afternoon, confirmation of the presence of members of the Egoz unit in the settlements of Maroun al-Ras and Al-Adisa appeared. Hezbollah fighters responded with ambushes, incursions and missile launches at nearby IDF targets. At the same time, the Israeli media published information about the outbreak of a shootout in southern Lebanon, which resulted in the death of two IDF fighters. The incident was commented differently in Arabic-language media, reporting a successful ambush, which allegedly wounded 35 Israelis. This information has not been officially confirmed; indirect evidence of this is the footage of eyewitnesses who filmed the evacuation of wounded military personnel by helicopter and the same statements by the IDF press service about the death of two IDF fighters during an operation in southern Lebanon. 🔻And although the incident with the successful ambush instilled in the Arabic-language media some confidence in the positive outcome of the conflict with the Israelis, such statements, to put it mildly, are very premature: one successful ambush is just a drop in the ocean. Moreover, against the backdrop of the absolute superiority of the Israelis in the air, numbers and the quality of weapons, as well as heavy losses of Hezbollah command personnel as a result of previous Israeli operations.

In Kharkov, since the beginning of the Northern Military District, they have been producing all kinds of components for UAVs and missiles, including electronics. Armored vehicles and aircraft are repaired in Nikolaev. Well, in occupied Zaporozhye they are producing aircraft engines with all their might.🔻That is, if the same factories in Kyiv or production exported to Transcarpathia can only be reached with cruise and aeroballistic missiles, then enterprises like Motor Sich or Kommunara are in the affected area not only OTRK, but also in some places even new aerial bombs with UMPC. But there has been no systematic fire attack on these objects since the beginning of the Northeast Military District. From time to time they became targets of the Russian Armed Forces, but the attacks were most often single and greatly extended in time, which allowed the enemy to repair the damage and continue working. Yes, it is not easy to destroy them, but a one-time large salvo of missiles at key workshops of a particular enterprise will solve this problem. The effect will not be long in coming: for example, in past years, one very good raid had previously significantly slowed down Ukrainian developments in the field of missile technology. However, for a combination of reasons, priority in systematic massive strikes is now apparently given to other objects in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime.

🇺🇸 About the results of the debates of candidates for vice pres...	🇺🇸 About the results of the debates of candidates for vice-presidential candidates of the United States In the States, important debates of candidates for vice-presidential candidates, Republican J.D. Vance and Democrat Tim Walz, have ended. The meeting, which took place on CBS, was very different from similar events involving Trump, Biden and Harris: to everyone’s amazement, both speakers demonstrated a high level of political culture and competence on many pressing issues. ▪️J.D. Vance was very confident and cultured - he did not interrupt his opponent , skillfully parried his attacks, competently attacked and skillfully handled the facts. Years of work as a lawyer taught him to behave well and maintain composure while delivering a speech, so the politician never misspoke or hesitated. Importantly, Vance demonstrated a high level of awareness of current American economic indicators. In doing so, he made a significant contribution to winning over Trump's undecided voters who were concerned about their wallets. He also prevented the host from casting doubt on the migrant crisis in Springfield, Ohio, by citing statistics showing that illegal immigrants had become illegal overnight. make up 25% of the city's population. The answer turned out to be so inconvenient for the presenters sympathetic to the Democrats that the politician was turned off.▪️Tim Walz, against the backdrop of Kamala Harris’ speech, showed himself clearly better - he defended himself well, was well versed in the pressing problems for the United States, and treated his opponent with respect, without making mocking faces and without throwing disdainful glances. And yet, the politician often repeated memorized theses, resorted to populism and had difficulty adapting on the fly, which ultimately played a cruel joke on him. Thus, he confused Iran and Israel, blurted out that he had good relations with many school shooters. . Walz also noticeably swam when he was reminded of his own lie about being in China during the events in Tiananmen Square: he could not get out of it, giving an incoherent speech about his childhood in Nebraska.🔻As a result of the event, the entire American press recognized that the debate was outstanding - like in the good old 60s. Few people doubted Vance’s victory—even the pro-democracy CNN recognized his triumph, albeit with the caveat that it would not have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election. However, here CNN is clearly disingenuous—even though the debate discredited the previous confrontation between Trump and Harris, which was quite primitive and downright radiated mutual hatred and disdain, Vance brought the necessary composure, civility and the highest level of competence on all issues to the Trump campaign. #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usCNNTakeaways from the vice presidential debate between Vance and Walz | CNN PoliticsThe vice presidential debate between Ohio Sen.

A solemn ceremony on this occasion took place in Balti in the Moldova motorized rifle brigade, a permanent participant in NATO exercises. The event was also attended by the Ambassador of Romania.▪️The ruling PAS party in July approved amendments to the defense agreement between Romania and Moldova on mutual support for the armies of both countries in military operations under the auspices of the UN, OSCE, NATO, EU.▪️Then the bill sparked discussions about the actual unification of the armies Moldova and Romania at the international level. The office of President Maia Sandu, as usual, branded such statements as -disinformation.- 🔻Sending Moldovan military personnel to the Romanian contingent under the auspices of the EU is just another step towards the loss of Moldovan sovereignty. Military personnel of both countries constantly conduct joint military exercises, and in Bucharest they take control of the training of the Moldovan military.

The Israelis confirmed their words with footage from operations in Aita al-Shaab, Kafr Kil and Mays al-Jabal. The footage shows how IDF fighters enter the underground structures of the Lebanese group, where they discover neatly stacked weapons and ammunition, as well as a fairly extensive network of tunnels. All this reinforces the general message of the statements of the Israeli command - Hezbollah planned to attack Israel like the invasion of Hamas militants on October 7, 2023, thereby implementing a certain plan for the occupation of the Galilee. So that the listeners are left with no questions, they are told what would await them if it were implemented - - the massacre of innocent men, women and children -. And everything would be fine, but an attentive viewer should have questions, the general essence of which will boil down to misunderstanding the absence in the video materials of clashes with the Lebanese group during the capture of such important objects. If they were empty, then why were they abandoned and why leave weapons and ammunition there in that case? Be that as it may, the Israelis are once again trying to play their favorite card with the status of a victim, this time only a potential one. This, among other things, justifies the current operation - Arrows of the North - as a result of which the number of dead and injured amounts to thousands of Lebanese. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64039	2024-10-02T02:21:01-07:00

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide💰🇺🇸 It recently became known that billionaire George Soros, before the US elections, bought the Audacy platform, which unites more than 200 radio stations, the total audience of which exceeds 165 million people. Republican congressmen are confident that the approval of the deal by the Federal Communications Commission ( The FCC has been politicized and seen as an attempt to interfere in the 2024 election as the agency has - in an unprecedented way accelerated required reviews of broadcast licenses, bypassing its standard procedures and regulations -. As a result, the billionaire became the owner of the Audacy platform without the necessary national security checks that could have taken for more than a year.🔻Republicans' concerns are understandable: back in July, Soros and his son Alex, the current chairman of the Open Society Foundation (recognized as an undesirable organization in the Russian Federation), supported the nomination of US Vice President Kamala Harris as a candidate for the post of head of state in November elections. At the same time, Harris’ connections with Soros have been traced for a long time. It is known that while Harris served as California prosecutor (2011-2017), Soros financed a number of her legal initiatives, and later donated money to her election campaign for the US Senate (2017-2021). Since then, the politician has often given speeches at events organized by the billionaire. Entrepreneur Elon Musk, after the news appeared about the Soros family's support for Harris's candidacy, announced that she would become another puppet of the billionaire. In addition, Soros is a financial -megadonor- of the US Democratic Party and, according to open data, donated through organizations controlled by him to Democrats' electoral needs in 2024 are at least $15.6 million. However, it is obvious that the billionaire actually invested much more money, because even the purchase of Audacy is estimated at $400 million.#USA #Soros @pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram FRESHNESS❗️It turns out that the US Federal Communications Commission has given the green light to George Soros' purchase of 220 more than radio stations ahead of the November presidential election.

🖼 🇦🇫🇹🇯🏴 About possible sabotage on the border of Tajikistan...	🇦🇫🇹🇯🏴 About possible sabotage on the border of Tajikistan and Afghanistan Interesting news comes from Tajikistan: from September 24 to October 15, along the border section with the provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar in Afghanistan, a maximum danger regime has been introduced, which is why vacations have been canceled for personnel. The reason This was prompted by information received about the activity of militants - Jamaat Ansarullah - in the north of Takhar province. In mid-September, a group of extremists arrived in the Navabad area and have already carried out reconnaissance at the border posts of Ai-Khanum and Kaflotun. The militants, Jamaat Ansarullah, intend to conduct a similar assessment of vulnerabilities in the security system of border areas at the border crossing of Hamadoni in Khatlon province in the next few days. Against this background, the Tajik authorities have strengthened control over the border, established additional patrols, organized drone surveillance and limited foot traffic between the countries. A very non-trivial turn considering recent years, when the Taliban movement came to power in Afghanistan. From that moment on, such events practically stopped happening. But in this case we are talking about Jamaat Ansarullah, a group that has long been trying to destabilize the situation in Tajikistan, and its militants previously took refuge in Afghanistan before 2021. Although the leadership of the Taliban announced the destruction of terrorism, individual cells continue to function on the territory of the country, and given the difficult situation inside Afghanistan, there is no escape from them yet. In addition, it is worth remembering the currently popular trends about the danger of IS and other terrorist groups for the countries of Central Asia. -An unexpected attack by militants in the border area could serve as another reason for the United States and allies to lobby for their services in the region.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇲🇽🇱🇹🚬Those who are interested in the state of affairs with smuggling in the American borderlands know very well that the precipitation differs from location to location: somewhere it is in the form of meatballs, somewhere it is cocaine, and in some places cigarettes are in particular demand. Colleagues wrote about how, for many years now, various types of flying objects have been penetrating Lithuanian territory and are being used by smugglers to deliver cigarettes to the desired address. Strictly speaking, cigarettes are very popular both in Lithuania and neighboring Latvia - at one time it was considered good manners to grab a block as a gift, since you were traveling from Russia or Belarus. Then this block could even reach Ireland - along with a large number of Baltic citizens working there. Strictly speaking, there is no sensation in the topic. If we talk about the methods of delivering contraband, they have been diverse since ancient times and are constantly evolving - otherwise this craft would have died out long ago. We also observed the air delivery of prohibited goods on the US-Mexico border - I don’t remember them being shot down there, there are simply patrolled points where the goods can be picked up from the ground faster than the customer. And the border there is bare, unlike Lithuania, surrounded by forests, where it is much easier to go to one of the residents of border villages who sell smoke with much less risk. As for the story about the scandal among Lithuanian officials on the topic of who will deal with the problem, two facts are overlooked: Some of the local officials are clearly involved in smuggling (including cigarettes), without the participation of border services, separate episodes they don't roll. 🔸In two weeks, elections to the Lithuanian Seimas are due to take place, against the backdrop of which the political situation in any country is worsening, shifting responsibility onto each other and other delights begin, designed to highlight the shortcomings of the characters, which theoretically could affect something. I don’t rule it out, that the scandal with the air delivery of cigarettes will be used just for the latter. #Mexico #Lithuania@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]TelegramV Z - VIEW.RULithuania suddenly suffered large-scale air raids from hundreds of illegal air targets.

Recently, a meeting was held in Tashkent between the Minister of Digital Technologies of Uzbekistan Sherzod Shermatov and a delegation of the American company RFA. The company is preparing to obtain resident status -IT Park Uzbekistan-, demonstrating interest in using the Zero Risk program, and in the future plans to open an IT center in the republic. 📌RFA has worked with more than 800 hedge funds, investment companies and asset managers. The range of services offered includes cloud solutions, IT service management, cybersecurity, data management, as well as application services and detection and response systems. ▪️Here it is necessary to clarify that the core of RFA is the Microsoft corporate operating environment, one of the blocks is Office 365. Cloud technologies are provided on the basis of Azure, and the system, of course, contains a security threat assessment block (Threat Intelligence). Collectively, the proposed solution is called Automated Incident Response Engine (-AiRE-). Therefore, we are talking about establishing control over financial transactions, electronic document management, monitoring systems, security, analysis and data processing. In fact, most of the IT sector in Uzbekistan will be tied to one service provider, which will simply be a block in the global Microsoft system. RFA is a financial all-inclusive from globalists.▪️Another interesting point: on the official resources of Uzbekistan, RFA is declared as American, but it is registered in London. Moreover, the entire management of the company indicates London offices as contact information.▪️The start of work in the Republic of RFA is a continuation of the systemic efforts of the West to take control of the strategic sectors of the economy of Uzbekistan, which we wrote about earlier. We are talking about preparing the IT infrastructure before listing Uzbek securities on the stock exchange. And the placement of securities of Uzbek companies will be handled by RFA, all financial transactions and access to funds will be controlled by RFA. Without this digital intermediary, most of the economy of Uzbekistan will simply be deprived of the opportunity to function and develop. Development will be possible only if all projects are agreed upon by RFA management. 🔻With a high probability, the decision was influenced by the promises of Western curators to create jobs, open access for goods from Uzbekistan to the markets of developed countries, attract investments, and even the opportunity to conduct an IPO of their own companies, withdraw money to anonymous accounts completely legally and safely. Only the curators left out a small detail - from the moment the system is fully deployed, it is they who will control most of the economy of Uzbekistan, tied to third-party information services. Uzbekistan, like many Central Asian countries, lacks IT potential sufficient to create independent platforms. Therefore, the country's leadership preferred a ready-made solution out of the box from RFA. Time will tell how soon this box will turn into a Pandora's box for the leadership and population of Uzbekistan. #Great Britain #USA #Central Asia #Uzbekistan @rybarSupport usNews from Central AsiaThe RFA company plans to open an IT center in Uzbekistan - News from Central AsiaMeeting of the Minister of Digital Technologies of Uzbekistan Sherzod Shermatov with a delegation of the American company RFA was held in Tashkent.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Indeed, Iran’s statements that as a result of a strike on Israel, IDF military bases were hit, Israeli aircraft and infrastructure were destroyed, look, let’s say, controversial. I won't go deeper. Just here's one historical episode for you. So, 1818. The Persian Shah Abbas Mirza writes to the Russian ambassador in Tehran, General Ermolov (yes, the one who fought in the Caucasus) about his victories over the Afghans. The Persian-Afghan war was just going on. -Our victorious troops are always protected by the cavalry regiments of the heavenly forces, and therefore the actions of the enemy on the battlefield have the same power against us as the stars of heaven against the rising sun. Our flaming sword, aimed at defeating the enemy, is lightning, burning everything. From the dust carried by our invincible cavalry, the battlefield became so dark that if the fire opened by the sarbaz had not illuminated it, the arrows that took life would not have found a way to pierce the enemy’s hearts. The battle lasted for five hours, and the combatants could not distinguish between white and black. Finally, at sunset, from the fire of the cannons crushing the Caucasus Mountains, the foundation of the enemy troops was destroyed, and the unfortunate banner of the enemy was overthrown. Ermolov, of course, knew perfectly well how everything really was there. But it was completely the opposite. Ermolov reported the following to the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Nesselrode: -The Khorosans, together with the Afghans, defeated the Persian troops, and the damage was terrible. The commander of them bought his head with a large sum of money, and the Shah, although he continued to command the troops, but, having gathered large forces, himself went to the enemy. The inhabitants of Tehran believe, however, that he will not go far, fearing that the slightest failure under his own leadership will make a bad impression among the people. Despite the failure, however, false news of victories is announced and celebrations are celebrated. Now Iranian statements are somewhat reminiscent of a letter about a flaming sword. Although, in fairness, it is worth noting that even if some important targets were hit in Israel, no one will ever know about it.

And in the south of the enclave there were clashes again east of Al-Fokhari. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out operations in at least ten localities in the region, detaining suspects with links to Hamas. Violent clashes took place in Nablus, where four IDF fighters were wounded. The situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border has further deteriorated as the Israelis announced the ground phase of the operation. Nevertheless, so far everything is limited to skirmishes along the border and strikes by the sides on each other’s targets. During the night, Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles into Israel. Most of them were intercepted by air defense systems, the rest mostly fell in vacant lots. At the same time, preparations are being made for a retaliatory attack by the IDF. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botSituation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone (ru; en)Situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border (ru; en)#digest #map #Israel #Palestine # report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64026	2024-10-01T13:22:28-07:00

❗️🇮🇱🇮🇷 Interim results of Iran's strike on Israel Two months ...	❗️🇮🇱🇮🇷 Interim results of Iran's attack on Israel Two months after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and four days after the death of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, the Iranians decided on the promised massive attack on Israel. ▪️According to recent estimates, about 200 ballistic missiles were fired into the country, but a significant number were intercepted by Israeli air defense systems. At the same time, American air defense systems were also involved in repelling the attack. ▪️Videos were distributed on the Internet that confirmed hits in individual areas, but at the moment the list of military targets hit is unknown. According to the footage, it is much more likely that the main place where the missiles will fall is wasteland. Although video footage of the aftermath of the strikes has already begun to appear in the media, Israeli censorship works well enough that only fallen debris or destruction of civilian objects leaks onto the Internet. ▪️Nevertheless, statements about the effectiveness of the raid are circulated in Arabic-language and Iranian media. Fars observers claim that at least 80% of the missiles reached their targets, and Shafaqna reported that at least 20 Israeli F-35s were destroyed. Another target was allegedly a cluster of tanks near the Netzarim intersection in the center of the Gaza Strip.▪️At least several rockets fell in the West Bank - one of them killed one and injured seven local Palestinians. Two more Israelis were wounded by shrapnel in Tel Aviv. There are also reports of victims who were injured on the way to bomb shelters. ▪️The Iranian attack could have been significantly more effective in the event of simultaneous launches also from Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, but this did not happen. ▪️All sorts of fakes have circulated on the Internet, including reverse footage of air defense missile launches, posing as arrival footage, and even the arrival of a Ukrainian UAV in Moscow City. ▪️It is noteworthy that literally before the Iranian attack in Tel Aviv, there was a terrorist attack in the Jaffa area: there, two men with machine guns shot people on a tram, after which they opened fire on passers-by. According to the latest information, eight people were killed, and the attackers were killed by Israeli security forces. Against the backdrop of the incident with the missile strike, speculation appeared on the Internet about the connection between both events - allegedly the terrorist attack could have been used as a distraction. However, such a version raises questions rather than trust. 🔻Despite the relatively small amount of information about the consequences of the attack, its overall results are clear and do not differ significantly from the April Iranian raid on Israeli territory. And the point here is that for Iran the main goal was not so much to inflict significant damage, but to create the desired picture for its audience, wounded by the latest actions of the Israelis. At the same time, we must pay tribute: the mostly outdated missiles launched by the Iranians are much cheaper than those spent by Israel and allied missile defense and missile defense systems. So, in economic terms, the attack was beneficial: another question is that this is unlikely to be enough in the current conditions.#Israel #Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64024	2024-10-01T11:58:05-07:00
🖼 🇲🇱 The situation in northern Mali: an attempt at revenge for...	🇲🇱 The situation in northern Mali: an attempt at revenge for Tin-Zautin Ambush, staged at the end of July by the so-called separatists. Azawad, with the support of radical Islamists from a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda - Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin - caused serious damage to the prestige of both the local armed forces and Russian military instructors.🔻With the goal of still conquering the last major stronghold of militants in northern Mali, government forces have recently stepped up operations in the region. ▪️After the accumulation of forces in the area of ​​the Kidal airport, a column consisting of fifty cars and armored personnel carriers moved towards Tin-Zautin. It is noteworthy that pro-government Tuareg militias also participate in it, who helped develop the route. ▪️At the moment, the convoy passed through the village of Tin Essako, where it stopped briefly due to the fact that militants were spotted at the point. After the latter escaped, the convoy continued moving, reaching the Amshaknshnar Valley.▪️This time, the leadership chose a more competent approach in planning the operation, spending most of the time outside the heights from where they could be detected or behind which militants could hide. In addition, the movement of the columns was preceded by active airstrikes against militants and reconnaissance sorties.❗️The unique case of using mock-ups in African operations also speaks to the quality of preparation. So, the militants, following the convoy, came across a model -Pantsir-S1-, which was considered real.🔻So far, all the observed action gives us hope that past mistakes in underestimating the enemy and overestimating their own capabilities were taken into account, and, given that before the ill-fated There are less than 100 km left of the city, in the coming days we will learn about the results of this operation.

The most significant advances are recorded both on the northern flanks and southeast of Kurakhovo. ▪️West of Novotoretsk, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces pushed the enemy to the right bank of the Kazenny Torets River, and in the Grodovka area they broke through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, occupying two large strongholds. Now the path to Moscow and Mirnograd located behind it is open for the Russian army.▪️To the south, during the battles at the Nikolaevka-Sukhoi Yar line, units of the Russian Armed Forces advanced west of the Novogrodovskaya mine, gaining a foothold in the forest belt on the approaches to Lysovka. According to some reports, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have also lost control over the waste heap of the Novogrodovskaya No. 2 mine, but this information has not yet been confirmed by objective control personnel. ▪️West of Marinovka, an armored group of Russian troops attacked Ukrainian formations along the M-30 highway at the northern entrance to Selidovo. And on the southern outskirts of the city, paratroopers of the Russian Armed Forces landed near the city hospital, where they had not been able to gain a foothold before.▪️ At the same time, Russian troops started fighting on the southern outskirts of Tsukurino and in the area of ​​the St. Basil the Great mine. At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces are knocking out the enemy from the forest belts along the railway track, moving from the Selidovskaya mine and launching attacks from Ukrainsk. ▪️To the south, the Russian Armed Forces knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from positions between Ostry and neighboring Maksimilyanovka, creating the preconditions for reaching the northern outskirts of the latter. At the same time, strikes continue to be launched against the few Ukrainian Armed Forces groups remaining in Ostroy, and unmanned aircraft are systematically destroying enemy equipment and infrastructure facilities in the Kurakhovo area.❗️The situation in the fields west of Nevelskoye has become somewhat clearer, from where no reports have been received for a long time, no frames. And the published statements of certain media about the occupation of this area by fighters of the Russian Armed Forces caused a certain skepticism, especially against the backdrop of the repeated liberation of the settlement in the Network. Nevertheless, in light of the incoming information about the advance of Russian troops in the lowlands near Zhelanny First and the eponymous Second, we can talk about the long-awaited occupation of the fields west of Nevelskoye, albeit with the assumption of a focal presence of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Judging by reports from the field, the large At-Takala airbase and a rural airfield south of the city of Izra, as well as the positions of Syrian anti-aircraft gunners located in their vicinity, came under fire. Arabic-language media published information about the work of air defense in these areas, however, as a rule, this does not mean the interception of even the majority of the ammunition, especially taking into account, to put it mildly, the battered Syrian air defense and the constant decommissioning of the remaining systems. Apparently, a possible reason for the raid on aviation facilities could have been Iran's supply of ammunition for supported forces, which is not surprising in the context of the unfolding events in southern Lebanon.

Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️NATO continues to form new threats to the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian NavyFrom September 10 to 27, the alliance's annual maritime exercises REPMUS 24 took place in the territorial waters of Portugal. The exercises included testing of sea and air unmanned systems during anti-submarine, mine countermeasures and reconnaissance operations. The results of the maneuvers and the best weapons will be used in the NATO anti-submarine barrier concept, which involves the deployment of a network of autonomous vehicles to detect and track the activity of submarines. An interesting point was the active use of Portuguese TEKEVER AR3 and AR5 UAVs for reconnaissance, surveillance and reconnaissance on land as part of these exercises and at sea. For the first time, a new modification of the AR5 was tested, capable of installing sonar buoys, which made it possible to detect and track underwater targets. In addition, the capabilities of radar, cameras and communications have been improved, which has increased the reconnaissance characteristics of TEKEVER drones. Since 2023, this type of UAV has been actively used by the Ukrainian side for reconnaissance of the Black Sea and the Crimean coast. TEKEVER was repeatedly recorded during missile attacks in Crimea, escorting BEC, as well as attacks by Ukrainian DRGs on the peninsula. Now, the new capabilities of the drone will allow the enemy to deploy a network of sonar buoys in the Black Sea and organize tracking of the movement of submarines of the Black Sea Fleet, which are the only ones protected from Ukrainian attacks naval drones.✨While the bureaucratic war of the Black Sea Fleet with orders and instructions is still ongoing, the enemy is improving its weapons and the tactics of their use.

As the signing of the peace treaty approaches, one should wait for additional decisions of the Constitutional Court, which will actually allow changing the Constitution of Armenia without a referendum and without the adoption of amendments by parliament.▪️It is significant that the decision of the Constitutional Court was on the same days when Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was in New York and held talks with Turkish President Recep Erdogan. On the same day as the decision of the Constitutional Court, a meeting of the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan was also held with the mediation of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 🔻The Americans, portraying the role of a mediator in the signing of the Armenian-Azerbaijani peace treaty, are persistently rushing Pashinyan with the constitutional changes that are required in Baku. When an obvious slippage began with the constitutional referendum, which would have delayed the conclusion of peace for another couple of years, the administration of the Armenian Prime Minister, through the mediation of the West, decided to take the path of least resistance, relying on amendments to the Constitutional Court. #Armenia #Azerbaijan #USA @rybarSupport usAnadolu AgencyThe Constitutional Court of Armenia approved the regulation on commissions for the demarcation of the Azerbaijani-Armenian border.

Recalling the previously concluded agreement on the strategic partnership between Kazakhstan and Great Britain, the United States also decided to designate its zones of influence in Kazakhstan.🔻Using this article as an example It’s clear to see how Kazakhstan is seen in the White House - as a gas station and as a transit station, through which dependence on Russia and China can be reduced. Therefore, the struggle for Kazakhstan is quite understandable, given the country's access to critical resources, such as uranium. #Kazakhstan #USA@rybar Support us The National InterestCalibrating U.S.-Kazakh CooperationU.S. policy toward Kazakhstan should focus primarily on nuclear nonproliferation, rare earth minerals, and enhanced trade routes.	https://t.me/rybar/64000	2024-10-01T07:03:58-07:00

Local residents reported several series of attacks across the city, which began at approximately 02:00. The SAR Ministry of Defense reported that most of the ammunition had been intercepted. The hits occurred in the western part of the Al-Mezze area, where foreign embassies are located and a military airfield is located. According to footage that appeared on the Internet, at least one of the targets of the attack was a certain car. However, it is currently unknown who was in it. Also killed during the raid was the famous Syrian TV presenter Safaa Ahmed, who lived in a building not far from the struck car. The Arab media have already announced that she died not from a rocket fragment, but from a targeted strike on her apartment (however, why spend a missile on a TV presenter is unclear). Syrian opposition sources also disseminated information about a series of hits on the positions of air defense crews, who tried to repel the attack. However, it is not possible to confirm these statements given the lack of personnel. 🔻So far, Israeli troops have been able to quite successfully combine ongoing operations in the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon with sporadic strikes on Syria, gradually gaining political points and eliminating everyone who could pose a danger to the ultra-Orthodox government. It is noteworthy that the combination of massive strikes on the same Lebanon, with periodic raids on Syrian territory, allows it to strongly influence public sentiment and use this as leverage on Iran’s positions in both countries.

The operation itself has been going on for a week - previously everything was limited to air raids on Hezbollah targets in both border and rear settlements. However, the expected rapid advance of the Israeli troops did not follow; at the moment, only relatively familiar skirmishes are reported in the border zone, including near the small village of Rmeish, where maneuver groups of Israelis operated at night. At the same time, false information is being spread on the Internet about the entry of IDF units into a particular locality or about the complete withdrawal of Lebanese units beyond the Litani River. However, such reports are refuted by both Israeli and Arabic-language media. At the same time, judging by the increasingly frequent statements by the press service of the Israel Defense Forces about the need for all residents of southern Lebanon to urgently evacuate to the north of the country and remain there until the end of hostilities, the Israeli offensive may begin in the near future after observing the necessary politeness. Moreover, That approval for the ground operation has already been received from the United States - last night, American Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, after a conversation with his Israeli colleague Galant, expressed support for the IDF offensive in southern Lebanon. The stated goal of the operation is the destruction of Hezbollah infrastructure near Israel's northern border. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar❗️🇮🇱🇱🇧 The IDF launched a limited military ground operation against Hezbollah targets in the border zone of southern Lebanon.

Episodes of escapes of Ukrainian men from the TCC, often captured on video, are replete with either comical or tragic events. And sometimes both. The story of one such escape is in our new issue. Synopsis: Not everyone living in the so-called territory. Ukrainian male citizens are still ready to defend certain -ideals- with arms in hand. We can safely say: the number of such people has decreased significantly over more than two years of a special military operation. But the number of those who do not want to be on the line of combat contact has increased manifold. At the territorial recruitment centers (TRCs), there are no longer not only queues, but even small streams of volunteers ready to go to the front even tomorrow. At the same time, military commissars need to recruit people in any case and constantly replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - young and old, fit and not so fit, fighters. More and more videos are coming from the territory of Ukraine with harsh arrests, which are more reminiscent of robbery attacks. Videos where groups of Ukrainians are detained while trying to cross the border make an equally painful impression. However, this is better than being shot while trying to escape - and recently such stories have appeared...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🔁🖼 How the West regulates migration from Central Asia to Russia...	Forwarded From Two MajorsHow the West regulates migration from Central Asia to Russia - article by uv. Comrade Fisherman✨Note that the difficult situation with illegal migration in Russia already in 2021 was reflected in the National Security Strategy of Russia in the form of a clause on Achieving the goals of ensuring state and public security by countering illegal migration, strengthening control over migration flows, social and cultural adaptation and integration of migrants. That is, the task was set by the Supreme Commander before the war. Moreover, already in 2023, the provisions of the Concept of the State Migration Policy of the Russian Federation for 2019 - 2025 were changed, as new challenges arose. At the same time, according to this doctrinal document, an economic justification is provided - in 2012-2017, the migration influx into the Russian Federation compensated for the natural population decline and became a source of additional labor resources for the national economy. The factor of valuable troubleshooting specialists is also stated that a significant proportion consists of low-skilled workers, whose demand is often determined by lower costs compared to the use of labor of citizens of the Russian Federation. Under these conditions, migration to Russia of the broad labor masses is objectively conditioned and inevitable. And this, as Rybar found out, was taken advantage of by the enemy. The American USAID, which was considered undesirable, could not be used. Therefore, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) acted as the main conductor of initiatives on the topic. Funding was provided by the World Bank, the UK Department for International Development and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Surprisingly for us, on the IOM website Rybar found as many as four completed programs in the field of labor migration to Russia, implemented from 2007 to 2021. ▪️ Project on Labor Migration in Central Asia (2007-2009) ▪️ Regional Program on Labor Migration in Central Asia and Russia (2010-2013) ▪️ Regional Program on Migration (2014-2015) ▪️ Facilitating Migration in the Central Asia Corridor — Russia- (2021) Details are in Rybar’s article.✨⭐️Probably, it’s really time to double-check all agreements with the UN and its structures involved in the field of migration to Russia. If only because the UN Headquarters is in New York, and the IOM is in Geneva, Switzerland, whose inflatable neutrality is a thing of the past. It is unlikely that Western structures will sincerely help Russia in solving its problems. But to cheat, get money and cause damage to Russia is always welcome.

According to the official, if the republic joins the EU, Europeans will be able to buy Moldovan lands. ▪️Mazheiks assures that for Moldova the massive sale of agricultural land to foreigners will be a plus, since many villages in the republic are dying out. ▪️Mijaix’s statement caused a stir, so Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Dorin Recean had to call the discussion of the EU ambassador’s statements disinformation.▪️At the same time, Prime Minister Recean promised that separate negotiations would be held in Chisinau with the EU to put a limit on the sale of Moldovan lands . True, it is not clear why any exceptions should suddenly be made for Moldovans in Brussels.▪️In addition, ex-Prime Minister Vlad Filat published examples from EU legislation, according to which a country cannot have a ban on the sale of land to foreigners upon joining the union.▪️ Opposition politician Renoto Usatii proposed enshrining in the Constitution a ban on the sale of Moldovan lands to foreigners. Moreover, agriculture is a strategic and key sector of the economy for Moldova. Usatii also noted that the citizens of Moldova are not even explained the meaning of joining the EU and the main points of negotiations are not disclosed. By the way, the other day in Moldova they blocked a website where they were trying to analyze the consequences of European integration for the republic. The revelations of EU Ambassador Mazeix clearly spoiled the election campaign of Sandu, who, with the help of a referendum on European integration, will try to enshrine the norm on joining the EU in the Constitution. However, the gross manipulations of Sandu and the Central Election Commission of Moldova, controlled by the West, are aimed at ensuring the desired results in the presidential elections and referendum on October 20. Moreover, the authorities in Chisinau have been openly ignoring the demands of Moldovan farmers for the last few years, who are massively going bankrupt amid the uncontrolled transit of Ukrainian grain, crisis and drought. As we have noted many times, Moldova has fallen into the trend of destroying national agriculture for the sake of such global corporations as Blackrock, which are also buying up the lands of the so-called.

From the mouth High-level officials are increasingly speaking not only about the threat of the formation of ethno-criminal enclaves with radical Islamist ideology within the country, but also the replacement of the Russian population and other indigenous Russian peoples. However, international organizations and globalist structures have a certain merit in this. Under the guise of development assistance, they financed and promoted initiatives to stimulate migration to Russia, and this continued until the start of the Northern Military District. We talk about the role of the relevant UN agency in this process, as well as departments of unfriendly states and NGOs financed by them, in our new article. #globalism #UN #Russia #article@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63984	2024-10-01T00:04:11-07:00

South-east of the village, another Leopard 2A6 of the Ukrainian formations was hit. In other matters, it could be the same tank that took part in the attack on the village a week earlier. Footage of Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on Krasnooktyabrsky appeared on the Internet, which confirms the presence of the Russian Armed Forces in the village and confident control over it. During the day, statements were also recorded about the withdrawal of enemy forces from Medvezhye under the onslaught of Russian troops, but this has not yet been confirmed by footage from the field.🔻In the Korenevsky district, Ukrainian formations are attacking in the vicinity of Kremyany, where they had previously gained a foothold in the forest belts to the east. Russian Aerospace Forces are processing the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces with FABs with UMPC; no attempts have been recorded to knock out the enemy on the ground.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, a Russian armored group attacked the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces south of the Plekhovo-Borki line. Several large forest belts and part of the border from Kucherovo to the Brodina gully came under the control of Russian troops. At the same time, the scale of the advance is not completely clear, since the footage of objective control was published by the enemy, who does not benefit from highlighting the successes of the Russian Armed Forces.

Various sources report tank shelling in the Wazzani area. This is a common thing: in the area of ​​Shebaa farms, tank shelling occurs regularly. In fact, the advance began in a very limited area. Israeli armored vehicle activity in the border area still remains high, and the surroundings of Metulla, Mitzgav Ama and Kfar Giladi have been declared a closed military zone. However, due to Hezbollah’s shelling, there weren’t too many local people here anyway. ▪️Lebanese media, meanwhile, are reporting shelling, including the use of incendiary ammunition, as well as high activity by Israeli aircraft and UAVs. ▪️Multiple reports of an invasion along the entire length of the state border so far turn out to be part of a large-scale disinformation campaign.▪️Another narrative: this is the alleged abandonment of positions by the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers on the border and withdrawal five kilometers into the interior of the country. However, Lebanese resources have so far denied the army’s withdrawal, and the UN has not confirmed the information either.❗️According to our data, units of the Israel Defense Forces have occupied UN observation posts on their side of the border and are continuing preparations to advance deeper into Lebanese territory. One of these areas is the village of Rmeish, where the crossing of the state border has already begun. The situation with the village of Rmeish is generally interesting: even at the very beginning of the aggravation, local residents organized patrols to prevent Hezbollah missile launches from the vicinity of their native village and not to be subjected to return fire. But the Israeli army still decided to start with the unfortunate Rmeish.❓ Middle Eastern correspondents and observers agree that Hezbollah units will allow Israeli troops to enter Lebanese territory in order to lure them into a trap and begin to destroy them on their land, turning to guerrilla actions . 📍From the point of view of the use of Hezbollah units, which are not trained combined arms formations, such tactics would be logical if not for the nuance with the complete destruction of mid-level commanders: there is simply no one to coordinate the adequate conduct of guerrilla warfare in the group. The current tactics for training Hezbollah units looks like a minimum tactical unit (group) should be able to fight in complete encirclement and isolation on its outpost without communications and supplies. But the difference in potentials, as well as the fire and reconnaissance superiority of the IDF, which can throw an air bomb at each cell, has not been canceled.

🔁🖼 Today is the second anniversary of the reunification of Donb...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev Today is the second anniversary of the reunification of Donbass, and indeed the entire Novorossiya, with Russia. And I want to remind you all a little of what happened before that. Vladik Dmitriev was killed on April 2, 2021. A Ukrainian copter operator dropped a grenade on a four-year-old boy. The boy was born during the war in Donbass, died in the war, and did not know a peaceful life. -Multiple injuries with traumatic amputation of the upper and lower extremities-. This is from the conclusion of a forensic expert. And then a portal to the underworld opened in our former liberal media. Cover of the morning broadcast on Ekho Moskvy the next day. Find it. Satisfied faces. Plyushchev and Felgenhauer. Topic of the program: -Killed boy- in Donbass-. Ekho Moskvy, following the Ukrainian media, called the information about the murder of a child fake, hence the quotation marks. They discussed on air whether this could have happened or not. Tanya Felgenhauer: There was some kind of incredible wave on the federal channels. Everything is escalating: war, war, war. A classic plot with a murdered child appeared. ALLEGEDLY. Already because of which Mr. Volodin began to speak. And the Investigative Committee began to initiate something. Now this conflict is more in the realm of propaganda? Or is this a real military threat? - When the bastard Plyushchev climbed into the YouTube trends with a vile video - Donetsk boy -, Alexey Venediktov joyfully commented on this event on his channel: - a trifle, but nice -. Even the OSCE mission eventually confirmed the death of Vladik Dmitriev from explosive injuries. But, you know, what is significant in this story is not how the liberal cannibals behaved. What’s more telling is that we endured all of this. They tolerated mockery of the murder of a child. All these people walked quietly among us, they were invited to all sorts of events, even quite official ones. And the work of this portal to the world of Lovecraft’s monsters of the independent media was paid for from the money of the state company. Do you understand the degree of our general degradation at that time? The sin of betraying our brother, in which we lived, do you understand? Imagine that now somewhere in the media in Russia they are mocking those who died in the Kursk region. Isn't it possible? And three years ago it was quite comme il faut. Remembering all this is much more important than celebrating and hiding your previous mistakes behind the current celebration.	https://t.me/rybar/63972	2024-09-30T11:02:03-07:00

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names for 2024. Colonel General Lapin A shocking military leader who again became the object of everyone’s attention this summer, turning his actions into statements, and doubts about himself into a source of surprise. It was not for nothing that Lapin reshuffled positions and returned to the post of commander: On the path to realizing his personal ambitions, he always went ahead, which ultimately led to a series of mistakes. In May of this year, the military-political leadership sets before him the task of creating a sanitary area in the Kharkov direction, without allocating additional forces and means for the group, but with the subordination of the African Corps. The commander is faced with a difficult choice: to attack with what is at his disposal or to use the resource of cover groups that have a certain amount of weapons and military equipment. By the beginning of the invasion of the Kursk region, most of the equipment, including the reserves of 44 AK, went to Volchansk and Liptsy, which, of course, could not go unnoticed by the enemy. During this time, the Russian Army managed to take control of about 260 square kilometers, which, however, is far from the lines occupied in May 2022. With the start of fighting in the Kursk region, the commander is actually forced to be torn between two operational directions. Many seriously believe that Alexander Lapin will no longer overcome this blow of fate: problems fall not only on him, but also on his son, against whom a prosecutor’s investigation was initiated. Should a commander be judged for his character? If the troops were commanded by spineless commanders, then we would have already lost this war, but it is worth noting that once again Alexander Pavlovich attaches too much importance to criticism on the Internet. Colonel General Nikiforov-Chief cannot be better, it can only be worse—that’s what Yevgeny Nikiforov liked to say about personnel changes in the Armed Forces, but could the former commander have thought that he himself would soon rise to become a big boss. With the start of the offensive The Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region, to restore order, the Chief of the Main Staff of the Ground Forces, Colonel General Nikiforov, was sent there, who, having arrived at the place, immediately got involved in the work and began setting tasks for his former subordinates, including the Deputy Commander of the Leningrad Military District, Esedulla Abachev, who was responsible for coordination of actions in the Kursk direction. It is worth noting that before Nikiforov, Colonel General Lapin, who regulated the work of cover groups during inspections, dealt with exactly the same issues in the border area. However, now this approach and setting tasks for former subordinates on the part of Yevgeny Nikiforov actually led to the establishment of dual power, to combat which a coordination council for border security was subsequently created, where Yunus-Bek Evkurov began to play the main role. Today, both military leaders are in a difficult relationship, largely due to differences in temperament: Nikiforov considers himself a superior commander and does not take into account any emotional attachment, remaining a pragmatist and considering everyone equally obliged to him, while Lapin believes that the commander of the group is it is an independent person who builds a homogeneous but closed organism that does not tolerate outside interference. The Minister of Defense reacted to the situation quite philosophically: without getting involved in the work of the General Staff, he entrusted the work of the cover groups to himself, thus gaining the opportunity to completely control the situation, reserving the right to personnel and organizational conclusions.

In September 2022, residents of these regions voted in referendums to return to the country, and on September 30, agreements were signed in the Kremlin that consolidated their new status.

Rybar: Photo 🇺🇳🇹🇯 A few days after the UN summit, which the Tajik authorities held productively, holding more than one meeting with officials from the United States and other Western countries, the first results for Tajikistan appeared.▪️First, Tajikistan’s sovereign credit rating was raised by international agencies Moody’s and S&amp;P from category category -B3- with a forecast -stable- to category -B3- with a forecast -positive-.▪️Then it became known that the Tajiks were completing negotiations with the World Bank on a grant agreement worth $650 million for the completion of the Rogun hydroelectric station , another $500 million of investment in Dushanbe will be received from the Asian Bank.▪️In addition, preferential lending agreements were signed with the Islamic Development Bank in the amount of $150 million and the Saudi Development Fund in the amount of $100 million.🔻A short period of time has passed, and the Tajik authorities are receiving quite significant preferences from foreign funds and organizations influencing the attraction of capital. It seems that with the number of bilateral meetings between the Tajik leadership and other countries, this is not all. But at the same time, it becomes curious what the Tajiks will give in exchange for all these -bonuses-. #UN #Tajikistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63966	2024-09-30T06:25:07-07:00

Last year the amount was about 1.4 billion.📌 The increase in spending on the armed forces was expected, given the state of the Armenian army now. At the same time, this measure will not help the Armenians much, if you remember what tactics the leadership adheres to: ➖Purchase of assorted equipment and weapons around the world, and, in some cases, decommissioned. ➖Dismissal of experienced personnel and promotion of convenient commanders.🔻But the reaction of Azerbaijan was not long in coming. As we thought, Baku is using this fact to accuse the Armenian leadership of militarization, since the Azerbaijanis have reduced defense spending for the next year. However, the Armenian neighbors do not mention one important point: their budget is 2 times larger than the Armenian one, even taking into account the slight reduction. #Azerbaijan #Armenia@rybar Support usARMENPRESS Armenian News AgencyIn 2025, it is planned to spend more than 3 trillion drams.

The Azerbaijani company Azersilah signed a memorandum of strategic understanding with the Israeli AS Holdings and its subsidiary Ari Arms. Ari Arms is known for producing small arms light weapons according to NATO standards. So cooperation between the state-owned Azerbaijani company will develop in this area. For the Muslim world, in light of recent events in the Middle East, this was shocking news. On social network X, many are demanding a boycott of Azerbaijan for cooperation with Israel.🔻However, well-informed observers in the region know that in Azerbaijan there is a strong influence of Mountain Jews, who are close in spirit to the current ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. Therefore, such agreements are not new for the two countries. On the eve of the Second Karabakh War, as well as before the operation of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces in Artsakh, the Israeli leadership actively supplied the Azerbaijanis with the necessary weapons and ammunition. Well, using this example, one can evaluate the real support for Palestine, the Gaza Strip and other Muslim countries from the Turkic tandem. Erdogan's populist threats mean nothing, one only has to evaluate the level of trade interaction with Israel.#Azerbaijan #Israel@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/63964	2024-09-30T04:44:58-07:00

Most of the measures that are necessary here and now to improve the migration situation have been announced. However, for now this is only a project, and it is unknown in what form it will be adopted, or whether it will be adopted at all. To implement all these points, a lot of effort is required, as well as the solution of other important nuances. One of these can be called powerful lobbying of the interests of ethnic communities at a high political level in Russia. And this is without mentioning the problem of corruption in the security forces. Of course, some changes have already appeared, foreigners who break the law are expelled from the country, banned from entering, but all this happens in a local format, and not nationwide. #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63963	2024-09-30T04:16:45-07:00

🇰🇿💰 Are the pension savings of Kazakhstanis floating overseas?...	🇰🇿💰 Are the pension savings of Kazakhstanis floating overseas? It became known that in August of this year, the National Bank of Kazakhstan invested 433 billion tenge from the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund (UPF) into government securities of the US government. It is significant that at the same time there are publications in the press that investments in Russian securities, already cheap, turned out to be unprofitable. In 2022, the National Bank invested the pension funds of Kazakhstanis in Eurobonds of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, denominated in dollars, for 18.8 billion tenge, and since then the cost of these securities has decreased by 385 million tenge.📌 All this is done under the pretext of investing in -income instruments- in order to preserve and increase in this way. The Kazakh authorities generally like to use the pension savings of Kazakhstanis - they have already bought shares in Air Astana (the airline is not a national carrier and is generally under British control). Also, funds from the UAPF were used to purchase cars - freight and passenger - for the Kazakhstan Railways, a state monopoly. Moreover, this was not done directly, but also through the purchase of securities, the essence was that the UAPF acquired bonds of the national holding on market conditions - Baiterek - for $382 million, after which this amount is used to purchase 3,300 cars. In the report, there was confusion in the testimony: it turned out that there was $24 million more money than the UAPF invested in Baiterek, and 200 fewer cars were purchased. In general, trends show that the West continues to develop Central Asian capital. Thus, recently the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev proposed to provide foreign companies with access to the pension assets of citizens of the republic. At the moment, these savings amount to about 20 trillion tenge, or in terms of the current exchange rate - 41.6 billion dollars. With such actions, Astana contributes to the fact that Americans do not have to turn on the printing press once again and increase inflation at home. And once again they support the American financial pyramid, politely called -national debt-.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usinformburo.kzThe National Bank invested the pension money of Kazakhstanis in August only in US government securities. There were no investments in other financial instruments.	https://t.me/rybar/63960	2024-09-30T02:59:58-07:00

At the meeting, he noted the prospects for economic development, including the opening of a Russian bank in an African country. Military cooperation between the parties was also noted.▪️In addition, speaking at the plenary session of the Russian Energy Week, Nguema Mbasogo expressed interest in cooperation in the energy sector. As a member of OPEC, Equatorial Guinea has some resource base for relevant initiatives. Under pressure from the West, Nguema Mbasogo is trying to enlist support from China and Russian partners. After the failure of the Chinese project of a logistics point on the Atlantic coast, this niche remains unoccupied. Also in the country, presumably, there are some deposits of coltan, for the possession of which an invisible war broke out between the United States and China. In such a situation, the expansion of Russian influence in Equatorial Guinea could make adjustments to the current situation in central Africa.

Now the Russian Armed Forces are breaking through to the northwest in the direction of Heroes of Labor Street along several parallel streets from Kemerovo to Pushkarenka. To the south, Russian troops are gradually expanding the zone of control west of Correctional Colony No. 2, several streets in the private sector have already been cleared of the enemy. At the same time, it is still not possible to occupy the waste heap to the south due to the high activity of Ukrainian UAVs. 🔻In the Zabalka area, the Russian Armed Forces apparently slowed down somewhat due to the continued presence of the enemy in the forests to the east and frequent counterattacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Shcherbinovka. Messages and other evidence of progress have not appeared for quite some time. 🔻At the Leonidovka-Novgorodskoye (New York) turn, several forest belts west of the Krivoi Torets River came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. The enemy here relies on heights 184 and 164 in the forest belts and on a chain of strong points. If it is possible to develop an offensive in this sector, Russian troops will be able to increase pressure on Leonidovka, which will improve the situation in Dzerzhinsk for the Russian Armed Forces. West of Novgorod, meanwhile, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces in the direction of Sukhaya Balka, where a stronghold of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was taken, as well as Panteleimonovka, where the enemy was driven out of several wide forest belts, is also recorded.

After the Crimean spring, at the height of the war in Donbass, another confrontation appeared: we began to fight terrorism at distant approaches. Over these nine years, the operation has changed: active combat operations are no longer carried out, there is periodic bombing and destruction of enemy targets in the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo Yes, patrolling certain areas. I would, of course, like to see more active actions, but in the conditions of the Northern Military District, this is probably an unacceptable waste. During active operations, significant areas of territory were liberated and the basis for further settlement was laid. Perhaps, in the context of the Lebanese-Israeli war, the role of the Russian Armed Forces will grow even stronger: but to what extent and in what capacity, whether the conflict will spread to Syria, whether there will be a need to increase the contingent again - we will find out over time.

According to the IDF press service, Hezbollah headquarters were among the targets attacked during the day. ▪️At the same time, the IDF command does not pay attention to the accompanying casualties among the civilian population. In just one day, in the eastern suburbs of Sidon, more than a hundred people were injured as a result of an airstrike on a multi-storey building, a third of them died. The total number of victims in Lebanon since the escalation has already exceeded one and a half thousand people, including foreigners. ▪️Despite statements by representatives of the Lebanese organization about launching missiles at various IDF targets, most of the ammunition is destroyed in the air by air defense systems, some of them even fall on Lebanese territory. Multiple air defense alarms in the Haifa area in the evening, according to local resources, were associated with the passage of just one air target.▪️Meanwhile, one of the shells fired by Hezbollah fell east of Jerusalem, causing several large fires and a power outage in populated areas in Western bank of the Jordan River. Lebanese rockets, although they reach the territories of the Palestinian Authority, often fall within populated areas, including in the area of ​​Arab villages. ▪️At the moment, American authorities are calling on the Israelis to abandon the idea of ​​​​conducting a ground operation in Lebanon, fearing tougher actions by Hezbollah and active intervention by Iran, which will inevitably lead to escalation. In addition, the United States assumes that if the conflict escalates, American facilities in the region will come under direct attack.▪️ The Islamic Republic of Iran is in a rather vulnerable position in front of a rival with a stronger position. The outcome of the confrontation will depend on the ability of Tehran and its allies to create new threats to the enemy.

According to the footage of objective control that has appeared, the enemy is attacking with armored groups in the Vesely area, expanding the zone of control north of Novy Put. ▪️The very fact of the publication of footage by the Russian side speaks of repelling the attack, while the advance of Ukrainian formations between Volfino and Vesely is also confirmed. The village of Obukhovka, apparently, is in a gray zone, and the status of Krasnooktyabrsky is again in question.▪️In Tetkino, judging by the footage of enemy UAV strikes, there are no longer any Ukrainian formations left within the village. At the same time, at what point the enemy was knocked out or retreated from there is difficult to say. 🔻No changes in control zones have been observed in the Korenevsky district; clashes continue. Attempts to attack the Ukrainian Armed Forces were recorded near Olgovka and Kremyany, and in the vicinity of Lyubimovka there are counter battles. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the line of contact also remained static.

If we talk about the reaction of countries and political movements of the Middle East to the death of Hassan Nasrallah, then for the most part it comes down to verbal condemnation of Israel, differing only in form. At the same time, almost everywhere the matter has not yet gone beyond statements.▪️Iranian spiritual leader Ali Khamenei introduced a five-day mourning period in the country. Other government officials spoke matter-of-factly about the imminent revenge while condemning the killing of IRGC deputy commander Abbas Nilforoushan, who died alongside Nasrallah.▪️Iraq's prime minister and Shiite religious leaders spoke out against Israel, and Islamic Resistance factions threatened to fire at him and his allies . So far, only the Yemeni Houthis have moved from words to action, launching missiles at Tel Aviv and shelling ships in the Red Sea.▪️In Syria, the authorities declared three days of public mourning, recalling in a statement the role of Hezbollah in liberating the country from militants. In areas of the provinces of Idlib and Aleppo controlled by opposition groups, on the contrary, the death of Nasrallah was celebrated.▪️Some of the Sunni countries in the region reacted curiously to the attacks on Beirut - they condemned Israel, but without much condolences because of the death of Nasrallah. This was caused by a long-standing ideological confrontation with Shiite Iran and Hezbollah.▪️Inside Lebanon itself, both allied and opposition Hezbollah, Sunni and Christian parties came out in its support, considering the murder of Nasrallah as an attack on the country. And several movements radically opposed to the group chose to remain silent. In general, Israel can hardly expect any powerful military response to what happened - Hezbollah itself is suffering very heavy losses, and Hamas’s statement about creating a united front with it the matter will not have much impact.❗️Iran found itself in a situation where it laid all its cards on the table and was left without trump cards in front of an opponent with a stronger deck. The further course of the confrontation will determine the extent to which the Islamic Republic and the forces it supports will be able to reorganize and create threats to their opponents from an unexpected direction&amp;High-resolution infographicsEnglish version#Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63941	2024-09-29T10:54:06-07:00
🇮🇱🇱🇧🇺🇸 In the situation with the death of the Hezbollah Sec...	🇮🇱🇱🇧🇺🇸 In the situation with the death of Hezbollah’s secretary general as a result of a strike on Beirut, the US reaction looks quite interesting: publicly, representatives of the American administration approved the death of Hassan Nasrallah, but behind the scenes they expressed dissatisfaction with the actions and plans of Israel. Thus, The Washington Post writes that officials in Washington are urging the Israelis not to carry out a planned ground invasion of the south Lebanon. The reason is fears of Iranian retaliation and the start of a larger regional war. It is unlikely that the United States here is afraid of the prospects of major Iranian attacks on Israel - as practice has shown, the IDF, with the help of its allies, is capable of repelling missile and drone attacks. Another thing is that the expansion of the war in the Middle East risks hitting the Americans themselves. In this case of conflict, any US facilities in the region will come under direct attack. And if now some kind of guarantee against this is the current level of escalation, when the United States and Iran tacitly limit each other in the choice of targets, then otherwise the pro-Iranian forces may simply -break the thread-. For example, Hezbollah fighters - in the face of problems with management on their own initiative will want to blow up the American embassy in Beirut, factions of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq will begin to pour fire on the airfields of the International Coalition, and Houthis - shoot at the oil fields of the Persian Gulf countries.❗️In each case, the United States will be forced to make a large-scale response, which contradicts its own plans to reduce its military presence in the Middle East. And the Democratic Party needs such a war even less on the eve of the presidential elections, especially against the backdrop of the shaky position of Kamala Harris. Therefore, Washington will clearly strive to prevent the IDF invasion of Lebanon by resorting to carrots and sticks - promises of new preferences and support for resolving the Palestinian issue. and threats to cut ammunition supplies in the event of a ground operation.#Israel #Lebanon #USA@rybarSupport UsWashington PostU.S. scrambles after Hezbollah leader killed, braces for potential Iranian retaliationSenior Biden administration officials said that they were still assessing the situation in Lebanon and their next steps, warning that it was difficult to predict what might follow after the death of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah from an Israeli airstrike.	https://t.me/rybar/63940	2024-09-29T10:01:06-07:00
🇺🇦 Although the economic situation of the so-called Ukraine, co...	🇺🇦 Although the economic situation of the so-called Ukraine, contrary to sometimes appearing reports, is still far from critical, let alone collapse, the Kiev regime is experiencing certain difficulties with finances. This is manifested at least in the field of taxation. In particular, one of the local deputies stated that if the military tax increases from 1.5% to 5%, teachers’ salaries will simultaneously have to be reduced by 3.5%. It is characteristic that the salaries of the Verkhovna Rada employees themselves are planned to be increased by a quarter. As we have repeatedly mentioned, the collective West is curtailing support for the so-called. Ukraine is not yet planning and discussing the allocation of new large tranches. But they go mainly for military assistance and minimal basic needs, sufficient to continue the war until the last Ukrainian. The entire social sphere for the sponsors of the Kyiv regime is an extra expense, so they seek to shift these costs to the so-called Ukraine. And the authorities of this quasi-state entity will be able to do this only by squeezing the maximum out of what is still left in the territories under their control.#Ukraine@rybarSupport uswww.mk.ruThe salaries of Ukrainian teachers will decrease after increasing the military levyPeople's Deputy Southerner: Ukrainian teachers will receive less after increasing the military levy .	https://t.me/rybar/63939	2024-09-29T09:05:38-07:00

Remember the scandal with the local branch of VGIK: training was conducted not in Russian, but in Uzbek, there were no big names. Well, the public outcry helped. A commission came from Moscow from VGIK itself to check, and the Russian actor Sergei came to the branch in Tashkent Bezrukov. Sergei Bezrukov visited the university, talked with students and performed the play -Uncle Vanya- at the local palace of arts -Turkeston-. Photos from the event can be seen on the actor’s personal page. Moreover, the current unsightly events may be part of the confusion due to the change in leadership. The ex-director of the branch, Eldar Yuldashev, lost his position back in July. Now the director of the branch is Ikbol Melikuziev, who may not have had enough time to restore order. Now the new director of the branch is trying to correct the mistakes of the previous management, and the students, judging by the latest reviews, are happy with everything, and there were no more complaints from them. Of course, there are still plenty of problems, but it is gratifying that, against the backdrop of all the scandals, a review of the work of the branch is beginning. We didn’t have time to write about the problem, but they quickly rushed to solve it. This means that not everything is lost, the public outcry allows the situation to be corrected for the better, and the efforts of officials can be reversed.#Russia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63935	2024-09-29T07:22:01-07:00
🇬🇧💉UK one step closer to assisted suicide Last week -...	🇬🇧💉UK one step closer to assisted suicide Last week, a citizen jury of the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (NCOB) concluded that assisted suicide should be legal in the UK. The jury concluded that a person suffering from a terminal illness should be able to legally access medication-assisted suicide. The council's conclusion is advisory in nature, but can subsequently be used as a decisive argument when amending laws. The UK is just following a trend that is sweeping the Western world. Assisted suicide is already practiced in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, as well as certain states of the USA and Australia. Based on the experience of other countries, we can expect that if suicide is legalized in the UK, the following events will occur:▪️the number of drug-induced suicides will increase every year, perhaps even exponentially (as in Canada);▪️the list of people who will be able to commit suicide, will gradually expand, and over time will include people whose diseases are not fatal or incurable (including those of a psychological nature), and minors; ▪️a market for services will begin to form around assisted suicide: from service personnel and medications to devices that facilitate the procedure. 🔻Assisted suicide fits perfectly into the globalist agenda. It is easier for the state to let a chronically ill (but unable to pay for expensive medicine) citizen die than to provide him financially; get rid of a veteran suffering from PTSD rather than rehabilitate him in society; eliminate the result of a failed gender experiment rather than admit a mistake. ❗️Canadian experts already shamelessly estimate how much money assisted suicide helps save in the healthcare budget, and Swiss entrepreneurs are presenting capsules for independently carrying out medical suicide. The most difficult stage for beneficiaries of assisted suicide is its legalization in the minimum possible form. And subsequently, the boundaries of what is permitted can gradually expand. It seems that for the UK the decision has already been made, and all that remains is to prepare society morally for the coming changes.#Great Britain #globalism@rybar Support usSky NewsAssisted dying should be allowed in England, according to 'citizens' jury'The top two reasons the panel were concerned about a law change were that it could be used for the wrong reasons if safeguarding is not in place, and that it could be misinterpreted or misused.	https://t.me/rybar/63934	2024-09-29T06:34:13-07:00
🖼 🇱🇧 About possible successors to the leader of Hezbollah Afte...	🇱🇧 About possible successors to the leader of Hezbollah. After the death of Hassan Nasrallah, the question arose of who would replace him as Secretary General of Hezbollah. The new leader must meet certain criteria, such as having religious status, experience and position in the leadership of the organization, so at least two figures are suitable for this role: Hashem Safi ad-Din According to some reports, he is the head of the Hezbollah Executive Council and a member of the Council jihad defining military strategy. Safi ad-Din is Nasrallah's cousin, and his son is married to the daughter of Qassem Soleimani. He bears the title of Sayyid (descendant of the Prophet Muhammad), and studied at Shiite educational centers in Najaf and Qom. Safi ad-Din's relatively young age and oratory skills speak in favor of him: in particular, he speaks publicly at events, while Nasrallah has not appeared in public for a long time. Naim Kassem Started his path in politics back in the 70s - initially was a member of another Shiite party, Amal, but then participated in the formation of Hezbollah in the mid-80s. According to media reports, Kassem is a member of the Shura Council, Hezbollah's central executive body. Experience speaks in his favor - Kassem has been Hezbollah's deputy secretary general since Nasrallah's predecessor, Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed in 1992. He also underwent training in Shiite religious centers. Lesser-known figures, including one of the sons of Hassan Nasrallah, are also formally suitable for the role of the new leader of the group. However, they have less experience and weight within the structure, which may affect its capabilities in the current crisis. In general, one of Hezbollah’s main problems now is the physical disappearance of the middle command level, intermediate between the top and the junior staff. What affects the reduction of the bench, including the search for a new leader. High resolution infographicsEnglish version#Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63933	2024-09-29T05:42:11-07:00

Air defense systems of the Russian Armed Forces operated in seven regions of the country, intercepting 125 UAVs. ▪️The largest group of 67 drones was destroyed in the airspace of the Volgograd region. Several explosions were recorded in the Kotluban area, where the arsenal of the GRAU of the Russian Ministry of Defense is located. According to available data, injuries and serious damage to the facility were avoided. ❗️Despite statements from enemy media resources about the defeat of the railway train during the raid, data from fire monitoring services indicate the absence of any fires in the area of ​​the railway line located on the territory of the arsenal and nearby settlements. The force of the explosions recorded in this area also does not fit with the version of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the defeat of a train with, as stated, artillery ammunition would have caused much more extensive destruction on the territory of the facility.▪️In the Rostov region, 17 UAVs attacked civilian infrastructure facilities in the Tsimlyansky district. Local residents reported partial power outages both in the locality of the same name and in neighboring Volgodonsk. There have been no reports of damage to energy facilities in the region at this time. ▪️In the Voronezh region, the Russian Armed Forces destroyed 17 air targets. One of the drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces hit an apartment building in the regional capital. A fire started on the upper floors, affecting several apartments, but the residents were evacuated in time - there were no casualties. ▪️Air defense systems also repelled an enemy raid on the Belgorod region, intercepting 18 air targets. In the Bryansk and Kursk regions and the Krasnodar Territory, one Ukrainian Armed Forces drone was destroyed, and three more were shot down over the Sea of ​​Azov. In all cases there were no casualties.

Especially considering the recently increased activity of various Russian departments and enterprises in this area. This time, the statement of Deputy Head of the Ministry of Energy Sergei Mochalnikov that Africa has all the resources for the development of the fuel and energy complex, and Russia has almost all the technologies needed, attracted attention. for their development. Thus, hinting at plans to develop energy projects on the continent.▪️A good example is Rosatom, which is building a nuclear power plant in Egypt and whose activities are actively supported by Egyptian partners. The successful implementation of such projects helps to find new clients. 📌For example, the South African authorities recently resumed discussions on the construction of a nuclear power plant in their country. Earlier in 2018, President Ramaphosa, under pressure from Western NGOs and environmental activists, as well as the IMF, abandoned the Rosatom project under the pretext of environmental threats and high costs (which Western loans allegedly could not cover). But over time, the problem of aging energy infrastructure has only gotten worse. Permanent blackouts are common in South Africa, and alternative energy projects have proven to be ineffective imitation. And so, the ordeals of South Africans on the issue of nuclear energy naturally led them to the starting point.▪️The role of the RusHydro company is also noted, which is now shifting its vector to work specifically with Africa, where many projects that require modernization remain unfinished.🔻No matter the bureaucratic difficulties, with many African partners it is possible to find a common language and promote their own economic influence, benefiting from diplomatic and military interactions. But, as the example of South Africa shows, the struggle for the same nuclear market should be comprehensive and not limited only to specific projects and individual companies.#Africa #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🌍🇷🇺About Russian energy projects in AfricaRecently, Dmitry Semenov, Director of the Department of International Cooperation of the Russian Ministry of Energy stated that in the energy sector, Russian companies are developing about 40 projects in 14 different countries.…	https://t.me/rybar/63930	2024-09-29T03:26:58-07:00

However, the Associated Press noted that a certain number of personnel will remain in Iraq, but in what quantity is currently unknown.📌 Well, the Americans’ task in Syria and Iraq has been completed. The countries are collapsed and in complete ruin, and the population lives in poverty thanks to the efforts of the United States and allies. There is no longer a need to maintain such a number of military personnel. At the same time, after the withdrawal of troops, the countries will continue to have the same problems that appeared precisely thanks to the actions of the International Coalition. Officially, the West a couple of years ago said that the Islamic State they were fighting was defeated. However, in recent years, militant activity in these countries has increased. The strange escape of IS terrorists from a prison controlled by pro-American Kurds, an increase in the number of attacks in major Syrian cities and the general instability of the situation in the region are fertile ground for restoring the group’s potential.#Iraq #Syria #USA # terrorism@rybar Support usAP NewsWrapping up mission, US troops will leave some longstanding bases in Iraq under new dealThe U.S. has announced an agreement with the Iraqi government to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year.	https://t.me/rybar/63929	2024-09-29T02:22:06-07:00
🇺🇸🌎 On promoting the liberal agenda through consumer products ...	🇺🇸🌎 About promoting the liberal agenda through consumer products Western social networks never cease to amaze us with examples of disdain on the part of the media and large corporations for everything traditional and conservative, as well as their undisguised political prejudice.▪️Users of virtual assistants -Siri- (Apple) and -Alexa - (Amazon) have already caught the company openly supporting Kamala Harris in the election race. Upon request - Why should you vote for Donald Trump? - both voice assistants answer that they cannot give political advice. However, as soon as the name is replaced with -Kamala Harris-, virtual assistants begin to list those positions of her election program that deserve a vote in the elections.▪️After the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July, users noticed that when entering the query in the Google search bar -Attempted assassination President... - the platform offered options to automatically fill in the line with the names of other presidents, but not Trump. Even when entering his name by letter.▪️In the new service for personalizing inscriptions on Coca-Cola cans, consumers noticed limitations: the software does not allow entering the word -Jesus- (at the same time, the words -Buddha-, -Allah- and -Satan- there are no such restrictions), and also does not allow you to write the slogan -Trump 2024- on the can. Of course, with the slogan - Harris Waltz 2024 - you can register a jar.🔻These are just a few examples of systematic work to promote liberal values ​​in the everyday life of residents of Western countries. And if the major media have already lost the trust of the population, then influence with the help of artificial intelligence and algorithms is a more sophisticated and effective method of propaganda, which affects all age categories. #globalism #USA@rybar Support usMail OnlineCoke went woke!

🔁 #Review #Summary for September 29, 2024 ▪️ Last week, the war ...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for September 29, 2024▪️ Last week, the war in Ukraine took place against the background of foreign policy actions of Russia and its opponents. Zelensky visited the United States with his -victory plan,- which aroused criticism due to the fact that everything hinges on receiving new multi-billion-dollar shipments of military-technical assistance, as well as permission to fire NATO missiles deep into Russian territory. That is, Zelensky is thus trying to shift responsibility for the consequences of such attacks to the United States. Kyiv needs this to directly draw the Alliance (and not its proxies) into hostilities against Russia. Regardless of public statements, weapons from NATO countries are used with complete impunity on the territory of our country, which has been repeatedly previously designated as -red lines.- The seriousness of the issue of a retaliatory strike from Russia (for some reason everyone perceives that it will be against Ukraine) is emphasized by the statements of the Supreme Commander at the meeting where the new Nuclear Doctrine was announced (the journalistic name of the Supreme Decree in force in 2020 - On the Fundamentals of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the field nuclear deterrence-). At the same time, the clauses of the still valid document made it possible to launch a nuclear strike on Ukraine in response to the actions of Kyiv. So it is most likely that changes are needed to justify a strike against those subjects of international law who use Kyiv to cause damage to our country. In addition, the allied Belarus is taken under the nuclear umbrella. Significantly, according to the not yet adopted updated doctrine, a massive launch and crossing of our border by aerospace weapons, including airplanes, missiles and UAVs, under certain conditions can become the basis for the use of nuclear weapons. Just tonight, 125 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down by our air defense. ▪️At the front, the repulse of the attempted invasion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region continues, as it writes every day in the reports of the Ministry of Defense. The offensive impulse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has practically disappeared, although the enemy is carrying out counterattack actions. In the south of the Sudzhansky district, the Russian Army is advancing in the area of ​​the village with heavy fighting. Plekhovo, in the Glushkovsky district we managed to hold back the onslaught of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, our troops are operating in the Korenevsky district. Apparently, our command decided to protect the personnel and iron out the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk region and their concentration areas in Sumy. Zelensky, despite the impossibility of achieving military goals in the region (such as the capture of the Kursk nuclear power plant), is forced to keep units in this bag and send them reinforcements, since the withdrawal of enemy troops will show the senselessness and futility of the death of Ukrainian soldiers in the Russian region from a military point of view.▪️The offensive continues Russian armies on the Pokrovsky direction to the west and south. The battles for Ugledar became important; the fall of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense became a matter of time. In the Kupyansk direction, attack actions of the Russian Army are also periodically reported. The Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison in Chasov Yar is gradually being covered from the south and north. In the Kharkov direction, the enemy, with the help of elite GUR units, occupied the aggregate plant in Volchansk, which led to its powerful bombing by our aircraft. Heavy fighting is taking place in Toretsk.▪️Despite the successes of the Russian Armed Forces, the advance is proceeding extremely cautiously, which is explained by the difficulties in supplying advanced units under fire from enemy drones. There were assessments from enemy deputies about the insufficient level of preparation of defensive structures in the depths of the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the future, this may play into the hands of our advancing troops. However, it is important to understand the severity of the battles and the pace of advance of several hundred meters per day of the Russian Army, which is due to the new technological way of war. continued belowTelegramTwo majorsstarted above ▪️ This week, a meeting of well-known public military correspondents/military bloggers took place with the Minister of Defense Belousov.

In addition to the United States, training of the nuclear component took place recently in France, where the third stage of the Poker-2024 exercise took place. This year, unlike previous years, the French command conducts training of strategic nuclear forces throughout the year as part of this series of exercises. In accordance with a plan, Rafale B/M aircraft (carriers of nuclear warheads) and Triumphan-class nuclear submarines are working out the scenario of deployment in an armed conflict.🔻Against the background of increasing tensions in relations between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance, changes in the Russian nuclear doctrine, the French are trying with all their might to keep keeping their units in good shape. By the way, according to the Fifth Republic, the French have restored the center for coordinating nuclear forces in Taverny, mothballed since 2011. So the new stage of the Poker exercise may be associated with testing its readiness. These seem like understandable measures, but if you remember that a similar training took place in the USA, and before that in Russia, and they also started talking about testing nuclear weapons in the DPRK, then it turns out a very alarming picture. To complete it, only a few powers - the nuclear club - are left to join the general trend.

Judging by the published footage, a group of reconnaissance officers fired at the vehicle at once from four RPG-7s on both sides. After this, hardly anyone inside the armored car survived. It is worth noting that previously this area was considered more of a rear area and the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces units was not expected here. So far, in the absence of new personnel from the field, it is not possible to clarify the current front line. At the same time, the enemy maintains stable control in Olgovka, from where today he published footage of his damaged BMP-1 and Ukrainian servicemen killed by a drone strike. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, meanwhile, clashes were noted at the Darino-Ivano-Daryino border, where Russian troops are trying to take stable control of both settlements.

🇯🇵 About the victory of a hawk and a NATO supporter in the Japa...	🇯🇵 About the victory of a hawk and a NATO supporter in the Japanese elections On September 27, the election of the chairman of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party took place. Shigeru Ishiba won them - next week he will officially become Prime Minister of Japan instead of Fumio Kishida. ▪️Many people call Ishiba a -hawk- - he is a supporter of increasing the potential of the Self-Defense Forces and increasing the military budget. In this, he will continue the policy of the former leader, who actively advocated for strengthening Japanese troops. ▪️Speaking of foreign policy priorities, relations with the United States, of course, come first. In his speeches, the politician pointed out the need for joint management of bases and the deployment of the Japanese army on US territory in order to make the alliance more equal. 🔻Ishiba’s most resonant statement in the election campaign was the proposal to create an Asian analogue of NATO. The new prime minister explains this initiative by the need to protect Japan, as well as the tense situation in the region. American authorities, according to Japanese media, reacted rather coldly to this idea. There is no doubt that a new alliance is needed to contain China. However, some observers claim Ishiba's pragmatic approach to relations with his neighbor. This is indicated by his intentions to balance between diplomacy and defense in foreign policy. Ishiba's approach to Russian-Japanese relations remains unknown. The local press expresses hopes for progress in the issue of Japanese visiting the graves of their ancestors in the Kuril Islands - the Russian authorities have canceled the simplified visa regime for them in 2022. However, there are so far no prerequisites that the new prime minister will be able to achieve its return, as well as move away from the anti-Russian policy that is now characteristic of the Japanese authorities. #Japan@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesFifth time's a charm: Shigeru Ishiba set to be Japan PM after LDP poll winIshiba, who has also served as party secretary-general, won the LDP presidential election on Friday, defeating economic security minister Sanae Takaichi in a runoff vote.	https://t.me/rybar/63924	2024-09-28T10:32:00-07:00

Two B-52N aircraft with nuclear weapons flew into the Pacific Ocean. One flew south of Unimak Island, and the second turned around off the coast of the United States. At the same time, a nuclear submarine was located along the western American coast, and coordination with the control point was carried out by an E-6B control and communications aircraft. Periodically, the Americans carry out such maneuvers that allow you to maintain the strategic forces of your country in combat readiness, but this does not happen very often. For example, a similar training on the West Coast last took place in May 2023 year, so enough time has passed. And there is practically no information on the Internet. Taking into account quite significant changes in Russian doctrine, as well as growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, this flight appears to be politically motivated in order to show the readiness of American nuclear forces.

Condolences in connection with the death of His Eminence Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah were expressed by almost all participants of the so-called. -Axis of Resistance- and its allies. These are both Palestinian formations and various groups in Iraq, the Yemeni Houthis and Iran.▪️At the same time, one of those killed during the strike on Beirut was Iranian Brigadier General Abbas Nilforoushan, commander of the Quds Force from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in the Republic of Lebanon . This is confirmed by government media. Nilforushan himself is known for his participation in several military campaigns, including in Iraq and Syria. At the same time, his statement from 2021 is being circulated in the media, when he spoke on state television about Israel’s weakness and inability to pose any threat to Iran. ▪️Meanwhile, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since the beginning of a series of strikes by the IDF Air Force, the number of casualties has amounted to about 700 dead and 2,600 wounded. Of these, six killed and 91 injured were residents of the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital. At the same time, the UN stated that more than 50 thousand Lebanese fled to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic, a total of 200 thousand were internally displaced. Also, representatives of the international organization reported that humanitarian needs had reached an unprecedented level.▪️Against the background of what happened in Hezbollah, they reported launches on about ten Israeli Defense Forces targets. Nevertheless, such attacks cannot boast of effectiveness: most of the ammunition is either intercepted by air defense systems or falls in wastelands, often on the territory of Lebanon itself. It is noteworthy that the total number of missiles launched today also remains at a relatively low level - only a few dozen, whereas previously their number could be measured in the hundreds. 🔻The killing of the leader of the Lebanese group was one of the most effective Israeli strikes as part of the recently launched air operation - Arrows of the North -. This was preceded by the death of other Hezbollah commanders, such as Fuad Shukri, Ibrahim Aqil and Ali Karaki. Despite the loss of almost all top leadership, most allied Hezbollah media indicate that the movement as a military-political organization will not disappear anywhere. Nevertheless, Hassan Nasrallah’s successor cannot be envied against the backdrop of the significant damage the Israelis have inflicted on the group in recent days and their virtual complete dominance in the conflict. At the same time, everyone is waiting for a response from both Hezbollah itself and Iran. However, what it will be like and what the Israelis will do in the future is difficult to predict. At the moment, the parties are doing what is already familiar to them: hitting each other’s positions, maintaining the already high degree of tension.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Zaporozhye direction: successes of the RF Armed Force...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Zaporozhye direction: successes of the Russian Armed Forces on the Rabotinsky salient and attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Energodarsituation as of 17:00 on September 28, 2024. The Zaporozhye direction, which has recently fallen out of the information field, remains one of the key sectors of the front. Russian troops exchange artillery, UAV and aviation strikes with the enemy, and also conduct local attacks in several sectors at once. ▪️On the Kamenskoye-Novoandreevka section, Russian units are fighting on the approaches to Pyatikhatki. To the east, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces expanded the zone of control north of Nesteryanka. During the attack, they knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from their strong point and occupied part of the forest belt. In parallel with this, the Russian Aerospace Forces regularly strike places where enemy personnel are concentrated in Novoandreevka and Novoyakovlevka. ▪️To the northwest of Rabotino, units of the Russian Armed Forces squeezed the enemy out of several forest belts. Thus, Russian troops managed to knock out the enemy from the ledge, which had previously threatened the left flank of the Russian Armed Forces units in the village. To the east of the settlement, Russian troops, during several assaults, expanded the zone of control on the approaches to Chubenkova Gully. Features of the landscape slow down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces and turn battles for each strong point into battles that can last for weeks. The beam itself, towards which Russian attack aircraft are approaching, is used by the enemy as a concentration point for their units and plays an important role in the defense of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ❗️Over the past two months, Ukrainian formations were forced to abandon a significant part of their positions on the former Rabotino ledge. Successful offensive actions of the Russian troops not only secured the flanks of the Russian Armed Forces group in Rabotino, but also led to the beginning of the formation of half-coverage around the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the area from the northern approaches to the village to Chubenkova gully. Nevertheless, it is clearly not worth expecting large offensive operations in this area with the aim of breaking through the front. Both sides have equipped powerful defensive lines here, the assault of which will be resource-intensive and will probably not lead to significant successes. ▪️At the same time, last summer was marked by an increased intensity of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Energodar and its surroundings. As a result of drone strikes and artillery shelling, the city and surrounding communities experienced water supply disruptions three times. Recently, one of the schools in Kamenka-Dneprovskaya came under fire from Ukrainian forces. There were more than a hundred students in the building at the time of the attack, but there were no casualties. The region's energy system is also suffering. Following massive attacks by enemy drones on local substations, significant power outages have been recorded several times since the end of July. This also affected the neighboring Kherson region, where, as a result of enemy attacks on the energy sector of Zaporozhye, several thousand people were left without electricity in August.

The Ural craftsmen from the team -Turned in War-, the creators of the famous folk kamikaze drone -Ghoul-, already noted at the highest level, have created the product that our troops so desperately lack. Heavy drone -Berdysh-. This is a combat drone, there is nothing superfluous in it and it has one task - war. Berdysh is, first of all, a front-line drone, a weapon of assault troops. It can easily carry 20 kilograms for at least 15 km, that is, it can fully ensure the supply of assault groups and reinforcement groups with everything necessary, in conditions of isolation of the enemy battlefield. Berdysh can engage in mining, ensuring the laying of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines at any time of the day. Berdysh can drop a powerful landmine on enemy dugouts, can conduct reconnaissance and, most interestingly, can inflict fire damage from the RPO -Shmel- or RPG-30 -Hook-. Berdysh is a modular drone, that is, through simple manipulations and in the shortest possible time, the miner turns into a supply worker, and on the next flight into a combat unmanned helicopter. The guys made it relatively compact so that it could be transported in a UAZ, the deployment time is like that of the Ghoul, that is, within a couple of minutes you can unfold and collapse the bird. Plus, as noted in the video, Berdysh is a repeater drone for the FPV family -Ghoul-. And most importantly, Berdysh was able to be made as cheap as possible, cheaper than Chinese agricultural drones, but more functional and suitable for combat operations. Dear friends, we are now announcing a BIG collection for Berdyshi. This will be the people's second drone. You, dear Brothers and Sisters, have already turned the people's drone - the Ghoul - into a real weapon, which is now being used by the troops. Now we ask you to help with the implementation of this machine, which is so necessary for our army.

The Israeli media are also disseminating information about the death of the daughter of Secretary General Zeinab Nasrallah in the Lebanese capital. However, this information remains unconfirmed. In addition, according to the Israel Defense Forces, from the Hezbollah leadership, only the commander of the Badr unit, Abu Ali Rida, is currently alive. Hezbollah published an official statement confirming the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Representatives of the movement promised to continue the path of their deceased leader in supporting Palestine, defending Lebanon and confronting the enemy. ▪️In Iran, they did not comment on the official information, expressing only support for Lebanon. Previously, billboards with the inscription -Nasrallah is alive- were installed throughout Tehran. At the same time, according to Reuters, amid the attack, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was transported to a safe and secure place. Also, the Iranian media denied reports about the death of the commander of the Quds Force, Brigadier General Ismail Qaani - earlier on the Internet it was stated that he was in the underground headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut. ▪️Despite Israeli claims that the United States was informed before the bombing of Beirut, several American media outlets claim the opposite. Previously, the Pentagon also stated that there was no information about the Israeli Air Force attack. ▪️Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov strongly condemned the actions of the Israelis, as they grossly violate the sovereignty of Lebanon. According to him, the Russian side is making every effort to avoid further escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63918	2024-09-28T04:44:02-07:00

If the law is adopted, social networks could be fined up to 5% of annual turnover. 🔻Of course, the law will primarily become a tool for suppressing freedom of speech, allowing the authorities to interpret what constitutes disinformation and put pressure on social networks to remove incorrect content. The main blow will probably fall on X (formerly Twitter), since the majority of bloggers with alternative opinions broadcast on this site. Therefore, one of the prominent opponents of the law is Elon Musk. We have already observed similar measures in post-Soviet countries, where local authorities, under the supervision of Western NGOs and USAID, are fighting Russian propaganda, but still cannot overcome it, demanding new subsidies and tightening legislation. 🔻And recently, against the backdrop of anti-migrant protests, the British government has sharply tightened censorship. Looking at British law enforcement practices, where migrants are given relatively lenient sentences for rape and other serious crimes, while native Britons are given exemplary harsh prison sentences for making jokes on Facebook, Australians have something to fear. #Australia #UK #protests@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63917	2024-09-28T04:00:00-07:00

Since 2014, the NATO airbase in Siauliai has been improved in several stages - work has been carried out to improve runways, expand aircraft parking, as well as update infrastructure, including aircraft maintenance equipment and modernization of security systems. One of the major stages of modernization was completed in 2020 year, which allowed the air base to host more modern NATO aircraft and conduct more complex military operations.

Meanwhile, Arabic-language media are increasingly complaining about the lack of any information about what happened against the backdrop of confident statements from the press service of the Israel Defense Forces. 📌Be that as it may, a consistently tense situation remains along the Lebanese-Israeli border: the Israelis are launching massive strikes across the entire territory of Lebanon, while Hezbollah responds by launching missiles at Israeli military facilities, which, however, do not lead to significant damage. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63910	2024-09-28T01:34:44-07:00

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke at it for the first time as head of government. 🔻Instead of talking about a happy future, we had to talk about less pleasant things.▪️One of the main topics of Starmer’s speech was the decision to cancel fuel payments in the winter for some categories of pensioners, which was announced by the Minister of Finance of the United Kingdom Rachel Reeves at the end of July.▪️A stab in the back for the prime minister, on the last day of the conference, there was a defeat in the vote against the government’s decision to block subsidies&nbsp;on heating for millions of elderly people. Despite the fact that the decision of the delegates is not legally binding for Labor, the voting results had a negative impact on the positions of Keir Starmer.▪️Along with this, the Prime Minister also commented on the situation in the Middle East, calling for a de-escalation of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. However, at the same time, Foreign Minister David Lammy said that the UK would not impose a complete ban on the supply of weapons to Israel.▪️Starmer also assured that he would implement reforms in the field of remuneration of doctors, projects in the field of renewable energy sources and GB Energy, education, border security, tenants' rights and the nationalization of the railways.🔻After the conference, the Labor government faces the task of setting a budget for next year. At the end of October, the head of the British Ministry of Finance, Rachel Reeves, will announce who will have to fork out to implement Starmer's plans.#UK @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usMail OnlinePM faces humiliation at Labor's conference over winter fuel paymentsUnite and the Communication Workers Union have put forward proposals calling for the policy to be scrapped at Labor's gathering in Liverpool.	https://t.me/rybar/63909	2024-09-28T00:19:01-07:00

After the start of the Northern Military District, the alliance significantly increased funding for the region, as well as the intensity of operational and combat training activities. Along with this, the leaders of the Baltic states made a number of aggressive anti-Russian statements. Considering the current events, it is worth recalling that all of this is, to one degree or another, the work of Great Britain. In 2024, London intends to send about 20,000 troops to the region under the pretext of protecting the critical infrastructure of the Nordic countries. The number of joint exercises has also increased significantly. The increased activity of the British is visible to the naked eye. Well, there is no longer any doubt about its anti-Russian orientation. https://t.me/rybar/63889@oldGBRTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics?

At the same time, the number of deaths in the region has already exceeded 41 thousand people, about 96 thousand were injured. ▪️Israeli attacks on satellite cities, in particular on Jabaliya, did not stop north of Gaza. At the same time, sporadic clashes were recorded near the Erez checkpoint in the vicinity of Beit Lahia.▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets continued. Nuseirat still remained under the most concentrated fire, with dozens of people killed.▪️In turn, Hamas militants fired at the positions of the Israel Defense Forces in the Netzarim corridor. Judging by the lack of messages on the Internet about the flight of evacuation helicopters, the shelling did not lead to any tangible results.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, Israeli units carried out engineering work in the territory of the Philadelphia Corridor. At the same time, local raids took place on Palestinian infrastructure facilities in areas of Rafah.▪️The Israeli operation -Summer Camps- continued in the West Bank. Thus, since the beginning of the conflict on October 7, 2023, about 11 thousand Palestinians have been detained.▪️The most violent clashes took place in the provinces of Tubas, Jenin and Nablus. Local branches of Palestinian groups reported several ambushes on Israeli patrols, but without details.▪️On the Lebanese-Israeli border, the situation continued to steadily worsen. The parties increased the intensity of attacks, and also expanded the area of ​​attacks by more than 100 kilometers.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63907	2024-09-27T23:02:06-07:00

Forwarded From Call sign Bruce📌 Colleagues, provocations and sabotage on the part of the Baltic states could have been expected for the last ten years. All the military activity described by you and not only you in the Baltic region is a long-known and predicted process. Exercises to block the Gulf of Finland or the Suwalki corridor are carried out constantly and began long before the start of the war in Ukraine. All with the same involvement of divisions from Finland and Sweden. Only then they were not legal members of the alliance. But they were already actual. Regarding the attacks from Estonia, which alarmed everyone so much, I also wrote the other day. In their potential, everything is very consistent. Are the headquarters new in Finland? You can study the logic of creating NATO regional headquarters at the division level and everything will fall into place. Therefore, the only thing that the current activity of the Baltic states and Finland indicates is that NATO, as it pursued a policy of aggressive military construction near our borders, is still pursuing it. And the experience of Ukraine taught her nothing. It has only become more convenient for them to justify their actions. Is a direct clash with NATO in the Baltics possible in the short term? In my opinion, probably not. In the medium term, I consider this collision inevitable. And we will have to start it. If we don’t agree otherwise. The word -rather- is highlighted in bold, since now any sensible assessments can be shattered by the very great instability of the military-political situation in the world as a whole. And only a fool would dare to say 100% that tomorrow will happen.@brussinfTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics?

Russian troops launched a missile attack on Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in the Dnepropetrovsk region and on Zmeiny Island, and also carried out drone attacks on the port infrastructure and industrial zone in Izmail. In turn, enemy drones attacked the Rostov region. In the Kursk direction, fierce battles continue along the entire line of contact, Russian troops are hitting enemy targets both in the occupied territory of the region and in the neighboring Sumy region. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces are advancing into the urban areas of Dzerzhinsk, gradually expanding the zone of control closer to the center of the population point. In the Pokrovsky direction, the attack aircraft established themselves in a forest belt on the approaches to Lesovka, several kilometers west of Novogrodovka.

Residential buildings and infrastructure were damaged, more than ten people were injured, and some were killed. In the southern Gaza Strip, IDF units are fighting in several areas of Rafah, while Palestinian forces respond with ambushes and mortar fire. At the same time, the Israeli Air Force is launching missiles at the outskirts of Khan Yunis and Abasan al-Kabirah. Another series of operations by Israeli security forces took place in the West Bank, as a result of which several dozen people were detained. The most violent clashes occurred in Nablus, where members of local armed groups were active. Massive shelling continues along the Lebanese-Israeli border. In the evening, the Israeli Air Force dropped an air bomb on Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut, where the movement's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah could be located. Two people died and more than 70 were injured. Israeli aircraft also carried out strikes on the Syrian province of Damascus, where they hit a settlement near the border with Lebanon. Five SAA soldiers were killed, and the target of the attack, apparently, was Hezbollah supply routes. The fighters of the Ansarallah movement also showed activity, launching a rocket at Tel Aviv and a drone at Ashkelon. Both munitions were intercepted by missile defense systems, but 17 Israelis received various injuries on the way to the shelters. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_botSituation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone (ru; en)Situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border (ru; en)#digest #map #Israel #Palestine # report@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63898	2024-09-27T12:40:00-07:00

🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 The Israeli Air Force launched another massive atta...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 The Israeli Air Force launched another massive strike on Beirut. This time they demolished an entire block with bunker-busting bombs, destroying six buildings to the ground and damaging those standing next door.❗️According to the IDF press service, the target of the attack was the main Hezbollah command post in the Lebanese capital, where the movement's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah could be located . The fate of the group's leader is not known for certain. Israeli resources report that he was at the facility at the time of the bombing, but Saudi media claim that Nasrallah is alive and in another place. The exact number of victims has yet to be calculated, but the number is clearly in the dozens. Considering that the bombs hit a residential area, a considerable part of them are clearly ordinary civilians. At the same time, the raid again clearly demonstrated the reconnaissance and combat capabilities of the IDF, which continue to knock out the top of Hezbollah for days in a row. In fact, without a ground operation, they inflicted extremely significant damage on the entire team to the structure of the organization. The Lebanese group cannot yet counteract these attacks. It does not have air defense systems that could even slightly disrupt the total Israeli air supremacy, and it is impossible to ensure secrecy in these conditions. It is difficult to say now how the situation will change in the event of a ground invasion by the IDF. But so far it seems that Hamas has turned out to be a much bigger tough nut to crack for the Israelis than Hezbollah. #Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63891	2024-09-27T09:53:03-07:00

Ukraine is undergoing intensive preparations to organize terrorist attacks in Mali. ▪️From the published documents it follows that the terrorists freely received Moldovan visas and crossed the Moldovan-Ukrainian border several times. The media publish photos of passports with the appropriate stamps. ▪️In early August, the Mali authorities broke off diplomatic relations with the so-called. Ukraine for aiding the rebels. ▪️During the attack by the separatist group CSP-DPA and the al-Qaeda-linked Islamic and Muslim Support Group (JNIM), several dozen Malian soldiers and a large number of Russian mercenaries were killed.▪️A representative of the GUR so-called. Ukraine Andrei Yusov did not confirm the participation of Kyiv in the hostilities, but on Ukrainian television on July 29 he said that the Malian rebels received information to conduct a military operation against Russian mercenaries.▪️According to the Malian authorities, Yusov admitted the participation of the so-called. Ukraine -in a barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups, which led to the death of members of the Malian defense forces-. ❗️This is not the first time that Moldova, represented by officials Maia Sandu, has found itself in such international scandals. ▪️For example, in June, Western curators hushed up a large-scale scandal when manipulations with Interpol’s international bases were revealed. Officials close to Sandu received multimillion-dollar bribes for assistance in obtaining refugee status for persons who are on the international wanted list.&nbsp; ▪️In August, a scandal broke out about Moldova’s possible involvement in a scheme for exporting from the so-called. Ukraine's biomaterials in the interests of the United States. The fact that Moldova consistently gets into such international scandals is the price to pay for indirect participation in the conflict on the side of the so-called. Ukraine. The Moldovan territory, to the detriment of its own economy and security, serves the economic and military interests of the Kyiv regime. Considering the Ukrainians’ flirtation with terrorists, it is not surprising that Chisinau also had to take part in their transportation. Thus, Moldova, following the so-called. Ukraine is turning into a gray zone on the periphery of Europe, where almost anything is possible. #terrorism #Mali #Moldova #Ukraine @rybarSupport usSuper HaberUkrayna ve Moldova yönetimleri Afrika'da ayrılıkçılığı mı besliyor?Detaylar SuperHaber'de...	https://t.me/rybar/63890	2024-09-27T09:36:00-07:00
🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics...	🇷🇺🇫🇮🇪🇪 What is NATO preparing against Russia in the Baltics? The information background around the Baltics in recent weeks has almost inconsistently made it into the editorial pages of various media. And it seems that the Baltic states have always been distinguished by populist slogans and shouts against the Russian Federation. However, in reality, in comparison with previous years, there is one significant difference. Now on the northern front they are echoed by a newly formed member of the Alliance - Finland, which immediately began working as part of the bloc. Exercises that take place almost weekly with allies in the bloc or independently affect Russia in one way or another - either in the Gulf of Finland or on the Kola Peninsula , then a couple of tens of kilometers from Karelia. The situation is aggravated by the high political activity of the Finns’ neighbors in the Gulf - Estonia and other countries in the region:➖Recently, the head of the General Staff of the Estonian Defense Forces, Vahur Karus, announced the country’s preparation for a preventive strike on Russia.➖Then the commander of the forces Defense of Estonia Andrus Merilo traveled to Helsinki, where he announced the preparation of a plan to close the Gulf of Finland.➖The German media, echoed by the Estonians, stated that Russian civilian vessels were conducting reconnaissance in the Baltic and North Seas, which raised the question of the need to close the passage for them. ➖Now in the Estonian segment the words of the head of the military committee Rob Bauer are being spread that the Alliance must be ready for war with Russia.➖German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said that Germany will be the pillar of containment of the Russian Federation in Europe, and the German base in Lithuania will be fully formed by 2027.➖Immediately after this, it became known about the formation of NATO headquarters in the Finnish city of Mikkeli, bordering Russia. And all these events took place almost in the past week. Quite a lot even for the Baltic republics, which act as a plug in every NATO barrel. And if we look again at the exercises that took place over the course of six months, including Steadfast Defender, we can see one common trend for almost each of them - everywhere they worked out a scenario of direct conflict with Russia. First of all, what was paid attention to during the imaginary war was the blockade of the main arteries, namely the Gulf of Finland by the forces of the NATO expeditionary group, as well as the Kaliningrad region by cutting the Suwalki corridor. One of the key aspects that the Alliance worked out was the establishment logistics to the Baltic states and Finland. Both we and our colleagues spoke more than once about how the construction of Rail Baltica was progressing. One thing can be said is that the speed of infrastructure construction was too high even for NATO. It would seem that the Baltic countries have always been distinguished by bellicose statements that were in no way visible in reality, but since the start of the Northern Military District, funding for the region has seriously increased, as has the number of battalion- NATO tactical groups and the number of exercises. And with changes to Russia’s nuclear doctrine in the information space, there is even more talk about the advisability of a preventive strike on Russian territories. Moreover, attacks by Ukrainian formations have shown that the threats of the Russian authorities do not work without their implementation. From the point of view of the West’s desire for total destabilization of the situation, provocations and even sabotage from the territory of the Baltic states and Scandinavia cannot be ruled out. After all, to close shipping or the corridor to Kaliningrad, they only need a reason, which they can organize themselves.

🔁🖼 Military leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names...	Forwarded From Children of ArbatMilitary Leaders of the Northern Military District. 20 names of 2024. Colonel General Teplinsky His group right now is the largest grouping of troops in the area of ​​the Northern Military District. Over the course of a year, a huge amount of criticism descended on him, but he continued to fulfill his military duty, despite all the obstacles that his superiors created for him. From excessive nervous fatigue, the commander began to develop neuritis of the facial nerve, which in turn causes severe headaches, while Teplinsky himself does not like to go to doctors and does not consider himself sick. The commander fell out of the public field after the notorious Krynki: spiteful critics did not hesitate to ironize that even the main favorite of the general public could not turn the situation around, resolve the issue of air defense, rotation of l/s, and finally failed to build vertical connections along the line of headquarters and units on the contact line , demanding slides before organizing a fire strike, but few people know that Teplinsky was reprimanded at least twice by senior commanders, criticized for Bonapartism, and for the first time in a long time he made concessions, becoming conformist. It is noteworthy that despite his difficult relationship with the NGSH, Teplinsky actually combines two positions and at the same time continues to deal with recruitment issues in the Airborne Forces. He was the first to publicly talk about the losses in the troops and was pulled back, but increasingly, on the front line in the airborne troops you can meet over-aged soldiers, some of whom are already 60 years old. In the spring of 2024, it seemed to many that the Russian Army would get bogged down and would not be able to reach the Dnieper, but already on July 17, the last units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces left Krynki. Time after time, Mikhail Teplinsky proved his indispensability, but seeing rejection from his inner circle, he became a closed person, withdrawn from everyday routine. We believe that the commander of the Ili force still has something to say: avoiding his rebellious heart, the glory of the main firefighter of the Russian He will secure armies more than once in fire and smoke. Colonel General Rudskoy He again managed to prove that the cold operational calculation underlying the analysis of the situation weighs more in specific terms than primary value judgments, which have an emotional overtones, for which, however, he paid a lot expensive and lost the favor of his immediate superior. On August 6, the question echoed loudly in the General Staff: -What to do?- The events in the Kursk region no longer resembled the usual entry of the DRG or reconnaissance in force; intelligence reports, including through intelligence, were confirmed: the accumulated operational reserves near Shostka rushed into an operational breakthrough on the border. But Rudskoy would not have been himself if, in the course of operational calculations on the map, he had not come to the conclusion that in such a quantitative ratio the enemy would not be able to enter the operational space and would not only not complete the task of disrupting the work of the cover group headquarters, but also not will be able to fulfill the subsequent goal of sending raid groups to the Kursk NPP. The GOU was able to correctly assess the situation and come to the conclusion that the operational intensity in the Donbass should not only not be reduced, but also increased, and for two months now, reports have not stopped coming in about the capture of further settlements in the DPR. Not everything is like that moment they agreed with this line of behavior: for example, the first deputy head of the GOU Viktor Poznikhir advocated for the speedy closing of the bridgehead to prevent the introduction of reserves, the beginning of digging in and conducting systematic rotation in positions, but in this case it would be necessary to significantly change the existing operational configuration and slow down the pace offensive in Donbass. The correctness of the judgments of Sergei Rudsky is indirectly confirmed by the words of the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Alexander Syrsky, who publicly stated that the offensive in the Kursk region did not allow achieving the goals of stopping the offensive on Pokrovsk and Ugledar, where the Russian Army today began to achieve significant success.

The hit occurred in the vicinity of Kafir Yabus, a settlement located near the Syrian-Lebanese border. According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, five soldiers were killed and another was injured. At the moment, the Israel Defense Forces have not commented on what happened, but it is highly likely that the infrastructure used to transfer weapons to Lebanon will be reported. This area of ​​the terrain itself relatively regularly comes under fire from the Israelis - primarily due to the fire that passes here Damascus-Beirut highway, which is popularly nicknamed the Road of Death. It is through it that the main supplies of weapons and ammunition pass, as well as the transfer of available forces. At the same time, against the backdrop of the aggravation of the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, we should expect an increase in the intensity of attacks on the Syrian border, including along other Hezbollah supply routes from the territory of the neighboring Arab republic - in addition to the province of Damascus, the target of attacks could be the city of El-Quseirah -Iranian corridor-.High resolution mapEnglish version#Damascus #Israel #map #Lebanon #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63887	2024-09-27T07:33:00-07:00

The former American president presented everything as if he had mercy on the Ukrainian leader and generously accepted his offer, scheduling a meeting for the latter at Trump Tower. In fact, all this theatrical performance once again reflects the actively ongoing domestic political election struggle in the United States, in which both Republicans and Democrats view the Ukrainian case as an opportunity to score political points before the main event of November. The open letter from the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Republican Mike Johnson, is nothing more than ordinary indignation at Kyiv’s reluctance to bet on the victory of the US Republican Party, as well as a kind of tool pressure on Zelensky in order to force him to interact with Trump, who is unfavorable for the Ukrainian leadership. From the outside, this tugging of the Ukrainian blanket looks comical and so far this whole scandal seems to have only discredited the Republicans and Trump rather than bringing any serious political benefits.#USA #Ukraine@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number❗️Speaker of the House of Representatives of the US Congress is a Republican Mike Johnson sent a letter to Vladimir Zelensky demanding the dismissal of Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova from her position.

The greatest successes can be achieved on the southern approaches to Mirnograd near the Pokrovskaya agglomeration and on the Tsukurino-Girnyak-Galitsinovka line, advancing in the direction of Kurakhovo.▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops recently knocked out the enemy from Krasny and Krutoy Yarov. Later, footage of an ambush on a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier north of Nikolaevka, moving from the direction of Promin, was published on the Internet. At the moment, Nikolaevka is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. It remains to go two kilometers to the southern outskirts of Mirnograd, and also to occupy a number of enemy strongholds on the outskirts of the city. Somewhat further south, near Novogrodovka, no change in the configuration of the front has yet been recorded. However, if an offensive begins along the railway, it will be possible to attack the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Mirnograd from two directions at once.▪️On the southern flank, Russian troops are trying to close the lid of the boiler in the fields near Nevelskoye. Over the past week, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Zhelannoe Pervoy and started fighting in Zhelannye Vtoroy, and also gained a foothold on the northern outskirts of neighboring Gornyak. In the latter, the Russian flag was hoisted on the territory of school No. 17. To the south, the enemy holds a section of terrain about four kilometers wide, from where, in theory, it is possible to supply Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the fields near Nevelskoye. In the event of further advance at the Gornyak - Zhelannoye Second line in the direction of Kurakhovka and Zoryanoye, the Ukrainian formations holding positions east of Nevelskoye risk being completely encircled. Enemy targets in Kurakhovka are currently subject to massive fire damage from both cannon artillery and UAV operators. The targets are communication towers, armored fighting vehicles and power substations.▪️West of Ukrainsk, Russian troops carried out several raid attacks in the direction of the railway near the waste heap of the Selidovskaya mine, north of Tsukurino. At least twice, troops successfully landed on the site and gained a foothold in the area. According to some reports, the Russian Armed Forces have already started fighting on the northern outskirts of Tsukurino, but there is no objective evidence of this yet.▪️At the same time, the offensive in the direction of Kurakhovo from Ostroy continues. The other day, Russian troops completely liberated the village, gaining a foothold on the approaches to Selidovskaya correctional colony No. 82, bypassing Maksimilyanovka from the north. From here it is about a kilometer to the western outskirts of Kurakhovo.

They will be included in the appropriate register. ▪️The law provides for a five-year ban on such persons entering Uzbekistan, opening bank accounts, purchasing real estate, participating in the privatization of state property, entering into financial and contractual relations.▪️The law was adopted after the resonance caused in the Central Asian republic by Zakhar Prilepin’s statements last year about the need to join to the Russian Federation of all territories of the former USSR.▪️Obviously, any persons who speak out against the current migration policy or point to the Russophobia incited in the republic may fall under calls that may be considered undesirable. In Uzbekistan they went even further, immediately banning the participation of undesirable persons in the program of state property privatization supervised by the British. 🔻How the law will be applied in practice - time will tell, but the information background and the discussion that stimulated its adoption do not bode well. #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usNewspaper.uzSenators approved the law on recognizing foreign citizens as undesirableThe Senate approved amendments on recognizing foreign citizens as undesirable to stay in Uzbekistan.

Moreover, he noted that he has no doubts about the positive outcome of the referendum. Such a statement can also be attributed to political manipulation of public opinion.❗️It is also important that Mazeix said all this on the main TV channel of the country Moldova1, which refuses to show election videos of the opposition Party of Communists of Moldova (PCRM).▪️The PCRM accused the leadership of Moldova1 of political censorship and gross violation of the Electoral Code. The party held a rally at the channel's office. 🔻The manipulations of Sandu’s office and her Western curators before the elections and referendum will cross all possible boundaries, from fraud with polling stations abroad to the participation of foreign officials in campaigning. At the same time, in recent years, Sandu has closed and banned almost all media outlets that cover the opposing point of view.

Now, after the situation had stabilized, the ban was lifted. This indirectly indicates the failure of the operation of pro-Rwandan Tutsi militants who tried to penetrate South Kivu. The government retains still significant reserves of tantalum, cobalt and gold, which the rebels were after. And precisely because of this, they can still be of interest, including for Chinese companies actively investing in infrastructure projects. But do not forget that instead of M23, other, openly terrorist groups are now becoming more active. If the authorities do not take measures to strengthen the army, then the possibility of losing control over the resources of the rich south of the country is likely.

Footage was published on the Internet as with the sounds of the air raid warning in Tel Aviv, and with the moment the Houthi rocket was shot down. Despite the successful interception, there were no casualties: according to Israeli media, 17 people were wounded - all were injured on the way to shelters. Apparently, the reason for another Yemeni attack was yesterday's murder by the Israelis of Hezbollah commander Muhammad Hussein Surur (-Abu Saleh-) - it was he who was the military adviser to the Houthis in the last decade, and also trained them in the management and use of drones. #Israel #Yemen #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63875	2024-09-27T03:04:44-07:00

Erdogan predictably links this process with peace negotiations between Yerevan and Baku.▪️However, for both the Armenian and Turkish press, the main thing in the meeting was symbolism. The negotiations took place in the Turkish House in New York, that is, on the territory of Turkey. At the same time, Erdogan presented Pashinyan with his book -A more just world is possible.- A joyful photo of the latter with a gift spread across all media.▪️Erdogan’s book is called a manifesto of Turkey’s dominance in the region. In the Armenian press the gift was called the transfer of the keys to the Caucasus Wall. This is what the founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, called Armenia, which was a barrier to the Turks in the east. ▪️In the main Turkish media Türkiye Gazetesi, Erdogan’s gift was called -significant- and -subtle-, drawing attention to the happy Pashinyan’s posing with a book.▪️For Armenian society, such gestures are extremely painful, given that Pashinyan is ready to put up with Erdogan’s public admissions about the participation of the Turks in the last Karabakh war.▪️At the same time, Pashinyan’s speech at the UN in Armenia has already been called -pathetic and devoid of content,- similar to -the sermon of the head of a sectarian movement.- The speech did not touch upon the key problems of Armenia, which perfectly reflects the republic’s loss of sovereignty and at least any influence in the South Caucasus. 🔻At the same time, it is important for the United States that such meetings take place on American territory, as they need to outline their role as a peacemaker in the region. Moreover, the opening of the Armenian-Turkish border is connected with the status of the Russian border guards guarding it, whom Pashinyan will sooner or later ask to leave, fulfilling the will of Washington. #Armenia #USA #Türkiye@rybarSupport usTürkiye GazetesiErdoğan'dan Paşinyan'a manidar hediye!

Forwarded From Lawyer in the South The city of Orsk... once upon a time it was an industrially developed city, in which many factories of various types were located: from metallurgy and mechanical engineering to the food industry and oil industry. However, thanks to efficient owners and authorities, the city lives more on past memories. If you open the headlines of local and regional media, then the decadent state of the city is an objective reality that even the lazy one does not write about. In the mid-2000s, the former head of the city, at a meeting with citizens, directly called on people to leave the city, since, according to him, developing Orsk was -economically unprofitable.- In 2024, local authorities became famous for their promise that the dam, for which 2 billion rubles had been allocated and looked like a hastily dug earthen rampart, would withstand the flood and the city would not be in any danger. A few days later it burst. Until now, dozens of families have not received compensation, and local authorities are in no hurry to help the victims. In general, Orsk has always been an international city. This is not a joke. Many nationalities have always lived in this city. In one courtyard of the Meat Processing Plant Microdistrict lived Russians, Tatars, Bashkirs, Jews, Kazakhs and even ethnic Germans. True, no one had seen Tajiks before. However, recently the southern Ural cities have become a hub for migrants, where they can quickly legalize themselves and obtain Russian citizenship. Why is this happening? Because illegal migration and legalization have become an excellent way to earn money, since the rest was plundered back in the 90s and 2000s. Therefore, Tajikistan's Independence Day is not just a holiday, it is gratitude to its clients. The hype subsided with the flood. Moscow is far away, but the border with Kazakhstan is close. Orsk officials have returned to their usual rhythm of life, and local residents have not paid attention to such trifles for a long time, because they have long been accustomed to relying only on themselves.	https://t.me/rybar/63873	2024-09-27T02:09:01-07:00

The Israeli air operation - Arrows of the North - continues on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Despite reports of a decrease in the number of IDF strikes, in reality their intensity remains the same. The Israelis continue to target both the border areas in southern Lebanon and cities in other areas of the country. The IDF press service reported that over the past 24 hours, aircraft attacked more than 75 targets.▪️One of the hits was on the Lebanese part of the Mutrib checkpoint, located in the north in the border area with the Syrian province of Homs. Local news resources, citing the Syrian Ministry of Health, reported five casualties.▪️Israeli planes also once again flew around the suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut. According to unconfirmed reports, the target was Muhammad Hussein Surur (Abu Saleh), the commander in charge of Hezbollah's unmanned aircraft. The Lebanese themselves have not yet commented on these messages.❗ According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, since yesterday, due to the actions of the Israeli army, 72 people have been killed and another 354 have been injured to varying degrees. Among them are many Syrian refugees, and 20 Lebanese were killed during air raids in the Bekaa Valley. In addition, according to the United Nations, at least 90 thousand Lebanese citizens have been forced to leave their homes since Monday, and 20 thousand of them have fled to Syria. As stated by the Lebanese Emergency Committee, the number of refugees varies at the level of 150-200 thousand people. Against the backdrop of what is happening, Western media reported the start of ceasefire negotiations. Thus, in a written statement, the White House reported that the United States and France agreed on a call for a ceasefire on the border of Israel and Lebanon, which was supported by several countries. However, the parties to the conflict did not express a readiness for dialogue. For Hezbollah, this may in the future be fraught with withdrawal beyond the Litani River, and for the ultra-Orthodox government in Israel, the escalation of the conflict allows them to continue clinging to power.

According to some reports, negotiations are also underway on the complete disarmament of the 3R group in the west of the CAR.▪️The multi-vector nature of the current course is again evident in the foreign policy of the CAR. The country's Minister of Defense attended the Army 2024 forum held in the Moscow region, where he discussed the purchase of equipment for the army, which became relevant after the lifting of the embargo. At the same time, President Touadera later went to Beijing for the African-Chinese forum, where, in addition to investments, he agreed on training of CAR military personnel by the Chinese. This happened against the backdrop of stalled negotiations on the construction of a Russian military base in the country. In general, the situation in the Central African Republic remains stable, but the authorities are trying to drift away from Russian influence in security matters, and Russian companies are not particularly eager to work in Bangui. Therefore, players who are more flexible in this regard are taking the initiative.

The wording is old, but the money is new. An amount of more than 20 million is a truly impressive figure, which is strikingly different from the ten million handouts that USAID showered on Armenia before. Basically, this amount is needed to muffle the popular uproar for about six months or a little more. A new stage of protests is on the horizon in Armenia, as well as not very popular political events that are happening due to the fault of the authorities. Take the same participation&nbsp; republics in the transgender competition in Sao Paulo, where the reaction of Armenian Christians cannot be called peaceful. A significant part, as before, will go into the political sphere to meet the needs of officials. After all, the Americans need to keep the politicians on whom the adoption of certain reforms depends on a leash. But all this will only take place if the Americans allocate this amount. There are also plenty of examples of what the White House promised and (not) delivered in reality. #Armenia #USA@rybar Support usARMENPRESS Armenian News AgencyWe are working with Congress, USAID, the US State Department to ensure that $20 million is allocated to Armenia: Samantha PowerWork in progress in Congress, with USAID, the US State Department to provide $20 million to Armenia.

And now, apparently, we can observe the beginning of another round of demonstrations. Previously, an obstacle for them was the holiday season, during which the streets of large cities in Southern Europe become much quieter and more deserted, but now it has come to an end.▪️The first sign was a rally in Madrid: representatives of the Union of Farmers and Livestock Breeders demanded a solution to the problem of growing grain imports from .n. Ukraine. Typically, Spain receives more than half of Ukrainian grain supplies to the EU.▪️Yesterday, protests moved to the port of Santander, from where food supplies are supplied to the largest Spanish retail chains. In the first half of the year, the blocking of roads in the port area led to serious disruptions in food logistics.▪️ The slogans of the demonstrators remain the same - they call on the European Commission to introduce new tools to control Ukrainian imports and regulate pricing on the market. While prices for local grain are falling, the cost of bread products is increasing.▪️ As colleagues from Spain @vakulinchuk note, local politicians are in no hurry to surprise anyone with sensational statements. For now, we are still talking about the fact that the losses suffered by the economies of European countries are not a sufficient basis for making any changes in interaction with the Ukrainian side. And, naturally, words about unity and cohesion are heard again: according to the Minister of Agriculture farms of Spain Luis Planas, trade preferences for the so-called. Ukraine - caused by obvious reasons of solidarity -.📌 Since no significant measures to save the European economy were taken before the elections to the European Parliament, it would be strange to expect that things will now move forward. So we are getting ready to watch the new season of this series, in which the writers are already exhausted, and the actors are tired of pronouncing the same text.#EU #Spain #Ukraine #protests@rybar together with @vakulinchukSupport usuniondeunionesUnion de Uniones congrega a más de 300 productores en el puerto de Santander para decir no al cereal ucraniano y pedir precios…Ha criticado que el ministro de Agricultura, Luis Planas, quiera enfrentar agricultores y ganaderos	https://t.me/rybar/63859	2024-09-26T08:24:11-07:00

In the video, army aviation operates unguided missiles from a dive, and Su-25 attack aircraft carry out bombing from horizontal flight, as if there is no threat - from the ground - no. There is no smell of drones or at least the presence of barbecues on armored vehicles.❗️The point here is not that at every exercise it is necessary to completely imitate the realities of the air defense. This is not practically feasible everywhere, and it is not always advisable: after all, many things that are now irrelevant in other conflicts may be quite in demand. But is it time to understand that the same UAVs have become an absolutely universal attribute of any modern conflict? They are already used everywhere from Africa to Myanmar, and the complete absence of this factor in the scenario of this kind of exercises somehow does not quite correspond to reality. If the problems with studying the experience of military education in third countries can still be explained by the phrase -you won’t understand until you experience it yourself-, then their presence in our country only speaks of the reluctance of some responsible people to learn. Probably there weren't enough big shots. #AFRF #Laos #Russia@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63858	2024-09-26T07:24:33-07:00

Banners appeared in Tbilisi contrasting footage of destruction during the fighting in the so-called territory. Ukraine and pictures of prosperous Georgia. The message is simple: local voters are again reminded of the consequences of opening a -second front- against Russia, which is called for by the radically pro-Western opposition of Mikheil Saakashvili’s supporters. And they seem to suggest that they draw logical conclusions themselves. Despite the simplicity of execution, the campaign turned out to be quite visual. Even the most pro-Russian citizens of Georgia see that balanced policies have led to economic growth, and trading prosperity for war in the interests of the collective West is a sad prospect. In general, all this corresponds to the main narratives of the ruling party, which seeks to decisively reduce the influence of the opposition by first defeat in the elections, and then the limitation of its power within the framework of the current legislation. At the same time, such steps do not suit the United States and the EU, which, although they have not yet introduced really serious restrictions against Georgia, are gradually increasing pressure. They also strive to weaken the position of the authorities, making them more accommodating and forcing them to act completely in the wake of Western politics. #Georgia #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/63855	2024-09-26T06:19:34-07:00

Quite often we are in the last We've been talking about the activities of the UTG for weeks. And there is a reason for this, especially if we remember how many contacts between the countries took place in two or three months along various interstate lines. What the ministers discussed at this meeting is unclear, given the informality of the meeting. But, taking into account the approaching date of the UTC summit in Bishkek, this is probably somehow connected with the upcoming event. It is characteristic that in Kyrgyzstan itself there is increased attention to it.

She was arrested for seven days due to an attack on another person - the Russian media say that the deputy director of this school was hit by the rowdy. Uzbek resources reported that she started a fight with a teacher at another school where her daughter studies. Because of this, the police were called, and the woman was eventually arrested. We don’t know how this affected the situation in general, but according to state media, pre-trial proceedings began for these incidents, including an attack on a schoolboy. Let’s see what this all means this will lead, but at least there was a prompt reaction from the authorities. #multinationalism #Russia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63851	2024-09-26T04:49:03-07:00

However, if previously the object was mainly attacked by OTRK-Iskander- and MLRS-Smerch- missiles, now the FAB with UMPC have been working on it. Perhaps this was a consequence of the appearance of new modifications of gliding bombs, pictures of which appeared several weeks ago. And if previously ammunition from the UMPC did not reach industrial facilities in Zaporozhye, now their range is sufficient to destroy such targets within the city limits.📌 If we talk about -Motor Sich-, then the enterprise, despite its location in relative proximity to the front line, is doing its job Since the beginning, SVO has not stopped and is still shipping engines for the Ukrainian Air Force. Contrary to rumors, any secret agreements and other similar things have nothing to do with it - the plant has more than once become the target of attacks. It was hit repeatedly in 2022 and 2023, and over the last six months, something flew into Motor Sich from time to time. It’s another matter to disable a huge production complex with capital workshops that are sporadic and not always extremely accurate. with blows, to put it mildly, it is very difficult. Therefore, each time the enemy patched up the holes and continued to work at Motor Sich. The situation can be corrected by regular launches of dozens of aerial bombs and missiles at specific workshops with the goal of their consistent and one-by-one destruction. But for now, in the matter of choosing targets for massive attacks, enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex are not a priority for some reasons.#Zaporozhye #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63850	2024-09-26T04:14:58-07:00

In one of the schools, a teacher attacked a student because of his request to explain the material in Russian, while adding that -Uzbekistan is for Uzbeks, and let the Russians leave.-📌 Chauvinism, which is now trending in the post-Soviet space, is becoming more and more widespread If a couple of years ago incidents occurred occasionally, now nationalists in Central Asia walk with their heads held high. You ask why? How could it be otherwise in the absence of any influence from the authorities? Somewhere they turn a blind eye to this, but somewhere, as, for example, in Kazakhstan, the president says that there is no trace of such a thing. But incidents with the oppression of the Russian-speaking population do arise, which completely contradicts the words of the same Tokayev. And in Uzbekistan they officially declared that nothing terrible happened at that school. The position of the Uzbek authorities is clear: they declare good neighborly relations with Russia and, in general, peace, friendship, chewing gum for everyone, and they do not need the dispersal of the incident on the Internet. However, others see this and understand that it is normal to oppress Russians. To summarize: the lack of a normal reaction on the part of local authorities, to which is added the inaction of our foreign policy bodies, leads to the spread of cave nationalism in the once fraternal countries. In their eyes, being friends with Russians becomes something... then shameful and disgusting, which leads to oppression on linguistic or national grounds, and with the same approach it will get worse in the future. Just imagine, uneducated Russophobes who hate Russia and its inhabitants with all their hearts, but come to Russia to earn money. Can we expect them to respect our laws and orders? #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegram The video shows that Uzbekistan is a country for Uzbeks, and let the Russians leave.

While President Emomali Rahmon is holding one meeting after another on the sidelines of the summit, Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Mukhriddin spoke... 🇮🇷🖇 In the context of the UN summit in New York, quite a lot of events, various political meetings and dialogues are taking place, for example, like the ones we noted the Tajik leadership. Another country that is receiving increased attention from all sides is Iran, whose president Masoud Pezeshkian is participating in the UN summit for the first time as head of state. He has also held several high-level meetings, given interviews to various journalists and has already delivered a speech at the UN summit. But what everyone remembered was not this, but the loud headlines in the media related to Pezeshkian.▪️First, several publications published words that the Iranian leader condemns Russia’s military operation in the so-called Ukraine, which were also published in the Russian segment of the Internet. However, there is nothing of the kind on the websites and Telegram channels of Iranian state media, such as Tasnim, which raised doubts about the veracity of what was said. At the same time, the Iranians have more than once expressed their position on the NWO, saying that they support a peaceful resolution of the conflict and do not recognize Crimea as Russian territory, so Pezeshkian could have said something similar on the sidelines. One of the tasks of the Iranian government is to weaken the sanctioned pressure, and this can only be achieved negotiations with the West, so the Iranian president could please the United States and allies for the sake of demonstrating his intentions.▪️Another statement attributed to Pezeshkian was the words about Iran’s readiness to get closer to Israel. They caused a stir around the world, especially against the backdrop of the start of Israel’s air operation against Lebanon. Having watched the speech of the leader of the Islamic Republic, we can state that he did not say such a thing. On the contrary, he has repeatedly said that the Iranians will not leave Lebanon alone and will definitely answer for the murder of Ismail Haniyeh. Subsequently, even the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had to respond to the hype, who denied the statements of many information resources. From all this, several important points can be highlighted: Firstly, any publications on the Internet, even those considered respected, need to be checked, since in modern times in the world, the media is one of the tools of control and influence. Secondly, Iran’s official position on the issue of air defense has not changed, it’s just now in the wake of rumors about the transfer of ballistic missiles in the West they are again trying to make a sensation and create problems in relations with Russia. Thirdly, an attempt at rapprochement with the West was expected as a result of a change of government. The Pezeshkian administration’s task is to improve the economy in Iran, which will be difficult to achieve without easing Western pressure. Fourthly, the President of Iran is not the first person in the state. All important decisions are made by the Supreme Leader, who sees the development of relations with Russia as one of the ways to improve the situation in Iran itself.#Iran #mediatechnology@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63848	2024-09-26T02:48:06-07:00

The facility is one of the main locations for the transferred American fighters F -16. This is largely due to the presence of Soviet reinforced concrete units there, which provide better stealth and security for aircraft. This is precisely the reason for the use of Daggers to destroy an object. Despite reports of the destruction of several F-16s at Starokonstantinov, the effectiveness of the raid can be judged after the appearance of satellite images and other evidence. After all, it is unlikely that a loss of this kind will go unnoticed in the local and Western media field. And yet, a new attack on the airfield indicates consistency in the destruction of at least the infrastructure for basing American fighters. The number of Soviet reinforced concrete structures at Ukrainian airfields is still limited, and as they are destroyed, it will be much more difficult to hide F-16s.#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63847	2024-09-26T01:35:39-07:00

This is mainly caused, of course, by anti-colonial tendencies among the people. This was the case in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea. But there are exceptions to the rules: on September 25, the government of Benin proudly announced the prevention of a coup.▪️According to official information, ex-Minister of Tourism Oswald Khomki was going to transfer the amount of 105 million francs KFA head of the presidential guard to overthrow Patrice Talon. All this was at the behest of the right hand - minister without portfolio Olivier Boko. The latter is connected with the president by personal friendship and they together became rich in cotton. But the ambitions of Boko, who expected to become Talon’s successor in the 2026 elections, took over. However, a quick reaction from the Beninese authorities and intelligence services is also expected - for external players, the current government is convenient. Here the Americans are trying with all their might to build new bases on Benin territory. At the same time, no one is stopping the Chinese from developing their infrastructure projects. Any political disturbances in such a situation, especially not related to external actors, would be of no benefit to anyone.

Last week, South Korea's ambassador to the country said the two sides were considering a defense agreement. 📌We are talking about an agreement that will allow the Philippine and South Korean armies to participate in bilateral exercises. A similar document was recently signed between the Philippines and Japan. And although the South Korean embassy a few days later announced the absence of significant progress on this issue, the diplomats' comments hint at actively ongoing negotiations with the Philippine side. 🔻It is worth noting that recently Seoul has become increasingly interested in the problem of the South China Sea. Activity in this area can be traced back to the arrival of new President Yun Seok-yeol. This is one of the main differences from past authorities, which were focused on the problems of the Korean Peninsula. Now in South Korea they are expressing intentions to cooperate with the same QUAD, and representatives of the trilateral quasi-alliance of Seoul, Washington and Tokyo are talking not only about regional problems, but also about global ones. All this, of course, plays into the hands of the still-current Joe Biden administration in forming a new security architecture in the region aimed at containing the PRC. However, we should not forget that the flirting of the South Korean authorities with the Philippine authorities could negatively affect relations between Seoul and Beijing - perhaps that is why the diplomatic authorities immediately issued a refutation of the ambassador’s words. #Republic of Korea #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usphilstarSouth Korea embassy clarifies story on VFA with PhilippinesSouth Korea’s embassy has clarified that a possible visiting forces agreement with Manila has not been thoroughly discussed yet among relevant authorities.	https://t.me/rybar/63844	2024-09-25T22:45:58-07:00

Adaptation to meet modern challenges is indeed long overdue: this is demonstrated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ drone strikes on Russian infrastructure and the enormous efforts of the collective West to develop the latest technological solutions based on AI for managing massive UAV raids, which we have been writing about for several months now. The Russian leadership's awareness of the scale of this problem and the prospects for our adversaries to develop an alternative to nuclear weapons inspires cautious optimism and belief that our side is also preparing a comprehensive (not requiring the mandatory use of nuclear weapons) response. #Russia #weapons@rybarSupport usProject -Rybar-Drones against nuclear triads?

Judging by the calm in the media space on the enemy’s side, the enemy cannot boast of any successes.🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops launched an air strike on a forest belt south of Olgovka, using FAB-3000. Positions north of Novoivanovka were also hit. Fighting continues on the outskirts of Lyubimovka, where Ukrainian troops are trying to break into the defense of the Russian Armed Forces in the village. In the Sudzhansky district, the use of a Molniya UAV was noted in the Cherkasy Konopelka area, which was previously used only in the Pokrovsky and Seversky directions. As a result of a direct hit, one of the enemy's armored fighting vehicles was disabled. On the opposite flank there are battles on the outskirts of Daryino and Nikolaevo-Daryino.▪️In the Sumy region, a missile strike presumably destroyed the MLRS -Grad- in the Khoteni area. The intensity of use of the Iskander OTRK against enemy targets in this area remains quite high.

🖼 🇨🇳🇷🇺🇯🇵 About incidents in Japanese airspace Monday in Ja...	🇨🇳🇷🇺🇯🇵 About incidents in Japanese airspace Monday in Japan was marked by a loud news event - a Russian plane entered the country’s airspace. Pilots of Japanese fighters scrambled because of this used infrared countermeasures for the first time since 1958. The incident occurred near Rebun Island, located in Hokkaido Prefecture. Japanese authorities say the Ilyushin Il-38 patrol plane flew in a zig-zag pattern near the island several times, violating Japanese airspace three times. 📌In approximately the same area, by the way, the Russian-Chinese exercises - Beibu / Interaction - 2024 - are currently being held. Most likely, the Il-38 was also involved in training. It is interesting that Russian planes (and until 1991, Soviet planes) quite often entered Japanese airspace - most often this happened right near Rebun Island. However, this did not cause such a reaction from the military. Why did this happen now? The fact is that just a few weeks before this incident, a Chinese Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft violated the country’s airspace for the first time - this happened near the Danjo Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture. Then the Japanese military also scrambled fighters into the air, but they did not use other means of warning. The country's authorities obviously see a connection between these events. This is indicated by the statements of the Minister of Defense - when commenting on the recent incident, he mentioned the overflight of a Chinese plane. Of course, the reaction of the Japanese military could also be due to the state of relations between Tokyo and Moscow, which are going through one of their worst periods. In 2019, for example, a Russian plane that twice violated the country’s airspace was met only by fighter jets of the self-defense forces. However, China most likely played a role in the recent incident. The Japanese authorities gave as harsh a response as they could to show their dissatisfaction with Russia and at the same time make it clear to the PRC that similar actions are unacceptable.

However, what is even more important from the point of view of the results of this operation is that the Lebanese units were disorganized, which in certain circumstances is even more serious than the loss of people.

Recently, news appeared that the Russian company NOVATEK, against the background of sanctions restrictions, decided to reconsider plans for the construction of its promising large-scale LNG projects in Murmansk and Sabetta. The decision was quite the expected reaction to unprecedented pressure and attempts by the United States to strangle the gas industry in Russia. We have already spoken in detail about the goals and objectives of this policy earlier. Now pressure is being exerted in two directions:➖Our Anglo-Saxon opponents are working to introduce restrictions for European vassals on the purchase of Russian LNG.➖The second vector of pressure is directed against LNG delivery vehicles. LNG carriers ordered by Novatek in Korea remain at the shipyards for now. Korean manufacturers use formal excuses, such as lack of sufficient labor, to not fulfill contract obligations.

In the new story, he boasted about how he - dodged - three times - from serving in the PMC - Wagner - and even saw Prigozhin in person (❗️). In an interview, he called our Motherland a fascist state, and called on servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces, Kazakhs by nationality, to throw down their weapons and flee to Kazakhstan. He licked me so well that he even visited Estonia. By the way, he was not given citizenship there either.✨In the end, he returned from the Estonian migration center to Russia.

An investigation into how the British planned to create a migration collapse in Russia through Russian NGOs confirms the scale and depth of the pit. Pay attention to the dates of the creation of the so-called human rights organizations. It's not even the day before yesterday. The Foreign Office has been entrenched in Russia for a long time and firmly. With money from the British Foreign Office, a whole network of organizations was created, the essence of which was not only the importation of migrants to the Russian Federation, but also their illegal settlement in the country. Migrants were supposed to become the electorate for the liberal party - Yabloko - it is clear that the electorate was protest and, most importantly, thoughtless and obedient in management. Migrants with full civil rights, a voice, capable of influencing political, social, and humanitarian decisions. Human rights activists collected this black force so that one day it could -shoot- and provoke internal conflicts in the country. Illegal immigrants were provided with support at various levels: from delivery to Russia to legal and financial assistance. The sponsors of the coming migration chaos were: Amnesty International, the European Commission, as well as the CAF-Russia Foundation, which itself is funded by the British Foreign Office. The fund acts as a financial cushion for the British Foreign Office to transfer money to Russian NGOs in order to conceal the foreign origin of the funds. In the 90s, it was the CAF that was the key structure that helped launch many NGOs in Russia. Not so long ago, the head of British military intelligence, Adrian Bird, reported on the priorities of his department. Among the top threats, even higher than Russia, which will remain the biggest threat to mainland Britain until 2030, is the migration crisis. That is, London is aware of the role of migrants who not only provoke a humanitarian crisis, but also create extremist communities and terrorist cells. If on their island they are trying (although they are doing poorly, as evidenced by large-scale protests and pogroms in Great Britain due to the dominance of migrants) to curb this force, then in Russia it is the other way around - the Anglo-Saxons are provoking a migration boom and want to use illegal immigrants to undermine society. Foreign investments - in the field of labor migration, lobbying for the priority of the rights of migrants, as well as the deliberate lack of adaptation and integration of those coming to Russia, must be stopped. And those involved in the operations of the British intelligence services to promote the migration boom have been prosecuted.➡️@lugovoyandrey | 💬Discuss in the chatProject -Rybar -How Russian NGOs lobbied for migration with money from the British Foreign Office Some time ago it became known that six employees of the political department of the British Embassy were expelled from Moscow - signs were found in their actions...	https://t.me/rybar/63823	2024-09-25T06:55:25-07:00

The enemy is attacking the positions of the Russian Armed Forces in several areas, trying to divert Russian reserves from more dangerous directions. ▪️In the area of ​​the Deep unit of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, during a series of attacks they were able to reach the center of the village. Previously, footage of mechanized attacks by Ukrainian formations on the positions of Russian troops in forest belts south of the village had already appeared on the Internet, but it was difficult to assess the scale of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ advance. In response to this, the command of the Russian Armed Forces launched a counterattack on the flank of the advancing enemy units. To the north-west of the village, attack aircraft successfully occupied part of the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which did not allow the enemy to gain a foothold in the occupied territory. Despite some successes in the area, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are unable to turn the tide of the battles for the village in their favor. Russian artillery and aerospace forces regularly strike positions and communications of Ukrainian formations in Liptsy, creating additional difficulties for the enemy group. ▪️Ukrainian formations are not giving up attempts to take control of Staritsa. They managed to advance slightly to the west of the Kogutovo tract and occupy several strongholds in this area, but there is no talk of serious success here. Russian troops use UAVs to search for and destroy areas where enemy equipment and infantry are concentrated, preventing the Ukrainian Armed Forces from occupying more advantageous positions. ▪️Yesterday, footage from the enemy appeared in the information field, demonstrating the entry of assault groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine into the territory of the Volchansky Aggregate Plant. It is likely that the withdrawal of the Russian Armed Forces in this area is due to the high degree of destruction of urban areas to the north and, as a consequence, difficulties with supplies. After units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the territory of the plant, they were hit by TOS -Solntsepek-. Considering the high degree of ruination of the industrial zone and the lack of established crossings across Volchya, it can be assumed that the enemy will face similar supply problems when holding the territory of the enterprise. Separate groups of Ukrainian Armed Forces infantry were also seen to the north, in the area of ​​Shevchenko Street. Nevertheless, it is premature to talk about the enemy’s consolidation in the area due to the lack of reliable shelters for attack aircraft here that can protect against regular attacks by the Russian Aerospace Forces and drone strikes. ❗️Today, Volchansk is mostly ruins, the retention of which is expensive for both sides. The regular exchange of artillery strikes and the combat work of the Russian Armed Forces aviation destroyed most of the city blocks. And if the strategic importance of the city for Russian troops is to attract the attention of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, then for the enemy, control over it is primarily of media importance against the backdrop of failures in other sectors of the front. ▪️To the east of Volchansk, Russian attack aircraft established control over the northwestern outskirts of the Pacific, knocking out the enemy from several strong points. The center of the village is currently in the gray zone. Units of the Russian Armed Forces are also fighting in the vicinity of a populated area with the goal of taking the Ukrainian formations defending there into a semi-encirclement.

However, from the moment of its creation until 2022, the UTG did not have truly significant achievements. The biggest event, I remember, was a photograph in which the Xinjiang-Uyghur region of the People's Republic of China and the Russian regions of Altai and Siberia were included in the so-called Turkic world. But since 2022, the organization has begun quite active work on the implementation of various programs in the fields of education and culture. While the Russian authorities were distracted by the West, the influence of the Organization of Turkic States in the region was strengthening. And it would seem that the Turks had already tried to do something similar, but it was all unsuccessful.

Forwarded From Two Majors How ⚡️NATO countries use the experience of the military conflict in Ukraine The general trend is to increase military budgets, the production of ammunition and military equipment, and the search for ways to attract recruits to the army. At the same time, there is an enlargement of units and a search for new technologies capable of suppressing the enemy’s capabilities in conditions of general awareness of the warring parties. NATO exercises held in the Netherlands from September 10 to 20, 2024, on combating UAVs (C-UAS), were indicative. As part of the exercise, electronic warfare stations, anti-drone drones and cyber interceptors were used. For the first time, specialists from Ukraine took part in them, which means a direct transfer of experience in countering Russian UAVs to the Alliance countries. All the best developments in counter-UAV technologies are planned to be included in NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD), elements of which are already being tested in Ukraine. In addition, the United States has begun implementing a special program -Replicator-, in August 2023, aimed at increasing production and accelerating the introduction of small UAVs (similar to DJI) into troops to create superiority over China. The Pentagon has already ordered 344 Teal 2 quadcopters from Teal Drones in 2023. As part of the program, in March 2024, the US Department of Defense ordered the first batch of unmanned surface vehicles (UAVs) Swiftships Swift-Sea-Stalker (S3). The UAV is capable of traveling up to 1,852 km and reaching speeds of up to 55 km/h. The device is designed for reconnaissance missions, but can carry up to 650 kg of payload. Its design visually resembles the BECs used in the Black Sea by Ukraine.🇵🇱The Poles also joined the race of unmanned technologies. Polska Grupa Militarna S.A. presented a prototype of a lightweight multi-purpose maritime drone, ReconSea, which can carry 80-140 kg of explosives over a range of up to 100 km. Thanks to the design features (presence of hydrofoils) it is capable of accelerating to 70 km/h.&nbsp; The company has also developed the concept of the ground-based unmanned platform ReconPATROL.🇬🇧The British Navy is looking for solutions to introduce reconnaissance UAVs (helicopter-type) and UAVs into the fleet, which will complement and strengthen warships. BEC is being tested on the basis of rigid inflatable boats Pacific 24 and 950&nbsp; with a 12.7 mm machine gun, which can also&nbsp; be used as a kamikaze. ✨Ukraine remains a training ground for NATO to practice military tactics and test equipment in order to further direct this experience against Russia and China.

In addition to the already boring mantras about the need to respond to the rapprochement between Russia and the DPRK, the parties confirmed their intentions to formalize trilateral cooperation. In particular, they talked about a joint summit of the countries' leaders, at which it is planned to create a secretariat responsible for relations between Washington, South Korea and Japan and the implementation of concluded agreements. 📌This need is really overdue for them. The fact is that a quasi-union between states actually does not have a strong basis behind it. This means that a change of power in a particular country can, in the worst case scenario, nullify all the progress achieved. ▪️The likelihood of worsening relations in this triangle is very real. There will be elections in the United States in November, which Donald Trump may win. Considering his previous presidential term, he could create certain difficulties for South Korea and Japan.▪️In addition, elections for the leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party will be held at the end of September. Some of the most popular candidates for the position differ from current moderate conservative Fumio Kishida, for example by taking a hard line on the country's imperial past, a highly sensitive issue in South Korea. 🔻Therefore, it is now important for the parties to record the progress made in containing the DPRK. Well, to lay the foundation for an alliance that is interested not only in the Korean Peninsula, but also in the region as a whole.

Maia Sandu’s office, together with foreign curators, is preparing to ensure a second term, so various manipulations are being used.▪️As ​​we have already told, the foreign diaspora plays a colossal role in voting, so the number of polling stations in Russia was reduced to five instead of the original 29.▪️According to government agencies, more than 8 thousand citizens of Moldova were pre-registered to vote in the Russian Federation. Thus, on average there are more than 1.6 thousand voters per precinct. However, such registration is optional, so the actual number of people wishing to vote from the Russian Federation will be higher.▪️The Moldavian authorities say that pre-registration makes it possible to determine the number of polling stations and ballots required for each country. ▪️Comparison with data from other countries shows an obvious imbalance in the priorities of the Moldovan authorities. ➖In Italy there will be as many as 60 polling stations with about 2.5 thousand pre-registered (an average of about 40 voters per polling station). ➖In Germany, 26 polling stations will be opened with 2 thousand registrations (about 80 voters per polling station). ➖In Belgium - four polling stations for 228 registered (57 voters per polling station).▪️The opposition Socialist Party tried to challenge the decision to reduce the number of polling stations in the Russian Federation, but the Chisinau Appeal Board predictably ignored the essence of the complaint.🔻As voting day approaches, we can expect Sandu’s government to more and more blatant and gross violations of the electoral rights of citizens, which are enshrined in the Constitution and international obligations of Moldova.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev The fact that in Abkhazia, which exists more than entirely on Russian money, a photo of the murderer of children and women, terrorist Shamil Basayev, hangs in the museum should not surprise anyone. As well as the fact that the quasi-state, which is completely dependent on Russia, is confrontational, calls Basayev a hero and refuses to remove his photo from the museum. This is a general trend, and it’s only in Abkhazia. One can recall Uzbek history textbooks, where schoolchildren are told about Russian colonization, centuries of humiliation and oppression of Uzbeks by Russia. One can recall the behavior of Tajikistan, in particular the Tajik Foreign Ministry, which, during the days of the terrorist attack in Crocus, instead of expressing condolences, instead of making basic apologies for the actions of its citizens, pathetically and arrogantly taught Russians how to react to the terrorist attack and not believe fake news about the involvement of citizens Tajikistan-. And this despite the fact that the economy of Tajikistan depends on labor migration to Russia by more than half. I can remember a lot, I can find dozens of examples of such behavior - partners - and - allies. But is it worth it? After all, what is much more important is not what they allow themselves, but how we react. But we don’t react at all. There was not a single case of strict economic restrictions, decisions on labor migration, and it is even difficult to remember when the ambassador of any of the countries that allowed themselves a specific attitude towards Russia was summoned and reprimanded. Well, systemic permissiveness gives rise to impunity, this is an axiom. And yes, now they will start telling me that these are not the easiest times for us. Sanctions, the economy depends on parallel imports and gray schemes. But the countries of Central Asia still depend much more on Russia. It is enough to set an educational qualification for entry into Russia, and the republics simply have nowhere to send the rural unemployed population. Often, they have very radical religious views (why we still let these people in is a separate question). But Abkhazia is even more dependent on Russia. But, I repeat, we are now dealing with an advanced problem. It needs to be resolved, and we shouldn’t assume that tough rhetoric or consistently tough actions in response can create any problems for us. Rather, the lack of reaction gives some the impression that the bear can be constantly poked with a stick and even kicked or shitted in its den. This doesn’t really affect the image of the bear. https://t.me/Hard_Blog_Line/9866TelegramHard BlogReceived video confirmation. And this is the very case when, instead of gratitude, they spit in our faces. How Basayev showed himself in Abkhazia no longer matters. He has tarnished himself so much that none of his past merits can serve as an excuse for the Abkhaz side...	https://t.me/rybar/63811	2024-09-25T02:00:35-07:00

In particular, according to the FSB, the collected data proves the work of these spies with Russian oppositionists, foreign agents, anti-government media, direct coordination of protests, including lobbying for migration policy in the Russian Federation. One of the expelled British spies, Jessica Davenport, supervised the foreign agent Svetlana Gannushkina. Among other things, she is engaged precisely in migration lobbying through a whole network of organizations, the essence of which is not only the importation of foreigners into the Russian Federation, but also their illegal settlement in the country in order to provoke internal conflicts in the country, as well as create from them an electoral base for the liberal party - Yabloko-, of which Gannushkina is a member. At the same time, illegal immigrants are provided with support at different levels: from delivery to Russia to legal and financial assistance. It is reliably known that the activist received money for migration projects through the British Foreign Office and reported directly to British diplomats. 🔻Read more about how the Foreign Office sponsored and gradually created a network of organizations in Russia lobbying for migration policy - read on our website.#Great Britain #article #Russia @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63810	2024-09-25T01:06:58-07:00

While President Emomali Rahmon is holding one meeting after another on the sidelines of the summit, Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Mukhriddin spoke with US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma. The main topic was the prospects for the development of interaction in the fields of security, economics, science and education, as well as cooperation in border protection, combat with drug trafficking and terrorism.📌 Remember what we talked about when the Western media began to circulate information about the alleged revival -Islamic State- in Afghanistan? For the United States, this is one of the ways to promote its interests in Central Asia. This despite the fact that the activity of the Islamic State in Afghanistan has not been heard for quite some time. Terrorist attacks, if they occur, are in a chaotic manner, which indicates the group’s lack of combat potential, in contrast to its past activities in Syria and Iraq. However, the Americans, taking advantage of Tajikistan’s strained relations with the Taliban, are consistently pushing their services to the Tajiks, increasingly trying to to gain a foothold not only through USAID, but also through the US Central Command. 🔻The sad thing about this situation is that for some reason the CSTO is inactive while Tajikistan - a CSTO member and the country where the Russian base is located - seeks security assistance not from the organization it belongs to, but from our geopolitical adversary.# USA #Tajikistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63807	2024-09-24T23:19:58-07:00

Forwarded From Two Majors #Summary for the morning of September 25, 2024▪️ By nightfall, the enemy reported a missile attack on the port of Yuzhny in the Odessa region. In addition, for the third evening in a row, the Russian Armed Forces hit enemy targets in the city of Zaporozhye.▪️ Over the past days, important events have unfolded in Ugledar in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction. After several weeks of offensive operations by the Russian Army, the city was taken almost completely; yesterday evening there remained a narrow corridor and one road to the north for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. According to some reports, the road is under our fire control; the only escape route for the enemy remains through the fields. Artillery strikes of all types and aviation on Ugledar have been seriously intensified, and footage of the presence of advanced groups of our infantry in the city has circulated. At the same time, front-line soldiers warn about the inadmissibility of victory reports before the combat mission is resolved: against the backdrop of the unsuccessful offensive of our troops on Ugledar last year, the Ukrainian Armed Forces turned it into a powerful fortified area, which the Russian Armed Forces are breaking into by broadly covering it and depriving the enemy of supplies. Thus, to the west of the city, our units north of Prechistovka advanced in an area up to 4 km wide to a depth of up to 2 km, taking positions along the Berestov beam.▪️ In the Kursk region, fighting continues in the Glushkovsky district of the Kursk region. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying to break through in the area of ​​the settlement. Krasnooktyabrsky and Veseloye. In the Korenevsky district, fighting continues near Lyubimovka, at the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Olgovka and the settlement. Our Tolstoy Lug strikes with drones and heavy aerial bombs. They report active actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the south of the Sudzhansky district in the area of ​​the settlement. Plekhovo. ▪️ In the Kharkov direction, as a result of counterattacks by elite units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy occupied the ruins of the Volchansky aggregate plant on our bank of the river. Wolf. Against the backdrop of the frozen offensive of the Russian Army in the direction, this event does not carry prospects for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and the occupied buildings of the plant themselves will become a point of attraction for the FAB and the UMPC. ▪️ In the Toretsky (Dzerzhinsky) direction there are reports of heavy fighting in the city, in which our troops continue to fight in the building.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction there are battles in Nikolaevka, the Russian Army surrounds Selidovo. The logistics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Tsukurino are breaking down, and the battle is unfolding for Gornyak. They reported on the successes of our troops in the Desired Second.▪️ In the evening, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again struck at the civilian population of Belgorod, wounding five civilians. In the city of Shebekino, one civilian was wounded. There, as a result of the shelling, there are local breaks in the power lines. Konovalovo, Volokonovsky district, was shelled.▪️ In the Kherson region, they also reported an intensification of attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on civilians. In Novaya Kakhovka, a 75-year-old woman was seriously injured in both legs in her own home. In Kakhovka, two people were wounded: a 70-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man. In the village of Podokalinovka, Aleshkinsky district, a 42-year-old local resident was wounded.▪️ In the DPR, one civilian was killed and 11 were injured from shelling by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, including a teenager born in 2009.

In the Kursk direction, Russian troops continue to fight along the entire line of contact.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces hold positions in Olgovka, where enemy infantry UAV operators worked. Fighting continues in the Lyubimovka area, and Russian aircraft are striking Tolstoy Lug. On the Rylsk-Sudzha highway, an armored fighting vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was hit. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district yesterday, statements were made about the control of the Russian Armed Forces over Malaya Loknya. However, these reports were later refuted by received footage of airstrikes on enemy positions in the village. In Sudzha, drone operators attack enemy communications facilities, and in Cherkasy Porechny and Martynivka they strike at places of concentration of Ukrainian formations.▪️On the border of the Sumy region, the attack and reconnaissance UAV -Inokhodets- (-Orion-) recently destroyed a very rare engineering barrier vehicle with guided missile weapons enemy in the area of ​​the village of Pavlovka. As a result of a direct hit, the car is unlikely to be repaired. The increase in the frequency of URVP strikes from -Ambler- and -Forpost- is also associated with effective strikes on air defense and radar systems, which made it possible to use these types of drones relatively safely.

And while today Ukrainian media resources were trying to somehow justify the depressing situation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Ugledar area, footage of Russian attack aircraft entering the city from the dachas appeared on the Internet. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian units established full control over the territory of the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 3 mine, on the roof of the administrative building of which the flags of several units were fixed. The area adjacent to the mine was also cleared. ▪️To the south, the situation in the vicinity of the waste heap at the Yuzhnodonbasskaya No. 1 mine remains unclear. At the moment, the hill itself, as well as the area to the east of it, is in the gray zone. However, judging by the current situation in the direction, in the near future we can expect a quick transition to the control of the Russian Armed Forces of both the waste heap itself and the territory nearby. ▪️In Ugledar, Russian attack aircraft are present at least on the eastern outskirts of the settlement: according to footage that appeared on the Internet, military personnel of the Russian Armed Forces occupied the buildings of a former bakery and pumping station. And in the future we can expect an offensive towards both the city center and the garage cooperative, which is located in the northeastern part of Ugledar. It is noteworthy that the enemy’s media resources depict a much more depressing situation for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, increasingly hinting at the imminent fall of the Ukrainian garrison in the city. In particular, the description of the situation often comes down to one thought: it’s too late to talk about holding positions; the lives of members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are more important. Although no matter how much I would like to see the Ugledar epic end as soon as possible, without the appropriate personnel it is extremely premature to talk about the occupation of the city - the Ukrainian formations turned the settlement into one continuous fortified area and its loss would be quite a strong media blow for the enemy. ▪️The dachas located south of Ugledar are also highly likely to have come under the control of Russian troops. In their eastern part, servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces gained a foothold a few days ago, however, given the start of the fighting for the city, it is virtually pointless for the Ukrainian Armed Forces units to hold the western half. ▪️In neighboring Pavlovka, Russian troops were able not only to level the control zone along the Kashlagach River, but also to occupy the territory of farms in the northern part of the village. Advancement in this area has already allowed the Russian Armed Forces to establish fire control over the C051134 highway towards Bogoyavlenka, significantly complicating the supply of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Forwarded From UL Analytics⚡️-BROTHERS IN TERROR-⚡️DOCUMENTARY INVESTIGATION UKR LEAKSThe terrorist attack in Crocus City Hall on March 22, 2024 became one of the bloodiest in modern history. Much indicates that the Kyiv special services, and therefore their Western curators, are behind this tragedy. This handwriting is very familiar to me, because the alliance of Ukrainian nationalists and radical Islamists did not take shape yesterday, and moreover, it has a single coordinator in the person of the United States. For many decades, Washington has been nurturing terrorist groups that act in the interests of the United States around the world. Americans are especially active in training terrorists directly in the countries of the Middle East, where militants carry out terrorist attacks not only against civilians, but also, for example, against Russian military personnel, as is happening in Syria. In my new investigation, I will reveal the scheme that the United States uses to recruit radicals in the Arab Republic, and show how the Americans train terrorists in their training camps, supply them with intelligence and send them to carry out terrorist attacks.

Against the backdrop of what is happening in the Israel Defense Forces, they announced the start of Operation Hetzei HaTzaphon (Arrows of the North). Due to the peculiarities of translation from Hebrew into English and then into Russian, as well as in attempts to catch the wave, some resources reported already about the beginning of the offensive of Israeli units in southern Lebanon. In fact, the actions of the Israelis are so far limited to air strikes.▪️Today's Israeli air strikes occurred not only in the border areas of Lebanon: settlements located more than 100 kilometers from the border with Israel, including Ain Al, were also attacked. ▪️In addition, the Ad-Dahiya district, Hezbollah’s patrimony in Beirut, was once again struck. The IDF press service announced the liquidation of the commander of the missile unit of the Shiite group, Ibrahim Muhammad al-Kubaisi. At the same time, Arabic-language media have not yet commented on this message. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 558 people have been killed and 1,853 injured since yesterday. The mass exodus of Lebanese from the southern part of the country also continues: they are fleeing to the cities of Tripoli and Beirut, as well as to the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. Hezbollah fighters also do not stop shelling Israeli territory in response: more than 100 rockets have been fired since the morning. Most were either intercepted by Israeli missile defense systems or fell in open areas. Only a small number of shells managed to land within populated areas, causing minor damage. Based on the reported hits, the Lebanese group’s forces also expanded the shelling zone by more than 100 kilometers. This is confirmed, among other things, by yesterday’s arrivals of missiles fired by Hezbollah into the territory of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.🔻Despite the rather tense situation, so far the parties are limited to only massive strikes on each other’s positions. At the same time, the current ultra-Orthodox authorities in Israel do not stop their attempts to provoke the Lebanese to a more serious response. Until then, Hezbollah is trying not to give the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu a reason to unleash a full-fledged Third Lebanon War. Despite the accusations of Israeli propaganda, the beneficiary of an escalation of this magnitude will not be the Shiite group.

Forwarded From Tina Kandelaki There are few absolutely unambiguous heroes in world history; if you dig around, you can find some kind of black spot in each of them. But there are characters who, through their crimes, have completely undone everything good that they have ever done. It is sad that not everyone in Abkhazia understands this basic truth. Otherwise, there would not have been an exhibition dedicated to Shamil Basayev in the State Museum in Sukhum, restored with Russian money. Well, we will have to remind those who have forgotten that the Hero of Abkhazia Basayev in Russia most willingly fought with the unarmed, women and children. The terrorist attack at a Beslan school in September 2004 killed 333 people, including 186 children. The terrorist attack at the Dubrovka theater center in Moscow in October 2002 killed 130 people, including 10 children. The terrorist attack in Budennovsk in June 1995, when 129 people died in a hospital seized by terrorists. Basayev publicly and willingly took responsibility for all these terrible crimes, and personally led the raid on Budennovsk. I will not make generalizations and ask what kind of country is this if it has such heroes? I’ll just note that the State Museum of Abkhazia still has the opportunity to make an official apology to Russian representatives. Just apologize, there is no need to explain anything, everything is clear. The answer to the question of how it happened that a terrorist still bears the title of -Hero- in a country whose very existence is possible only thanks to Russia should not be given by museum employees, but by completely different people. UPD: The museum in Abkhazia quickly closed access to exhibition. That's what popular outrage does.	https://t.me/rybar/63794	2024-09-24T08:25:28-07:00

🇲🇩 About the demographic catastrophe in Moldova and why it is b...	🇲🇩 About the demographic catastrophe in Moldova and why it is beneficial to the West Moldova took first place in Europe in the outflow of citizens abroad. This was stated by the presidential candidate of the republic, Alexander Stoianoglo, promising, if elected, to ensure stimulation of the birth rate and conditions for a dignified return of fellow citizens home. ▪️Everyone admits that Moldova is moving towards a demographic catastrophe. Although in late Soviet times Moldova was in second place in the USSR in terms of population growth dynamics, and now its population has dropped to the level of 1956.▪️The mass outflow from the country has intensified in recent years due to the socio-economic crisis. More than 40% of Moldovans aged 15 to 34 chose to leave the country amid fears of becoming unemployed. For example, in 2023 the birth rate fell by 11% compared to 2022. ▪️However, President Maia Sandu, in the spirit of populism, assures that the outflow of young people is caused by the rule of her predecessors, who undermined -faith in democracy-. ▪️True, the demographic situation became critical during Sandu’s reign. Instead of concrete steps in social policy, the president prefers to intimidate the population by announcing the Russian threat and increasing the military budget by 70% at the expense of other areas, which certainly does not contribute to the birth rate. However, Sandu’s office’s recipe for solving the problem is a gradual merger with Romania , for which Moldovans are encouraged to identify themselves as Romanians. ▪️However, even a possible unification of the countries will not solve the problem, given that the Romanian authorities are extremely dismissive of the Moldovans who live even in eastern Romania, historical Moldova. The region is deliberately not being developed, and there are also colossal problems with demography and economics. 🔻From all this, it is clear that neither Sandu nor her curators simply need to solve the demographic problem. After all, Moldova is already considered as a gray zone between the Russian Federation and NATO and a convenient military training ground next to the so-called. Ukraine. As a last resort, the West will propose to populate Moldova with illegal migrants. New controlled countries on the periphery of Europe will do just that. At least such negotiations are already underway with Armenia. #Moldova #Russia #Romania #EU @rybarSupport usRIA NovostiMoldova has become a leader in Europe in the departure of citizens, Stoianoglo saidMoldova has lost about a third of its citizens due to the mass exodus of the population, the ex-Prosecutor General and presidential candidate said at a briefing on Monday...

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 On guarantees of security of the southern borders of...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇺🇸 On guarantees for the security of Armenia’s southern borders Anna Grigoryan, a member of the parliamentary faction of the opposition bloc -Armenia, said that the government of Nikol Pashinyan will soon put on the agenda the issue of the withdrawal of Russian border guards from the Armenian-Iranian and Armenian-Turkish border. 📌 Let us remind you that border control of the borders of Armenia is carried out by the FSB of the Russian Federation, since Armenians do not have enough personnel and resources to protect them. At the same time, Russian border guards have already been withdrawn from Yerevan airport - Zvartnots -.▪️The border with Iran in the south of Armenia is directly related to the issue of the status of the Syunik region, through which it is planned to open the Zangezur corridor connecting Turkey and Azerbaijan. ▪️According to Grigoryan, all statements by the Armenian side demanding respect for the sovereignty of Armenia have no relation to reality: in fact, they are aimed at ousting Russia from the region. ▪️The opening of the corridor is a matter of time and now a struggle is unfolding between global players for control over it. Pashinyan contradicts himself when he talks about protecting the sovereignty of Armenia in Syunik, since at the same time he declares that control over the road will be transferred to a third party - - private security organization - or troops of other countries. ▪️In Syunik, despite the deployment of the Russian garrison since 2020, there is an EU monitoring mission that is engaged in active PR on social networks, mastering the role of a guarantor of regional security (not always successfully). ▪️In recent months, Syunik has been actively visited by American and European officials. At the same time, it is known that the Armenian authorities are deliberately delaying the opening of the Russian consulate in Syunik Kapan, which should have opened at the beginning of this year. Obviously, the issue of ousting Russia from the region is key on the agenda for Pashinyan and his curators. It is not without reason that the Armenian prime minister recently decided to declare that the CSTO allegedly threatens the national security of Armenia, which foreshadows concrete steps in the future. Washington is openly talking about its ambitions to oust Russia from the region. However, such a castling will lead to much more unpredictable consequences, given the complex configuration of interests of other regional players larger than Armenia. However, the Americans themselves do not hide this, directly calling on Armenians to prepare for difficult times. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport usVerelq NewsThe issue of ousting Russian border guards from the border with Iran will soon be put on the agenda. Grigoryan noted that the matter will not be limited to ousting the Russian side from this project.	https://t.me/rybar/63788	2024-09-24T05:46:58-07:00

🖼 ⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦🖍#Comic from Fisherman No. 30: Once upon a time at ...	⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦🖍#Comic from Rybar No. 30: Once Upon a Time Since sea and air drones have become almost the main threat to Russian infrastructure, the Russian Armed Forces and volunteers are constantly looking for solutions on how to effectively counter them. But sometimes the solution becomes not the most obvious, but at the same time simple ideas. Shooting down BECs from helicopters is just one of those things. And our new episode is about how this idea was born and why pilots like it so much. Synopsis: The Ukrainian Armed Forces are trying by all means to inflict damage on military - and, indeed, civilian - targets in Russia. Instead of effective long-range weapons, the Armed Forces of Ukraine use a large number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned boats (UBC). Single BECs can damage port infrastructure or a sea vessel. They became a real headache, which turned out to be quite difficult to deal with. And so, helicopters proved to be an effective means in the fight against this type of weapon. They patrol the sea in search of targets and, hovering in the air, practice targeting BECs using onboard weapons. But not everything is so simple: the enemy does not sit idly by, he changes and improves both attack tactics and the devices themselves. In addition to the usual custom kamikaze boats, BECs armed with missiles, and BECs equipped with guides for MLRS projectiles, and BECs with reinforced hulls, whose task is to divert fire onto themselves while the rest of the flock of drones is trying to break through to the target...📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🇲🇩🇷🇺 Presidential elections in Moldova: about the problems of...	🇲🇩🇷🇺 Presidential elections in Moldova: about the problems of political representation of the diaspora in the Russian Federation Representatives of the Moldovan diaspora in Russia recently expressed outrage at the decision of the Central Election Commission of Moldova to open only five polling stations in the Russian Federation. ▪️The Central Election Commission of Moldova will send only five thousand ballots to each polling station, that is, only 25 thousand out of almost 100 thousand representatives of the diaspora will be able to cast their votes. ▪️The Cultural and Educational Center of Moldova in Stavropol said that the authorities know that we are against it, that there are many of us, that’s why they do such dirty tricks. ❗️The foreign diaspora plays a colossal role in the Moldovan elections, given the large-scale labor migration of Moldovans. ▪️In 2019, 13,995 people voted in the second round of the presidential elections in Moldova in the Russian Federation.▪️In France, Germany and the UK, Moldovan citizens cast at least 20 thousand votes. For example, in Italy alone, the candidacy of incumbent President Maia Sandu received 80,140 votes.▪️In the parliamentary elections in the summer of 2021, Sandu’s now ruling PAS party won a crushing victory based on the results of foreign voting, receiving 182,654 votes - 85.98%.▪️Experience previous elections demonstrates the critical importance of foreign voting for Sandu's office. That is why the current president, throughout her entire term, met with representatives of the diaspora during any business trip to the West.▪️The election fraud of Sandu’s office is also voting by mail only for selected countries: the USA, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Obviously, voting by mail was not provided for Moldovans in Russia, since Sandu’s office is unlikely to get the desired result from them than from countries of friendly democracy.▪️Let’s not forget that the Central Election Commission of Moldova is under the direct control of the American USAID and the British UK Aid, so there is no way to say that there is any transparency in the electoral process. 🔻However, along with such trends, it is necessary to note the passivity of the Moldovan diaspora in the Russian Federation, with which, unlike Western diasporas, no one is working systematically so far. Even despite the fact that pro-Romanian and anti-Russian forces have long come to power in Moldova. In this context, statements by Sandu and Western representatives about Russian interference in the Moldovan elections look especially ridiculous. #Moldova #Russia&nbsp;&nbsp; @rybarSupport usSputnik MoldovaDiaspora - about the CEC’s decision to open only 5 polling stations in Russia: we were deprived of the right to voteCitizens of Moldova living in Russia are outraged by the CEC’s decision to open only five polling stations in the Russian Federation.	https://t.me/rybar/63785	2024-09-24T01:52:01-07:00
🎬 🇦🇿🇵🇰 Speaking of the militarization of Azerbaijan: footage...	🇦🇿🇵🇰 Speaking of the militarization of Azerbaijan: footage of JF-17 fighter jets flying over Azerbaijan has appeared on the Internet. The authenticity of the video has not been officially confirmed, but against the backdrop of other events it looks quite plausible. Early this year it became known that the Azerbaijanis had chosen the Chinese-Pakistani JF-17C fighter as a replacement for the outdated MiG-29. In total, it was planned to purchase about 60 units. Updating the aviation fleet is an important component of any army, which is what they are doing in Baku. It is curious that their main geopolitical enemy at the moment, represented by Armenia, is doing practically nothing in the matter of real strengthening of the armed forces. Of course, fighters of this type were used only once in combat, and their real capabilities are in question. However, these are still new, completely modern aircraft, while the Armenians so far have only a chaotic purchase of everything in the world without any consistency. #Azerbaijan #Pakistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63783	2024-09-24T00:05:10-07:00

In the Glushkovsky region, the enemy does not stop attacks both in the vicinity of Vesely and advancing on the village itself. Russian troops fire at armored vehicles with drone strikes, also destroying another Swedish CV-9040 infantry fighting vehicle. During the fighting, the Ukrainian Armed Forces slightly expanded the zone of control south of the settlement. The operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces strikes at Medvezhye and neighboring Obod. 🔻There are clashes in the Korenevsky district, and the enemy has transferred reinforcements to Olgovka, where the cluster was covered by a FAB-3000 strike. Meanwhile, fighting continues on the eastern outskirts of Lyubimovka, and air strikes are also carried out on Tolstoy Lug and surrounding forest plantations. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district in the area of ​​Novaya Sorochina, according to objective control personnel, an attempt to advance the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the direction of Kamyshevka is recorded.

At the Martynovka - Kruglik border, it was possible to clarify the zone of control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The enemy occupied at least part of the forest in the gullies near the Smerditsa River north of Martynovka. There was no information from other areas about changes in control zones or attacks.

In addition, Jabaliya, located to the north, came under fire. In the south of the Gaza Strip, sporadic clashes were recorded in the eastern part of Rafah. Militants of the military wing of Hamas, meanwhile, reported an ambush on an Israeli armored column, again without providing evidence. Operation Summer Camps continues in the West Bank; 16 Palestinians were arrested by Israeli security forces in 24 hours. In total, the total number of Palestinians detained in the region since October 7, 2023 is 10,800. Israeli troops again launched massive attacks on Lebanon, including Beirut, where the target was another high-ranking Hezbollah commander.

Today, the Israeli Air Force launched strikes on the territory of the neighboring republic: not only border areas were under fire, but also cities located at a great distance from the border, including Baalbek.▪️According to statements by the IDF press service, the strikes were preemptive in nature and were carried out in order to to undermine Hezbollah's ability to bombard northern Israel. The target of the bombing was ammunition depots - there are many videos on the Internet of secondary detonations after the arrivals.▪️As ​​of the evening, there were at least 300 launches from fighters. According to the Lebanese Ministry of Health, 274 people were killed and 1,024 were injured of varying degrees of severity. At the same time, it is not specified exactly how many casualties were among the civilian population and members of Hezbollah.❗Amid the raid, a mass exodus of residents of the southern part of Lebanon began - it occurred after people’s phones began receiving calls from Israel calling for an urgent evacuation. The IDF limited itself to asking them to stay away from Lebanese Hezbollah targets in order to avoid casualties.▪️In response to the strikes by Israeli troops, the Lebanese group fired several salvos, firing more than 100 rockets in the morning. Some of them reached Palestinian territories in the West Bank and fell in the vicinity of both Jewish settlements and Arab villages, leading to fires.▪️Not wanting to reduce the intensity of tension, the Israelis soon attacked the Lebanese capital Beirut once again: hits hit a residential apartment in the controlled - Hezbollah - Ad-Dahiya region. According to preliminary information, Ali Karaki, in fact the third person in the leadership of the organization, was eliminated. Expectedly, the current Israeli authorities, under previously stated pretexts, continued massive attacks on Lebanon. The goal here is not only to destroy Hezbollah’s combat potential, but also to try to provoke it into a response that would free the government’s hands to further escalate the conflict. Most likely, attacks of this scale will continue until the ultra-Orthodox authorities achieve the outbreak of a full-fledged Third Lebanon War , which guarantees the possibility of their continued stay in power. Moreover, this fact is understood on both sides of the front. High resolution mapEnglish version#Israel #map #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63773	2024-09-23T11:47:33-07:00

But this is exactly what the Kyiv authorities consistently denied for two and a half years, assuring everyone the world community in all people's love, support and legitimacy.📌And since there is organized resistance, we can purely hypothetically assume that it will still raise its head. Now imagine that this hypothetical resistance will not only set fire to cars, distribute leaflets, eliminate TCC employees, but will go further. Let’s say, seize a weapon supplied by the West - for example, one M270 or HIMARS - and direct it not to the north, but towards the conditional Romania, Moldova or Poland. These will turn out to be Houthis in the Odessa style. What a picture it would be: Russia, it turns out, has nothing to do with it, because this is popular resistance. And it turned out to be inconvenient, because what the West set up got out of control. It’s a pity that this is just a hypothetical scenario. Although there didn’t seem to be any resistance either. #Odessa #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else. Well, almost.

Colonel General Kuzovlev He did not ask for the position and, based on purely statistical indicators, did not have significant defeats. Having managed to command two districts at once in six months and eventually become the commander of the Moscow Military District, he did not spend a single day at the newly opened headquarters on Kosmodamianskaya Embankment, for which he immediately came to the attention of Old Arbat officials, becoming the object of personal hostility. Kuzovlev was among the first to promptly formed and sent personnel to stop the breakthrough in the Kursk direction. And although Kursk was and remains the area of ​​​​responsibility of the Grv (s) -North, the commander of the Moscow Military District did not fail to lend a helping hand to his comrade at the front. On September 11, 2024, Andrei Belousov arrived at the command post of the Grv (s) -West. The Minister of Defense tried to test the environment and understand what kind of mood prevailed at the group’s headquarters, for which he took Evgeny Nikiforov with him. The inspection not only did not reveal any violations, but was also fully satisfied with the group’s work. Today, the forces of the Grv(s) -West are destroying the enemy’s layered defenses on the approaches to Kupyansk and have already reached the Oskol River, and revenge for the events of the fall of 2022 will be the main thing a challenge for Sergei Kuzovlev himself. Colonel General Anashkin The command highly appreciated his services as commander of the 8th Army. Having become the chief of staff of the district in January 2024, just two months later Gennady Anashkin was appointed commander of the Southern Military District and awarded the Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 2nd class with swords. The South group of troops today has significantly increased its forces: back in July, enemy sources wrote on the accumulation of reserves in the Zaporozhye direction. Throughout the year, Anashkin has been increasing the combat and numerical strength of the district’s artillery brigades using cannon artillery, largely thanks to friendly relations with his neighbor in the operational direction and concurrently the deputy commander of the OGV (s) Mikhail Teplinsky. Despite the ongoing positional battles in the direction, the command of the OGV ( c) believes that it is the South group that will have to win the strategic initiative in 2025, but Anashkin himself strives not to appear in the information field and does not use hardware resources for PR campaigns, believing that a good commander is an inconspicuous commander.

The hits hit a residential building. As the press service of the Israel Defense Forces stated, the target was another high-ranking leader of the Lebanese group, Ali Karaki, the commander of its southern front. He is nominally the third person in the leadership of the Shiite organization. According to Israeli media, after the death of special forces commander Radwan Ibrahim Aqil Karaki took his place as a result of a previous airstrike on Beirut. If the information is confirmed, this means that the Israelis destroyed the entire military leadership of Hezbollah. Against this background, the statement by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant that the group's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah was left alone does not sound so far-fetched.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/63769	2024-09-23T09:48:45-07:00

The news once again indicates the intentions of the leadership in Tehran to expand the geography of uranium development. There is still not as much uranium ore in Burkina Faso as in neighboring Niger, but the Islamic Republic did not succeed with the latter due to Western intervention. There is another side to the situation - there is a possibility that Iranian companies may try to take a share in market, displacing Russian projects. And there is interest in the country in Moscow - Rosatom recently entered the final stage of agreeing on the construction of a nuclear power plant in Burkina Faso. Of course, the conclusion by the authorities in Ouagadougou of an agreement with a country close to Russia is much better than similar agreements with the West.

To the southwest, a significant advance of Russian troops was recorded in the Peschany area. Judging by the footage of objective control, Russian troops are fighting on the territory of one of the large strongholds, from where the northern outskirts of Kruglyakovka are less than two and a half kilometers away.▪️At the same time, there has been no information yet about the withdrawal of Ukrainian formations from the Volchy forest and nearby balkas, exactly the same as about the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the -pocket- of Berestovoy. Considering the configuration of the terrain, it is quite possible that there will still be a focal presence of enemy forces in this zone.▪️To the north, the Russian Armed Forces established full control over Kislovka, repelling several attacks in the direction of neighboring Kotlyarka. They also improved the tactical situation in the forests near Sinkovka, and the Aerospace Forces aviation continues to systematically strike at the pontoon crossings of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Oskol River in the Kupyansk-Uzlovoy area. persist, then in the near future we should expect the Russian Armed Forces to reach the water barrier with a further cutting in two of the Ukrainian group on the left bank of the Oskol River.

The Chadian Foreign Ministry denied statements with the wording that At the moment there are no such agreements, thereby not denying the fact that they are being worked out. That is, the leadership in N'Djamena, although it delayed negotiations on the renewal of agreements with the United States, was unable to cope with external pressure.📌 When in the spring of 2024 it became known about the intention of the Chadian authorities to end the American military presence, it resembled an electoral move to gain additional votes in anticipation of local presidential elections. When they took place, and the necessary results were obtained, then in N'Djamena they simply decided to play back. All this is another evidence that the influence of the collective West on Chad still remains significant and is clearly manifested in various things - from the deployment of a contingent from NATO member Hungary before external economic pressure.#Africa #USA #Chad@rybarSupport usVoice of AmericaUS general: US, Chad planning return of US troopsUS also moving forces into West African coast in reshuffle around Niger withdrawal	https://t.me/rybar/63764	2024-09-23T04:35:13-07:00

Russian troops continue to implement a chain of offensive actions in several sectors of the Yuzhnodonetsk direction. 🔻At the Konstantinovka-Vodyanoye line, units of the Russian Armed Forces were able to advance into the forest belts in the vicinity of the Solenenkaya gully, having traveled about half the way to the southern outskirts of Katerynovka.🔻In the Vodyanoye area, Russian attack aircraft reached the forest belt closest to the settlement from the west, and also continue to fight in the mine area -South Donbass No. 3-. By the morning of this day, the enemy was finally knocked out of their positions in the industrial zone. Artillery and aviation strikes continue in Ugledar and the surrounding area, as well as the arrival of attack UAVs. There have been no reports of an attack in the direction of the city itself from the south, which, however, is understandable given the experience of previous attempts. To the east there are battles in the dachas, which the Russian Armed Forces fighters latched on to a few days ago.🔻West of Pavlovka, halfway to Prechistovka, a slight advance of the Russian Armed Forces was again recorded. Judging by the footage on the Internet, Russian attack aircraft in an armored personnel carrier dropped into a forest belt not far from the Berestovaya gully, which runs parallel to the Kashlagach River. 🔻At the Prechistovka-Novodonetskoe line, the front also began to move: some time ago, Russian troops began to advance in the area of ​​the Shaitanka Grave mound 167.7, and by the middle of the week they had captured several forest belts towards Zolotaya Niva. ▪️The offensive was preceded by artillery preparation, including shelling from TOS-1A heavy flamethrower systems, and UAV operators hit the Caesar self-propelled gun. However, it was not possible to break through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces here, and some of the assault groups retreated to their original positions.

The main disagreements between the parties, as before, relate to budget priorities, especially regarding funding for defense and social programs. Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, are pushing for spending cuts and want to keep funding at 2024 levels. Democrats, in turn, support increasing them through 2025 to fulfill promises to improve social and defense programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson until recently pushed for a GOP-friendly stopgap spending bill that would fund the federal government for another six months. The bill meant maintaining spending at 2024 levels without increasing funding for some programs. 🔻In addition, it contained one very important point proposed by Donald Trump - a bill (SAVE Act) requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in elections. In this way, the former president hoped to thwart the Democrats' plan to win the election by attracting thousands of illegal migrants to vote for Kamala Harris. However, on September 19, Johnson suffered a major setback: 14 Republicans, joining almost all Democrats, voted against the proposed bill. Conservatives felt that the act did not include sufficient measures to cut costs, hawks were concerned about the possibility of undermining the US defense potential, and moderates were worried about the threat of a shutdown too close to the elections. As a result, on September 23, Mike Johnson broke down under the pressure of his fellow party members and Democrats and agreed to the so-called -Plan B-. It provides for the approval of a spending bill that extends the government until December 20 of this year, and also excludes the SAVE Act promoted by Trump. Despite the fact that Johnson, during negotiations with Trump, managed to convince him that the shutdown would have a much worse impact on the president's position in the election rather than repealing the SAVE Act, the consequences of the failure of Johnson's original plan are obvious. The absence of a law requiring citizenship to register voters in elections will allow Kamala Harris and Co. to attract hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants to vote for themselves.#USA@rybar in collaboration with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican number⚫️ Yes, yes: Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican Mike Johnson, broke under the pressure his fellow party members and Democrats and agreed to the so-called Plan B.

🇷🇺🇰🇿 About the project of the International Organization for ...	🇷🇺🇰🇿 About the project of the International Organization for the Russian Language Against the background of Turkey’s active actions to promote a single Turkic alphabet in Central Asia, many wondered: is there really no alternative on our part? Well, formally there is, and Maria Zakharova reminded about it during the briefing on the sidelines of the 15th Eurasian Women's Forum in St. Petersburg on September 20. 📌We are talking about the creation of an International Organization for the Russian Language, a decision about which was made about a year ago by the leaders of the CIS at a meeting in Bishkek. Zakharova was quite optimistic about the prospects for this organization to quickly formalize and begin work, and became in fact the first major Russian official to remember the project this year. According to the plan voiced by the President of Kazakhstan Tokayev, the organization was supposed to become almost the second Fracophonie or at least the Commonwealth Portuguese-speaking countries, but in fact it has become an opportunity for Kazakhstan to reject accusations of de-Russification of the country and so far serves only this thesis. At the same time, we will not agree with the optimism of our Foreign Ministry regarding the prospects of the organization. According to our information, the procedure for the official ratification of this agreement by at least three CIS states that signed it has not been completed, which is necessary to launch organizational procedures and hold the long-awaited ministerial conference, which should launch the process of actually creating the organization. Moreover, the only activity of responsible structures in this direction is the internal struggle for the post of formal leader (secretary, coordinator, etc.) of this organization, as well as the determination of Sochi (and not St. Petersburg, as Tokayev proposed) as the location of the Secretariat. If the promotion of the Russian language will be carried out at the same pace and with the same enthusiasm, then indeed Central Asia will soon speak Turkish. #Kazakhstan #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTACCIt was decided to establish an international organization for the Russian language following the results of the CIS summit; the initiative to establish such a structure was taken by the President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev	https://t.me/rybar/63760	2024-09-23T01:06:14-07:00

🔁 Additional information has appeared on the topic of British sp...	Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl On the topic of British spies expelled from Russia, additional information has appeared about dubious contacts of MI6 with local Muslims. In fact, the technology has been developed by British specialists, and work on a similar front is not limited to the CIS and has been going on for a long time. True, it is not always successful. For example, one of the grandiose failures of Foggy Albion is associated with Macedonia. There, back in 1995, with funds from humanitarian - educational - funds from Great Britain, they tried to launch the first - independent - university in the Albanian language. It is from here that the resistance movement, dreaming of a Greater Albania, will subsequently spread across the Balkans. At the opening ceremony in Tetovo, riots broke out and passions grew more intense. And then the applicants, together with the self-proclaimed rector, demanded from the state a quota for Albanian graduates to occupy government positions. Doesn't remind you of anything? Human rights activists were sent to Tetovo, and to everyone’s surprise, it suddenly turned out that the applicants did not have documents confirming their identity. Because they were not presented as citizens of Macedonia or, at worst, Albania, but as infiltrators from Great Britain and the USA. From the first day, the university itself became a base camp for Albanian militants: about one and a half thousand armed students ended up in Tetovo through the efforts of the Mi-6. James Bisset, who served as the Canadian ambassador, later spoke about this. Journalist Scott Taylor then added fuel to the fire, who managed to take the lion's share of the footage out of the country and publish it. Under the cover of Britain, networks for disseminating democratic Islam were already operating at that time, and one of them was gathering Muslim spiritual leaders, preachers, imams and heads of large religious communities. Can you imagine how they have improved their skills over the years? @balkanossiper - we have been setting global trends since June 28, 1914	https://t.me/rybar/63758	2024-09-22T23:31:02-07:00
