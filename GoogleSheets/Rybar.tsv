Palestinians are returning to their homes destroyed by military action and exhuming the bodies of the dead. Despite the formal end of hostilities, as the rubble is cleared, the number of dead and wounded continues to grow. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces are conducting police operations. In Tulkarm, massive demolition of buildings was carried out. Israeli bulldozers destroyed 16 houses at one time. According to Palestinian media, the total number of destroyed buildings has reached 600, mostly residential. On the border with Lebanon, despite the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory of its northern neighbor, various incidents periodically occur. For example, in the Kafr Qila area, according to local journalists, the Israelis threw stun grenades at local residents who dared to approach the fence.

As well as the fact that the so-called Ukraine today will give a head start to most authoritarian regimes in the world. From the point of view of the ongoing negotiation processes, the words also mean that the current American administration has written off Zelensky, and does not particularly plan to do business with him in the future. It is curious what he will say in response: Zelensky does not plan to leave and is already fighting with competitors. We won’t be surprised if the so-called Ukraine will soon experience some resonant event.#Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramAmerican number🇺🇸🇺🇦 Well, that’s it, the masks are off.

There is no need for mediators in the dialogue between the Russian Federation and the United States.▪️ The expulsion of diplomats from the Russian Federation and the United States does not lead to anything good, now the work of diplomatic missions will resume.▪️Putin said that he would be happy to meet with Trump, but the meeting must be prepared. She is not yet ready to give an approximate date. The most important issues should be worked out, including on Ukraine.▪️The Russian Federation is ready to return to the negotiating table on Ukraine, Putin said, it has never refused dialogue. The Europeans themselves stopped contacts with Moscow, and Kyiv even forbade itself from negotiating with Russia.▪️Trump promised to quickly resolve the Ukrainian crisis, but upon receiving data from the presidency, he changed his position, which is natural. The Russian leader also called Kyiv’s hysteria about the absence of the Russian Federation and the United States at the negotiating table inappropriate.▪️There were no Russian air defense systems at the CPC, because it is an international facility, all the oil belongs to American and European companies. Russia receives only small funds for providing the opportunity to transit oil products.▪️The attack on the oil pumping station of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium looks like coordinated actions with Europe and will provoke consistently high energy prices on world markets.▪️The Ukrainian Armed Forces could not independently organize an attack on the CPC, since they receive space reconnaissance data only from the West.#Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/68150	2025-02-19T06:19:53-08:00

Forwarded From Older than the Edda Let's move on from the discussion of negotiations to a more pressing topic, namely the progress of the SVO. I have repeatedly posted videos of how the people's kamikaze drones - the Ghoul - in an air battle destroy the main striking force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, namely heavy drone bombers. Now we can state that the Air Defense Ghoul has fully justified itself in this form of military art and every day takes out Ukrainian heavy drones, saving many lives of our soldiers. A combat hard worker who daily solves problems on the battlefield, from the destruction of manpower and equipment, to mining and air defense tasks. Day and night, without a break for sleep and rest.

The country, through a system of well-fed politicians, judges, security officials and the media, is firmly integrated into NATO⚡️. Indicative was the cancellation of the results of the presidential elections in 2024, in connection with the victory in the first round of Kelin Georgescu, who announced plans to reduce the military presence of the US and NATO in the country. To increase influence, in August 2024 the United States appointed a new military attaché to Romania, Colonel Robert Kammerer, who was previously assigned to the 316th Squadron, 17th Airlift Wing, specializing in reconnaissance missions and training intelligence officers, translators and analysts for the US military. In addition, from 2025 to 2027, a contingent of US Marines will be deployed in Romania to conduct exercises and training. Against this background, Romania was included in the training programs for Ukrainian military personnel. At the same time, the army is being rearmed. By March 2025, it is planned to put two Patriot air defense missile batteries (4-16 launchers each) on combat duty. The State Department approved the sale of 186 AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles and equipment worth $592 million, as well as 32 F-35A fighters worth $7.2 billion. Under the Foreign Military Sales program, 44 AAV-7 amphibious landing vehicles will be purchased (for $210 million), which are capable of moving through water up to 37 km. The possibility of purchasing two Independence-class ships from the US Navy for $300 million is USS Jackson (LCS 6) and USS Montgomery (LCS 8). For the previously purchased squadron of F-16 fighters, the modernization of the 71st air base - General Emanoil Ionescu - in the village of Campia Turzi (costing 90 million euros) has begun. The military potential is being strengthened. by increasing the capacity of the military-industrial complex. As part of the contract (for 857 million euros) with the Turkish company OTOKAR, 278 4x4 COBRA II armored fighting vehicles will be supplied, another 781 must be produced in Romania under a Turkish license within 5 years. 🇰🇷The South Korean company Hanwha Aerospace will begin construction of a plant in Romania to localize the production of K9 self-propelled guns. The first howitzers will be transferred to the Romanian army at the beginning of 2027.✨In general, the military activity of NATO countries⚡️ in Romania remained intense throughout 2024 and in 2025 began with large-scale exercises Steadfast Dart, the purpose of which was to practice the transfer of military contingents of the alliance along sea and land routes from west to east - to prepared Romanian frontiers. In the scenario of a future war with Russia, Romania is assigned the role of the first echelon. In this context, the introduction of hours of Russian language study in military educational institutions is indicative. In addition, preparations have begun to strengthen mobilization potential. The law on preparing the population for defense (the law on mobilization) is at the stage of departmental approval. Efforts are being made to increase recruitment into the armed forces, where the officer shortage is 43%, by incentivizing military personnel and intensifying the indoctrination of schoolchildren. ✨⭐️The nature of these military preparations does not in any way correlate with the defensive goals of the measures voiced by NATO ⚡️ functionaries, rather strengthening confidence in the preparation of offensive actions in all areas of the eastern flank. Moreover, they themselves name the dates of this war. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/68147	2025-02-19T05:02:50-08:00

We were hooked by the fact that in many Western resources or Telegram channels that do not understand the realities of modern Iraq and Iran, Iraqi groups are called purely pro-Iranian, which in reality is not true.➖➖➖➖➖➖There is nothing supernatural in meetings of this kind. Interaction along this line began many years ago, and strengthened during the war with the Islamic State. It was from then on that AKhaSh began to be called pro-Iranian formations. And for some time this was true, but times have changed. Now the Iranian militia acts separately, and they react extremely sharply to words about dependence on Iran. Yes, contacts have been established with the Iranians, military-technical cooperation is underway, but otherwise, Al-Hashd al-Shaabi is a separate structure that acts in accordance with its interests in isolation from Iranian ones.#Iraq #Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/68146	2025-02-19T04:39:01-08:00

Since February 10, the American exercises Justified Accord 2025 have been taking place in Kenya, Tanzania and Djibouti. 1,300 people are taking part in them, including British instructors. The Americans brought in units stationed in Somalia for the maneuvers. Tactically, the emphasis is on preventing crisis situations. However, as the Archangel of Special Forces correctly notes, the Americans themselves support them. For example, the US Air Force provided military assistance to the forces of the autonomous region of Puntland, and not to the Somali authorities, from which they separated.▪️The main objective of the event is to maintain military contacts between the US and African countries, especially in light of the growing Chinese influence. Last year, in the same Tanzania, large-scale exercises were held with the armed forces of the PRC, which clearly caused dissatisfaction in the White House. The increased activity of various militants in Somalia and political upheavals in Kenya, which were sponsored by USAID, contribute to the appeal to American military support in these countries. This example shows the principle of divide and rule, which has long been rooted in Western politics. And judging by the fact that last year Kenya received the status of a non-NATO ally from the Americans, the teachings are bearing fruit, gradually strengthening the military influence of the United States in the countries of the Dark Continent. #Africa #Kenya #Somalia #USA #Tanzania@rybarSupport usTelegramARCHANGEL SPECIAL FORCES🪖Americans strengthen cooperation with African countriesSince February 10, the Justified Accord 2025 exercise is taking place in three East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Djibouti).

An ongoing series of exercises continued in the Asia-Pacific region last week. From February 15 to 22, Komodo 2025 training is taking place off the coast of Indonesia, in which representatives of the Navy from 38 countries participate. 📌During the exercises, priority is given to working on issues related to mitigating the consequences of natural disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and eliminating joint maritime threats in cases not related to combat operations. Naval forces of the United States, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and other countries take part in the training. Russia is also a participant - the country is represented by the corvettes of the Pacific Fleet -Rezkiy- and -Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov-. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Compared to other exercises that have recently taken place off the coast of Indonesia, these exercises seem to have a strong humanitarian character. So, unlike most exercises in the region now, Komodo 2025 should not be perceived as part of a struggle for spheres of influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Conducting such maneuvers is part of Indonesia's defense diplomacy, designed to strengthen cooperation with major and minor players on the world stage, as well as increase the country's prestige in international relations.

A recording of a conversation between Enver Bganba, the 44-year-old nephew of the acting acting governor, appeared online. President of Abkhazia. And he is a supporter of Ardzinba.▪️According to Enver Bganba, Armenians pose a threat in the upcoming second round of elections, and they need to change their choice in favor of Ardzinba. And this, in his opinion, can only be achieved by force.▪️Ardzinba’s followers began to publicly threaten the Armenians of Abkhazia. In response, the Armenian community of Abkhazia published an open letter addressed to officials and candidates, demanding action. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Armenians make up about 40 thousand people, with the total population of Abkhazia being about 250 thousand. This is a significant part, so playing the anti-Armenian card is quite reckless and dangerous. However, if you remember which side Ardzinba (Turkey) adheres to, then such steps on his part are quite expected.

Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan at a government meeting stated the need to look for alternative options for supplying key food products to the republic. Pashinyan did not voice the details, but such a phrase is indicative against the background of his political aspirations. ❗️Armenia is extremely dependent on grain supplies from Russia, and the local Armenian market provides only a minimal part of the needs. However, that too decreased after the loss of Artsakh. Almost the entire volume of sunflower oil and part of the sugar is also imported from the Russian Federation. Armenia's ambitions to join the EU conflict with membership in the EAEU and deep economic ties with the Russian Federation. Western politicians have repeatedly spoken out about the need to sever Russian-Armenian relations. So Armenia’s attempt to revise its food policy fits into this logic. 🔻But what alternatives can be found in Armenia? Potentially, Armenia can purchase grain from Kazakhstan, especially since similar negotiations were already held in the summer of 2024. In addition, Kazakhstan is trying to return to the Azerbaijani market. It is clear that Kazakhstan is a member of the EAEU, but in Astana in 2024 they already made hints about -grain wars-. For Armenia, this is another step towards deeper integration into the Turkic world through the so-called. Middle corridor. However, these are still theoretical aspirations. Another question is how ready the infrastructure of Kazakhstan is for such an expansion of markets. #Armenia #Russia@rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaPashinyan instructed to look for alternative options for the supply of key food products.

Ukraine to prepare negotiations with the United States. Such statements are fully justified: the Kiev regime has long established itself in the image of a collective monkey with a grenade, not disdaining either public cooperation with Al-Qaeda or sabotage on international infrastructure. The blow to the CPC, part of the shares of which belongs to Chevron and other companies from the United States, fits well with this logic of the Ukrainian leadership. We would not be surprised if one of their goals was also to punish Kazakhstan for its ties with Russia by reducing the pumping of Kazakh oil. So, as negotiations intensify, we should expect new attacks on such objects: the further, the more so-called.

🔁🖼 ⚡️🇪🇺🇺🇦Against the backdrop of military preparations in E...	Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️🇪🇺🇺🇦Against the backdrop of military preparations in Europe, Ukraine continues to implement logistics projects. The results of the EU audit of the Military Mobility Action Plan concluded that there has been insufficient progress, despite the full expenditure of the budget for these purposes for the period 2021-2027 (1.7 billion euros). It turned out that the transfer of tanks and other heavy vehicles is complicated between the countries of the union, due to the difference in traffic rules (❗). In addition, there is an insufficiency of funds allocated for projects on the southern route in the direction of Ukraine. However, through other instruments, financing of Ukrainian logistics with EU countries continued. One of the elements was the development of checkpoints (CPP) on the border with EU countries. One of the main logistics hubs to Europe is being formed in the Lviv region. On January 15, 2025, on the border with Poland 🇵🇱 an updated checkpoint was opened at the station -Mostyska-II-, which is equipped with a transition system between the European gauge (1435 mm) and the Soviet one. The reconstruction was financed by the European Investment Bank and the CEF Fund. Two new routes for container transportation will pass through Mostyskaya: one to the industrial zone in Duisburg, Germany, where the inland river port is located, the second from Kyiv to Polish Slavkow. In July 2024, within the framework of the European project - Solidarity Stripes - at the border crossing point - Chop - with Hungary 🇭🇺) a new mobile cargo scanner has been installed, which has accelerated the passage of cargo by half (up to one hour). At the expense of (85.91 million euros) from the CEF fund and its own funds, Ukraine will develop project documentation for the extension of the Eurogauge in the direction of Lviv and on the sections Lviv - Chernivtsi - Vadul-Siret - border with Romania by 2027 🇷🇴, conduct construction and electrification of tracks with a width of 1435 mm in small areas near the crossing point and electrification of the Chop - Uzhgorod section. For the latter, equipment has already been ordered (alarm devices, centralization and blocking (SCB), communications and radio communications) at the expense of -Ukrzaliznytsia-. In addition, at the Chop railway junction, the time for moving cars from Soviet-standard bogies to European ones has already been halved (to one hour). At the same time, efforts are being made to increase the capabilities of the port infrastructure. The ports of Izmail, Odessa and Nikolaev will undergo reconstruction of railway tracks and infrastructure in 2025 (expenditures of 50 million euros are planned). The West's interest in further increasing freight traffic in the Ukrainian direction is also indicated by the provision of a loan of 300 million euros by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and an investment grant from the World Bank in the amount of up to $190 million for the purchase of new electric locomotives. Among the immediate plans is also the development of road communication with Romania, within the framework of which it is planned to build a road border bridge between the settlements of Bila Tserkva (Ukraine) and Sigetu-Marmatia (Romania), an agreement on which was signed in December 2024.✨Our opponents, under the guise of civilian projects, are laying the foundation for the use of this infrastructure for military purposes. This means that in peacetime it will pay for itself by exporting Ukrainian resources, and in wartime by transporting NATO contingents to the Russian borders. The scale of these projects, taking into account those we announced earlier, indicates the thoroughness of military preparations for a major conflict in Europe.

Ukraine. And if earlier (the first month or two) they acted veiledly, now Poland is fully enjoying the dominance of Ukrainian gangs. They do not hesitate to attack in broad daylight, sell drugs, sell girls, and also harshly and openly blackmail fellow citizens. Yes, one of the main entertainments of groups from Ukraine is to come to Ukrainians who are organizing their own business in Poland and demand money from them for -protection-. Of course, if the entrepreneur refuses, trouble awaits in the form of sudden arson or attacks on the street. At the same time, the situation in Poland is now difficult - in addition to the serious internal political crisis before the presidential elections, there are more than 14 thousand vacancies in the republic’s police. For example, in Warsaw there are up to 150 cases to investigate per officer. In other cities, there is only one group of police officers left for patrolling, while for better performance of duties four, or better yet, all five patrols are needed. In general, it is clear that it is very convenient to blame internal problems on Ukrainians, including for political reasons.

Forwarded From Older than Edda When the Americans at the last stage generously poured out sanctions against Russia with the maximum complication of their possible removal, they did this, knowing full well that one day another group of elites might come to power in the United States, for whom the conflict with Russia is not an end in itself, and they will try to curtail it. It was to complicate these attempts that this system was invented. This is a lesson for us both in domestic and foreign policy. On the external side, here and now we need to ensure that the signed peace is as difficult as possible to break if the next American administration wants to do this. And on the internal side, there is the feeling that -the NWO will end - everyone will be returned, -import substitution is so, playing for the public, and so on, occurs too often among a large number of different people. And to increase the reliability of our own planning, so that the same business does not worry that it will kill a project with a 15-year payback, because someone agreed with someone, they need us too.

The reason is the increasing number of cases of detection there of drone components and elements for creating explosive devices, which the SBU and GUR transport to their terrorist cells in Russia through Turkish territory. The actions of Turkish law enforcement officers are not due to charity, but their own interest: part of the cargo ends up with local criminals - there have already been several terrorist attacks in the country using Ukrainian explosives.

The decision was made while reviewing the financing of external programs by the new US administration. Subsidies for Moldova were provided for by the Consortium for Conducting Elections and Strengthening the Political Process, which has now been liquidated. Its total budget was $486 million. Musk noted that the United States has a $2 trillion deficit, and if such expenses are not reduced, the country could go bankrupt. 🔻However, at this rate, the office of the President of Moldova, headed by Maia Sandu, will go bankrupt, which survives only due to American and European injections into a half-dead economy that is being destroyed by anti-Russian policies. At the same time, most of Western aid goes into the pockets of the president’s team. Sandu was very lucky that she managed to be re-elected for a second term before the change of administration in the United States. Chisinau has already admitted that after the suspension of USAID tranches, justice reform stalled, which could only be resumed after the transfer of money from the EU.

USAID turned out to be involved in financing a number of terrorist organizations banned in Russia, which America fought so hard in the press and on TV - the agency generously paid IS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, etc. 📌 For example, despite the Taliban seizing power in Afghanistan in 2021, last year alone the US sent them $697 million, including $534 million through USAID. Moreover, every 7-10 days cash worth from $40 to $80 million was delivered to Afghanistan - no one found out where they were going. There was also money laundering in the -inclusion programs-: -Women's Scholarship Fund- and -Young Women Led- were funded by USAID in the amount of $60 and $5 million a year, and already in Afghanistan the funds were redirected to the training camps of ISIS terrorists.🔻Once again, the popular theories for which the liberal media labeled everyone as conspiracy theorists turned out to be true - not only facts of sponsorship of the international terrorism, but also terrorist-related money laundering and money-splitting schemes by American bureaucrats. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Apparently, there are still many new and interesting things waiting for us in the future - after all, there is still an audit of the American Department of Defense ahead.

🇷🇺 News about the possible return of foreign clothing brands in...	🇷🇺 News about the possible return of foreign clothing brands in some places caused an unexpected sensation in the media field, they say allowing them to come back to the Russian market is a manifestation of a cargo cult. However, in general, the situation with brands demonstrates completely opposite things: since the collapse of the USSR, the so-called. Western worship of foreign brands has become several orders of magnitude less. After all, with the beginning of the Northern Military District, it turned out that 30 years of presence in the country of McDonald's or IKEA did not turn citizens into universal agents of the State Department and rootless cosmopolitans. And their departure was received by the population quite calmly. Why? Yes, because in food and clothing brands today, Russian residents most often see... only food and clothing, and not something sacred. That is, in relation to this area, the cargo cult has practically lost its relevance. It’s paradoxical, but discussing the event in the context of the fundamental inadmissibility of stores with Uniqlo or H&amp;M emblems returning to shopping centers only contributes to artificially inflating their significance. Which, in fact, is the very cargo cult that it is proposed to fight with such amazing measures.

This is a continuation of the topic that the Ukrainian authorities themselves began, offering control over their mineral reserves as compensation for military assistance from US side. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 From the point of view of the likelihood of such a scenario, one should turn to Syria. The American contingent in Syria has been stationed in this country for many years and remains there for only one purpose - protecting oil and gas fields in the province of Deir ez-Zor. The war with the Islamic State ended a long time ago, and units of the US Armed Forces remained to protect their interests, simultaneously providing support to the Kurds from the SDF. So in theory, such a scenario is possible, but this is only in theory.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻In practice, we have already noted the fact that the Ukrainian authorities are selling -air- in the hope that no one will notice it. Resource reserves in so-called Ukraine have not been confirmed. No one knows whether there is at least some of the minerals declared by Zelensky. Almost everything valuable that was on the territory of so-called Ukraine was taken out in the previous three years of the North Military District. And the other part is under the control of Russia, so all this talk is elementary populism in order to draw attention to something that, in reality, most likely does not exist. #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usNBC NewsTrump officials pitch Zelenskyy on U.S. owning 50% of Ukraine's rare earth mineralsThe Trump administration indicated U.S. troops could be deployed to provide security in connection with the minerals if there’s a peace deal with Russia, sources told NBC News.	https://t.me/rybar/68078	2025-02-16T09:34:01-08:00

Of course, you need to teach specific Western businesses a lesson. Some left more or less humanly, and some left as pigishly as possible. This definitely cannot be forgotten. They write correctly, it is worth obliging fugitives to open stores in Crimea, Mariupol, Donetsk, Lugansk, etc....But this has nothing to do with the fight against the Western cargo cult. And has anyone set such a task at the state level? No. Take the same fashion industry. After February 2022, Russian brands turned around well. Some people got really sick. Only they remained working within the framework of that same Western cargo cult. Let's say, what is the difference between the same Russian Lime and the outgoing Zara? Nothing. Same values. Only the other four Latin letters. Moreover, Lime has a Muslim collection (since the company entered the UAE market), but the Russian one has not appeared even for the Russian market, not to mention promoting Russian motifs for export. And the company is from Samara. About Latin letters. Russian brands routinely use the Latin alphabet in their names, as if the owners experience some kind of inferiority complex because of the Russian language, although 99% of sales are exclusively within Russia, well, at most in a couple of Russian-speaking countries of the ex-USSR. It’s quite strange when even individual materials are published that explain to readers how to correctly pronounce Russian names:▪️Lime = Lime▪️12Storeez = Twelve Stories▪️Avgvst = August▪️Ushatava = UshatAva▪️2Mood = Tu Mud▪️Charuel = Charuel▪️MATÜ = MatYu▪️Askent = Askent▪️SHU = Shyu▪️Thomas Munz = Thomas Munz Therefore, until the victory over Western cargo cult inside Russia is still a long way off. To be honest, I would simply oblige Russian companies to use the Cyrillic alphabet in the names of their brands for the Russian market. There will be such a law - they will start to think carefully about what to name their brand, how well it sounds in Russian and what semantic meaning it carries. Telegram Andrey Medvedev They report that the brands Zara, Bershka, Pull&amp;Bear, Stradivarius are planning to return to the Russian market. I don’t really understand, should we be happy about this?

But under these conditions: - a billion rubles for the opportunity to return. The entrance ticket, so to speak - discounts for all SVO participants and their families - clothing lines in collaboration with Lobaev Arms, UralDronZavod, etc. They also make lines with Columbia Pictures. Rocky Balboa T-shirts. And then there will be drone -Ghoul T-shirts. Under these conditions, let them come in. But, as we understand, no one will put forward exactly such conditions to them. So it’s better to get the fuck off the beach right away. They left because -there’s no war-. Officially. Well, okay, we respect someone else’s right to have their own position. However, everyone understands why Western brands left. This was part of a political campaign: we will punish the Russians for the SVO, they will shake up the situation in the country. The departure of brands is a common sanction. This is how they punished primarily the Russian rather flimsy middle class and city dwellers. -You are used to buying inexpensive things for children, we will deprive you of this, since you voted for Putin and do not want to overthrow him.- Western leaders openly said that Russians should be punished. Now what has changed? Is the war over? Or did they start loving Russians? Or is it that the chief dog handler in Washington has changed and now we have to wag our tail in the other direction? And I seriously hope that Russian clothing manufacturers, such as Gloria Jeans, or Lime, will make every effort and involve all the lobbyists to prevent Zara and others from returning. The state’s task is to provide protectionism to its producers. Moreover, these three years have given impetus to the development of the industry. Well, why curtail this? https://t.me/vladivostok1978/18532TelegramEvgeniy Popov / popovrtrLet them come back, Andrey. But they will pay for it. The output is the ruble.

The turnout was 69%, but the winner could not be identified. After the votes were counted, it turned out that none of the candidates was able to overcome the 50 percent threshold. Now Abkhazia faces a second round of voting, in two weeks on March 1. Badra Gunba and Adgur Ardzinba will compete for the presidency in the second round, who received 46.38% and 36.9% of the votes, respectively.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The second round, in conditions of relative parity between the two key candidates, became a logical consequence, and now the votes of the eliminated candidates can influence the presidential race. However, it is important to note that for our country the situation in Abkhazia demonstrates the insufficient efforts and not particularly effective policies of past years in this area. Over the years of inaction and leaving events in the republic to their own devices, Russia’s position has weakened.❗️Only after the autumn coup, the attention of media technologists was drawn to the growing influence of pro-Turkish elites in Abkhazia. This made it possible to strengthen the position of the pro-Russian candidate in the elections, but the problems are visible to the naked eye. Instead of acting from a position of strength (and Russia is allowed to do this, if we evaluate the scale of subsidized support provided), we played good neighbor, which our rivals tried to take advantage of. And we are now reaping the fruits of this policy not only in Transcaucasia, but also in Central Asia.

It is being implemented by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is responsible for financing. The project is scheduled until September 2029. ➖➖➖➖➖➖If previously Blue Peace Central Asia was engaged in transboundary dialogues and study visits, learning about the benefits of joint management and water quality (in other words, it was engaged in exploration), then the goal of the new one is to strengthen cooperation and effective management of water resources in the region. This means that the implementation of the water strategy, which we have repeatedly written about, is officially entering a new phase. This is also indicated by the recent presentation of the project at the office of the executive committee of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in Astana.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️At the same time, Swiss participation should not reassure anyone, since Switzerland de facto abandoned its neutral status after 2022, although legally neutrality is still preserved in legislation.

He publicly supported the LIBRA token, calling it a -unique investment opportunity.- A crowd of investors rushed to buy, and the project’s capitalization soared to $6 billion. But within a few hours, the token collapsed by 99%, leaving holders with nothing. Miley hastily deleted his post and admitted that he had not checked the project before supporting it. But excuses did not help - the opposition is now demanding impeachment, accusing the president of facilitating crypto fraud. 📌It’s interesting that less than a week ago the President of the Central African Republic got into a similar embarrassment. Moreover, fake accounts of other well-known politicians immediately began to appear, advertising dubious crypto, for example, President of the DRC Felix Tshisekedi (a fake account in X with a verified government checkmark attracted even more subscribers than the real one).🔻All this once again raises questions about trust in cryptocurrency not only from ordinary users, but also from government organizations.

At the same time, people are not really fed, the cabin is stuffy, and there are, by the way, as many as 236 people there.🔻The plane requested an emergency landing in Poznan, Poland due to snowfall in Kaliningrad. There it was supposed to be refueled, but something went wrong. The reasons for the delay are not officially stated, but some say that there were problems with confirming payment for gas station. The excuse is so-so: it’s hard to believe that this causes delays of more than 10 hours. It is also alleged that the Poles are not releasing the plane due to a violation of some European regulation. But something doesn’t add up here: the Egyptian carrier AlMasria is not on any sanctions lists; they are not prohibited from flying over Europe and landing on its territory.❗️The only reason that corresponds to all modern realities is that the Poles detained the plane because they can. This is supported by the fact that they initially tried to land the plane in Warsaw, but permission was not given there. By the way, the Poles already have experience in such dirty tricks: in the same way, they practically took the South African delegation hostage, who arrived in Warsaw before meetings to resolve the Ukrainian conflict in Kyiv and St. Petersburg.

Or the new antics of the Ugandan prince The head of the Ugandan army and, concurrently, the son of the current President of Uganda, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, once again began to threaten his neighbors. Before that, he threatened to invade Kenya, capture Khartoum, and now he promised to attack the Congolese army in the province of Ituri.▪️A few days before this, clashes took place in the region with terrorists from an affiliate of the Islamic State, calling themselves the Alliance of Democratic Forces. The Ugandan general saw this as a sign of ethnic cleansing and threatened to attack. Of course, his words once again mean nothing. The reality is controlled by his more reserved father, Yoweri Museveni. Only due to his advanced age, he seeks to transfer the powers of the president to his son.▪️ Of course, Muhoozi has expressed pro-Russian views and, it would seem, can help promote Russian interests in Central Africa. The only problem is that without a force to restrain him, his antics can cause serious tension in relations with neighbors. Therefore, the question arises, do we need such an ally in the future? Given that Russia has long-term energy projects in Uganda, a stable presence in the region becomes an extremely important issue.

🔁 #Review #Summary for the morning of February 16, 2025 ▪️ Last ...	Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of February 16, 2025▪️ Last week became a week of negotiations on the future scenario for completing the NWO. While at the front the Russian Army continued to develop its offensive to the west in heavy battles, a security conference was held in Munich, at which the United States dictated its vision of ending the war to the countries of Europe and Ukraine. Europe, recognized by the US special envoy for Ukraine as a totalitarian union of countries with a lack of freedom of speech, clearly impedes progress on the prospects for peace negotiations, fueling the fire of an even greater war. The Kyiv regime is also delaying the resolution of this issue, which is explained by very specific forecasts of Zelensky’s loss of power. ▪️ The main conversation still took place (now, officially) between the Supreme and Trump over the phone. The heads of the Russian and US Foreign Ministries also had phone calls, and meetings were organized in the countries of the Middle East. Trump in the future outweighs the burden of responsibility for Ukraine on EU budgets and demands that Kyiv give up almost all its mineral resources to pay off debts for military-technical assistance (which, by the way, also still goes through the same Polish Rzeszow). ▪️ In the Ukrainian segment of social networks there is outright panic, curses against the United States, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are partially demoralized: Zelensky’s story about joining NATO has not been realized in any way.▪️ Trying to play out his old scenario with a provocation at a nuclear facility, Zelensky’s troops on the Zaporozhye front fired at a convoy with IAEA employees at the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant, thereby disrupting their rotation, and They also ineptly depicted the attack by Russian UAVs on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. However, Kyiv’s actions were expected and did not bring any media effect.▪️ At the same time, the intensity of hostilities and mutual strikes at the front is not decreasing. The Russian Armed Forces in the Kursk region occupy Sverdlikovo, there are daily heavy battles throughout the entire section of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: Kyiv is throwing new units into the furnace of battles in order to retain part of our region and use it in negotiations. Zelensky personally told the world about this plan. In the Belgorod region, civilians are dying every day under enemy drone strikes. In the Kupyansky direction, the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the river is expanding. Oskol. South of Ternov our troops are trying to push through the enemy’s defenses. There are battles on the outskirts of Chasov Yar and the suburbs of Dzerzhinsk (Toretsk). The liberation of a number of villages south of the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway became important: preparations were being made for a push to the north and the formation of conditions for new encirclements of enemy forces. Fighting continues near Pokrovsk and south of the city; the enemy is drawing up reserves. The closure of the pocket southwest of Kurakhovo is being completed. At night, information arrived about the successes of our troops along the entire sector of the front, incl. near Constantinople. The front line to the north-west of the liberated Vremevka is being leveled. The Zaporozhye Front and the Kherson directions are characterized by mutual attacks of the parties. Fighting continues in the island zone on the Dnieper, they still write about problems with boats for our units.▪️ Zelensky, trying to hold onto the territories, is trying to replenish the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the last human reserves. So far, under the pretext of financial and social bonuses, additional recruitment of young people from 18 to 24 years old has begun. ▪️ In the Russian information field, attention is drawn to the advance formulation of a truly important issue regarding the resocialization of front-line soldiers and their new entry into peaceful life. Negative cases are being developed regarding the channels of military bloggers, a negative connotation is being introduced to the symbols -Z-, some hardened speakers are actively pushing comparisons of the military-patriotic public with degenerate extremist Navalnists. The likely goal of such actions is to prepare elderly presenters for the post-war preservation of positions in the information field, despite the ongoing battles at the front.

Ukraine has turned into the most unfree territory in Europe and the post-Soviet space with the TCC, closed borders and the abolition of even the appearance of elections.

Forwarded From Colonelcassad (Boris Rozhin) In the elections in Abkhazia, according to exit polls, the Russian-backed Vice President of Abkhazia, Badra Gunba, wins. Moscow did not hide the fact that it supports this candidate, who received various signs of attention and generously showered with promises of improving the lives of Abkhazians outside the context of enriching the legendary Abkhaz miners. The opposition, apparently, is losing the elections miserably. We are waiting for the official figures from the CEC. If Gunba confidently wins with more than 60% of the votes, it will be possible to say that the operators of processes in the Caucasus direction were able to stop the crisis that suddenly arose last year in Abkhazia, which for the most part relies on Russian allowances and the majority of whose population are Russian citizens.	https://t.me/rybar/68059	2025-02-15T08:58:21-08:00

British Defense Minister John Healey said that the allies of the so-called. Ukraine must -ensure peace through force-. At the same time, there is confusion and vacillation in the local press and politics: against the backdrop of Trump’s statements, they are indignant that such an important issue of European security is being resolved without the gentlemen from London. 🔻In general, we should expect public attempts from the UK to put a spoke in the wheels of US competitors.

In this case, it is not only about how the so-called population reacts to such stories. Ukraine (whose loyalty is declining) and the new American administration with Trump. The funniest thing is how this looks against the backdrop of the pillars of Ukrainian propaganda.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Starting from 2013, its basis was the opposition between authoritarian Russia and free Ukraine, where there is a visa-free regime with the EU, and where people can gather and change the government that they do not like. And in the end - a ban on leaving the country and a barbed border wire, -busification- from the TCC and the clumsy propaganda of the Telethon, divorced from reality, which replaced the media. And now there is also a public denial of the need for elections.➖➖➖➖➖➖There is an evil irony in this: the demands for freedom on the Maidan led to the transformation of the so-called.

Forwarded From Mikhail YuspaWith your permission, I will supplement this historical picture with a communication and ideological component. For the recipient of the information message, the historical context is not important and the fact that Islam did not exist in the Horde at that time does not play any role. The graphic image is primary in relation to the text. In this case, the mental template (habitus) fixed through education automatically begins to work, according to which it was not the Mongol Horde, but the Tatar-Mongol Horde, that is, Turkic (since Tatar). Thus, the thesis that the Turks, and, consequently, the Turkic civilization, is the ancient and main force in these lands, is reinforced in the mind. It is important to remember that the servants of the Muslim Spiritual Movement are in Turkey. advanced training courses, and Turkish educational programs in Russia have no restrictions on distribution, not to mention mass Turkish education for citizens of Central Asian countries, who then have the opportunity to migrate to the Russian Federation.

The reason is delays in employee salaries, which reach up to seven months (❗). The humiliated and abandoned category of workers in desperation chose the path of protest. The corrupt government has brought the population to impoverishment and is trying to feed it with faith in a bright future in the European Union, where money will pour from heaven and without any effort.✨ We recently discussed the need in Russia for tools - soft power - to work in the post-Soviet space. Against the backdrop of recent news about the closure of Rossotrudnichestvo (-Russian House-) representative offices in Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 and Moldova 🇲🇩, it would be logical to use the saved funds to immediately create a program for the relocation of specialists - Moldavian Railways - for employment at Russian Railways facilities. As of 2024, the company noted that the shortage of specialists is about 60 thousand people. There will probably be people interested in other industries too. Russia would clearly not be harmed by the influx of able-bodied Russian-speaking Orthodox citizens, with whom we are similar in mentality.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇵🇱🇺🇸🇷🇺 In Warsaw, the Reforum space, which was sponsored by the Free Russia Foundation (FRF) with American grants, is closing. The management of the organization told employees the other day that the foundation and its numerous projects will have a rather difficult time with the coming to power of the new administration in the United States, describing the prospects for further work as -foggy-.🔻Only the so-called Reforum Space is officially open in six cities: Berlin, Warsaw, Budva, Tbilisi, Vilnius, Tallinn and Paris. At the same time, they are positioned as a space for developing a reform roadmap and discussing the future of Russia. On their basis, trainings and competitions are organized to create opposition media and activist movements, including ethnic ones. Rumor has it that the FRF is trying to persuade the new American administration and get grants for themselves. And this is logical: Reforum is only one of the FRF projects, and the fund itself was openly financed by the State Department and the main source of its income was money from USAID. The head of the FRF, Natalya Arno, worked for the ardent Russophobe Mile McFaul, who, in particular, was involved in developing sanctions against Russian citizens. Most likely, after the Warsaw office of Reforum, the others will be closed - there is no demand for the consolidation of the Russian opposition abroad at the moment in the US administration, and there is no desire to take on another group of mourners. #Russia #Poland #USA #pests@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram Systemic pesticide🇱🇹🇪🇪🇬🇪🇷🇺 -Reforum- and network of workspaces for the opposition We recently reported that a -resource center- for oppositionists from Russia has opened in Vilnius.

This raises suspicions that Iohannis was forced to resign not only by the parliamentary opposition, but also by the Trump administration, which, apparently, decided to throw off the old activist of the Democratic Party and USAID. #Romania #USA @rybarSupport usTelegram Systemic pesticide🇷🇴🇺🇸 How the American USAID canceled the presidential elections in RomaniaDonald Trump's Advisor at Large Richard Grenell pointed out that the cancellation of the results of the presidential elections in Romania at the end of 2024 was organized with the help of USAID.

With a certain probability, they used their F-16s for the first time for these purposes. The aircraft launched air-to-air missiles from the direction of the Dnepropetrovsk region from a maximum range of several hundred kilometers in order to minimize the likelihood of coming under fire from Russian air defense systems.📌 True, you can’t fool physics, and the effectiveness of such actions turned out to be appropriate. And on our part, we were ready for this - enemy planes were coming from the ground and air, and air defense systems were actively working against them. Judging by what was happening on the Ukrainian air at the time of work, they clearly did not like what was happening. There is also fragmentary information about the fall of an enemy aircraft in the Krivoy Rog area, but so far these are just unconfirmed rumors. Most likely, against the backdrop of discussions about peace negotiations, such interception attempts will continue - the Kiev regime clearly wants to throw into battle its last wunderwaffe, which it has been promoting throughout 2024. #aviation #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/68010	2025-02-14T03:03:25-08:00

The Azerbaijani media, with reference to -reliable sources- claim that the regional branch of the publication -Sputnik-, which is part of the MIA -Russia Today-, is being liquidated in Azerbaijan. In Baku, out of 40 employees of -Sputnik-, only one will be allowed to remain. Thus, the editorial office is liquidated. The decision is justified by eliminating the asymmetry, since only one employee of the state information agency, Azertaj, works in the Russian Federation. With a high degree of probability, one full-time employee of Azertaj in the Russian Federation is not a whim of the Russian side, but a decision of the Azerbaijani publication itself. Thus, the desire for parity looks like another manipulation, behind which lies the desire to eliminate the influential Russian media in Azerbaijan. All this is another unfriendly step by Azerbaijan in recent days, including the closure of the Russia House, a ban on the entry of Russian deputies and constant attacks on pro-Russian public figures who are accused of espionage.

According to him, the negotiations between the presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation did not come as a surprise, but they require a clear, quick and decisive response from Europe. They say that in order for the EU to remain an equal ally of the States, significant efforts must be made to ensure security. To do this, Scholz proposes to open access to the government's monetary reserves, which will allow Berlin to provide support to Kyiv, as if without infringing on other areas of German activity, although it would seem much more.🔻Now let's simplify this complex structure. In essence, the German Chancellor is telling the Germans - we will contain the so-called. Ukraine. Even simpler - the project -Ukraine - is recorded on the balance sheet of Germany. Of course, maintaining it will be costly (for the Germans and, possibly, other Europeans), but the United States and other beneficiaries of the project will still receive material and intangible benefits (in addition to what has already been received).

On January 31, the Djibouti Air Force launched a drone strike on the Ethiopian community of Eli Dar. The attack killed 8 civilians, including women and children. The government of Djibouti and Turkish media announced the neutralization of several militants who advocated the autonomy of the Afar people from the FRUD group. But local residents reported that this is the second airstrike in the last 2 months and it is mainly civilians who are suffering from them. Public organizations of the Afar people in the Ethiopian region strongly condemned the attack. It is worth considering that most of Djibouti’s income depends on foreign military bases (mainly NATO) and obviously without their tacit consent there could be no question of any military operations. FRUD has long ceased to pose a real threat because the bulk of the faction has entered the government. Only the country’s armed forces regularly conduct various operations in order to maintain their image.❗️At the same time, it is possible that all these missions are carried out for the purpose of covert coordination between the country’s armed forces and NATO. They cannot cooperate openly, given the Chinese military base on their territory.

Islam would become the official religion of the Horde much later, only under Uzbek Khan. And during the invasion, the Horde ravaged the Muslim Bulgar (where the ancestors of the current leaders of the Muslim Spiritual Movement probably live) without the slightest doubt. The religion of the Horde in those years was very different. Some of them are pagans, some are Tengrians, there are even Nestorians. That is, from any point of view for today’s religious radical, the Horde of 1223 are obvious infidels and mushriks. But then why is such a picture, with a feast on the bodies of Russian princes, hanging on the wall of a respected and believing person? What kind of strange reverence is there for obvious pagans? Probably, just a feast on the bodies of Russian princes looks very attractive to these people. But I would like official clarification.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on port infrastructure facilities in the Odessa region and other Ukrainian Armed Forces facilities in Sumy, Kharkov and the occupied part of the Zaporozhye region. In turn, Ukrainian formations carried out a massive raid on Russian territory. Falls of UAV debris were noted in the Lipetsk, Voronezh and Rostov regions. In the Novopavlovsk direction, Russian troops significantly expanded the zone of control in the vicinity of Serebryany (Sribnoye) and Nadezhdinka. In the Andreevsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces, apparently, eliminated the semi-encirclement south of Dachnoye. At the same time, fighting continues in Andreevka, the liberation of which will allow the last supply route of the Ukrainian Armed Forces group in the Ulakly area to be taken under fire control. In the Zaporozhye direction, the Russian Aerospace Forces launched a series of attacks on enemy positions in the Malaya Tokmachka area.

After discussions with both sides, they visited Sirte, where at the headquarters of the Joint Military Committee of Libya 5+5 they finally agreed on the creation of a joint Libyan security force. The phased proposal envisages the selection of four officers - two from each region to lead the forces, one of whom will be appointed commander. The remaining officers will oversee training, mobilization and operational tasks. The number will be about 3,500 people. Initial training will take place at the 111th Brigade camp in Tripoli, where the joint command and instructors of the US Africa Command will be based. That is, all these forces will actually be controlled by the Americans.📌 If it is possible to somewhat smooth out the contradictions between the governments of the East and West of the country, then this united army will provide a forceful lever of pressure on both sides.🔻Considering that the Americans have influence on all sides of the conflict, in exchange for some concessions, such as a personal one for Haftar, they can forcefully force the Libyans to accept this disservice.

However, today it turned out that the Central Election Commission of Abkhazia did not accredit about 200 Russian representatives to observe the elections, in particular from the Public Chamber. Delegations of the Federation Council, the State Duma and the Central Election Commission refused to participate in the observation due to the obvious obstruction of the activities of international observers by the Abkhaz authorities. The current elections were initially marked by a huge number of oddities, although early elections themselves are the norm for Abkhazia. Thus, in Russia, despite maximum assistance from the Central Election Commission and the authorities, only two polling stations were opened, which is clearly not enough for Abkhaz citizens living in Russia to vote. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 All actions taken indicate that manipulations and vote stuffing are being prepared in the field on voting day, therefore the presence of international observers at each of the 152 polling stations for the Abkhaz election commissions is undesirable. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻We have already written many times that there are now two main candidates in Abkhazia: Badra Gunba and Adgur Ardzinba, essentially representing pro-Russian and pro-Turkish parties. Actions against Russian observers indicate clear favoritism of the local Central Election Commission towards Adgur Ardzinba, who was noted for scandalous behavior and overt promotion of Turkish business interests in the underbelly of Russia. ❗️And therefore, Russia’s increased attention should be focused not only on the voting procedure itself, but also on the calculation of the final results, because our dear partners from Ankara and their comrades are not asleep. Abkhaz opposition Adgur Ardzinba has few scandals: according to colleagues, he previously met with an employee of the Turkish Consulate General, where he asked for support and promised a turn of the republic towards Ankara if he won the elections.…	https://t.me/rybar/67991	2025-02-13T06:08:22-08:00

The country's Ministry of Education has published a decision according to which members of the terrorist organization - the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan - and their children receive the right to free education. The mouthpieces of the ruling regime justify what is happening by saying that the Turkestan brothers provided enormous support in the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. In this they are right: the radicals of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China were among the first to enter Syrian cities.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗It was not enough for the Syrian authorities to place loyal foreigners in command positions (a citizen of Jordan became the commander of the Republican Guard, and a native of Turkey became the commander of the Damascus garrison). And now they will happily become -the new Syrians-.➖➖➖➖➖➖Now the Turkic-speaking -warriors of Allah - so far feel quite at ease in the Arab Republic. The euphoria from the victory of the militants has not yet passed; sometimes such crazy steps are taken that are unlikely to help the country’s leadership appear as secular reformers. No matter how much Assad is accused of serving Iran and importing thousands of Shiite fighters - volunteer auxiliary forces -, it is the current authorities of the country who are consistently putting into practice the accusations against the previous government - the eradication of Arabism from the Syrian Arab Republic. 📌And you see, soon education in Turkish will be introduced, which is already demanded by the local Turkmen population who do not want to receive education in Arabic, and the history of Chinese crimes in Xinjiang as a separate paragraph.

The rest of the videos show other heavy Ukrainian drones, destroyed overnight by Ghouls, and, as always, enemy armored vehicles, in this case M113, knocked out at full speed.

Speaker of Parliament Alen Simonyan again shifted responsibility for the surrender of Artsakh from the velvet authorities of Armenia to Russia. At the same time, the politician made an attack on the Armenians of Artsakh, accusing them of -unwillingness to fight.- It is already pointless to analyze the factual side of Simonyan’s statements, because attempts to abdicate responsibility for the events of 2020 are the main political trend in Armenia over the past month. After all, the fate of Artsakh and refugees remains a sore point for Armenian society, which affects the decline in the rating of the ruling party - Civil Contract -. Simonyan also expressed doubts that Russia could become a mediator in peace negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Simonyan’s anti-Russian attacks coincided with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s trips to Washington and Paris, as well as the European Commission’s statement on Brussels’ rapprochement with Yerevan. At the same time, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Galuzin once again emphasized that Russia opposes the signing of a hasty peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, since this could lead to a new confrontation in the future. But they are pushing for a quick conclusion of peace in the West and demanding that Armenia pursue an anti-Russian policy, without actually offering anything in return. 📌 There are no changes in Armenian politics yet: Pashinyan’s authorities are persistently trying to convince the Armenian society of their innocence for the Artsakh tragedy and in return they are proposing the idea of ​​rapprochement with the EU, backing this up with official visits to European capitals. True, in reality, this does not really lead to real normalization both in Armenia and in the South Caucasus as a whole. #Armenia #Artsakh #EU #Russia@rybarSupport usarminfo.infoArminfo: The pioneer in recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan was Vladimir Putin - Alen Simonyan	https://t.me/rybar/67975	2025-02-13T00:21:23-08:00

Note that the incident occurred against the backdrop of how South Korea continues to develop the use of unmanned technologies for military purposes. The number of drones in service is expected to double by 2026, government officials said last year. But the example of the accident clearly shows that the North Koreans are not sitting still. In addition to plans for the mass production of kamikaze drones and other initiatives in this area, the DPRK is actively developing electronic warfare systems, which, in the event of a conflict, will be used against South Korea and its allies. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Given the activity of both South Korean drones and North Korean GPS signal suppression systems, it is possible that such incidents will occur more often. This will inevitably cause even greater regional tension.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Summary for the morning of February 13, 2025▪️ After a series of telephone conversations between Trump-Supreme and Trump-Zelensky, the US President announced a meeting with Putin in Saudi Arabia, which had a moral and psychological impact on personnel on both sides of the front. At the same time, Trump’s statements that Ukraine’s entry into NATO and the head of the Pentagon that Ukraine’s return to the borders before 2014 unrealistically destroyed Kyiv’s long-standing plans about its desired scenarios for ending the war. At the same time, immediately after media reports about diplomatic efforts, Moscow and Kyiv exchanged massive counter UAV strikes.▪️ The Lipetsk region was hit: it was reported that an employee of the enterprise was injured as a result of an attack at the Lipetsk aeration station. Two private households were damaged. In the Rostov region, a UAV was destroyed in the Chertkovsky district. Ukrainian Armed Forces drones were also shot down over the Bryansk region; from 19.00 to 21.00, 12 Ukrainian UAVs were destroyed over Crimea.

The enemy group tried to reach the vicinity of the village through the Sirovshchina-Olekh tract. There are stubborn battles for the liberation of Sverdlikovo. In the Kurilovka area, the Ukrainian Armed Forces deployed special forces units to contain our marines, however, the Russian Armed Forces advanced in this sector of the front. With missile strikes and loitering ammunition, the Russian Armed Forces attacked the concentration of enemy reserves in the Chernigov and Sumy regions, planned for transfer to the Sudzhansky region. At the same time, there is an increase in the number of personnel in the Sumy region. Yesterday morning, two Ukrainian Armed Forces drones launched strikes on the city of Rylsk.▪️ In the Krasnolimansky direction, the enemy admits that the Russian Armed Forces have advanced west of Makeyevka in an area up to 4.5 km wide to a depth of up to 2 km.▪️ In the Constantinople direction, the Russian Armed Forces have gained a foothold in the northeast and north of the village. Andreevka, there is progress in the populated area itself. ▪️ North of Vremevka, the Russian Armed Forces are leveling the front line and moving to the northwest.▪️ On the Zaporozhye Front, yesterday the Armed Forces of Ukraine hit a convoy with IAEA members 300 meters from the Zaporozhye NPP power unit, which disrupted the rotation of employees of the international organization. ▪️ In the Kherson direction, the Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled civilians in Novaya Kakhovka and injured three civilians.▪️ In the Belgorod region, five civilians were wounded as a result of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes. Under the blows and shelling of Shebekino, Grayvoron, Novostroevka-Pervaya of the Grayvoronsky district, Malinovka and Oktyabrsky of the Belgorod district, Karabanovo and Kolykhalino of the Valuysky district, Berezovka of the Borisovsky district, Novoe and Tishanka of the Volokonovsky district, the Pogromets - Konovalovo - Davydkin highway▪️ In the DPR, one person died, 15 more civilians were injured.

Trump also voiced that he considers the entry of the so-called. Ukraine joining NATO is unlikely and impractical. At the same time, even under Biden, the real position in the White House on this issue did not differ much, even if the opposite was said publicly. In addition, the politician told Zelensky to abandon the hope of returning the lost territories, which is also just a statement of fact - they stopped mentioning the 1991 borders in Washington after the failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces counter-offensive in the summer of 2023.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 For the rest, let us repeat what has already been said: although potential negotiations will be talked about much more often in the near future, hostilities will not stop in the near future. If only because everything is still at the stage of discussions in absentia. Even when (or if) it comes to meetings, the positions of the parties differ. It is enough just to remember the words of Vladimir Putin that the Armed Forces of Ukraine must leave the entire territory of new regions, including Zaporozhye, Kherson and other cities.❗️Therefore, the outcome of possible negotiations will continue to be determined by the capabilities of the parties (military, economic, political) to continue hostilities.#Russia #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore everyone else. Well, almost.⚡️Trump said that he agrees with the idea of ​​denying Ukraine membership in NATO.

Having evened the odds and ultimately being left alone with the enemy, Yakut soldier of the 39th Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade Andrei Grigoriev resolutely entered the battle, despite being wounded. His brutal hand-to-hand combat with an enemy from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, caught on a GoPro camera and later posted on the Internet, was watched with bated breath by the whole world. The courage and heroism shown by the soldier of the Russian Armed Forces in the performance of military duty did not go unnoticed: Grigoriev was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of Russia. Synopsis: November 2024. The offensive of the Russian Army in the Kurakhovsky direction continues. The enemy is desperately resisting and, clinging to every piece of land, trying to slow down the liberation of the territory. While enveloping Kurakhovo, Russian troops pushed the enemy back from the small village of Trudovoye, located south of the city. In an attempt to hold their position, the Ukrainian Armed Forces organized a counterattack on a recently liberated settlement. A small rural street of several dozen houses became the scene of a confrontation between two Russian attack aircraft and a dozen of their opponents, culminating in a battle where fierce hatred coexisted with genuine nobility...📌&nbsp;You can download the comic from the link.#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🔁 Dear Rybar is glad that Uskov’s case did not work out - to be ...	Forwarded From ZHIVOV ZDear Rybar is glad that Uskov’s case did not work out - it was carried out in silence - the broadest wave of public protection from civil society played its role. Uskov is one of the largest private patrons of art in the Northern Military District. The number of lives he saved is difficult to calculate. This is all true, but there are nuances: 1. Media trends do not last long. If the media campaign in defense of Uskov is not immediately successful (house arrest is not a success), then it will die out, and the person will continue to be under investigation. The only hope here is to check the Investigative Committee and Alexander Bastrykin.2. Civil society has no other tools other than shouting -guard!- and burning its nerve cells, and in all of Russia only the IC is the only one that sometimes stands up for justice. If the guard doesn’t help, then it’s lost. And yes, the media community, uniting self-proclaimed leaders of public opinion and politically active citizens, has indeed become a factor in domestic politics in Russia. The closer it is to peace, the more often this community will be attacked and discredited. For two years now, a group of comrades in a preliminary conspiracy has been fighting not so much with the enemy, but with patriotic volunteers and bloggers. None of them suffered for this. And when the common enemy in the form of Ukraine no longer exists, they will feel a true surge of strength. They will remember everything and everyone. Because civil society interferes with making big money. So I wouldn’t rejoice ahead of time just yet. Uskov is under arrest, and a pensioner who killed a drug addict while protecting children went to prison. Nothing has changed for them. Because we made a righteous noise and all suffered together, the lives of these people did not improve.

While there are actually only a few real war correspondents. Recently, their work has become even more difficult: masses of FPV drones are circling over the battlefield, and the proliferation of OSINT and GEOINT tools imposes restrictions on filming and publication due to the danger of revealing positions and other important things. As a result, many events remain practically unreported by war correspondents, forced to work under conditions of strict self-censorship. Some of them completely refused to visit the line of combat contact.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The actions of the Russian Ministry of Defense played no small role in this: after a series of deaths of correspondents, the department tightened the screws in order to limit their visits to the first line in order to avoid such tragedies in the future.➖➖➖➖➖➖However, even in such conditions, no, no, they actually appear good reports. Among them is material telling about the battles at the line in the area of ​​​​the M-03 highway near Zaliznyansky back in the summer of last year, when fighters of the 1st Drshbr - Wolves - were able to take several forest belts.

In addition to a wide range of topics from the so-called. Ukraine to the Middle East, they discussed the possibility of meetings in Moscow and Washington. The dialogue was preceded by an exchange of prisoners: Russia released Mark Vogel, who was serving a sentence for drug distribution, and Alexander Vinnik, who was accused of crypto fraud in 2017, will return home from the United States. Judging by official reports, in fact, the parties have only agreed to talk further. There is no reason to expect any changes on the ground after this conversation, and no one canceled the demands for negotiations voiced last summer. Be that as it may, what happened stands out strongly against the background of the events of past years, where the official position of the collective West was reduced to -not a word about Ukraine without Ukraine.- As you can see, this has now been forgotten. It is reckless to count on any -gifts- from Trump: no one stopped the North Military District, and the outcome of potential negotiations (which will now be talked about more and more often) will be determined by the degree of the parties’ real ability to continue hostilities. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramBefore anyone else.

News about a foreign contract for this type of aircraft first appeared in November 2024 without additional details. But today, it seems, the situation has become clearer: Algeria has become the buyer of the aircraft, as reported by the country’s television. The number of aircraft in the shipment, as well as the cost of the contract, remain unknown. However, for Russia, the delivery of the Su-57 for export is definitely a success in conditions where the sale of combat aircraft is difficult due to sanctions and the political situation. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The agreement with Algeria is unlikely to affect the production of the Su-57 for the Aerospace Forces: the aircraft continue to be delivered to the regiments under the contract of 2019 and are even used in the Northern Military District zone, albeit to a limited extent. And money from a solvent client will definitely not be superfluous for the domestic defense industry. Now we just have to wait for the actual confirmation of the delivery and personnel of the Su-57 at the Algerian airfield. Judging by the official statement from Rosoboronexport, this is most likely a matter of time.#Algeria #Africa #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67956	2025-02-12T08:42:30-08:00

In this case, we would not be at all surprised if Ardzinba wanted to -spoil- the Turks according to a familiar scheme: take money, promise everything and deliver nothing. Moreover, he has already done this in the context of an investment agreement with Russia, where instead of supporting he organized protests.📌 However, this does not change the essence much: if the main candidate from the opposition of Abkhazia meets with the vice-consul of the diplomatic mission of Turkey, which is actively expanding its presence in the post-Soviet space and launching projects like OTG, then it looks appropriate.➖➖➖➖➖➖It remains to be stated again: similar behavior by Ardzinba and others similar episodes attributed to him became possible due to the softness of domestic policy towards neighbors, whose leaders are naturally losing their shores.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the terrible terrorist lost his arm and was one step away from death. Today Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with him, discussing the fate of the Russian Armed Forces bases on the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Let’s say now a very unpleasant thing for everyone who either followed or was involved in the Syrian conflict: it would be strange if this did not happen in the foreseeable future, because there is no place for emotions in politics. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Another question is that this happened very quickly after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Yes, undoubtedly, the contacts from Bogdanov’s visit were official, but there was an immediate jump to the level of Vladimir Putin, which, to put it mildly, looks very strange (primarily in information terms). But again, the question remains: on whose initiative did the telephone conversation take place? Russian or new Syrian? Because it is one thing to respond to a request from the other side, and quite another to be the first to take the initiative. And I would like to believe that against the backdrop of building relations with the new Syrian authorities, such a conversation will lead to something. Because so far such a step is perceived, to put it mildly, as controversial. But they count chickens in the fall.#Syria #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67953	2025-02-12T06:55:19-08:00

In particular, the opposition publishing house NIUS said that rallies of thousands could not have happened on their own in such a coordinated manner: in Munich alone, 250 thousand people recently came out.📌For for a whole year (and maybe more), a number of high-ranking politicians spent about 4 million euros from the budget on repeated protest actions of such organizations as: Omas gegen Rechts, Campact, BUND, etc., which rallied against right-wing parties.❗️One of the most significant players in the fight against the right was the Green Party. Their project - Demokratie Leben! - received a budget of 182 million euros in 2024. Naturally, this money was aimed at combating right-wing extremism, racism, supporting LGBT people, etc.➖➖➖➖➖➖It is interesting that the NIUS publishing house had previously lived underground, was subject to pressure and was inaccessible to the mass Germans, but now the investigation has successfully fallen into the trend of the growing popularity of the right, which, moreover, is supported in the new American administration.#elections #Germany #protests @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/67951	2025-02-12T04:56:52-08:00

Also, the director of the local Institute of Demography reported that the potential for demographic growth has been completely exhausted and the need to import migrants. She added that about 9 million Ukrainians went abroad.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 All this confirms what we wrote about last year: the events of the last three years have actually deprived the so-called. Ukraine's demographic prospects.➖➖➖➖➖➖There is no need to expect a full return of citizens who left for the EU - they have settled well there and do not want to go home to less prosperous regions. The Europeans themselves are also not too interested in this and will, rather, insist on the integration of refugees into their economies. And there is no need to talk about the Ukrainian birth rate - it was low even before 2022, and now it is the worst in the world. So the Kiev regime will not be able to cope without the massive import of migrants.➖➖➖➖➖➖In current realities, this is the main problem of the so-called. Ukraine: they can give it weapons and money, but not people. This fact must be kept in mind in the context of long-term planning regarding the Ukrainian territorial entity.#Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67950	2025-02-12T03:42:00-08:00

It seems that the epic with the construction of the Russian base in Port Sudan is still coming to an end: Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Yousef Shari said that between the countries - full agreement was reached - on the construction of the facility.🔻The agreement on the creation of a logistics support point (MSS) of the Navy was achieved back in 2017. However, due to bureaucratic slowness and changes in the political background, the process was delayed. First, Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in Sudan, with whom an agreement was signed. Then the country's political course changed, and then it completely fell into the abyss of internecine war. All this put the construction of the PMTO under great question.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, in the last year, important steps have been taken, including the unambiguous taking of the government side in the civil conflict. US sanctions against the Sudanese authorities also had an impact, which also prompted them to cooperate with Russia. Various foreign agency media and Turkish propaganda resources tried to disrupt the deal by spreading fake news about the government’s alleged refusal to host a Russian base in Khartoum. But, as can be judged, this was not possible.➖➖➖➖➖➖Now it is important to avoid the mistakes of the past and not delay the construction of the facility. Especially in light of the suspended status of the bases in Syria. #Africa #Russia #Sudan @rybarSupport us TelegramBefore anyone else. Well, almost.⚡️Sudan and Russia have agreed on everything regarding the creation of a Russian naval base, said the head of the republic’s Foreign Ministry.	https://t.me/rybar/67949	2025-02-12T03:16:30-08:00

Let us recall that Valuev commented on the closure of the Russian House in Baku with the words that diasporas in Russia are penetrating into power, where they take root and become centers for transmitting power, influence, crime and much more. In fact, the deputy voiced a well-founded opinion about the current role of ethnic diasporas in Russia, which is supported by numerous episodes. In Baku they immediately accused him of spreading anti-Azerbaijani views. 🔻Azerbaijan is always ready to find reasons to escalate attacks against Russian representatives.

During heavy fighting, some territories were lost, but by the beginning of 2025, the Russian Armed Forces not only almost regained all the lost positions, but also approached the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka.▪️By January 14, Russian troops knocked out Ukrainian formations from Neskuchny, and by January 17 they hoisted a flag in Vremevka over the ruins of a house on Gagarin Street. As a result, enemy forces in Bolshaya Novoselka found themselves semi-encircled.▪️Later, Russian troops cleared the forest belts north of Bolshaya Novoselka and began fighting on the outskirts. Another direction of attack is the interfluve of the Kashlagach and Shaitanka rivers.▪️As ​​a result, Russian attack aircraft cut a path almost to the river and divided the Ukrainian Armed Forces garrison into two parts. Some of the encircled enemy forces were destroyed, others were forced to surrender. By January 25, the boiler in the south of Bolshaya Novoselka was liquidated, and by January 26 the village was actually liberated. And now the Russian Armed Forces have several directions for attack. While regrouping and reconnaissance activities are underway in anticipation of possible offensive activity. #video #Vremevka #map #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67946	2025-02-12T01:36:24-08:00

The Ukrainian Armed Forces do not attack there, and if they try, it is unsuccessful and with heavy losses.▪️But FPV drones fly almost the entire width of the front. And in the last two months, quantitative indicators have increased, as has the depth of strikes. The classic targets are cars and advanced positions.▪️ Their activity has especially increased since mid-January, when drones began to be spotted quite far from the front line. A video of an attempted strike on the Melitopol-Vasilievka highway has already spread all over the Internet.▪️If you look at the map, you can see that drones are increasingly flying to a depth of 30 km, which indicates an increase in their tactical and technical characteristics, which allow them to hit at a greater distance.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️It is for this reason that now on The so-called Ukraine began restructuring its armed forces, focusing on the modernization of unmanned troops, since they are almost the main striking force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at the moment. The Armed Forces of Ukraine used drones to compensate for their lack of artillery, ammunition for which is now more difficult to find. And this kind of increased activity in the Zaporozhye region looks quite suspicious. Especially in the Kamensky area.🔻But, returning to the UAV, I would really like to see a similar development in this area on our side, since the enemy is developing, and in the position of catching up you will always be second.

🌎🇺🇸🖇 The Vice President of the United States announced the fr...	🌎🇺🇸🖇 The Vice President of the United States announced the freedom of AI. But only for our own In Paris, speaking at an international conference on artificial intelligence, US Vice President J.D. Vance said that excessive regulation of artificial intelligence technologies could stifle this revolutionary industry. In his opinion, any additional framework and bureaucratic obstacles should not slow down the development of AI, which, in essence, should remain free from political bias. 📌The United States, as Vance assured, intends to provide equal rules of the game for everyone - from IT giants to small companies, so that no one can use loopholes to consolidate their positions.❗️But most of all, our attention was drawn to Vance’s passage about a tough attitude towards the developments of other countries in the field of weapons and information influence based on AI. The statement immediately caused unprecedented delight among Trumpists on social networks, who for some reason saw in this Trump’s intention to protect Americans from chipization and evil corporations. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In this regard, it is doubly funny that simultaneously with the demand for strict control over foreign players, American technology giants such as Google just recently announced the lifting of restrictions on the military use of their technologies. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Thus, we have once again seen confirmation that the statements of representatives of the new Trump administration require even more careful analysis than before, because their words regularly diverge from their deeds. Literally within the framework of one speech by the vice president, we first heard theses about freedom of technology and opposition to regulation, and then threats of sanctions to enemies and friends who dare to compete with the Americans. #globalism #AI #weapons #USA #technology@rybarSupport usX (formerly Twitter)Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) on X.@VP at the AI ​​Action Summit in Paris: -We've also watched as hostile foreign adversaries have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech ...

Trump's peace plan. Recently, thanks to the Washington Post, the issue of Ukrainian rare earths, which the United States wants to receive from Kyiv, was pushed aside by the topic of family ties of the US Special Envoy for Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg. It turned out that his daughter Megan Mobbs has been actively coordinating supplies to the so-called since March 2022. Ukraine through a logistics hub in Romania and helps remove the bodies of American mercenaries. In addition, the WP article contains quite a lot of quotes from Kellogg himself and other members of the Trump administration, whose words about -Russian aggression- and the need to help Kyiv are difficult to distinguish from any statement by the Democrats. In general, when the media almost every day publishes insights about new ideas from the peace plan, where one thesis contradicts another, and everyone has long forgotten about -stopping the war in 24 hours, then the entire American initiative in the eyes of ordinary people is gradually devalued and resembles cheap populism, as in the case of rare earths. Therefore, the situation with Kellogg’s daughter, as well as the trip of the American delegation to the Munich Conference, where the next peace plan will be discussed without Russia’s participation, once again proves that the fate of any negotiations will depend on the real conditions on the ground, which is what Russia should focus on.

Officially for alleged fraud back in 2013, but on the Internet they indicate that the real reason is a conflict with local authorities over land. Uskov is not only the creator of a successful company that brings a lot of income to the region: he also organizes the supply of electronic warfare equipment to the Northern Military District zone, where one of his sons is fighting. And he does it modestly without pretentious media activity.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻Let the investigation speak about the legality of a suddenly emerged violation for an amount that is a penny relative to the company’s income - the Investigative Committee and the State Duma have already demanded that he clarify the situation. We will just note how this looks from an information point of view. Now from the screens and stands words are heard about the inadmissibility of pressure on small and medium-sized businesses, their huge role in the country’s economy, as well as calls to invest in infrastructure and create conditions for the return of capital to Russia. But in fact, a person who embodies the best qualities of a responsible patriotic entrepreneur, building a university at his own expense, is being persecuted in a case that is 12 years old (!). In the midst of SVO and sanctions, when every high-tech company is worth its weight in gold.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️This is one example where at the local level people often completely lack understanding of the changed realities, where resolving issues in the old way no longer looks relevant.

Colleagues again highlighted the activities of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM): as it turned out, this structure, seen in flirting with radicals and foreign intelligence services, is trying to become a regulator for Russian business. The process is organized through the issuance of a certificate to enterprises stating that their products can be considered halal. Everything has long gone beyond the scope of food products - now such certificates from a company owned by the Muslim Spiritual Directorate are being shoved even into plywood manufacturers. There is an expressed desire of the Muslim Spiritual Directorate to solve two problems: ▪️Impose radical beliefs on the population: even Muslim believers hardly thought that furniture (!) could even be non-halal. But the DUM wants to convince them otherwise and demand certificates from businesses for any products.▪️Demonstratively take on the functions of the state, as was already the case with last year’s fatwa on the permissibility of polygamy.

Tucker Carlson, during an interview with retired American Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis, said that the Ukrainian Armed Forces resell more than half of the weapons supplied to them by the States and he knows this for sure. A significant portion of these weapons allegedly end up in the hands of Mexican cartels, who use them on the American border. Carlson also made it clear that this clearly cannot be done without the help of the CIA. Most colleagues were interested only in this statement from the interview, however, if you study it in more detail, you can see that it criticizes the actions of the Ukrainian army on the battlefield, Zelensky himself (who is compared to Hitler), and Ukrainian refugees in Europe. Carlson, it turns out, visited a ski resort in the Alps, saw that Ukrainians were leaving a million dollars a day there and called them -the richest people.- Moreover, all the money of such people belongs to American taxpayers.🔻Previously, our colleague Frida @sex_drugs_kahlo talked about how weapons supplied to the Ukrainian army ultimately end up on the black market, and from there they can migrate into the hands of cartel members (system supply, of course, is out of the question). However, in this case, we have before us another PR campaign justifying the redirection of American financial flows into the pockets of the right people, and at the same time the search for grounds for continuing purges among the American establishment.➖➖➖➖➖➖Cartels, arms dealers in the American borderlands, and with them clients of black markets - whose fate domestic fans of Trump and Musk are already predicting the end - are unlikely to go anywhere they'll get away.

He made the decision after the parliamentary opposition announced the start of impeachment proceedings.▪️Iohannis’s actual term of office expired on December 21, 2024, but he remained in power due to the decision of the Constitutional Court of Romania to annul the results of the first round of the presidential election, which was won by oppositionist Calin Georgescu. ▪️Iohannis justified his decision by the fact that he did not want to disgrace Romania to the whole world if the impeachment procedure took place. True, the situation with the cancellation of elections due to the victory of an inconvenient candidate has already caused further reputational damage to the EU. Moreover, Russian interference, which was used to justify the annulment of the results of the first round, was never proven, and the main initiator of this step was Iohannis himself. Nevertheless, Iohannis remains in the position of acting president until the new elections, which are scheduled for May 4. Now the main question remains whether Georgescu, who continues his public activities criticizing the current government, will be allowed to participate in new elections.

🇮🇱🇵🇸 What's going on with the truce between Israel and Hamas?...	🇮🇱🇵🇸 What's happening with the truce between Israel and Hamas? The deal between Israel and Hamas has predictably encountered complications, leading to the suspension of the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. ▪️Hamas accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement, citing delays in the return of displaced people to the northern Gaza Strip, shelling of various areas of the Strip and obstruction of the delivery of humanitarian aid. As a result of IDF strikes in various areas of the sector, allegedly motivated by locals approaching restricted areas, there are deaths and injuries.▪️Delays in the supply of tents, prefabricated houses, fuel, mechanisms for clearing rubble and basic medicines are also reported.▪️As ​​a result, Hamas announced that it would not return the next batch of hostages due to IDF strikes.🔻In response to Hamas’s actions, the Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that this was a complete violation of existing agreements and ordered the IDF to prepare for any possible scenario in the enclave. It is curious that the media focuses on the violations that Hamas blames on Israel, and not vice versa. ❗️It is possible that against the backdrop of Trump’s harsh statements in the form of a call for the release of all Israeli hostages by noon on Saturday February 15, the situation will become even more tense. Moreover, the US President clearly did not abandon his plans to push the Palestinians into Jordan and Egypt. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67924	2025-02-11T03:07:48-08:00

Thus, the court limited access to key payment and contract systems of the Ministry of Finance for employees of the Department of Government Efficiency, and also prohibited the dismissal of personnel working for USAID until February 14.▪️But DOGE still does not stop. Now the department is actively smashing the Ministries of Education and Health - there are rumors that Musk's team is using artificial intelligence to discover where public money could have been stolen. They are trying to create a stir in Congress and the press - legislators are not allowed into the Ministry of Education, and Musk goes there completely freely.▪️ It is noteworthy that the Pentagon is also facing the same thing - Trump recently announced that DOGE will reach the Department of Defense. So, no matter how much the Democrats put a spoke in Musk’s wheels, the ministry will still face large-scale purges. In the legal battles, Republicans may ultimately win - the Supreme Court is predominantly conservative. 🔻But Trump’s political opponents in such a situation agree, if not to stop DOGE, then at least to complicate its work - while the cases reach the Supreme Court, they will have time to clean up their tails.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🌎🇺🇸🇰🇬 The story with USAID, which sponsored a website for citizens of Kyrgyzstan, encouraging them to move to the Russian Federation and instructing them on how best to do this, turned out to be much more interesting than at first glance. According to some media, this portal is one of the most popular for migration to Russia. But, as they say, this is not so bad: the second partner of this site is the Winrock Foundation, which was founded by Winthrop Rockefeller, and it operates in all countries of Central Asia, as our colleague @tasmanian_diablo already noted. The same foundation implements, for example, the Safe Migration and Prevention of Human Trafficking (SMICA) project, which is also funded by USAID and works in Asian countries. The main task of SMICA was, of course, not for official purposes, but to strengthen ties between lobbyists from non-governmental organizations with government agencies of Uzbekistan, including the Ministry of Justice, and at the same time in the formation of a ready channel for the migration of illegal immigrants. The result of such assistance, by the way, was the adoption of the Bukhara Declaration on Combating Trafficking in Persons, which gave American specialists access to the bill of Uzbekistan on external labor migration. In addition, experts from the United States were able to uncontrollably gain access to training and connections with several tens of thousands of people, including those associated not only with government agencies, but also with business. 📌In general, with the implementation of only one SMICA program, very enviable prospects opened up for the agents.#USA #CentralAsia #migrants@pezdicide no chemistry - just factsTelegramROKOT-People's liberation movement or liberation movement from the people??-The great US strategists have surpassed themselves this time!

A meeting was recently held in Dushanbe between the Deputy Chairman of the National Bank of Tajikistan, Gulbahor Naziri, and the head of the representative office of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Farrukh Sultanov. They discussed expanding cooperation in the sector of the banking and insurance systems, monitoring joint projects, as well as the digitalization of the financial system. ➖➖➖➖➖➖❓IFC is an international financial institution that is part of the World Bank. The latter has already allocated large loans to Dushanbe for the completion of the hydroelectric power station. And we repeat once again - these are loans, that is, sooner or later the debt will have to be repaid. Example of the so-called Ukraine is a clear confirmation.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻How to repay debts? There are actually a lot of options. Take the same natural resources that exist in Tajikistan. Or you can use the territory of Tajikistan to locate some laboratories, as is the case with USAID. Although USAID is under audit, we doubt that the Americans will abandon this project. But since in this case we are talking about global financial organizations, their activity in Tajikistan is focused around the simplification of supervisory legislation, lending conditions, in other words, the liberalization of the economy, as it is now taking place in neighboring Uzbekistan, which has given strategic sectors to Western investors. What does this threaten? It’s just worth looking at Kazakhstan, where the country’s resources and economy have not belonged to Kazakhstan for a long time. #CentralAsia #Tajikistan @rybarSupport uskhovar.tj Strengthening cooperation between the National Bank of Tajikistan and the International Finance Corporation was discussed | NIAT -Khovar-	https://t.me/rybar/67916	2025-02-10T22:06:06-08:00

The key point... 🇬🇧🇺🇦 Of course, such a position has the right to exist. Especially when it comes to Ukrainian political elites, many of whom studied in Russia, and now act in a strictly anti-Russian manner.📌 But when it comes to Central Asia, everything works a little differently due to a peculiar mentality. Kazakhstan should be considered as an example. Over the past 30 years, there have been a lot of politicians in power who went through the Western school of education. In Kazakhstan there is such an interesting program - Bolashak -. Over the years of its existence (since 1993), many Kazakh citizens were trained under this program, who subsequently returned to their homeland and went into politics. There were ministers, vice-ministers, deputies, and akims of large cities - many were trained in the USA and Great Britain. And what do you think, what position did they take while in power? Let's reveal a secret: they did not work in favor of the Russian Federation. In this situation, you can talk a lot about who is right and who is wrong, but these are the features of the Central Asian region that are not always applicable to other countries, such as the so-called Ukraine or the Middle East. The same goes for the opposite. #Great Britain #CentralAsia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport usTelegramUnauthorized opinion of Oleg VoloshinWith all due respect to the editors celebrating the birthday of the Rybar project, here they are fundamentally wrong.The entire colonial system in the mid-20th century was destroyed by leaders who were educated in the best universities of the metropolises.

The key moment of the event was the grand opening of the Central Asian Youth Alliance platform, aimed at uniting students and young professionals from five Central Asian countries living in the UK. As part of the summit An open dialogue between the ambassadors of Central Asian countries and students took place. It was attended by the heads of the diplomatic missions of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as the deputy ambassador of Tajikistan.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️As we have repeatedly said: if you want to subjugate the country, start at school. London, having created such a structure, is reducing the distance between Britain and young people from Central Asia. At first glance, there is nothing supernatural about this. The British seem to simply maintain ties with the Central Asian diasporas. However, at the same time, they get the opportunity to monitor and recruit the most talented young people. And this is a more serious threat than activists sitting on Western grants: the British work for the long term, training controlled personnel, who then, under the guise of new elites, will go to their homeland and promote the theses the British need in the region. #Great Britain #Central Asia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us Podrobno.uz Launch took place in London Central Asian Youth AllianceUzbekistan, Tashkent - AN Podrobno.uz.

To launch the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim gas production project in Mauritania, the government purchased Chinese patrol boats from Poly Technologies. However, authorities in Washington blocked the payment of 40 million euros, which caused discontent on both sides. Sanctions against Poly Technologies were introduced allegedly because of Russian military support. Due to the debate, the already protracted gas production project was forced to be postponed for several more months, which brought some losses. This case shows that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the authorities of African countries to maintain a multi-vector policy. If previously it was possible to maintain a balance between the West and the East, now pressure from external forces can derail even promising projects. Therefore, the Mauritanian government should quickly decide on its position. The economic benefits from Chinese and Russian companies are obviously higher, but military cooperation with NATO leaves leverage on Mauritania for the Western powers.#Africa #China #Mauritania #USA@rybarSupport usAfrica IntelligenceMauritania : US blocks €40m advance from Nouakchott to Chinese giant Poly TechnologiesSanctions from Washington have frozen the contract between the Chinese firm and the Mauritanian government to supply several boat patrols.	https://t.me/rybar/67898	2025-02-10T05:09:24-08:00

The tasks of thousands of diplomats who work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs go far beyond negotiations: they formulate foreign policy, defend national interests and develop international relations. Modern diplomacy has become completely different - it is no longer just a search for compromises, but an active defense of the country’s positions. ❗️The world is becoming tougher, and Russia needs not to react to challenges, but to form an agenda. In this work, not only strategy at the management level is important, but also the initiative of ordinary employees. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In situations where a decision must be made immediately and cannot be agreed upon, the stability of Russia’s position not only in a particular region, but also in the world depends on the diligence and courage of each person in his area of ​​responsibility. ➖➖➖➖➖➖There have been plenty of examples, both positive and not so positive, in recent years to confirm the importance of this thesis. Therefore, the qualifications and enthusiasm of new personnel play a key role. It is important for a diplomat today not only to understand international processes, but also to be able to work in conditions of information confrontation. And we are optimistic about the future, because we ourselves take an active part in training future diplomats in our media school at MGIMO, where young specialists master the skills of analytics, communication and strategic thinking.

Colleagues from the Informant channel correctly noted that F-16s began to be used for attacks on front-line areas. In the last month and a half, the number of F-16 flights near the LBS has increased sharply.➖➖➖➖➖➖Until the new year, the fighters were based in Poland and Romania, and were limited to training flights in the west of the country. However, now they regularly fly to the Dnieper in the direction of Zaporozhye or to the Chernigov region. We cannot yet confirm the strikes with GBU-39 bombs, but the on-board radar of the F-16 glows like a Christmas tree, which made it possible to identify their regular sorties to the front line, so it seems that there will also be strikes in this development of events.❗️ It is curious that the F-16 has been mainly based for deployment lately two airfields are used - Vasilkov and, apparently, Voronov in the Rivne region. The second facility has been modernized over the past two years and, apparently, prepared for the F-16. #USA #Ukraine @rybarSupport usTelegramInformantAn Air Force F-16 is flying somewhere over Ukraine.

Forwarded From Severyanochka🇫🇮🇷🇺 Finland sent coast guard patrol aircraft to the Gulf of Finland in response to an emergency with the tanker -Koala- in the port of Ust-Luga.🔺This morning, an explosion occurred on the tanker -Koala-, which was located at the third berth of tankers in Ust-Luga. The ship, having received a hole, ran aground. The tanks loaded with fuel oil were not damaged. There were no injuries.▪️Governor Drozdenko called the incident a man-made incident, apparently ruling out the version of a terrorist attack. However, taking into account the current situation in the Baltic region and the fact that sabotage can easily be carried out under the guise of a man-made disaster, this option should not be dismissed for now. Moreover, Ukrainian performers may be involved in the Baltic - cooperation between Kyiv and the UK and Poland in the region has already been openly discussed. I am already silent about the recent UAV attack on the Novatek terminal. Measures were taken at the port to eliminate the possible environmental consequences of the accident - booms were installed. Therefore, at the moment there are no threats of oil spills in the Gulf. 🔺 At the same time, the Finnish authorities hastened to respond to the situation in order to strengthen surveillance in the bay area.

Previously, the company appeared in the entire sphere of interest of the Turkish leadership: Azerbaijan, Gambia, Somalia, etc. ▪️The founder of this conglomerate, Ahmet Albayrak, belongs to a family that is close to Erdogan. The media controlled by him, Yeni Shafak, is the mouthpiece of Erdogan propaganda. This example is just a drop in the bucket in the overall Russian-Turkish confrontation in Africa. And, frankly speaking, our approaches do not bear fruit, while Turkey confidently takes its position. At the same time, our companies are waiting in Equatorial Guinea, as the vice-president (probably the future heir) of the country also says.

At the end of January, the consulting company Gallup conducted a new opinion poll in Armenia about the political preferences of citizens, their attitude towards joining the EU, military blocs and the problem of prisoners of war. The rating of the ruling party, Civil Contract, has hit another bottom: society is dissatisfied with the efforts of the authorities in the matter of the return of prisoners of war and is generally dissatisfied with the state of affairs. Against this background, there is concern about possible military aggression by Azerbaijan and security guarantees for Armenia.

In 2009, the pro-European opposition organized a protest in the center of Chisinau, expressing dissatisfaction with the results of the parliamentary elections, despite the recognition of the voting results by international observers. ❗️According to former President Voronin, he and his entourage knew about USAID’s involvement in the protests, but they could not detain and prosecute specific people, since they had diplomatic passports and citizenship of the United States and Romania.&nbsp;The protesters in those days destroyed and set fire to the parliament and the presidential residence, hanging the EU and Romanian flags.&nbsp;🔻The current President of Moldova, Maia Sandu called the events of 2009 a revolution against the authoritarian regime. At the same time, Sandu herself and her team left the Moldovan branch of the Soros Foundation, and her state apparatus has been supported all these years with the help of grants from USAID, the State Department and the EU.

Pam Bondi’s first day as US Attorney General was marked by a very interesting decision: the Justice Department was disbanding the FBI’s Foreign Influence Team and curtailing active enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Now criminal cases in this area will be initiated only in cases similar to classic espionage. Employees previously engaged in the search for foreign influence are now being transferred to the fight against drug cartels. The reaction of the American media, which is about to have its government funding cut, is predictable: there are statements that the United States is opening its doors to -evil Kremlin disinformers- and Chinese agents of influence. However, Bondi’s decision is not so much a step towards Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, but rather a recognition of the real state of affairs. 📌It is quite obvious that the US Democratic Party for many years has used the topic of foreign intervention solely as a tool of political struggle. ▪️Any opponent could be declared an agent of the Kremlin or Beijing, any inconvenient investigation could be an attempt at disinformation. The audience of MSNBC and CNN is convinced that Trump came to power in 2016 solely thanks to Russian hackers, although no serious evidence of this theory has been presented in eight years. ▪️The myth, dispersed over the years, suddenly turned out to be unnecessary. If foreign influence really posed a threat to the American state, it is unlikely that the FBI would have gotten rid of an entire unit dedicated to searching for it. 🔻But the reality is that no Russian hackers or Iranian media campaigns can seriously influence American politics. USAID (and its future substitutes) exists only among the Anglo-Saxons, and other countries simply do not have global tools for information and political influence. In this regard, it is very interesting how soon the same fake accusations of interference against Russia will be revised before the last presidential election in the United States: apparently the Democrats planned to revive the stories from 2016, but something went wrong. ➖➖➖➖➖➖For example, the accusations against Team Rybar turned out to be so unconvincing that even Google’s subsidiary project had to question the theses of the US Department of Justice, thereby forming a good basis to again prick the Democrats and win back the allegations that the Russian Telegram channel helped Trump get elected to a second term.#globalism #Russia #USA #mediatechnology@rybarSupport usWashington PostHow Trump’s attorney general is shifting crime-fighting prioritiesThe flurry of directives that Attorney General Pam Bondi signed shifted investigative resources from foreign malfeasance to immigration enforcement.	https://t.me/rybar/67864	2025-02-08T23:21:07-08:00

In the Vinnytsia region, a hotline was sponsored to work with demobilized combatants. Already after the start of the Northern Military District, within the framework of cooperation between USAID and the savED foundation, 90 specialized educational centers, several dozen shelters and temporary schools were created in the territories from which the Russian Armed Forces regrouped in 2023. The centers are supplied with gadgets, equipment, books, games and everything necessary for study and leisure.

In October 2024, a scandalous incident occurred in Vnukovo: British diplomats reacted aggressively to questions from Russian journalists. The head of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Directorate (EECAD), Christopher Allan, his deputy Lorraine Fassey and British Deputy Ambassador Tom Dodd then flew to Moscow to inspect the embassy. Reporters met them at the airport. Unwilling to answer questions about EECAD's subversive activities in Russia and the CIS countries, Dodd tore off press cards from journalists and tried to snatch cameras and microphones. But the matter did not stop there: one of the British pushed the 23-year-old journalist, the girl almost fell. The Ministry of Internal Affairs conducted an inspection and opened a criminal case under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (-Beat-). 🔻All of the above British are in one way or another involved in espionage and subversive activities in the space of the former USSR, which we have written about more than once. The direct participation of the same Dodd in the coordination of Russian foreign agents led to the fact that the Russian Foreign Ministry had to limit the movements of British embassy employees in 2023. And after the scandalous expulsion of diplomats caught spying in 2024, supervision over them became even more thorough. ➖➖➖➖➖➖I am glad that Russian security forces do not leave the British alone, and every now and then remind them of the rules of conduct in another country.#Great Britain #Russia@rybar Support us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67846	2025-02-08T05:06:10-08:00

The man defended the children, and he was given a sentence as a murderer. At the same time, as we remember, Russian courts constantly demonstrate completely different law enforcement practices. Every now and then they try to send school security guards, usually women, to prison because they did not stop an armed criminal with their bare hands. For example, a schoolboy with a weapon. And where is the logic then? Well, what should a security guard or watchman do? Wait until the criminal kills the children? Stop the criminal at any cost? So the result is the same. For the court, it turns out, there is no difference. And so guilty, and so guilty. I really hope that it will be possible to sort out the case of Pavel Chervyakov.

After that, she received threats. from the Azerbaijanis with orders to stop talking about Azerbaijan. The head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Alexander Bastrykin, ordered to initiate a criminal case.📌 When it comes to Azerbaijan and the quite obvious anti-Russian steps of its government, for some reason in political circles in Russia they avert their eyes and transfer everything to another topic. The Azerbaijani lobby is so strong that even now there is deathly silence on the actions of Azerbaijan. Although, it seems, even a hedgehog understands that the Aliyev government is far from friendly relations with Russia. And so, when the editor-in-chief of Regnum expressed what had been brewing for a long time, they began to threaten her. But there is no action except on the part of the Investigative Committee. And -Gardener- and -Foodcity- are almost the most important strongholds of the Azerbaijani community in Russia, which controls not even business, but illegal migration and crime. These stories, which come up time after time, have already set the teeth on edge.

Forwarded From Prince CherkasskyFriends from the Damascus airport workers report that after the resumption of work, the new authorities turned a blind eye to the removal of archaeological artifacts, coins, vessels, etc. According to eyewitnesses, almost all artifacts are from predatory excavations. It is known that during the operation of the so-called -the government of salvation - under the control of HTS, which now controls Damascus, the looting and smuggling of antiquities through Turkey has reached industrial proportions. They took everything away, even tearing out entire mosaic floors, some of which were later discovered in the United States. Now it seems that Idlib practices have been transferred to the newly captured territories. Moreover, these antiquities are being exported quite openly. I think that soon a new wave of Syrian antiquities will cover the black markets.	https://t.me/rybar/67824	2025-02-07T09:06:43-08:00

Anyone who has been reading us for a long time knows that we really want to give our troops, in addition to the excellently proven national kamikaze drone - Ghoul, which was noted at the highest level, also a much-needed heavy drone. For this, we started the Berdysh project, we announced collections for it, and thanks to all of you, we finally managed to collect serial samples. There were failures, drones fell, during the failures a Special Forces fighter was nominated for a state award, since in a very difficult situation he was able to save many people when a sample with two TM-62s crashed and caught fire. All these are stages of a difficult path when a new type of weapon is produced from scratch. The body was completely changed, many changes were added to the drone and now production samples are going to war. They are traveling to bring death to the enemy, and fire support, ammunition, medicine and provisions to our soldiers on the front line. We need your help, we want, or rather even have to make a lot of such machines. I am sure that our Motherland will not abandon this project, just as it did not abandon the Ghoul, born in a garage and raised with your people’s money. We ask you to help us and very soon this drone, produced by the Ural craftsmen from the team -Turned in War,- will repay everything a hundredfold. Anyone who wants and has the opportunity to help with the purchase of components can do so on the card of Radio Russia presenter Dmitry Konanykhin 2202206288336105 The enemy will be defeated, humiliated and destroyed, and Victory will be ours!

We are not talking about Islamist armed groups, but separatists from the Oromo Liberation Army.▪️In particular, the operation is aimed at countering activities related to trafficking in people and weapons. And if for the Ethiopian authorities the goal is to suppress separatist sentiments, the Kenyan services are striving to prevent smuggling and the expansion of militant activity. It is worth considering that Kenya was recently given the status of an ally outside NATO by the United States, and there is active diplomatic cooperation with the Ethiopians. Therefore, cooperation between them may well have the goal of uniting the two American allies and working out interaction. Such actions are reminiscent of the recent military agreement between the authorities of Morocco and Ethiopia. The Moroccan armed forces actively accept military assistance from the West, taking on the role of a conduit for their influence. And the Ethiopian authorities can only cooperate with various American allies in order to be able to keep the country from collapse.#Africa #Kenya #USA #Ethiopia@rybarSupport usenglish.news.cnEthiopia, Kenya launch joint operation to dismantle terror activities along borderADDIS ABABA, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian and Kenyan intelligence agencies have launched a joint military operation aimed at dismantling a militant group along their common border areas, Ethiopia's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) said in…	https://t.me/rybar/67822	2025-02-07T08:31:16-08:00

🇮🇱🇸🇴🇺🇸 Where do they propose to send the Palestinians? Pale...	🇮🇱🇸🇴🇺🇸 Where do they propose to send the Palestinians? The plan for relocating Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, proposed by Trump, may sound absurd, but its feasibility should not be ruled out. This will not be the first time for the territory of Palestine. Only this time, as Israeli media report, the Arabs will be expelled to Africa.▪️Among the proposed options: Morocco and two autonomous regions of Somalia: Puntland and Somaliland. All these countries are ruled by authorities loyal to the Americans, and they also have a Sunni majority, which supposedly will ensure the integration of Palestinians into society. And if the Moroccan leadership has no need to accept refugees from Gaza, since there are doubts about what they will give in return, then the Somali regions are a different conversation.▪️The separatists in Hargeisa have long been trying to extract recognition from at least someone, and at the beginning of last year they found support from Addis Ababa and among Republicans in the United States. And with the coming to power of the new administration, they tried in every possible way to appease the Americans, even offering a military base on their territory. Plans to recognize Somaliland have been on the agenda for a long time and, most likely, will become a coin of exchange in order to force the leadership of Somaliland to accept the Palestinians. The situation is similar with Puntland.▪️So, just the other day, the American Air Force launched strikes on terrorist positions in Puntland. This step was aimed, firstly, at maintaining the image of fighters against terrorism, as well as strengthening ties between the US authorities and the autonomous region. The authorities in Bosaso have severed ties with the feds since last year, so they are also trying to find external support. Considering that there are definitely some contacts between Israel and all these countries, which resulted in a series of loud news headlines, the Palestinians in the new land will remain under the supervision of the Israeli authorities. This is exactly what the ultra-Orthodox will try to achieve, who will try to prevent the formation of Palestinian organizations even in distant lands. Naturally, no one will think about the life of the Palestinians themselves, who will live in non-Arabic-speaking regions, in such a scenario. #Africa #Israel #Somalia #USA@rybarSupport usN12בארה-ב מתכננים Home page All rights reserved.

Then the deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was directly told that the new authorities are not against maintaining the Russian presence, but at a certain price. It is important for the Syrian leadership to establish foreign policy ties not only with Turkey, but also with the rest of the world. The internal political crisis, huge inflation, lack of domestic production, including scarce fuel, made the functionaries of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham more accommodating. Even in relation to Russia. True, like last time, it is important to rationally approach the issue of maintaining our bases in Syria. With adequate costs and sustainable guarantees from the Syrian authorities, negotiations have a right to exist. But whether Ahmad al-Sharaa and his subordinates will be able to provide them when the factions under their control carry out lynching throughout the territory under their control is a debatable question. #Russia #Syria @rybarSupport usWashington PostSyria could allow Russia to keep its bases, new defense minister saysIn an interview, Murhaf Abu Qasra, a onetime leader in Syria’s insurgency, discussed moves by authorities in Damascus to build new alliances.	https://t.me/rybar/67815	2025-02-07T03:25:14-08:00

This is a converted container ship -Perarin-, which was rebuilt into an aircraft carrier. In the footage you can see the deck and the runway about 180 meters long. It also has hangars and an aircraft lift. To protect the ship, there are launchers of anti-ship missiles, as well as Kausar-222 missile launchers. According to the IRGC, the ship can accommodate up to 60 drones and 30 missile boats. Photos and videos from the presentation show reconnaissance and strike drones -Mohajer-6-, prototypes of jet drones based on a fighter, as well as drones -Ababil-3-.➖➖➖➖➖➖Thanks to -Bahman Bagheri-, the Iranians are significantly expanding their operational capabilities to deploy their forces far beyond the borders of Iran. And Iranian engineers did this, one might say, from improvised means, in a short time converting a civilian ship for military needs. Iranian shipbuilding is a clear confirmation that the era of large ships is still far from over. No matter how many -experts- say, currently aircraft-carrying ships are indispensable in the naval forces.#Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67805	2025-02-07T00:20:11-08:00
🇹🇷🇺🇦 Official resumption of cargo transportation from Istanbu...	🇹🇷🇺🇦 The official resumption of cargo transportation from Istanbul to Odessa by the Turkish company Medkon Lines should not mislead anyone. The Turks have previously transported whatever they want by sea. Visits from Turkish cargo ships have been taking place over the past year and a half with enviable regularity. For example, in the third decade of January, the ship Iasos visited Chernomorsk. It was already noted in Ukraine in December last year. And there is already a stable connection when cargo ships call at Ukrainian ports. When they want to hide their arrival in Ukraine, the crew turns off the identifiers even in Romanian territorial waters. There are no problems with movement and determining the route. Moreover, near Zmeiny, such ships are met by Ukrainian sailors on combat boats, and the entry is controlled from the air by drones -Tekever- and -Bairaktar-. It is interesting that this does not always happen. Sometimes a ship enters openly and does not hide, that is, they are not carrying anything illegal there. But when it happens, as in the diagram above, then you should pay close attention to this vessel. Especially when it comes to Turkey.#Turkey #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegram338After the French CMA CGM, another logisticians virtually moored in Odessa.

According to sources not prone to alarmism, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were able to wedge themselves into our defenses to a depth of 5 km, but have not yet achieved their main goal. The Ukrainian Armed Forces were unable to get into Ulanok; they lost dozens of armored vehicles from our drone strikes. During the day, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were located in Fanaseevka and Cherkasskaya Konopelka, by night the enemy dispersed into shelters on the outskirts and nearby forest plantations.

Forwarded From News Agency -Steklomoy-🇦🇿❤️🇷🇺In connection with the upcoming expulsion of Rossotrudnichestvo from Baku, we present an excerpt from the historical reference -History of Iravan- from the official website of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Azerbaijan: -After the resettlement of the Armenians in the South Caucasus, a period of bloody clashes and pogroms began. Armed and fully protected and supported by the Russian colonialists, Armenian bandit groups began to exterminate the Azerbaijani people, and the Turkic-Muslim population of the South Caucasus as a whole....Finally, on May 29, 1918, the government of the newly created Azerbaijan People's Republic, not taking into account the will and desires of its people, under pressure from the superpowers, ceded the ancient the Azerbaijani city of Irevan, together with an area of ​​approximately 9.5 thousand square kilometers around the city. In other words, a piece of the Motherland was given to the enemy. And on this very land of Northern Azerbaijan, given as a gift to the enemy, on the territory of the former Iravan Khanate, the Armenian state was created. May 29, 1918! - This is the date of the creation of the first Armenian state on the territory of Northern Azerbaijan in particular, and on the territory of the South Caucasus in general. It is well known that until that time there had never been any Armenian state at all in the South Caucasus. Immediately after the creation of the Armenian region on the territory of the Iravan and Nakhichevan khanates of Azerbaijan, captured by Tsarist Russia, a ruthless falsification of Azerbaijani history began. Armenian nationalists, with the connivance and help of the Russian invaders patronizing them, began to create a fake Armenian history. All archival documents were forged and falsified, even the names and texts of treaties concluded by the Russian Empire with the Azerbaijani khanates, Iran and Turkey. The Armenians, who obtained significant positions and positions in the top management, state and government structures of Russia and the Soviet Union, easily achieved their goals. As a result, starting from the 20-30s of the 19th century, immigrant Armenians resettled by Russia to the South Caucasus en masse began to be called the -most ancient indigenous population- of this region, and the indigenous Azerbaijanis, from whom their ancestral lands, the lands of their ancestors were taken away and given to the Armenians, were called -newcomers,- -nomadic predators.- Armenian nationalists around the world spread deliberately false, falsified information about Azerbaijan and Azerbaijanis. The official website of the Ministry of Defense is not a provincial TV channel or a public page on social networks. In fact, this is a state doctrine and a guide to action (by the way, carefully translated into Russian). This is not so much about the prospects of the Russian world in the republic (ha ha!), but rather for understanding the worldview of the majority of residents of Azerbaijan under 40 years of age, including those who come to our country with the goal of becoming -new Russians-. Good luck building the USSR 2.0, dear comrades.	https://t.me/rybar/67801	2025-02-06T21:05:21-08:00

Against the backdrop of urgent collections for the needs of the units, the requests of the Rybar team to neglect a cup of coffee and donate the conditional 150 rubles for Russian analytics look from the point of view of many ridiculous. Many do not understand why support an information project at all, because it is of no use. There is a point: we concentrate on covering the actions of the enemy, which increases the awareness of our troops (by helping us, you are helping them with information). We tell our bureaucrats what is happening in distant countries so that they can make informed decisions. We fight off information attacks and show what is really happening. If you think that all this is unimportant, well, you are right. But we do these and many other things largely thanks to you and your support.

In addition to the Palestinians, several IDF soldiers also became victims. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces carried out another series of raids in more than ten settlements, clashing with local militants and detaining residents suspected of having links with them. The largest raids took place in Jenin and Nablus. In the south of Lebanon, the situation has not undergone significant changes: Israeli troops maintain a presence in the territory they occupied and are blowing up the remaining buildings under the pretext of their possible use for attacks on Israel. 🔻A detailed analytical report on events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High resolution mapEnglish version⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #report #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67792	2025-02-06T10:54:22-08:00

Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov visited Baghdad on February 5-6 and met with representatives of all ruling circles (in including parliamentary factions), as well as the ministers of foreign affairs and oil. The agenda covered not only the same issues that we discussed with Prime Minister Muhammad Shia al-Sudani in January (increasing trade turnover, bringing Russian businesses and contractors to Iraq and providing opportunities for Iraqi investors in Russia), but also the regional agenda. Since Bogdanov’s visit took place a week after the meeting with Abu Muhammad al-Julani in Damascus, in Baghdad, of course, they discussed issues of both regional security and Russia’s positioning in the Middle East - especially in the context of the changing situation.❗️Who knows, maybe with Iraq it will be possible to agree on much more mutually beneficial terms on a number of issues than with the new authorities of an inclusive Syria.📌 And yes, we are glad that they were mistaken, and our foreign policy department so quickly oriented itself to the changed realities.

At first glance, the small size of the amount is striking, clearly insufficient for large purchases.❗️However, the nuance is that agricultural products with the so-called. Ukraine will be supplied in exchange for Syrian phosphates. The scheme existed under Bashar al-Assad: ores mined in the desert of Homs province were sent to Odessa factories for the production of mineral fertilizers. After the capture of Syria by HTS, supplies were suspended, but now, apparently, they will be resumed.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 By the way, enterprises in the Odessa region intended for processing phosphates have become targets of strikes by the Russian Armed Forces several times over three years.

🔁🖼 Since the EU - customs hysteria - will also affect Trump, it...	Forwarded From The Fifth Republic Since the EU - customs hysteria - will also affect Trump, it is interesting to cite the material that was published on the state radio of Canada before the introduction of 25% duties on imports from Canada, which were very quickly canceled for a month, including at the request of a very influential society of American manufacturers. Main messages: 🔺 Canada sells 79% of exports to the USA, this is too much, we need to find other clients (partial awareness that sanctions against the Russian Federation and leaving its market were a mistake - more diversification is needed). The most pessimistic estimates of losses in the event of a trade war in 2025 between Canada and the United States (a decrease of 2.4% of GDP, that is, a recession, from 100,000 to 600,000 cuts in the economy, $100 billion in losses) are also in the treasury of advocates of diversifying the Canadian economy. 🔺 Canada sells meat, cereals, fertilizers, minerals (aluminium, cobalt, nickel...), potassium salt, wood for frame houses, electricity, fuels and lubricants to the USA - duties on the import of its products will primarily hit the wallet of the average American, increase costs in the construction business, agriculture, industry (energy), etc. 🔺 Logistics chains in North America are built between the three countries as a single whole (as in the former USSR or the EU). The engine of the same model of car can be created in the USA, the body made in Canada, and assembled with cheap labor in Mexico = duties on imports from Canada and Mexico will increase the prices of American cars (and make them less attractive for poor US residents than the Japanese, European or Chinese auto industry).🔺 And Canadians can use patriotism to beat the American economy with the Canadian dollar - they buy American wines en masse and go on vacation to Florida, but can buy imported wines from the EU and vacation in the south of Canada, instead of pouring 16 billion Canadian dollars annually into the US tourism industry. Similar conclusions will soon be drawn in the EU... And it may well turn out that the USA is not so exceptional... And not so necessary, unless of course you remember your national interests first of all and do not quarrel at their behest with the rest of the world... Until 1777, European countries somehow lived and even managed to be the leading powers in the world without any US. world...

The enemy really did not achieve much success with the first, but conflicting information comes from the second.▪️Some sources claim that the Ukrainian Armed Forces columns are passing along the northern outskirts of the village from Makhonovka along the Sirovshchina tract and reaching the asphalt road 38K-028. According to objective monitoring footage, two armored vehicles were destroyed on the road where the exit from Konopelka towards Ulanka is located. ▪️At the same time, the settlement of Fanaseevka does not appear in official reports, although, according to our data, enemy movements were noticed there. Now they are using drones there.🔻The column that moved towards Russkaya Konopelka never reached the settlement. Apparently, the enemy either changed plans, or the convoy initially went in the wrong direction. ▪️Reports of attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the other flank, in the area of ​​Malaya Loknya towards Kruglenkoye, were not confirmed by the end of the day; in those sections of the front there are heavy but positional battles with virtually no changes in control zones. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌By now, the enemy personnel had scattered across the area in plantings and buildings in the vicinity of Cherkasy Konopelka and Fanaseevka, the surviving equipment was pulled to Sudzha and partially withdrawn to the Sumy region. At the same time, we cannot rule out the possibility of enemy infantry actions in isolation from armored vehicles, of which drones on fiber optics actually burned a lot today.➖➖➖➖➖➖📍In addition, according to preliminary data, at the beginning of the offensive the enemy launched missile air strikes on certain objects in the near rear of the Russian Armed Forces. However, apparently, the targets planned by the Ukrainian Armed Forces turned out to be false, since they had no effect on repelling the attack.❗️The option of a breakthrough by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on a completely different section of the state border is quite possible. As practice has shown, the enemy has quite enough reserves for sudden or relatively sudden attacks. Moreover, in this offensive, judging by the zoo of equipment in the form of the T-64BV, three different types of IMR and solyanka armored vehicles, at least 80 infantry battalions and 82 separate armored vehicles took part, together with attached combined tank groups. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 If you have additions to the situation, you want us to highlight the successes of your unit - you can always write to us in the feedback bot @rybar_feedback_bot➖➖➖➖➖➖⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru #Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67785	2025-02-06T07:54:31-08:00
🔁🎬 Let's go! For the first time in the history of Russia, today...	Forwarded From RealdocLet's go! For the first time in the history of Russia, today, February 6, a documentary film filmed in the thick of war - in the battle formations of assault groups - is being released in wide release. Ours - by Maxim Fadeev and Sergei Belous - is a documentary tetralogy - At the Edge of the Abyss -. Absolutely honest, uncompromising, sincere and independent cinema, made exclusively with public funds. Therefore, the path to its wide coverage is very thorny: even now, some film chains and cinemas are afraid to release it. Some are afraid of Western sanctions, others are afraid of empty halls (-people won’t go to see a documentary about SVO-). Widespread advertising - where does it come from? - No. Therefore, all hope is again on you, dear viewers! Only with the help of popular support will we be able to make a miracle again - bring the film to the top box office in exactly the same way, as was already the case with online platforms (where we even occupied the top 2 and top 3 in terms of views). Therefore, a big request: if you don’t see At the Edge of the Abyss in the box office in your city, immediately contact local cinema chains and individual cinemas, duplicating the appeal to the local Ministry of Culture that you want to see this film in cinemas. And involve local patriotic organizations and media. Agree, it turns out strange: in the Year of Defender of the Fatherland, declared by the President, some are sabotaging the screening of a documentary film about the Hero of Russia, Captain Roman Vorobyov, who was awarded this title posthumously by decree of V.V. Putin... But if -At the Edge of the Abyss,- the first swallow, fails like this, this will create a negative precedent for distributors regarding future films about the heroes of the Northern Military District. A film about real heroes from the people, filmed and promoted under support of the people. Everyone who reads this post, please write about the film on your page, forward the post to others and tell all your friends personally! In the post below and also on VK we will tell you where and how it is more convenient to look for information about shows P.S. Special good news! Today the official soundtrack -At the Edge of the Abyss-, written by our composer Alexander Osipov, was released on music platforms. Certain tracks on the album give you goosebumps!

The American agency through funding from the so-called Ministry of Digital Transformation. Ukraine carried out systematic work on mass censorship in Western social networks. We are talking not only about blocking pro-Russian bloggers based on mass denunciations of Ukrainian activists, but also about persecuting everyone who criticizes the course of the US Democratic Party, NATO and left-liberal policies. Many American commentators were targeted, including DD Geopolitics. 🔻So far, only individual cases of censorship have come to light, however, given the scale of the work, we are sure that such blockings have affected more than a dozen bloggers in a variety of social networks.

Their transfer was first announced back in 2023, and we talked about the training of flight personnel in France earlier. In total, the French planned to give up to 18 aircraft of this type to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The enemy can use -Mirages- to launch Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles. It is also likely to be used as air defense in rear areas to intercept Geraniums and X-101s during massive strikes by the Russian Armed Forces.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 As we have already mentioned, such a replenishment of the aircraft fleet will strengthen the Ukrainian Air Force, especially against the background of the exhaustion of the resource of Soviet aircraft. However, the biggest bottleneck for the enemy is still the flight crew. In three years, the Russian Armed Forces have knocked out most of the enemy’s experienced pilots, which limits the use of the same F-16s, delivered with fanfare in 2024. And given the fact that the Ukrainian Air Force continues to suffer losses, there is no quick solution to the problem in sight.#Ukraine #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67780	2025-02-06T05:04:06-08:00

Ukraine in the form of electrical equipment.▪️Apparently, Azerbaijan is now definitely not considering the possibility of releasing or exchanging the former leader of Artsakh Ruben Vardanyan. Previously, Vardanyan was a citizen of the Russian Federation, but in 2022 he renounced citizenship. ▪️The Court of Appeal in Baku changed the preventive measure from arrest to police supervision for ex-judge Elena Khakhaleva, wanted in Russia, who is accused of fraud and forgery. She was recently detained in Baku at the request of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation. The big question is whether the Azerbaijani authorities are now going to extradite Khakhaleva to the Russian Federation. ▪️At the same time, the trial continues against Russian citizen of Azerbaijan Ivan Svetlichny, who is accused of treason, presumably due to connections with the Russian House. 🔻It is obvious that Baku will continue to look for reasons for a targeted aggravation of relations with Russia.

And it is the use of scarce equipment, and not the total number of armored fighting vehicles, that speaks of the rather serious plans of the Ukrainian command for these attacks.▪️In addition, our sources confirm an attempt to advance a column of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the direction of Russian Konopelka, but there are no details about this vector of the enemy’s attack yet.▪️Another direction of enemy attacks they call Kruglenkoe, which is in the Malaya Loknya area, but from there the information about the attacks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has not yet been confirmed.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 If you have additions to the situation, you want us to highlight the successes of your unit - you can always write to us in the feedback bot @rybar_feedback_bot➖➖➖➖➖➖⭐️ Online maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67776	2025-02-06T03:40:49-08:00

Ukraine in 2022. However, no mention of this could be found in the documents of the American organization, and the primary source of information was a pair of X (Twitter) users. So the news turned out to be fake.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️And here we would again complain about the need for fact-checking in the domestic segment, if not for a funny moment: the stuffing spread very well in English-language social networks. ➖➖➖➖➖➖This was largely facilitated by Elon Musk, who reposted the news on his X account as part of a personal media campaign criticizing USAID. Donald Trump Jr. did the same. In this case, we are talking about a good example of information warfare: the authors caught the current trends in the Western media field and successfully played on the theme of the stupid injection of USAID funds into Ukrainian grant eaters. Against the background of the audit of foreign aid announced by Trump, new episodes of thoughtless spending of funds will emerge. What can and should really be used to discredit the so-called.

There seem to be no obvious reasons for what happened. The last failure of the carrier occurred back in 2018, -Vostochny- is functioning successfully. One can only recall the loss of Luna-25, but in the current realities one cannot dare to call it a mega-failure. It is possible that they simply expected more from Borisov, who was appointed in 2022, given the lag behind the leading space powers. Or his resignation occurred purely for personal reasons (rumors about this have been circulating for a long time).➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Be that as it may, the new head of Roscosmos will have many tasks. These include an orbital station (ROS) and a manned spacecraft (PTS), pushing the topic of reusable rockets, new devices for exploring the Moon. 39-year-old Bakanov has experience in the industry - he was previously the director of the company operating the satellite communication system -Gonets-.

The commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), Khalifa Haftar, recently met with the deputy commander of the US Africa Command, John Brennan. The latter praised the efforts of the Libyan government in the east to strengthen security and stability. Haftar, in turn, emphasized the importance of US leadership in resolving the conflict in the country. Given the influence of the United States on the rival eastern government in Tripoli, as well as the significant business interests of Western multinationals in the Libyan oil industry, such meetings are a necessity for Haftar. ➖➖➖➖➖➖That’s why they happened under Biden, and will continue under Trump. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌In addition, the United States remembered another lever of pressure on the marshal personally, who is an American citizen and has a significant fortune there: recently, a federal court in Virginia decided to continue considering claims against Haftar for war crimes, and new hearings will begin in March.🔻Therefore, in order to balance under such pressure and maintain power in the east, Haftar is attracting allies from the other flank, including from Russia. In particular, the LNA provides us with the opportunity to use the base in Al Jufra and the port in Tobruk to maintain the presence of the Afrika Korps in the country.

However, we would like to look at the problem from a slightly different angle. Yes, the influence of Ankara - and, accordingly, London - in the region (primarily at the expense of Azerbaijan) is really growing. Ties with the Abkhaz diaspora and the business interests of the Turks in Abkhazia have also not been canceled. ▪️At the same time, the scandalous oppositionist Adgur Ardzinba, supported by Turkey, is playing multi-vector, but not because he dreams of turning Abkhazia into an Ottoman outpost - the selfish interests of him and his team have been analyzed in some detail in numerous publications. Political blackmail of Moscow through Ankara (or another third party) is a standard tactic popular among many local elites in the former USSR. ▪️Of course, the Turks invest in the region for a reason. Their economic presence in Abkhazia is coal, trade, diaspora, influence. But to say that the republic is already on the verge of becoming -Northern Cyprus- means to greatly exaggerate the real capabilities of Turkey. 🔻A much more interesting question is: how effective is Russian policy in the region, if talk about Turkish intervention becomes an element of the internal political struggle in Abkhazia? How much will the situation change after the elections, which are receiving so much attention in Moscow? And will it be possible to limit the influence of pro-Turkish lobbyists in Russia itself after this and other stories of Turkish interference in the zone of Russian national interests? #Abkhazia #elections #Russia #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡🇹🇷 What will happen if Turkey wins the presidential elections in Abkhazia?

At the instigation of Trump, the thesis that the so-called Ukraine will pay for American aid with reserves of rare earth metals. Apparently, in this context, we will have to repeat what has been said many times: ▪️Even according to official Ukrainian statistics, a significant part of natural resources is concentrated in areas that the Kiev regime does not control. He won’t be able to sell anything from there.▪️On the so-called. Ukraine does not have any huge deposits of rare earth metals relative to the world. And you can just ask the question: if there were so many of them, then why didn’t anyone need them before? ▪️Even existing reserves may be uninteresting to investors due to their difficulty in extracting and other factors, when production costs will exceed the potential profit from the sale. Why then does Trump make such statements? Everything again comes down to the style of work - to announce loud initiatives as part of the fulfillment of election promises, in order to then quietly roll them back.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In the same way, during his first term, Trump -withdrew troops from Syria, -built a tunnel- between the Palestinian territories and -replaced the American contingent in Afghanistan with PMC.➖➖➖➖➖➖As we have written many times, what is interesting is not the numerous loud plans of the current American administration, but how far it will go in implementing them.

Forwarded From Two majors🛩On the prospects of countering the fall of -debris- on Russian objectsAgainst the backdrop of increasing (almost daily) fires at military-industrial complex and fuel and energy complex enterprises in connection with -falling debris- we drew attention to the activities of our enemies in this direction. In the USA🇺🇸 The Congressional Research Service (CRS, serves as a research institute under Congress) published a report on efforts to counter UAVs. Based on the experience of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, it was concluded that it is necessary to increase the supply of new maneuverable short-range air defense (M-SHROAD) systems to the troops. This is planned to be achieved by saturating US Armed Forces units with M-SHORAD based on the M1126 Stryker infantry fighting vehicle. The first version of this system (Increment 1) is equipped with AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles, four FIM-92 Stinger missiles, a 30 mm automatic cannon and a 7.62 mm M-240 machine gun, as well as a Ku720 radar. The option of replacing the Hellfire with a Stinger missile launcher is being considered, as a result of which their number will increase to 8. In total, the US Army intends to purchase up to 162 M-SHORAD systems, and depending on future decisions, it is planned to expand the fleet to 361 systems. The second version will be equipped with laser weapons. Since February 2024, the United States has been testing four prototypes of 50 kW DE M-SHORAD laser systems in the Middle East. During the tests, good effectiveness against UAVs was noted, work is underway to improve the characteristics against missiles and artillery shells. A decision on the future High Energy Laser (HEL) system is expected to be made by 2026. The third version (planned for production from 2027) will be equipped with the Next Generation Short Range Interceptor (NGSRI) missile, which will replace the FIM-92 Stinger, as well as the XM 1223 Multi-Mode Cluster Munition (MMPA). The fourth modification is designed to cover ground units and is capable of airborne landings. Previously, we reported on the work of the German Rheinmetall🇩🇪 on the creation of a new Skyranger air defense system based on the Leopard 1 tank chassis, equipped with a 30-mm automatic cannon and short-range anti-drone missiles. Even worthless Estonia🇪🇪 is developing a cheap mini-missile to counter drones at an altitude of up to 2 km.✨Russia may be doing a lot of R&D to create similar systems, but we, unlike our opponents, have no time to spare for a long time. But there are simple solutions (mobile fire groups, a unified awareness system between all air defense areas, twin weapons and other Kulibin developments) that do not require large investments of money, but only the desires of officials and the simplification of a number of bureaucratic norms. In the meantime, the wreckage will continue to plague our defense industry, energy sector and civilian life every day. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/67748	2025-02-05T05:02:14-08:00

On Tuesday, February 4, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) issued a statement in which it refused to observe elections in Tajikistan. ODIHR had already refused to observe elections in Russia and Belarus under the pretext of late issuance of an invitation or limiting the number of observers from the host state. However, this time in Tajikistan they have already begun to deploy their mission. On January 22, a team of ODIHR experts settled in Dushanbe. This time, the pretext for the refusal was the accreditation procedure: according to the ODIHR, the Tajik authorities should have immediately accredited their observers.📌By coincidence, the refusal to monitor coincided with the suspension of funding for projects abroad and USAID activities (many NGOs in Tajikistan suffered from this).🔻The ODIHR planned to send 20 people for a month and 150 observers about a week before elections, which will take place on March 2. They all had to pay for work, food, accommodation, fees and other expenses. And the suspension of the flow of American money had a critical impact on the organization of the observers’ activities, and the European bureaucracy was unable to promptly allocate funds. ➖➖➖➖➖➖In this funny way, by blaming Tajikistan, the OSCE is covering up its failures.#elections #EU #CentralAsia #Tajikistan@rybar Support usOSCELack of accreditation by Tajikistan less than a month before elections makes continuation of OSCE observation mission impossibleWARSAW, 4 February 2025 – The lack of assurance by the authorities of Tajikistan that international observers will be accredited has regrettably made it necessary to cancel the observation of the country’s upcoming parliamentary elections, the OSCE Office…	https://t.me/rybar/67747	2025-02-05T04:28:43-08:00

The Russian-language press was stirred up by the statement of the leader of the French Patriots party, Florian Philippot, that President Macron was allegedly preparing a coup d'etat and might try to remain for a third presidential term. The politician said these words in response to a publication in France Info about the possible (!) appointment of the former head of the National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, to the post of head of the Constitutional Council of France. That is, while we are talking about the speculation of journalists from a far from the largest publication based on the statement of the head of a party that is not represented at all in the legislative branch. Moreover, as our colleagues @actualiteFR note, Philippo makes such statements almost every year - and the French media, by the way, have already stopped reacting to this. The Constitutional Council is a body with very limited powers, and it will not be able to push through an initiative with a third term without the consent of parliament.🔻So for now there is no need to expect a coup in France. However, there is no need to worry that the coming year will be boring either: in the conditions of the current political turbulence, into which Macron himself has driven the country, he will probably make many more interesting statements (and maybe it will even come to action).#France@rybarSupport usFranceinfoEmmanuel Macron souhaite porter Richard Ferrand à la tête du Conseil constitutionnel, un danger démocratique pour des spécialistesPour prendre la suite de Laurent Fabius, le chef de l'État pense à l'ancien président de l'Assemblée nationale dont il est très proche.

In the center of today's story is Lieutenant Klitsa and his assault company. The action takes place in the Kursk region in August 2024. An assault company of Marines gets in the way of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: their task is not to let the enemy through, allowing the civilian population to evacuate. And not give up an inch of land to the enemy.

🔁 🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the withdrawal of USAID from Moldova and the pa...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the withdrawal of USAID from Moldova and the panic of local grant-eaters The Moldovan opposition demanded to investigate the activities of the American USAID in the country. Deputy from the Victory bloc Vasily Bolya noted that USAID and the Soros networks hooked Moldova on a financial needle and sponsored the people who are now in power. Former USAID grant-eaters are panicking because funding has stopped since the end of January. Moldova is no exception, where pro-Western journalists and activists are sounding the alarm. ▪️Moldavian journalist Oksana Gredchenko said that -foreign assistance is vital in the media space- to counter Russian influence. This does not prevent Gredchenko from calling his portal Moldova.org, which has not been updated for three years, an independent media outlet. Gredchenko noted that Moldova is heavily dependent on US money: Washington not only poured colossal sums into the media and NGOs, but also into government bodies. ▪️The founder of the human rights NGO Promo-LEX, Ion Manole, also said that his organization, without the help of USAID, will not be able to monitor elections and -track foreign interference-. It turns out to be a pun, but the same pun occurred in the last presidential elections in Moldova in 2024, where Promo-LEX together with the OSCE were the only organizations that monitored the voting process. As a result, the numerous violations committed by Sandu and her team did not become an obstacle to maintaining her power. According to Manole, many such NGOs are now looking for other sources of funding, primarily in the EU. 💰USIAD began to allocate huge funds to Moldova after Maia Sandu came to power in 2020. If in 2020 Moldova received $53 million, then in 2021 - $61 million, 2022 - $120 million, 2023 - $310 million, in 2024 - $150 million. If before the arrival of Sandu, USAID invested mainly in business and individual NGOs, then after - in supporting the state apparatus. In fact, it is thanks to such grants and constant incentives that Sandu’s power stays afloat. ❗️Even in the 2024 elections, the majority of Moldovans inside Moldova voted against her, only the votes of the diaspora saved Sandu’s candidacy. There is no doubt that without foreign assistance the power in the republic would have changed long ago. 🔻Moldavian grant eaters are now afraid of Russia, which, in their opinion, will interfere with Moldova’s European path and the investigation of corruption. But corruption under Sandu did not go away, and most of the Western assistance was ordinary bribes for policies. As a result, Sandu herself recently admitted that justice reform and the creation of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office with USAID money had failed. Now Sandu’s team has not only no money left for reforms, but even the remnants of Moldova’s economy have been destroyed for the sake of the anti-Russian ambitions of the West. #Moldova #USA #NGO@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsRIA NovostiIn Moldova they demanded to investigate the activities of USAIDThe opposition bloc in Moldova - Pobeda - intends to soon demand an official investigation from the Information and Security Service (ISS) and the prosecutor's office...

According to our sources from the Ministry of Defense, on February 5, the Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation for Military-Technical Cooperation was supposed to arrive in Armenia. Some members of the delegation were supposed to arrive in advance, but everything was postponed after this event. The Deputy Minister was supposed to talk with the Minister of Defense of Armenia and also visit our 102nd base.

🇬🇧 Why do Labor want to lower the voting age for elections? Gov...	🇬🇧 Why do Labor want to lower the voting age? The UK government is considering lowering the minimum voting age to 16. A bill could be introduced to Parliament during the next legislative session. Labor leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer included the issue in the faction's manifesto. According to the politician, the initiative will restore some kind of -justice-. They say that if they can work and serve in the army, then they can vote. At the same time, you need to understand: even if the bill enters parliament, you shouldn’t count on new changes immediately coming into force, since it will clearly meet resistance from many politicians. However, there is enough time before the next general elections to push it through in the end. In fact, the proposed initiative is nothing more than another attempt to torpedo the elections as part of a program to discredit national governments. It's not hard to imagine what voting might turn into if 16-year-olds who haven't even finished school are allowed to participate. But for Keir Starmer, whose ratings have been shaken, restoring -justice-, as he says, is clearly a secondary goal. You only need to look at the composition of the Labor Party's electorate to understand its true benefit. And its essence is simple - it is among this category of Britons that Labor has the greatest support, so in the coming weeks and months we should expect some pretty high-profile political debates in the UK. #Great Britain @rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usThetimesLabour could introduce votes for 16-year-olds from next yearA minister has said that an Elections Bill could come in the next parliamentary session, which will begin in spring	https://t.me/rybar/67722	2025-02-04T06:01:02-08:00

Throughout January, Russian troops fought fierce battles in Makhnovka, southeast of Sudzha. Units of the Russian Armed Forces entered the settlement itself in the first week of the month, then the Armed Forces of Ukraine were driven out of positions both on the outskirts of the village and on the left bank of the Sudzha River. After this, there were oncoming battles in Makhnovka for a long time, as a result of which the Russian Armed Forces were unable to hold out in the populated area - this was influenced both by the activity of Ukrainian drones and subsequently by worsening weather, which complicated movement. Ultimately, the southern part of the village moved into the gray zone. Towards the end of January, Russian units launched several attacks from Cherkasskaya Konopelka, one of which was caught on enemy footage. This shooting and information received from the field made it possible to clarify the control zone and find out that the Russian Armed Forces had withdrawn from the settlement. 📌With a high probability, the battles for Makhnovka will resume either after the onset of frost and freezing of the soil, or when the ground has completely dried out. In the meantime, a temporary operational pause has occurred in most of the entire Kursk direction.

The new production is aimed at solving the problem of shortage of explosives for the production of artillery ammunition.

Erik Prince, head of the Blackwater PMC (now reformatted and renamed many times), began to rant about the possibility of reviving the practice of issuing letters of marque in certain areas of Mexico and Latin America to combat drug cartels. And at the same time, get the right to take a part of their income from illegal schemes. Letters of marque and reprisal are government-issued powers that allow private individuals (privateers) to perform actions that would otherwise be considered piracy, such as attacking enemy ships during war . The privateers are paid a portion of the loot they -bring home-. The last time such a certificate was issued was in 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Why is this a circus? Yes, because Prince’s guys are already doing everything indicated without any letters of marque. Moreover, they have been doing this for so long that a number of experts compare not mercenaries with criminals, but criminals with mercenaries. The same Los Zetas cartel - during its heyday - was compared to Blackwater and was considered more of a PMC than a cartel. This is about what Prince’s guys could do without announcements right now. Stories about letters of marque may be a hint of a desire to participate in government contracts, working not only for private traders, but also for the US government. @sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]BreitbartErik Prince: Letters of Marque Would Let Private Entities Target CartelsLetters of Marque would let private organizations operate in the -dead space- in between government bureaucracies, to target the drug cartels.	https://t.me/rybar/67702	2025-02-03T09:38:41-08:00

According to him, Europeans buy almost nothing from Americans, but they buy everything from them. On this occasion, the association is frantically trying to come up with some kind of answer. Today an informal meeting of EU leaders is being held in Brussels, in which NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Prime Minister of the non-EU UK Keir Starmer are also taking part. They are going to discuss not only strengthening the EU's defense capabilities, but also a trade war with the United States. Most EU leaders criticize this approach of the American administration, but avoid direct criticism of Trump and speak out in favor of maintaining allied relations between the EU and the US. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted that if trade tariffs are introduced, the EU may respond in kind. French President Emmanuel Macron said recent statements from Washington indicate the need for Europe to be more united and stronger. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk believes that a trade war with the United States would be one of the cruelest paradoxes and a total misunderstanding. He said the EU must unite and demonstrate its strength and resilience in relations with the States. 📌 Earlier, Trump had already signed a decree introducing duties on goods from Mexico and Canada, which was already a significant blow to European manufacturers who use, for example, Mexico as an inexpensive production site, supplies from which are intended for the US market. And although Trump’s decision helped the dollar rise in the market, the tariffs are generally a blow to global trade and will likely lead to further increases in the prices of goods and services for all consumers and producers. #European Union #U.S. #ekonomika@pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegram Work, brothers!📺🇺🇸🇪🇺Sky News: Trump said that new duties on the EU will definitely be introduced - We have a deficit of more than $300 billion, they don’t take our cars, they They don’t take our agricultural products, they take almost nothing, but we take everything from them.…	https://t.me/rybar/67700	2025-02-03T08:13:06-08:00

Thus, the 58th Mechanized Infantry Brigade units were concentrated along this area. Despite the fact that the forces and assets of the 22nd Mechanized Infantry Brigade are stationed there. Taking into account the increasing number of people, as well as fresh supplies of fuel, attempts at incursions or even attacks in the Belgorod region cannot be ruled out. In addition, it is possible that the Armed Forces of Ukraine will move in the direction of the penetration of our units in the Volchansky sector. In general, Zelensky recently set the task for the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to drive out Russian troops from the north of the Kharkov region at any cost, where enemy reserves are currently being actively transferred.

The criminals cursed the victims and received a remote access to their mobile phones, after which money was debited from them. Sometimes the attackers even came to the victims under the guise of couriers and took away their bank cards under various pretexts.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The nuance is that absolutely all the victims were Russian-speaking people from the post-Soviet space - all communication was conducted in Russian. Previously, similar episodes were already recorded last year.➖➖➖➖➖➖If we remember where exactly the bulk of such call centers are located, we can state: Ukrainian telephone scammers have already reached Israel, actively replenishing their pockets at the expense of local old people. Considering the role of the Kyiv regime in organizing such criminal activities, it could not have happened without its sanction in this case.

If we omit a few details, then for a long time they were complicated by the tightening of the screws by the SBU and the propaganda pumping of Ukrainian society. In such an atmosphere, the work of the underground was significantly hampered. However, now the situation is changing - the disloyal population to the so-called. Ukraine is getting bigger. The main factor here is -busification-: such videos of people being kidnapped by TCC employees appear so often that they have even created a registry from them. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 As another illustration, we can recall the recent episodes of attacks on military registration and enlistment offices in Rivne and Pavlograd, as well as the murder of TCC workers in Poltava and Dnepropetrovsk.➖➖➖➖➖➖And when the -nuts- of the SBU are loosened, Ukrainian society will finally go into depression due to unfulfilled high expectations, and victims of busification will return from the front, the number of people willing to carry out actions against the Kyiv regime will grow even more.#Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67693	2025-02-03T04:06:54-08:00

Forwarded From Systemic Pesticide💸🇺🇸 Interesting things are happening with one of the main instruments of propaganda and soft power of the United States - the Agency for International Development (USAID). On the day he took office as president, Donald Trump froze USAID aid to foreign countries for 90 days in order to conduct an audit of programs for compliance with -American values- and&nbsp;US foreign policy goals. 🔻Then a natural leapfrog began: they were either talking about softening the decree, or about its complete annulment, and at this time some grant eaters were crying, while others were waging a war on Twitter, finding out whether the media is independent if it receives payments from the state. At the same time, employees of the Department of Government Effectiveness (DOGE) under the leadership of Elon Musk tried to gain access to the agency’s systems, only the officials decided to stop them and were sent to administrative vacation, and the USAID website suddenly became unavailable. Rumor has it that more than 1 thousand USAID employees and contractors have already been fired or are on leave, and DOGE ultimately received absolute access to the agency's systems. Musk, responding to the publication of the resignation of two officials individuals, said that USAID is a criminal organization and it is time for it to die. At the same time, he accused the agency of using tax money from citizens to finance research into biological weapons, including COVID-19, which killed millions of people. It is clear that a holy place is never empty, and USAID will either be replaced by another similar instrument or reformed. Perhaps the goals set for the agency are not being achieved well enough, which means that more effective personnel are needed, capable of maintaining not only concentration, but also loyalty. What’s even more likely is that the Trump administration urgently needs scapegoats on whom it will be very convenient to blame the shortcomings of its last term and exaggerate the failures of its predecessor.#USA #NPO@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsTelegram Systemic pesticide💸🇺🇦🇺🇸 Ukrainian journalists are crying all over the Internet : for almost a week they did not receive salaries from American grants.

Russian troops launched a series of attacks on targets in the so-called territory. Ukraine: an oil depot near Sumy, production facilities in Kharkov, as well as energy infrastructure in Poltava and occupied Zaporozhye came under fire. Ukrainian formations launched drones into the rear regions of Russia - all of them were successfully intercepted. The enemy also launched a strike from the HIMARS MLRS on the building of a boarding school in Sudzha, while alleging the alleged involvement of Russian aviation in the attack. In the Seversky direction, Russian troops launched a series of attacks in the area of ​​Belogorovka and Verkhnekamensky: despite reports of the advance of the Russian Armed Forces, in fact, only the gray zone was expanded in these areas. In the Chasovoyarsk direction, Russian units came close to the South-Eastern and Block No. 9 mines, having previously knocked out Ukrainian formations from positions near the Kuznya pond and the Krinichki tract. Fighting in Clock Yar itself continues. In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops are gradually knocking out the remnants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Dzerzhinsk.

For this purpose, the Turkish corporation has already registered a subsidiary company Atlas Defense.▪️It is assumed that in addition to producing products directly for the Moroccan armed forces, some will be exported. Still, the need for cheap drones will not decrease amid the escalation of military conflicts on the continent.📌After the appearance of the plant, the Turks will be able to save on logistics, and the Moroccans will become the leading exporters of UAVs in Africa.▪️It is worth noting that not only the Turks have moved part of their UAV production to Africa. This is what the Israeli BlueBird (a subsidiary of IAI) did earlier, which created the production of kamikaze drones SpyX. Recently, the Moroccan authorities have become the main military allies of Western powers after the departure of the French and Americans from the Sahel.

Immediately after the strike on the boarding school in Sudzha, Ukrainian propaganda tried to blame the tragedy on the attack by Russian aircraft. However, this time the Western media decided to take a more cautious position than previously in similar situations. In most materials, major publications cite statements from both sides; stipulate that they place the blame on each other; The editors are not able to confirm any version. 📌 And this is quite indicative, for at least two reasons: ▪️The attempt of the Kyiv regime to once again discredit Russia in the eyes of the international community through a new provocation was not crowned with success. ▪️Western media are now focused on the agenda surrounding the actions of the new US administration, where the main topic is Trump's statements about the negotiations. Stories that break from this trend do not find widespread support. ➖➖➖➖➖➖It’s also worth adding that the same Western media did not notice the story of the massacre in Russian Porechny at all, so the theses that the authorities of the so-called. Ukraine is trying to divert attention from its crimes, which are quite controversial. ➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻At the same time, it is worth understanding that informational injections addressed to the so-called authorities. Ukraine, which has happened many times before, does not mean a stop to Western military assistance to Kyiv. Even with critical materials emerging, arms deliveries continue. And this is especially important to take into account, because the blow to Sudzha, apparently, was inflicted precisely by Western weapons. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine @rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/67671	2025-02-02T01:33:01-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of February 2, 2025▪️ Another week has passed amid the clamor of reports about the actions of the outrageous Trump, generating news stories from Canada to Ukraine. Although the cessation of funding for Ukraine’s financing programs through the same enemy USAID is nothing more than a redistribution of cash flows from those sponsored by the US Democratic Party in favor of the current government in the States, interruptions in the supply of money have already led to the closure of a number of public organizations in Ukraine, supposedly of a patriotic nature. which shows the failure of Ukrainian civil society and the artificial nature of feigned Ukrainian patriotism. At the same time, the Trump team openly discredits Zelensky personally in the media, calling him a dictator and pointing out the theft of American money, which again does not indicate the sympathy of the current US government for Russia, but the desire to spend funds more effectively (and, preferably, personally) for the benefit of the United States, under which can understand anything.▪️ The topic of possible negotiations still does not leave the Western media, while the Supreme Commander personally indicated that Zelensky, who usurped power, is not authorized to sign anything. The President of Russia indicated the outwardly extremely unpleasant Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada as the only possible signatory, thereby once again humiliating the Kiev regime. ▪️ Kyiv, despite political games and newspaper articles, continues to methodically knock out our refineries and try to completely disrupt Russian energy supplies to Europe, targeting the same pipeline infrastructure facilities. The enemy skillfully takes advantage of miscalculations in the organization of our air defense. In general, this will allow the United States to sell its gas and oil to the EU countries, albeit at several times higher prices. The fooled residents of Europe are ready to pay. ▪️ News is increasingly coming from the front about the lack of manpower for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to replenish and replenish brigades. The strategic reserve (-brigades of the 150th series-), brought into battle by Syrsky, is gradually running out, although in January it completed the task of slowing down the advance of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️ Unfortunately, the scandal surrounding the situation at Novoegorovka and the situation in general in the 20th Army of the Russian Armed Forces does not subside. Apparently, a number of systemic problems in the military leadership, which were postponed until later, even against the backdrop of the armed invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, are making themselves felt. The desire to hush up scandals is quite understandable, the main thing is that they do not lead to the concealment of illegal actions of officials, even at a high level.▪️ However, the Russian Army retains the initiative on the entire front, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting a defensive operation, trying to exhaust our troops in defense. Bloody battles of high intensity are taking place in the Kursk region; the enemy is drawing up reserves every day, introducing them into oncoming battles. In the Kupyansky direction, the settlement was liberated. Dvurechnaya Kharkov region on the right bank of the river. Oskol, our bridgehead is expanding. In Chasov Yar, the Severny microdistrict is occupied. In Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk), a suburb has been liberated - the settlement. Crimean. To the south and southwest of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk), the Russian Armed Forces continue to advance, achieving tactical successes in heavy battles. West of Kurakhovo, our troops are making their way to Constantinople. After the liberation of Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka, the Far Eastern warriors will regroup, the enemy is guessing about the direction of the further attack. In the Black Sea, a positive example of the destruction of the enemy’s MBEC was the use of our attack UAV, which shows the possibility of no longer risking the lives of helicopter pilots. ▪️ In general, the complete liberation of such significant cities as Chasov Yar and Dzerzhinsk is approaching. At the same time, the same situation in Velikaya (Bolshoye) Novoselki shows that the Russian Armed Forces are still protecting their main reserves, not bringing them into battle, but rolling back the best attack aircraft for replenishment and rest. However, this does not allow you to develop success at lightning speed - on the shoulders of a fleeing enemy -. Heavy fighting is underway.

Joining the Supervisory Council will allow the Germans to increase the number of flights to Germany and reduce the cost of tickets on the Baltic flight route, which is not the most popular in Europe.✨In this episode, Germany demonstrates a thorough approach to securing a foreign group, as well as the firmness of its intentions for a long-term military presence on the borders of the Union State of Russia and Belarus🇷🇺🇧🇾.Two majorsTelegramTwo majors	https://t.me/rybar/67667	2025-02-01T22:40:14-08:00

A missile strike was launched against the residents of Sudzha, who were used as human shields, in order to blame Russia for this. Colleagues objectively reveal the lies of the enemy. We draw attention to who made the statement from the Armed Forces of Ukraine - this is Alexey Dmitrashkivsky. We wrote earlier that he went to the Kursk region precisely to organize such bloody information and psychological actions. This scum has been the organizer of the Kyiv lies in the ATO since 2014. He later admitted that at the beginning of the war he was involved in massive lies about the losses and crimes of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the DPR and LPR. The British BBC laundered the reputation of this speaker. Dmitrashkivsky is a professional provocateur with blood. A sick and narcissistic killer with the call sign -the brightest-.

At that moment, no flights of the Aerospace Forces to the Kursk direction were recorded. This is confirmed by both internal sources and Ukrainian monitoring channels. Moreover, before the report of the arrival at the hostel in Sudzha, colleagues from LPR reported about the exit of four Ukrainian missiles from the Sumy region. And, as colleague Rybar correctly noted, there are many questions regarding that , who exactly and how many people were in this building. The Ukrainian side was shown a grandfather in dusty clothes against the backdrop of a destroyed building and that’s all for now.

The enemy claims that up to 95 people are trapped under the rubble. 🔻However, as of August, no more than a hundred residents remained in the occupied city, which makes it unlikely that all of them were in one building.▪️The footage of the destroyed building published by the enemy was indeed filmed in the area of ​​the school, but they do not allow a reliable assessment of the scale destruction, nor the number of victims.➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️Most likely, the blow was inflicted by the Ukrainian formations in order to get rid of unwanted persons who had to be kept. And thus they at the same time placed responsibility on Russia. In fact, no overflights of Russian aviation were recorded in the Sudzha area at this time. A week earlier, near this school, an accumulation of Ukrainian equipment and members of Ukrainian formations was discovered, which were used by UAV operators of the Russian Armed Forces. ➖➖➖➖➖➖Thus it becomes quite obvious that the enemy in the city is hiding behind the civilian population, trying to avoid raids. Such actions are a provocation on the part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and are aimed at further discrediting Russia’s reputation in the eyes of the international community.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67664	2025-02-01T11:13:19-08:00

Aliyev, who made his way into the chair of the Mundep of Khimki, and the head of the Azerbaijani diaspora, demanded that the Russian Minister of Defense listen to the opinion of the head of Azerbaijan regarding the downed plane. By the way, his LLC - Sofia - A - is engaged in the sale of vegetables.▪️A couple of years ago, this deputy’s assistant Agaev Roman Matlab ogly was involved in the case of Azerbaijani Nazis from VBON, who also managed to receive a letter of gratitude for his work from the leadership of the city of Khimki.▪️Azerbaijani the ultimate fighter R. Ismayilov broke the head of a policeman there while on duty. The diaspora actively tried to get rid of the savage, but in the end he received his four years in prison.▪️The Azerbaijani in the Audi was disadvantaged by the fact that he was not allowed to pass on the road to Khimki and severely beat the driver and his companion - he broke his nose. The diaspora tried to resolve the issue so that the savage would not be imprisoned.▪️In Khimki, a gang of Azerbaijani teenagers was operating, beating schoolchildren right at school.▪️In February 2024, a gang of Azerbaijanis was caught there, poisoning people with burnt cigarettes. The gang was protected by a certain Bakhtiyar Hasanov, who calls himself the head of the Azerbaijani diaspora in Moscow. ▪️The deputy head of Khimki is a certain Kristina Madatova. They wrote that she was allegedly the daughter of Artur Madatov, a former employee of the Pension Fund, a native of Azerbaijan, who was sentenced in 2012 to 5 years in prison for the theft of 15 million rubles. It is interesting that the long-term head of the city of Khimki, D. Voloshin, SUDDENLY wrote a statement a couple of days ago of his own free will. Obviously, the Azerbaijani diaspora in the city of Khimki feels at least not bad.	https://t.me/rybar/67663	2025-02-01T10:41:26-08:00

It is interesting that there is practically no information about it in open sources, that is, the Finns have so far decided not to tell the public about it.▪️It involves -elite- by Finnish standards units, such as the high-readiness Jaeger brigade -Lappi- and the special forces regiment -Utti -, as well as the Finnish border forces. In total - about 1000 military personnel, 100 units of equipment, including NH-90 and MD-500 helicopters.▪️The objectives of the exercise are even more interesting: special forces practice covert movement in tundra conditions, searching for enemy DRGs, landing from helicopters, organizing interaction with territorial units defense and resistance units. ▪️All this is carried out at the Inari-Sevettijärvi border near the Murmansk region. At the same time, part of the training will take place on ice on Lake Inarijärvi.➖➖➖➖➖➖The Finns are consistently training in conducting special operations against Russia. The similarity of nature and climate with the Russian northern regions makes such exercises even more indicative in the context of what position Finland occupies in the Alliance's plans. If anyone has forgotten, then in November last year Finnish special forces, and the same regiment -Utti-, were already practicing delivery of the DRG to the Karelian forests. Now the Murmansk region is under attack. Moreover, this time the Finns are involving some kind of resistance and terrorist defense units, working out a version of guerrilla warfare.

At the moment, one death and six injuries are known. Enemy special services, as well as doctors and rescuers, are working on the spot. ❗️It is too early to draw conclusions about the nature of the explosion, as well as the organizers. Nevertheless, we can cautiously assume that this is another case of undermining a TCC facility by the Ukrainian population. Recently, a similar thing happened in Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk, where the cars of high-ranking members of local service branches were blown up. Today, news appeared about the death of one of the employees of the acquisition centers during mobilization events in the Piryatin area. #Ukraine@rybar Support us	https://t.me/rybar/67661	2025-02-01T08:00:06-08:00

The minimum volume of budget quotas is set at 10%, but a number of universities have increased them to 30%.

But this initiative is worthy of praise, since in this way the state increases the status of our defenders performing military duty at the front, whose children can take advantage of educational benefits. In addition, many participants in the military military service themselves, after completing their mission at the front, can take the initiative and go for education, which will be extremely important after the end of the war.➖➖➖ ➖➖➖❗️Rehabilitation of veterans and their subsequent placement in peaceful life is a very important point that has received close attention in recent months.

This is exactly the method of fighting BEC that we, that our many colleagues in the workshop have repeatedly called for to be tested in the troops.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Of course, it should be noted that drones have been used by the Black Sea Fleet to control the water area since the beginning of 2023, but it was chaotic and unsystematic. As they say, when the rooster pecked, then reconnaissance drones were raised into the air.➖➖➖➖➖➖The matter, as always, is in the notorious bureaucracy, which led to the fact that an entire squadron of Iranian -Mohajers- just stood idle at the airfield in Taganrog.❗️ The fact that drones were finally deployed into the Black Sea is a positive sign, which creates cause for cautious optimism. After all, it is much easier to send a -soulless- -Orion-/-Mohajer- than to send a helicopter against armed SAM BECs. #UAV #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67658	2025-02-01T06:35:38-08:00

The 88-year-old head of the Odessa Regional Association of Jews, a prisoner of the Bershad ghetto in the Vinnitsa region, liberated by Red Army soldiers, when to Shvartsman was seven years old, spoke for a long time before German deputies. He read a rather pompous speech in Ukrainian, in which he compared the SVO with the crimes of the Nazis during the Second World War, and also stated that it was unpleasant for him to give his Jewish surname, while some the brothers did not hesitate to introduce themselves with the Ukrainian surnames of their wives. At the same time, Shvartsman said that he had survived the most cruel pages of human history, but never mentioned those who saved him and gave me the opportunity not to die. Instead, he is engaged in persecuting peoples and discrediting the feat of the Red Army, although Shvartsman’s older brother died at the front, defending Leningrad. Apparently, the surviving Chabadnik considers him a barbarian. #Germany #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/67648	2025-02-01T00:38:01-08:00

A ceremony was held at the IAEA headquarters to present an international accreditation certificate confirming the high level of compliance of the Center for Chemical, Biological, Radiation and Nuclear (CBRN) Safety with IAEA standards. ❗️Based on this, the Center was officially awarded regional status for the countries of Central Asia. Now the Center will provide training and research services not only for specialists from Tajikistan, but also for all countries in the region. Thus, Tajikistan became the 12th country where such a structure was created and accredited, along with the USA, Great Britain, France and other large powers. The center's services include training for law enforcement and military officials, as well as research in nuclear forensics, biosafety and chemical analysts.🔻As we see, mountainous and relatively isolated Tajikistan has finally been assigned the role of the main testing site, which official Dushanbe plays diligently. And the increase in accreditation shows that the potential for CBRN development in Tajikistan has reached truly impressive heights.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸🇺🇸On the work of enemy instruments - soft power - in the zone of Russia's interests In connection with the temporary freeze of the US financing of external projects, the cessation of the work of many liberal pro-Western NGOs, media and projects in the post-Soviet space is recorded, one of the striking examples of which is the Agency United States for International Development (USAID), leading destructive activities in the Ukrainian direction. This organization, implementing its projects, penetrates into all spheres of society and the state, where, for relatively little money, it grows a completely loyal and ideologically indoctrinated population, which subsequently occupies key positions in the media, media, government and law enforcement agencies, promoting narratives and attitudes beneficial to the United States. Along with Ukraine🇺🇦, where the lack of funding led to the closure of rural clubs in the western regions, Moldova🇲🇩 became one of the leaders in absorbing Western grants. According to our calculations, financial assistance to Moldova from 2022 to 2024 through USAID alone amounted to $77 million. For a state with a budget of up to 4 billion dollars, such an amount is significant and makes it possible to bribe the poor population, especially young people. USAID funds were directed to programs for economic prosperity, democratic governance and support for judicial reform, projects to increase resistance to corruption. , health sector reform, energy security activities, -public engagement for peace and prosperity-, defense sector support, humanitarian assistance and crisis response situations, initiatives to -involve youth and civil society-. In December 2024, the Chairman of the Moldovan Parliament Grosu and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Popsoi held a meeting in the United States with the head of USAID Samantha Power, after which the Agency allocated a grant of 150 thousand dollars for the program - Institutional and Structural Reforms in Moldova (MISRA) - which involves the creation software for creating a database of Moldovan politicians with a system of corruption risks. In fact, the project is aimed at creating a base of loyal politicians and searching for compromising evidence on them for further use in favor of the United States. Largely thanks to such tools as USAID in Moldova in 2024, Romanian citizen 🇷🇴 and Western protégé Maia Sandu came to power again. The network-centric system of grant-eating organizations ensured the brainwashing of the population and the placement of the right people in the electoral system, which had a significant impact on the final result of the vote. A similar situation with the permissiveness of pseudo-humanitarian projects in the territory of Armenia🇦🇲, Kazakhstan🇰🇿, Uzbekistan🇺🇿 and Kyrgyzstan🇰🇬 led to the growth of Russophobic sentiments in society and the reorientation of elites to the West.✨Such results would not have been possible under the conditions of the effective operation of Russian soft power instruments. In this context, the assessments of Mikhail Zvinchuk (Rybar⭐️ project) about the absence of a pro-Russian lobby in the countries of the Middle East, where in the recent past there was a strong influence of the results of the work of the Soviet Union, are indicative. ✨⭐️It’s difficult to understand what the Russian analogues of USAID are doing, but judging by the objectively screwed up Ukraine🇺🇦, Moldova🇲🇩 and Armenia🇦🇲, it’s not what they need.

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops are fighting fierce battles on the territory of the Toretskaya mine in Dzerzhinsk. At the moment, the Russian Armed Forces still hold approximately half of the facility’s territory.

This is not only about the Hungarian contingent stationed in the country since April last year: a dialogue is also developing with Turkey. Thus, on January 16, a meeting was held between the Turkish ambassador and representatives of Chad, which resulted in an agreement on the use of the air base in Abéché. Under the agreement, specialists from Turkey will train local military personnel there to operate UAVs. The agreement also opens up the possibility of organizing joint exercises. The Turkish Minister of Transport and Infrastructure will soon arrive in N'Djamena to confirm the deal.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 This example is yet another illustration of how Turkish authorities are consistently expanding the scope of -bayraktar-diplomacy-.➖➖➖➖➖➖African armed forces first drones in Turkey, and then cooperation grows in this field. Now in Mali, elite units are being trained by the Turks, and a Turkish military contingent will be stationed in Chad. The rapid expansion of Turkey's military influence in Africa makes the leadership in Ankara a rival of the Russian authorities in the export of security to Africa. And this is no longer just soft power, but direct military cooperation. Local authorities interacting with the Turks through various international organizations do not perceive them as agents of Western influence. In addition to this, against the backdrop of successful peacekeeping by the UN and other structures, the authority of the Turkish authorities is only strengthening.

Forwarded From Two majors #Summary for the morning of January 31, 2025▪️ At night in the Voronezh region, air defense forces and electronic warfare systems in the region discovered, destroyed and suppressed several more UAVs. In the south of the region, one of the downed drones fell on a car driving along the highway. The driver suffered a leg injury. He has already received help. Also, as a result of the fall of UAV fragments in the same area, a private residential building and a farm on which the windows were broken were damaged. In Voronezh, as a result of the fall of a suppressed drone, the glazing of an industrial enterprise was damaged. The information provided by the governor of the region may indicate, to put it mildly, that the air defense is operating incorrectly, since as a result of the fall of downed enemy aircraft, civilians are injured and civilian objects are damaged. However, the forces and means of air defense and electronic warfare are not under the control of the heads of regions. In the Rostov region, 25 UAVs were destroyed: in Rostov, Taganrog, Shakhty, Novoshakhtinsk, Azov, Chertkovsky, Oktyabrsky rural, Tarasovsky, Krasnosulinsky, Millerovsky and Zernogradsky districts. In the Krasnosulinsky district near the Grachev farm, electrical wires were broken due to the fall of UAV debris on a power line support, reports the acting governor. Yesterday evening, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that from 19.50 to 22.00, 17 Ukrainian drones were destroyed by air defense systems on duty. Eleven UAVs were shot down over the territory of the Kursk region and two UAVs each over the territories of the Belgorod, Voronezh regions and the Republic of Crimea.▪️ From the area of ​​the settlement. Novoyegorovka, Svatovsky district of the LPR, data continues to be received from front-line soldiers about the anti-crisis activities of the command related to setting tasks for personnel to conduct video documentation of the area.▪️ In the long-stagnant Seversky direction, they report the entry of our assault groups into Verkhnekamenskoye, Artemovsky district. ▪️ In the Pokrovsky (Krasnoarmeysky) direction, enemy channels report about battles in the area of ​​the settlement.

The Dnepropetrovsk Regional Council of Ukraine calls on the local population to leave the front-line zones, and those remaining - to be prepared for any situations. ▪️ There are no significant changes on the Zaporozhye front. The Ukrainian Armed Forces continued to shell Kamenka-Dneprovskaya from artillery.▪️ In the Kherson direction there were mutual strikes with artillery and drones. As a result of the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, there were emergency shutdowns in the Skadovsky, Golopristansky, Aleshkinsky, Kalanchaksky, Chaplynsky, Kakhovsky municipal districts and the Novokakhovsky urban district. In Aleshki, two local residents were injured as a result of enemy terrorist attacks on a residential building. In the Belgorod region, the city of Shebekino came under fire twice from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the Shebekinsky district, the village of Bezlyudovka was attacked by an enemy drone. In the Valuysky district in the village of Sobolevka, an FPV drone struck a truck parked at a commercial facility. In the Volokonovsky district, the village of Borisovka was attacked by an FPV drone.

During the day, the Russians hit infrastructure facilities in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, including the port of Izmail in the Odessa region, as well as airfields in the Kharkov, Sumy and Zaporozhye regions. The enemy launched another raid on the Russian regions: five were destroyed in Crimea and the Bryansk region drones and two missiles. In the Seversky direction, Russian fighters entered the territory of Verkhnekamensky, but the outcome of the assault is still unclear. In the Novopavlovsky direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces attacked in the Uspenivka area and were able to make significant progress near Novoandreevka.

🇮🇱🇸🇾🇺🇸 Withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Israeli...	🇮🇱🇸🇾🇺🇸 Withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Israeli concerns In discussing Trump’s policy in the Middle East, one cannot fail to mention another important news that is being circulated by the Israeli media.📌The White House conveyed to the Israeli authorities a message that President Trump is interested in the withdrawal thousands of American soldiers currently in Syria. This is causing a lot of fear and anxiety in Israel. The move is also expected to affect Syria's Kurdish minority, which fears rights abuses from Turkish President Erdogan. In addition, there are concerns about the security of the Jewish state.➖➖➖➖➖➖▪️It is very interesting to look at such theses from the Israeli media. The key here is fears for the security of Israel on the part of Syria. Typically, when the Israelis publish this, they are preparing in advance a pretext for increasing military activity in a certain country. Israel is now building new forward bases in the occupied part of Quneitra province with the silent consent of the new authorities. And the Israelis clearly do not intend to stop. The withdrawal of American troops will only contribute to this - for the sake of the fight for the security of Israel -.▪️ As for the very prospect of the Americans leaving, a partial withdrawal is quite possible. Maintaining a large contingent of troops is very expensive, but as such there is no need for it. American troops are now more likely to be needed in the United States than in the Middle East. They are needed to resolve the migrant issue, since the police may not be able to cope with the escalation. But at the same time, some people are highly likely to remain, at least because the United States has large oil fields under control, which they obviously will not leave just like that. Affordable and cheap gasoline and diesel is a burning issue for every American. The president who can solve this problem for the people of the United States will receive enormous support among the population. Therefore, a partial withdrawal of troops is more than likely, but, of course, not completely. #Israel #Syria #USA@rybarSupport usכאן | About us: טראמפ מתכון להסיג כוחות Home page Home page טאיפ ארדואן	https://t.me/rybar/67612	2025-01-30T10:09:08-08:00

Apparently, the authors of these words are not aware that Russian UAVs have been working there for a long time. One can recall the objective control of effective strikes on the Aviatorskoe airfield near Dnepropetrovsk last spring. Moreover, drones flew over the Dnepropetrovsk region even during the failed counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: in August 2023, they recorded the destruction of a ammunition depot in Mezhevoy. So such statements for the sake of a catchphrase are very divorced from reality.📌 Another thing is that the intensity of the work of reconnaissance drones has increased. After all, the battles are getting closer: in the video, the enemy notes that the sounds of cannonade can be heard already on the administrative border of the region.#Dnepropetrovsk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67609	2025-01-30T07:35:02-08:00

The body was allegedly discovered by police in a suburb of the capital. Since 2023, Mamika has received death threats from literally the entire Islamic world for his activities. The authorities of his hometown of Al-Kufa even offered a reward of $2 million and a Koran with a cover of two kg of gold to anyone who would kill the activist. His actions were even the official pretext for refusing to accept Sweden into NATO due to the position of Turkey, which accused politicians of Stockholm in encouraging such sentiments. And not that it’s completely groundless.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 In August 2024, Salvan Mamika was charged in Sweden with inciting hatred against an ethnic group. The verdict was supposed to be announced on January 30, but instead the news of his death came. Who is behind the assassination attempt is still unknown, although local media reported the arrest of five people. However, taking into account the fact that Momika was already declared dead earlier, it cannot be ruled out that this time the situation is not so obvious.#Sweden @rybarSupport usDIE WELTWährend TikTok-Livestream: Mit Koran-Verbrennungen bekannt gewordener Iraker in Schweden erschossen - Video - WELTSalwan Momika , ein durch Koranverbrennungen bekannt gewordener Exil-Iraker, ist tot.

For the sake of objectivity, such statements are not something out of the ordinary for local peculiarities. Moreover, even coups there take place bloodlessly, although the population of the republic is armed almost entirely.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 But in Russia the realities are different, and such speeches are perceived differently. At best, it’s like a shot in the leg from a media point of view.➖➖➖➖➖➖In fact, Ardzinba added another reason for criticism. And this is in the context of a certain loss of electoral support and a situation where Moscow preferred to bet on another candidate. In general, this is a clear demonstration that at least Adgur Ardzinba’s team is not particularly familiar with the concept of political technology. Which, against the backdrop of previous scandals with his person, definitely doesn’t add points to him. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🗡 Supporters of the presidential candidate of Abkhazia Adgur Ardzinba called on the population to take up arms if the residents of the country do not elect a connoisseur of Sochi luxury as head of state. - Let it not they forget that we are a fighting people, we have weapons that maybe...	https://t.me/rybar/67607	2025-01-30T05:50:04-08:00

Against this backdrop, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are discussing the possibility of holding an emergency summit of the League of Arab States (LAS) to issue a statement of disagreement with Trump's proposal. Egypt and Jordan quite rightly fear that accepting a large number of residents of the Gaza Strip will jeopardize their own safety. Egyptian officials have repeatedly said that Palestinian militants could launch attacks on Israel, which would provoke an Israeli response.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Trump's eccentric statements and proposals are his thing. This became clear from his first term. What are the words about Canada, what are the words about Greenland, these proposals for the resettlement of Palestinians - all this looks unlikely in the short term. More importantly, Trump declared before coming to power that his policy would be focused on the United States and only the United States, but in In recent days he has been more concerned about Israel's interests. The expulsion of several tens of thousands of illegal immigrants is a drop in the ocean of the American migration problem. But in the Gaza Strip, Trump proposes to resettle the Palestinians, has authorized the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, and will meet with Netanyahu on February 4. It is clear whose interests are more important. Although if we remember that the conditional half of Trump’s cabinet are Chabadniks - supporters of the ultra-Orthodox ruling in Israel - everything, in principle, falls into place. #Israel #Palestine #USA@rybarSupport UsWSJTrump Doubles Down on Proposal to Relocate Palestinians From GazaThe president expanded on a controversial idea that was rejected by the Arab states and would represent a significant shift in the U.S. policy.	https://t.me/rybar/67606	2025-01-30T05:24:06-08:00

The Axios resource published the news that the United States removed from Israel about 90 Patriot anti-aircraft missiles, which the IDF removed from service last spring. They were taken to the Polish airfield of Rzeszow for subsequent transfer to the so-called. Ukraine.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️We wrote about the high probability of this scenario back in May 2024. In the end, this is what happened.➖➖➖➖➖➖For now we are talking about the delivery of only missiles - the installations themselves will first be sent to the States for repair and maintenance. As the authors point out, the deal was agreed upon by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September. Formally, this is positioned not as a direct supply to the Kyiv regime, but as a -return of systems to the United States.- However, without Israel’s consent in principle, this scheme would not have been possible. The question is whether the missiles will be sent to the Patriots on the so-called. Ukraine in the context of Trump's decree on the suspension of military assistance. Most likely, yes: for such a case, a special exception will clearly be made within the framework of -emergency assistance-. #Israel #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usAxiosScoop: U.S. sending dozens of Patriot missiles from Israel to UkraineGetting more Patriot missiles to Ukraine has been a top priority for the Pentagon.	https://t.me/rybar/67605	2025-01-30T04:32:16-08:00

At least four people may have survived and were pulled out of the water by rescuers. In total, there were 64 people on board the fallen airliner, and the helicopter crew consisted of three military personnel. Information is received that eight figure skaters of Russian origin were among the passengers. 19 bodies were recovered from the Potomac River where the aircraft fell.

Ukraine managed to develop and scale it up: a resource appeared on the Internet that acts as a database of such episodes. The website contains a list of cases of busification, indicating the location, the number of military registration and enlistment office workers who participated in the seizure, and links to the evidence base. Currently, 453 similar cases have already been collected there. The authors are trying to collect information about the abducted, TCC employees and the license plates of the cars they used. A reward is paid for information about this and the provision of exclusive personnel - busification. ➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 It is curious that the creators of the resource mention Gonzalo Lira, a Chilean journalist who was killed in the dungeons of the SBU after two years in prison. There is also the name of an Odessa blogger who became a victim due to criticism of busification and the ban on the Russian language. Against the backdrop of a clear increase in tension in Ukrainian society and its anger towards the TCC, the initiative looks very timely.

Starting from the 2025/2026 academic year, the educational process will be built on the basis of the programs of higher educational organizations in Turkey.➖➖➖➖➖➖Not to say that Turkish universities, gymnasiums and lyceums in the post-Soviet space are a new phenomenon. The Turks, under the auspices of the unity of the Turkic peoples, are trying to consolidate their influence in various spheres, and education is no exception. Take the same foundation - Maarif - and Kyrgyzstan. At the same time, Uzbekistan has demonstrated greater openness to Western universities in the country over the past year. In particular, discussions took place with Japanese, American, British representatives (and all this over the past year).➖➖➖➖➖➖The Turks are intensively strengthening their presence through the OTG. This can be seen in the fact that the efforts of the UTG have already been noted in the CIS countries: a pan-Turkic university, pan-Turkic geography and cartography, a pan-Turkic alphabet, a pan-Turkic economy, and recently they have been involved in military exercises. The intentions of the Turks in the educational environment are quite clear: you want to get a loyal to create a layer for yourself - start small, preparing young people at all stages.

🔁 In this wild story about how Russian and Tatar boys were sente...	Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev In this wild story about how Russian and Tatar boys were sentenced to prison terms for deciding to protect themselves and their friends from an ethnic teenage gang, there are several absolutely outrageous moments. From the very beginning, local law enforcement agencies tried to talk about the detention -skinhead gangs-. That is, nothing was known in detail yet, and the children were called criminals. And they were detained unjustifiably cruelly. And yes, as you understand, one of the skinheads is an ethnic Tatar. And the call sign of his father, who is fighting in the Northern Military District as a volunteer, guess what? Exactly. -Tatar-. These are the creepy Russian Nazis among the security forces in Chelyabinsk. Then, the security forces tried to say that the teenagers had fought over a girl, and there was no other reason for this situation. No ethnic group. From the very beginning of history, the investigation did not notice this ethnic group of migrants. They were considered victims, and no arguments were taken into account that migrant teenagers spread rot on their classmates and kept the school in fear. And, given the influence of diasporas in the Chelyabinsk region, this is not at all surprising. Several times, after I wrote about this story again and again, they tried to explain to me in different ways that the accused Russian teenagers are terrible Nazis, that there is no evidence of the existence of an ethnic group, that all this is incitement. However, time passed, and after an order from the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, it turned out that an ethnic group of hooligans really existed. And its leader was even detained. Well, there are other consequences too. I want to ask all those who talked about the fight over a girl, about the evil Nazis who, for no reason, just out of hatred, decided to beat up the good guys, who said that my fellow journalists were creating a problem out of nowhere. Why are you silent now? Tell Alexander Ivanovich Bystrykin the same thing. Then Vladlen Tatarsky wrote a lot about this case. He wrote that sentencing the teenagers risks being a verdict of justice if the ethnic group is never noticed by the security forces. As a result, two years later, they noticed. Sincere thanks for this. And one more thing. Even if Chelyabinsk schoolchildren were not entirely right somewhere, these are our children. And we, adults, must protect our children. Obliged. And thanks to those who did not retreat over these two years and continued to write about this story. And to those adults, men and women, who from the first day began to fight not for children, not for justice, but exclusively for bureaucratic self-preservation, and say -nothing. Their dishonesty will remain with them forever.TelegramOperation Z: Russian Military Correspondents Spring‼️🇷🇺🏴‍☠️ A gang of migrant children in a Chelyabinsk school established their own rules, beat, extorted money and robbed children ▪️ Having received a rebuff from Russian schoolchildren, the scumbags began to complain about alleged oppression because of their nationality. ▪️On instructions from the Chairman...	https://t.me/rybar/67596	2025-01-29T22:58:30-08:00

Today, Ukrainian planes took off en masse from several airfields in the central and eastern part of so-called Ukraine. In total, at least 6-7 units of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters, as well as at least one F-16 fighter, were observed in the air. blocked, but there were no strikes. Nevertheless, the fighter flight routes were typical for the launch of cruise missiles over Russian territories, as indicated by several signs.▪️The aircraft took off from four airfields at once: the MiG-29 and Su-27 took off from Cherkassy, ​​Mirgorod and Kanatovo, and the F-16 from Vasilkov airfield. They all made their way towards Dnepropetrovsk and the southern part of the Kharkov region, after which some turned around, and some disappeared from radar near Dnepropetrovsk, possibly landing at a local airfield.▪️This route is used when launching cruise missiles over the eastern part of Crimea, the Crimean Bridge , Krasnodar Territory and Rostov Region. Those that returned to Mirgorod most likely served as cover and conditionally practiced launching decoys.▪️ As for a possible landing in Dnepropetrovsk, this is what the Su-24M did during strikes last year. We refueled and then departed back to the departure airfield. At the same time, Su-24M bombers did not take part in today’s training. But during the last launches in the Kursk region, they took off from the Cherkassy airfield, which was involved in the event today.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️One way or another, there were no missile attacks for a long time, so we cannot exclude the fact that the attack is a preparation to a massive raid, especially taking into account the nature of the actions of the Ukrainian air forces. We do not rule out that the Su-24M will either fly to Cherkassy before the strike, or will land after the missiles are launched, and the F-16 will provide cover. And right now, an air threat has been introduced in Crimea and Sevastopol, which indicates the presence of cruise missile carriers in the air.

The example of Syria showed that one cannot rely on only one partner. Moreover, we have something to offer our Algerian colleagues, taking into account the historical experience of relations.▪️Since Soviet times, military-technical cooperation between countries has become an integral part of the relationship: in recent years, Algerians have purchased T-90 tanks and Su-30MKA fighter jets from Russia.▪️Deepening military-technical cooperation with Algeria creates fertile ground for resolving contradictions in the Sahel, where the Russian African Army operates corps, helping local authorities resolve the conflict with the Tuaregs. The latter enjoy the support of Algeria.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️For this reason, intensifying contacts with Algeria is a very important step in expanding Russia’s field of activity (especially taking into account the fact that the military-technical cooperation group led by Sergei Surovikin is constantly working in the territory countries).

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide💸🇺🇦🇺🇸 Ukrainian journalists are crying all over the Internet: they have not received salaries from American grants for almost a week. The head of the NGO Institute of Mass Information, Oksana Romanyuk, said that nine out of ten Ukrainian media existed through grant funding, so Bely’s decision at home, the suspension of aid literally means the cessation of activities. According to Romanyuk, almost 90% of Ukrainian media worked on grants - regional publications receive advertising revenues of only 3-10%, so the current situation may lead to a weakening of control over power through the media. We don’t readily believe it. By the way, the Zelenskys also feed on USAID money: the projects -digital state- and -Diya- (analogue of State Services) were created and financed by the American foundation, like all humanitarian -programs- of Elena Zelenskaya in schools.🔻US President Donald Trump signed a decree on the suspension assistance to other countries for 90 days to review the relevance of these programs to US foreign policy goals. At the same time, despite the rather populist decision, it was immediately followed by a negative reaction from the entire Kyiv gathering: even in the office of the President of Ukraine they indicated that this was unexpected and unpleasant news. By the way, the Trump administration has already made concessions in the application of the decree and allowed continue the delivery of vital humanitarian aid.

As a result of negotiations with his Turkish colleague, Brigadier General Çatal Erdogan adopted a military cooperation plan for 2025. It provides for issues of cooperation in military education, peacekeeping, and combat training.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻This agreement is, as they sang in one famous song, another brick in the wall of building military cooperation between members of the UTG. Throughout 2024, we observed the growing participation of Kazakhstan in Turkey’s military maneuvers. And this trend continued in 2025. The Kysh-2025 exercise, taking place in Kars province, continues today. Both Kazakh and Uzbek military personnel are participating in it. And since a new plan for this year has been adopted between the countries, this kind of interaction will be observed more and more often. The Turks’ idea is for the Organization of Turkic States to turn into a significant supranational bloc that will be like NATO in Central Asia, and Türkiye will be its leader.

Forwarded From Two Majors It is significant that last night Zelensky said: -Every step of his [the Supreme] is aimed at making the war endless.- And at night he sent his drones to oil refineries and nuclear power plants. Lies from Zelensky are common and absolutely unsurprising. But when, at the end of the third year of the war, our next governor, against the backdrop of a burning oil refinery, talks about -fallen debris-, it is still surprising. It looks like a voluntary self-undermining of one’s own authority for the sake of following the mossy instructions of the first year of the war. -Debris-, which miraculously flew to the object, implies the successful operation of the air defense system in the region, the assistance of the refinery management in supplying nearby air defense units, the absence of the need to develop a legal framework for vesting (expanding) the powers of even private security companies or the Russian Guard to use weapons and equipment for protection and refinery defense. Well, if it’s -wreckage-, then you don’t need to do anything. Although another burning refinery hit by a flying whatnot hints at the opposite.

Ukraine, thereby recouping all the costs of conducting the SVO. It’s funny that the source of information was manipulative material from the Kyiv regime with an attempt to justify the need for a multiple increase in Western support and a promise to pay with the resources of Crimea and Novorossiya.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌In fact, Ukrainian propaganda led to the opposite effect: sponsors are not impressed by the numbers produced, and their own figures rejoiced at the far-fetched statistics.➖➖➖➖➖➖In the context of the topic of Ukrainian minerals, we repeat what was said earlier: the methodology for calculating their cost and profitability of production is unknown. Therefore, discussing them in the context of recoupment of military costs is not yet very advisable.

They remain in your memory, even if you don’t specifically think about them, they flash before your mind’s eye in a difficult, decisive moment. It may happen that at the front you happen to meet such a friend - but fighting on the side of the enemy. What feelings will prevail in this case among the Russian Army serviceman? The hero of our comic strip was destined to find himself in such a situation... Synopsis: The Russian army continues to liberate the DPR territories from Ukrainian occupation. Every day, Russian troops overcome the resistance of Ukrainian formations and bring victory closer. The advancement of troops is ensured by the greatly increased professionalism of Russian soldiers and officers, as well as increased technical capabilities. However, no offensive would be possible without the feat of the Russian soldier who fights for his land. Such feats occur every day and all along the front line. And where there is a place for feat, mercy is also possible. After all, in a bloody struggle, not only citizens of a once common country clashed, but also yesterday’s comrades in arms...📌&nbsp;You can download the comic using the links:&nbsp;RU&nbsp;| EN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

First of all, we need to face the truth. The Syrian agenda is now far from the first place among the general public. And not even on the second one. Nevertheless, at the moment, in the Syrian direction, Russia, to put it mildly, has a difficult situation. Despite this, the media are looking at this meeting with hope, including stating that a joint press conference will be held following its results. Of course, no one will come to the microphone and say that everything is bad and there are a lot of unresolved issues remaining. Therefore, even if the press conference takes place, its results will be completely different. That same diplomat, who has vast experience behind him, said briefly about this: A press conference is PR. Concrete things are more important now.	https://t.me/rybar/67544	2025-01-28T02:36:33-08:00

Then we were one step away from resolving the Syrian conflict through negotiations. Neither the Americans nor the Turks could offer anything like this. A skillful combination of military power and military diplomacy opened up the Middle East and Africa for us. Dozens of countries rushed to seek partnership with Russia. A lot has changed since then. Syria has found itself under the rule of yesterday's terrorists; economic projects remain on paper. The leaders of African and Middle Eastern countries are beating on Russia's doors, but they are not receiving answers to their questions. This cannot continue indefinitely. I think that Russia has a couple of years left to decide on its policy. Decisive steps are expected from us. Well, if we miss our chance, then we will have to wait several more decades for the next one. P.S. I am not calling for the transfer of divisions from Kursk.

The head of the presidential administration, Kamil al-Duleimi, says that the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime has become a kind of cold shower - which made people realize that Russia may not come forever. Therefore, in the current realities, as the head of the presidential administration says Iraq, what is needed is not so much Russian economic expansion at the level of private initiatives, but systematic political work by Moscow’s political representatives in Iraq. Because the political work that is being done now, to put it mildly, is not as active as in other countries. Not only the Americans, the British and the Japanese bypass Russian diplomatic representatives, but even the Ukrainians, who knock on all sorts of doorsteps. Relations with all other countries are developing, while relations with Russia stand still. 📌We, of course, are sure that Mr. Kamil ad-Duleimi is mistaken, and our diplomatic mission is much more active than the Ukrainian one.

To answer, it’s enough just to remember all the latest scandals with this organization, as well as scrupulously collected invoice for its activities recently.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻For example, how the SUM pits Muslims against the population and tries on the function of a government agency, allowing polygamy contrary to the position of other Russian Muslim organizations.

At the beginning of January, the capture of the above-mentioned village was announced by the resources of the Russian Ministry of Defense, but a video with Russian fighters from Nadia itself has not yet been released. Despite this, last week footage of drone fire adjustments on retreating units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from a forest belt stretching to the west of the village was published on the Internet. In addition, information received from the field also confirms the liberation of the settlement. The capture of Nadiya made it possible to seriously strengthen the positions of the Russian Armed Forces on the right bank of the Zherebets River, to reduce the pocket located south of the settlement, and also made it possible to conduct further offensive operations to the west. It is possible that the collapse has already occurred, since there are no convenient positions for defense there, with the exception of the Zhelobki forest.

He did not go into details, but this is the first real confirmation of existing agreements between countries. Previously, all information about Iran's purchase of Russian aircraft was discussed in the format of rumors and publications in the format -sources reported-.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Considering that Shamdani finally made this information public, we can expect the appearance of the Su-35 in Iran in the near future. Last year we wrote that some aircraft could be delivered in parts to Iran, where they would be assembled by Russian specialists.➖➖➖➖➖➖This is an important step within the strategic partnership between Russia and Iran, which will further strengthen relations between the countries.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇷🇺 Unfortunately, the most negative (albeit the most predictable) scenario for us is happening in the Baltic Sea. Once again a ship leaving a Russian port was detained and again a fictitious pretext was used related to a cable break. The main problem is that no one presented any evidence of a break in this cable between Latvia and Sweden. All this looks like the security forces of Sweden and Latvia simply released -insider- in the media, which trumpeted it around the world. The pretext was received, and no matter in what way. And all this was done while the ship was passing near the cable. The rule of law no longer plays any role - European countries simply resort to sabotage or racketeering in other words. The only way to secure ships is to organize escort by warships, which is extremely difficult to achieve given the difference in the number of warships and merchant fleets sailing back and forth. But you can hire private organizations, as American shipping companies do. #Baltic #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelTwo Majors⚡️🏴‍☠Pirates of the Baltic Sea are pursuing another ship under the pretext of suspicion of sabotage.

The Swedish Coast Guard ship🇸🇪 is carrying out measures regarding the vessel Vezhen (IMO 9937270, flag Malta 🇲🇹), which left the 🇷🇺Russian port Ust-Luga a few days earlier and was in the area when the undersea fiber optic cable between 🇱🇻Latvia and 🇸🇪Sweden was damaged. The vessel is anchored near the port of Karlskrona🇸🇪 and is awaiting inspection results.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES🪖Military-patriotic education in RussiaIn the context of the topic raised by Rybar about youth education in Russia, one can cite the military-patriotic club -Peresvet- in the city of Sudogda in the Vladimir region, where many of our colleagues come from. This is the only military-patriotic club where combat unit instructors come and conduct combat coordination, tactics, parachute training, engineering training, work on FPV and quadcopters. Children who join the club learn everything directly from those who participated in combat or operations. In particular, these are combat units from special operations forces or from airborne units of the Special Forces. Currently, classes are conducted in 16 areas, ranging from combat and fireworks to tactical, mountain and engineering training, as well as the basics of using UAVs (FPV drones , copters, UAVs such as -wing-) and even communications equipment -Azart-. Direction 17 is planned to be launched - basics of engineering design, 3D modeling and 3D printing, which is especially important in our time. The same drones and copters are assembled with great ease on 3D printers. The exclusivity of the center lies in its unique approach and teaching. Disciplines are being studied in stages, focusing on the age of the children. For the younger group - in a simplified form, so that the children find it interesting. The older the group, the more complex the material, such as shooting from military weapons in a fire training course or piloting real drones that are used in the air defense. And upon leaving for the troops, a person already has a huge knowledge base for serving in the army. And another feature of the club is that all training is carried out with an emphasis on real combat operations, there is drill in the club, but purely for the development of discipline and outlook, because this is also necessary in the troops, but to a lesser extent. The main emphasis is on combat operations. And the final test of knowledge and skills is a large-scale field trip with a very deep immersion in a simulated combat environment, taking into account the experience of the military. And upon graduation, a person has a huge amount of knowledge, which will be useful both for military service in the army and for contract service in special forces units. In addition to all this, children are being raised, correct values ​​are being formed, and even if a person does not want to connect his life with the army, people will leave the club more prepared for the reality of adult life than others.

Tusk pointed out - possible consequences - if Orban will continue to oppose sanctions against the Russian Federation as opposed to more obedient ones colleagues. Allegedly, this will prove that he -plays- on the side of Russia, and not Europe. In response, Szijjártó said that Tusk, apparently, has a hard time understanding that the Hungarians have Hungary in first place and they -play for the national team-, protecting their interests .📌 As you can see, pressure on the governments of Slovakia and Hungary has been especially increasing recently, and not only because of their similar policies regarding the so-called. Ukraine, but also due to their position against the importation of migrants. At the same time, any speech by Fico or Orban that does not correspond to the generally accepted European course is broadcast as an anti-Ukrainian view.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for the morning of January 26, 2025▪️ All week, the world political Olympus was burning with passions about the possible negotiation process on Ukraine. It is absolutely pointless to study the statements of the Ukrainian side in this vein, since Zelensky, who is illegally in power, is clearly not interested in Moscow, and Kyiv, devoid of subjectivity, happily grunts at any news from Washington. Moscow, like all the years of the war, talks about its readiness for negotiations, while no one mentions stopping hostilities. The Russian army is moving west with heavy fighting. ▪️ The Trump team, having firm intentions to promote a peaceful settlement, is still drawing knowledge about the true situation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, allegedly either from Kyiv, or from the media, or from the reports of the old White House team, this can be seen from the jumping estimates of losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which differ in statements Washington has from 80 thousand to a million people, which indicates poor knowledge of the real situation. ▪️ The only real step taken by the Trump team was the cessation of funding for Ukraine through the American enemy USAID, which feeds not only social projects, but also a network of grant eaters. It is significant that the move was made after Peskov’s statement about his readiness for negotiations and waiting for -signals- from the United States. However, now there is a redistribution of cash flows in the states themselves, and USAID is still associated with the structures of the US Democratic Party.▪️ Trying to portray a strong position, Zelensky last week increased drone strikes on Russian refineries, the Armed Forces of Ukraine skillfully exploited the holes in our air defense system. The repeated attack on the oil refinery in Ryazan, already attacked this week, was indicative. However, Kyiv’s media attacks, although they collectively cause significant damage to our country, are not able to affect the situation at the front, where the Russian Army retains the initiative. ▪️ An important event was the liberation of Velikaya (Bolshaya) Novoselka by Far Eastern soldiers; the fighting in this (Vremevsky) direction lasted for more than a year. It was possible to block the enemy units, who asked their command for an order to withdraw, but never received it. In the Kursk region, which the enemy is constantly pumping up with reserves, there are heavy oncoming battles; at great cost it is possible to achieve advancement in the tactical zone, exhausting enemy forces in high-intensity battles. The Kupyansk direction is characterized by the expansion of our bridgeheads on the right bank of the river. Oskol near the village Western and Dvurechnoe. The liberation of the Clock of Yar is approaching, but the enemy remains combat resilient even after the fall of its main defense center at the Refractory Plant. From Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) at night there was news about successes on the northern outskirts of the city (the village of Krymskoye); in the next few days, official statements about the liberation of the city, in which the most difficult and bloody battles were taking place, are likely. The next large city is Konstantinovka. The Russian Armed Forces are approaching it from the direction of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk): fighting is going on north of Vozdvizhenka at the junction of the Pokrovsk-Konstantinovka highway. Pokrovsk itself has not yet been stormed by our troops: there is a slow envelopment from the southwest through the village. Kotlino. West of Kurakhovo, our troops are trying to close the pocket that crowns the enemy garrison in Constantinople. The Zaporozhye Front and the Kherson direction are characterized only by mutual strikes, although it should be noted that there are about 5-7 km left to Orekhov, the city is under attack by our troops.▪️ Testing of almost all types of weapons and equipment of NATO countries continues in Ukraine. Trophies from the Kursk region are increasingly less represented by Soviet models; new examples of even small arms, the production of which Europe is putting on stream, are increasingly being found. The government departments of the EU countries clearly indicate the date for the start of the war with Russia - 2029. Military preparations and the deployment of production are in full swing, albeit to the detriment of social programs and the standard of living of those same Germans. It is pointless to wait for changes in governments with a wave of popular anger - the example of Ukraine shows how modern information technologies make it possible to brutalize people, reducing their level of critical thinking to the level of animals.

Units of the Russian Armed Forces liquidated the boiler in the central and southern parts of the village. The Russian flag was raised above the building of the district hospital, which confirms the cleansing of most of the village. At the same time, banners were also installed on a multi-story building in the north of the village. It is not yet known whether the surrounded members were captured or destroyed. The enemy presence remains only in the northwestern part of Bolshaya Novoselka, the long-term defense of which is problematic due to supply difficulties. Probably, after the liberation of the village, the Russian Armed Forces will begin to attack in the direction of Novocherevatoy and Privolny - the Armed Forces of Ukraine are already evacuating local residents from these villages.⭐️ Online- maps are available by subscription to map.rybar.ru#digest #map #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67471	2025-01-25T11:09:32-08:00

Although even yesterday’s schoolchildren with little life experience are often perfectly capable of recognizing where attempts to teach them something are being openly misled on ears and chase blizzard.➖➖➖➖➖➖🔻When words about patriotism are heard from the screens, and domestic social networks with services massively block relevant content, turning a blind eye to pro-Ukrainian content.

Yesterday, protests took place in several cities of Slovakia against, as the Western media unanimously put it, the position of Prime Minister Robert Fico regarding Russia. His opinion on several issues has long caused irritation among his more flexible colleagues. Thus, the politician spoke out against the membership of so-called Ukraine in NATO, called for stopping funding for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and called the undermining of the Nord Streams a terrorist attack. Therefore, the actions of the Slovak Prime Minister meet resistance over and over again: previously there were attempts on his life, and now protests have been launched, which Fico called an attempt at a coup.➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, according to our colleagues from Slovakia @casusbellilive, these rallies are the cause of the coup they won’t - it’s not the right scale. But it cannot be ruled out that sooner or later the card of repression against the opposition may be played to remove Fico.➖➖➖➖➖➖What is clear for sure is that in any development of events, one way or another, words about the -Ukrainian trace- will be heard: Zelensky’s curators will again present the persecution of the prime minister as a confrontation between the Slovak and Ukrainian authorities. However, the next step is up to Fico - and so far he is holding the blow quite well confident.#Slovakia #protests@rybar together with @casusbelliliveSupport usReutersSlovak protests build in rebuke of PM Fico's Russian tiltTens of thousands of protesters gathered in a central square in the Slovak capital on Friday, waving banners opposing Prime Minister Robert Fico's policy shift closer to Russia after tensions between the government and the opposition rose.	https://t.me/rybar/67468	2025-01-25T08:43:49-08:00

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, Russian troops continue to destroy pockets of resistance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Dzerzhinsk. At the moment, battles are taking place for control of the Toretskaya mine, which is already half controlled by the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️Also throughout the week, evidence was received confirming significant success in the village of Krymskoye located near the mine, which is closely adjacent to the development of Dzerzhinsk. In fact, the enemy remains to be knocked out of only a few streets of the village.▪️In the western part of the city, the Russian Armed Forces have completely occupied the Khimkolonka microdistrict, but the waste heaps are still partially under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In neighboring Shcherbinovka, attack aircraft are gradually expanding the zone of control in the northern direction.▪️ At the same time, the civilian population of Gorlovka is suffering greatly from enemy shelling and drone strikes.

A project called ERAM (announced back in 2022) aims to create anti-ship missiles using Western air-launched technologies. Enemy resources report that the Ukrainian military command is considering the use for these purposes of 🇺🇸American QuickSink technology, which is an aerial bomb (weighing from 230 to 960 kg) with the already known JDAM control and correction module, only modified to hit ships. The technology will allow directing a projectile at moving and maneuvering surface targets at a range of up to 80 km.✨It is significant that that all Ukrainian developments from BECs/UAVs to missiles and situational awareness systems represent alterations and adaptations of Western technologies that NATO countries⚡️ are testing at the Ukrainian training ground. This means that the ERAM project has a chance to be implemented using American or another NATO country’s technology, which has not yet been tested in a real battle against warships.

Unlike the previous release, this one since the whole event was much better organized: a significant number of the population was gathered in a protected area, in the center of it a stage was built, and a separate place was allocated for Red Cross vehicles. The hostages themselves, dressed in military uniforms, were brought onto the stage by the militants with a poster praising the Palestinians' war with Israel. And all this was watched both by a crowd of thousands of gathered civilians and by the lenses of cameras located in several places at once. 🔻The purpose of such a ceremony is simple - to demonstrate the strength of Hamas and the general support of the movement from the population.

Thus, consisting of -prisoners Conscience of the Assad regime prisons - the organization - Civil Peace - published a statement to the public, where it criticized - cases of attacks on civilians, detentions of innocent people and acts of violence, humiliation and theft of property. Human rights activists paid special attention to the arbitrariness of the security forces during the ongoing military campaign against the remnants of the Assad regime, the victims of which are often civilians. Alawites, Shiites and Christians fall under the hand of the new mukhabarat.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖Let us recall that the so-called. -The Syrian revolution- is in fact a hodgepodge of various military-political factions, whose hatred of each other may outweigh the need to unite for a common goal. Now, after the overthrow of the government of Bashar al-Assad, it is no longer there, and even more so.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In this case, such statements are interesting both in the context of growing dissatisfaction with the opponents of the previous regime among civilians with the new one, and the existing contradictions between the factions that were offended the fact that the new authorities do not take their interests into account. Of course, for the Syrian conflict this is not something out of the ordinary; groups have constantly fought among themselves for control over territories, and the same protests in the liberated north (Idlib and border areas of Aleppo) against pro-Turkish and terrorist administrations are not uncommon.

During the last offensive actions, they managed to place a beautiful stick (seriously a stick) in the populated area of ​​Tormasale.

Trump has gradually begun to face what he already dealt with during his first term as president - his executive orders are being challenged in the courts and winning. Yesterday, a federal judge in Seattle suspended the president's executive order intended to limit the right to birthright citizenship. The judge's decision is conditional because the decree goes against both the constitutional amendment itself, adopted in 1868, and the history of its interpretation by American courts for more than 100 years. It is noteworthy that this is not the only lawsuit - human rights organizations and the leadership of several cities and 22 states have already appealed to federal courts. In a word, in this area the Trump administration will face chaos - the implementation of new decrees will go through the cracks, will not affect everyone and will meet fierce resistance from opponents of the current president.➖➖➖➖➖Under these conditions, Trump’s decisions will gradually begin to take on the contours of a populist character - more about them loudly stated, but their implementation will be very lame. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramRybar🇺🇸 About the first decrees of Donald TrumpThe new US President signed a whole stack of decrees on his first day in office.

During a recent meeting of the Malian Prime Minister with energy representatives, it became known that all assets previously owned by the French TotalEnergies were transferred to Coly Energy Mali. 1,109 employees from the headquarters of TNK, based in France, came under the new company. Previously, the French managed a network of more than 60 gas stations that covered all regions of the country, with the exception of the far north. It would seem that the transfer of French assets under the control of a regional company is a good thing the news is true, there is a fly in the ointment here too. The fact is that the head of this company, Rene Hunsin, is also the president of the board of directors of Global Energium Côte d'Ivoire: it has been operating in Côte D'Ivoire since 2017 and has not shown major success. So, this office is mostly owned by the Dutch holding HEDIA.➖➖➖➖➖➖That is, the Malian authorities handed over one from major players in the energy market into the hands of fairly unknown companies, whose traces still stretch to Europe. It is likely that these assets were simply not in demand by the Chinese or Russia (which is quite strange), but it would not be so difficult to nationalize them, given the course to sever relations with France.#Africa #Mali #energy@rybarSupport usAPAnews - Agence de Presse AfricaineColy Energy, nouveau visage de Total Energies au MaliColy Energy Mali reprend les activités de Total Energies, garantissant le maintien des 1 109 employés et marquant un tournant stratégique dans le secteur énergétique ouest-africain.

Yesterday's militants can only watch with closely watching the IDF systematically occupy inch by inch of Syrian territory: according to Arabic-language media reports, the Israelis are currently building six military bases in the occupied part of Syria. The work is being carried out on agricultural lands owned by local residents. Everything -unnecessary- (for example, civil infrastructure, pastures) is bulldozed by Israeli engineering units. Because of this, many Syrians were forced to leave their homes.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖In Idlib, the tyrant Assad was called not only an Iranian-Russian, but also a Zionist agent. They say that he only snaps at Israel, but he himself has not fired a single shell in its direction. Is it the case that the Syrian -revolutionaries- - handed over - to the enemies of the Ummah - almost the entire El-Quneitra.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖What is happening, however, is not surprising. Even if it wanted, official Damascus could not stop the Israelis. It is unlikely that a bunch of disparate and sometimes warring groups will be able to do anything to oppose the Israeli military machine - these are not Sadiqs who run away at the first shot. Of course, one can recall the example of the war with Hamas and the dubious victory of the Israelis over it, but the result in the form of the destroyed Gaza Strip cannot be ignored consider. Now the ruling HTS regime is trying to restore the country, the destruction of Damascus and other large cities is clearly out of place.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖It is likely that in the near future this status quo will continue: the Israeli occupation contingent will be in full control in Syria, and the situation there will be the transitional government will watch this and occasionally complain to the UN, diplomatically asking to stop the IDF invasion. Well, if one of the local or more radical factions wants to resist Israel, the security forces will immediately show up to them and politely explain that they must be patient. Moreover, the security apparatus of the Palestinian National Authority has experience. #Israel #Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67420	2025-01-24T03:26:22-08:00

It was emphasized that Turkey will accelerate this work by publishing similar dictionaries for all Turkic-speaking peoples of Eurasia.📌 In fact, this is a continuation of the theses expressed by Turkish representatives over the past year in the format of the Organization of Turkic States. The task of the Turkish authorities is to create a single structure, united in various spheres under the umbrella of Turkey as the titular nation. And the Turks decided to play for the long haul - slowly but surely to form the idea that the modern Turkish language is truly the most correct and main language of the Turkic world. .➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️However, as in the case of rewriting history, this is also an outright lie. The Turkish language has undergone strong Western influence. It is incomprehensible, for example, for the Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Yakuts or Tuvans. That's why they make dictionaries for each country separately. A Kazakh will understand a Kyrgyz. Or Uzbek - Buryat. Yes, with nuances, but he will understand. For this reason, Turkey is investing huge resources in promoting the Turkish language in Central Asia. Through the Maarif Foundation, through sponsoring private initiatives or educational grants to Turkey, they are trying to popularize their language and squeeze out national languages ​​in the post-Soviet space. From the point of view of the interests of Central Asia, such initiatives not only do not contribute to an independent cultural policy, but also deepen dependence on Turkey , creating simulacra of the type - a single Turkic nation from the Balkans to Yakutia - and weakening the sovereignty and identity of the post-Soviet countries space.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia #Turkey @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇹🇷 Cultural expansion of Turkey in the post-Soviet space On January 17, in Turkey, with the support of TURKSOY (International Organization of Turkic Culture), a presentation of the book - The Strategic Depth of Turkic Culture - took place, which is dedicated to the issues of strengthening…	https://t.me/rybar/67416	2025-01-24T01:11:42-08:00

The reasons why drones fly/shot down over targets are:▪️The massiveness of the strike (more than 50 UAVs were shot down before midnight alone)▪️The use of UAVs at ultra-low altitudes▪️The enemy’s use of jet (faster) drones, which are becoming more and more numerous. In addition, since drones shoot down directly above targets/at close range from them, our system The country's air defense as a whole requires improvement. And this is normal, there is always a battle of sword and shield. It is necessary and important to start with a situational awareness system (SitaWare, Nettle, Virage tablet), closed modern communication channels, increasing the number of mobile groups, developing cheap and mass-produced small air defense missiles (the West already has such developments). NATO is preparing for a full-scale war with Russia. And if the idea comes into his head that NATO troops will be able to implement the concept of a single disarming strike because of our country’s air defense system, which is not fully decisive for the task, then war will not be avoided.

The Italian publication Ansa writes that Donald Trump in the coming months may begin the process of reducing the American contingent in Europe by 20 thousand troops, which is a fifth of the total number of US armed forces in Europe. Moreover, the American president wants the Europeans to bear the costs of maintaining the remaining contingent, since the United States is a deterrent in Europe, and this, according to Trump, should not be a burden for US taxpayers.➖➖➖➖➖➖Reducing spending in the US military is a logical step that was fully expected with Trump coming to power. Similar measures are planned in the Middle East, specifically in Syria and Iraq.❓Why? The US economy is in a difficult situation. The migration situation is tense, the social situation has deteriorated even more during the years of the Democrats’ rule and their internal political actions, and medicine is on the verge of collapse. The fires in California alone will cost the United States billions of dollars. Trump has a lot of problems within the country that require immediate solutions. Maintaining a large military contingent abroad is a huge burden on the economy, which is already on its last legs. A partial reduction in troop levels will ease some of the pressure on the economic sector. In addition, American troops, in the face of growing problems within the United States with migrants, will be needed more in the United States than in Europe, which is already falling apart.#EU #NATO #USA @rybarSupport usANSA.itTrump vuole tagliare 20mila soldati Usa in EuropaDonald Trump è imprevedibile ma alcune linee guida sul futuro dell'impegno americano in Europa stanno emergendo con una certa chiarezza.

They had journalists working for them, who were engaged in producing the minted format of news. That is, in the format of textual information and propaganda notes that everything is fine. Whoever says that it is bad is the enemy of the Syrian people. The best example was their work during the offensive on Aleppo, when they tried to convince everyone that what was happening was the command’s plan.➖➖➖➖➖➖After the revolution, many different sources appeared (an example of one of the grids in the screenshot) that are engaged in classic media propaganda . They post dozens of photographs from various regions of Syria in which absolutely ordinary things happen. People are engaged in restoration work and live their lives. ❗️Against this background, reports of kidnappings, disappearances of Alawites and Christians fade into the background. After all, something terrible cannot happen in a country where people walk peacefully, which is confirmed by photos and video materials!➖➖➖➖➖➖And this shows a big difference in the approach to information work. Under previous governments, any negative reports seemed to be true because government photo and video reports were consistent. Portraits of Bashar al-Assad or his father flashed everywhere, which was quite annoying to the population, which was falling into poverty more and more every day. Therefore, media services played a significant role in the fall of Assad. And now these same media are creating a picture that everything is good and wonderful in Syria, in order to show the whole world how good the new authorities are for lifting sanctions from Syria.#Syria #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67396	2025-01-23T07:02:01-08:00

If only yesterday there was information about the encirclement of the remaining enemy units in the village, then today the defenders were cut in two in the center of the village. Ukrainian formations cannot retreat to the west in the direction of Vremyevka due to the fact that the bridge has been destroyed, and from the north the enemy is being pushed back from Novy Komar.🔻In the southern part, the remnants of the personnel of the 110th mechanized brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who did not have time to retreat to the northern part of Bolshaya Novoselka, were surrounded . Currently there are calls to force the enemy to surrender in order to save the lives of military personnel abandoned by the Ukrainian command. The operation to clear the populated area is being carried out by attack aircraft from the tank brigade of the 36th Army and marines. ❗️It is worth noting that the settlement suffered severe destruction during the fighting, however, the enemy is trying to cling to positions to the last. In the northern part, there are no complete bridges, but only makeshift crossings, where a Ukrainian Armed Forces infantry squad was spotted yesterday, through which the enemy from time to time tries to cross the river. Such objects are regularly subjected to shelling and bombing from the air.

🔁🖼 🇺🇸The real priorities of US foreign policy after the arriv...	Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸The real priorities of US foreign policy are identified after the arrival of the new administration. The activity of the AUKUS association (🇬🇧Britain,🇺🇸USA,🇦🇺Australia), created on the initiative of the United States to counter 🇨🇳China in the Indo-Pacific region (IPR), is increasing. . Australia has begun its Regional Presence Force (RPD) deployment, which will see the destroyer HMAS Hobart (DDG 39) deployed to Southeast Asia for six weeks to maneuver with allies in the region. On 20 January, HMAS Hobart, with allied AUKUS ships, joined Exercise La Perouse 2025 (conducted by France from 16 to 24 January) in the eastern Indian Ocean around the Indonesian archipelago. 13 ships and 30 naval aviation units from the navies of 9 countries will take part in the exercises: Canada, France, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, 🇬🇧Britain and 🇺🇸USA. Led by the French aircraft carrier FNS - Charles de Gaulle - the naval group will work to ensure security in the Malacca, Sunda and Lombok Straits, which are located on the main maritime logistics routes from 🇨🇳 China. On January 21, the AUKUS countries’ exercises ended in Norfolk (Virginia🇺 🇸), during which tests of the Hugin underwater unmanned vehicle were carried out Superior (Kongsberg company) together with the Video Ray Defender remotely controlled vehicle during combat operations under water and on the seabed. Scenarios for reconnaissance and protection of underwater infrastructure (gas pipelines and communication cables) and neutralization of explosive objects were worked out. In the usual practice of Western countries, such names have the exact opposite meaning. It is significant that the civilian ship Island Pride, equipped with prototype technologies for detecting, tracking and eliminating threats at different depths, was rented for the exercises. On the British side, a special naval unit was involved - the Diving and Threat Elimination Group (DTXG). The accumulated experience will be used during the development of elements of underwater and surface combat operations within the framework of the Australian exercise Talisman Saber 25, which will take place in July-August 2025 in the ITR.✨The development of elements of blocking Chinese logistics in the Indo-Pacific region will take place for at least the next 4 years a priority area of ​​foreign activity for the United States, which is interested in subordinating the Chinese economy to its interests and restraining the country’s development. Aspirations for technical improvement of operations along underwater communications routes are also becoming obvious, which may indicate a long-term trend in future sabotage wars under water.⭐️For Russia, such scenarios mean the prospect of being involved as a tool in the US fight against China, as well as being subject to inclination to one of the competing parties by increasing economic, political and military pressure.

An extremely sensitive situation has developed in Uzbekistan (primarily for local security forces). Some citizens of Uzbekistan at one time renounced Uzbek citizenship in favor of Russian, but no one has ever officially deprived them of their citizenship.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 The point is that it is prohibited to have dual citizenship in Uzbekistan. And people who receive a new one in another country are obliged to renounce the old one by writing a petition, which must be signed by the president of the republic.➖➖➖➖➖➖Apparently, the head of the country in the old days did not sign some of the petitions to renounce citizenship, or perhaps these requests did not reach him at all: it turned out that the new Russians received a Russian passport, but they were never officially deprived of an Uzbek one. This created a stalemate for the security forces, which, upon their arrival, are obliged to detain holders of dual citizenship due to violations of current legislation. Here it is necessary to separately say that we are not talking about low-skilled migrants. We are talking about Russian people who went to Russia and are trying to go on vacation to relatives, volunteers who went to fight in the Northern Military District zone, and simply those who decided to live in Russia. The situation is quite dangerous for the simple reason that the Uzbeks, There are many who have renounced Uzbek citizenship in favor of Russian citizenship (including for the sake of serving in the RF Armed Forces). And in fact, their trips to their historical homeland were at risk due to bureaucratic delays.➖➖➖➖➖➖📌Surely, the Russian embassy in Tashkent has simply not yet encountered the massive scale of this problem. But we are confident that the Russian diplomatic mission will promptly sort out the current situation, as this may affect the strategic partnership between the countries.➖➖➖➖➖➖Still, we are talking about Russian citizens who repay their debt to Russia by participating in a special operation to protect Russian interests. And they should certainly be given all possible help and support.#Russia #Uzbekistan@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67391	2025-01-23T03:07:01-08:00

This is what we wrote about a few days ago. It’s as if 2016-2020 never happened, when the current US President made very loud statements on Twitter in the same way, the lion’s share of which remained there. This is Trump’s style of work.

Its name is unknown, since it is a relatively new weapon in the DPRK army. It was presented only in September 2023. It is a 122 mm MLRS, the launcher of which is disguised as a truck. Thus, the RF Armed Forces have already noted the presence of 170-mm self-propelled guns -Koksan-, OTRK KN-23, air defense systems based on -Tor-, ATGM Bulsae-4 and now 122-mm MLRS. The very idea of ​​​​using this type of camouflage could have been borrowed by North Korean engineers in the Middle East. Paramilitary groups in Iraq and Syria regularly converted tankers into ersatz MLRS, but they suffered from low accuracy. Subsequently, the Iranians acquired more modernized versions of the MLRS, as well as the OTRK. For example, Fatah-360 can easily be disguised as a regular truck. In the context of the development of modern technologies, especially unmanned ones, such camouflage is extremely important, as it complicates the search for launchers on the front line and in the rear. #DPRK #Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramBelarusian security officer 🇧🇾Refrigerator?

It is noteworthy that this This is the second scandal in the last 24 hours in which this part appears: earlier a recording was posted online beating a contract soldier by a military police officer using a stun gun. Later the latter was arrested.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖📌 Let's be honest - such episodes are not isolated. Especially if you remember that only those caught in the video become public knowledge.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖This is not always due to the Augean stables of the former Ministry of Defense team. In the conditions of the arrival of a mass of different people from different places and segments of the population with low selection criteria (-there is no mobilization, but people need to be taken somewhere-), it is difficult to completely avoid this.❗️However, all this greatly affects not only the image of the RF Armed Forces in society, but also its completeness. After all, a potential motivated contract worker, seeing such stories, will think several times before going to the selection point. This can be combated, for example, by publicized processes with holding the perpetrators accountable to the letter of the law. Because such characters perceive being sent on assaults as an opportunity to continue to create chaos, just in a new place. #VSRF #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67368	2025-01-22T07:11:22-08:00

It is worth noting here that in Kharkov the Kiev regime has taken tough measures to recruit manpower - from the TCC’s carte blanche for any violence to the police’s plans to capture those liable for military service, for failure to comply with which they will be mobilized themselves. However, as one can judge, these initiatives, together with checkpoints and raids, do not have the desired effect.

Forwarded From Andrey Medvedev The fact that American intelligence services and army special forces have been fighting in Mexico against the cartels for a long time is, in general, no secret. Here it is enough to recall the film -Sicario-. Or go to the DEA website and see the circumstances of the death of agency employees. In every second case there will be punishers present directly or indirectly. The huge border, the virtual absence of federal power in the northern states of Mexico, all this turns the cartels not just into powerful criminal organizations, but, in fact, into political structures. But I would look with interest at the situation when exactly what the American army or marines will fight against cartels, conducting full-fledged military operations.

🇺🇸🇷🇺 Regarding the mission in the Baltic and the use of auton...	🇺🇸🇷🇺 Regarding the mission in the Baltic and the use of autonomous surface platforms, as described by the Two Majors, there is an interesting discussion that has erupted in the West. Many believe that the use of BECs in the Gulf of Finland is supposedly less preferable compared to UAVs due to financial costs. However, cheaper drones are limited in time, unlike even the cheapest BECs, which can be in standby mode for days. The Ukrainian side is actively using BECs for stationary surveillance of Crimea. That is, the drone floats up and simply observes Sevastopol or merchant ships along the route in the Black Sea. And another advantage is their invisibility. UAVs are one way or another detected by air defense systems, and with BECs the situation is much more complicated due to the use of Starlinks.➖➖➖➖➖➖Therefore, NATO’s decision to send BECs to the Baltic is very logical. This is a combat test and a test of their effectiveness. In addition, the Alliance will use unmanned platforms in combination, which will increase efficiency. The types of these 20 drones are not named, but there are also plenty of options. This could be the product of any company that sent its prototypes to the so-called Ukraine for testing in combat conditions. #NATO #USA@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors⚡️In the Baltic Sea, NATO will begin to use unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation (SACT), Admiral Pierre Vandier, announced the transfer of 20 UAVs within a few weeks&nbsp; for use...	https://t.me/rybar/67341	2025-01-21T09:13:25-08:00

Turkish business has been present in Abkhazia for more than a decade, especially in the field coal mining. Turkey is also historically home to a large Abkhaz diaspora, which contributes to the development of bilateral ties. In parallel, the authorities in Ankara tried to implement other projects in the republic, but were not particularly successful. The Turks have a calculated trade turnover with Abkhazia, but its share is only 11%, which is even lower than in previous years.➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖❗️Another thing is that even (not yet) the greatest Turkish influence can be used by Abkhaz political circles in their own interests - to blackmail the Russian leadership with the message - if they don’t help us in Moscow, then we will turn to Ankara! -➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖After all, what prevents the scandalous Adgur Ardzinba from making curtseys to Turkey and negotiating with it? And he has already resorted to similar tricks when he promised not to obstruct the agreement with Russia, but instead organized protests against it. The effectiveness of all this, of course, is questionable.

NATO ships are gradually arriving in the area of ​​the operation to protect shipping in the Baltic, that is, the blockade of the Gulf of Finland - something for which they have been preparing for the last two years during NATO exercises.♦️The hydrographic vessel -Luymes - of the Dutch Navy, and minesweepers have already arrived in Tallinn -Datteln- German Navy and -Croix de Sud- French Navy. The new naval formation is headed by the Dutch frigate -Tromp-. In addition, if we evaluate the statements of the Western media, then additionally in the Gulf of Finland there will be the frigate -Otto Sverdrup - of the Norwegian Navy, the minesweeper -Talivadis - of the Latvian Navy and the auxiliary vessel of the Swedish Navy -Belos-.Grouping aviation, which is officially declared as participating, consists of French aircraft -Atlantic 2- and B-350, as well as the Swedish ASC90 AWACS aircraft or simply Saab 340. However, the Baltics are full of other aircraft, so the declared aircraft are conditional. We think that it is possible to increase the ship group, since the Swedes talked about three ships in the mission, so the number of surface forces is really high for such a small Gulf of Finland.❗️And this is just the beginning. Dear Two Majors write that NATO will send unmanned boats to the Gulf of Finland to monitor the surface and underwater situation. In fact, this will be the first operational use of BECs in a NATO mission format. And they were clearly guided by the experience of Ukraine against the Russian Federation. What is all this for? Of course, not to protect the interests of Russia, but to control all shipping, which in theory could hit the trade routes on which our economy largely depends. And with underwater autonomous platforms, the options for implementing this are a carriage and a small cart. #Russia #Finland #EstoniaGlobalistics - subscribe to the channel	https://t.me/rybar/67331	2025-01-21T04:02:25-08:00

In the context of our yesterday’s publication about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ preparation for a new strike, we decided to note another important nuance. The route of a recent U-2S flight over the southeastern part of the Black Sea ran entirely over the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines. Commenting on the words of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, we noted that overseas partners would benefit greatly from the destruction of gas infrastructure in the Black Sea. This can only be achieved in the same way as with Nord Streams in 2022. Then this weakened Russia’s position in Europe and strengthened the role of the United States, which began to supply liquefied natural gas at inflated prices.▪️In recent months, NATO countries have concentrated on other provocations in the Baltic Sea, personally creating the pretext for the start of the Baltic Sentinel mission and actually occupying the Finnish bay. This was necessary to control the Russian military and merchant fleet.▪️Recently, Ukrainian formations tried to attack one of the branches of the Turkish Stream gas pipeline with drones. Considering the role of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in attacks on the energy infrastructure of the Russian Federation in the hands of the collective West, this would not have been done without approval from above.❗️And now an American high-altitude reconnaissance officer, for the first time since the beginning of the Northern Military District, conducted reconnaissance where both branches of gas pipelines lie. ➖➖➖➖➖➖The West has no problems organizing sabotage under a foreign flag - there are Armed Forces of Ukraine with BECs, including fully submersible ones. There are cargo ships plying to and from the so-called Ukraine. And there are many of them. Loading it with the necessary equipment with swimmers is no problem. So the enemy has plenty of funds.

🇺🇸 About the first decrees of Donald Trump The new US President...	🇺🇸 About Donald Trump's first decrees The new US president signed a whole stack of decrees on his first day in office. The first documents concerned appointments in the administration, including the Cabinet level. However, in addition to this, Trump and his team made decisions: ▪️withdraw from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement; ▪️cancel 78 decisions made during Joe Biden's presidency. It is noteworthy that Trump again granted Cuba the status of a country sponsor of terrorism; ▪️ limit the right to obtain US citizenship by birthright; ▪️ close government programs for gender inclusion and gender reassignment; ▪️ give drug cartels the status of terrorist organizations; ▪️ pardon about 1.5 thousand convicts for protests on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021 year;▪️begin the process of renaming the Gulf of Mexico into the American Gulf;▪️declare a state of emergency on the southern US border to stop the influx of illegal migrants;▪️prosecute former Biden administration officials for illegally disclosing sensitive information;▪️unblock TikTok and allow an American company to own half social networks;▪️adopt a directive ordering the restoration of freedom of speech and -prevent the introduction of government censorship-.🔻Thus, Trump did not repeat his previous mistakes and hesitate with orders. He decided to carry out a kind of political blitzkrieg, before his opponents had time to come to their senses, to conclude secret alliances and repel the new president, as was the case in the period 2017 - 2021. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67324	2025-01-20T23:10:02-08:00

Rybar plays a vital information role: our information gang, our analytical center, chews up what is happening in crisis regions of the world. This is necessary to understand why event A is followed by event B. We respect and value our audience, we recognize both failures and highlight successes. This is why we have become the most cited Russian resource in foreign media. Because our information is reliable and our approach is correct. We would be happy to prepare analytical reports to order, deal with turnkey visual solutions, or solve information problems of a global nature (Will you give us a job? Great, we are ready - you can write to us directly about this). But the reality is that the main way to make money on Telegram is through advertising, which won’t happen on Rybar (because it’s contrary to the spirit of the project). Today, donations and donations make up the bulk of our budget. Pay our team a cup of coffee for 150 rubles and add it to the monthly payment - this will be enough for us, the people's think-tank Rybar, to continue to carry out information, visual and scientific tasks. This is enough for us to develop. 📌Ways of support:▪️ obtain access to our GIS service map.rybar.ru▪️ subscribe to the closed channel @rybar_plus_bot with our reports and notes in the margins▪️ direct transfer to a legal account through SBP▪️ through the donation button on our website rybar.ru▪️ subscribe to the closed section Rybar+ on website▪️ by transfer via cryptocurrency Your @rybar	https://t.me/rybar/67321	2025-01-20T21:24:49-08:00
🇷🇺🇺🇦 Ukrainian formations once again launched drones...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Ukrainian formations once again launched drones into the rear regions of Russia. Smolensk was subjected to a massive drone attack, where a series of explosions occurred in the Zadneprovsky district of the city. Judging by the emerging videos, one of the targets of the raid could have been a local aircraft factory, dating back to 1926. A little more than a kilometer away, an enemy UAV hit the roof of a residential building, causing a minor fire. At the same time, footage of a large fire allegedly on the territory of an oil depot in neighboring Yartsevo is being actively distributed on the Internet. According to local residents, this is nothing more than a fake - the situation around the facility is normal, there is no fire there. 📌It is very significant that the first videos from the oil refinery were published by the small Smolensk channels, created just a few hours ago. However, some of the authors did not bother to check the source and became the distributor of this footage.#Russia #Smolensk #Ukraine @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/67320	2025-01-20T15:44:23-08:00
