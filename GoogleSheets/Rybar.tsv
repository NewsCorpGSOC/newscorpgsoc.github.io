Ukrainian troops are making attempts to improve the tactical situation in several areas. In the Glushkovsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are striking with FPV drones on the engineering equipment of the Russian troops, trying to disrupt the work on establishing pontoon crossings. So far, no attacks have been recorded directly on the pontoons, however, given the distance from the front line, this should be expected soon.🔻In the Korenevsky district, there are battles in the Korenevo and Kremyanoye areas, where Ukrainian formations have been trying to gain a foothold for more than a week. Enemy positions in Lyubimovka and Tolstoy Lug were hit. There is currently no objective data on the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over Apanasovskaya.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, thanks to objective control personnel, the situation east of Sudzha has become clearer. Ukrainian formations carried out a landing in Spalny two days ago. Over the past few days, fighting has continued in the village and on the approaches to it: FPV drones are hitting enemy equipment, personnel, trucks delivering ammunition and other vehicles. Considering today's data from the Russian Ministry of Defense on repelling attacks in the area of ​​the settlement of Borki east of Spalnoye, fighting in the latter is probably still ongoing.

The Chinese spoke out against it, the Americans did not remain silent either, but there was some semblance of the status quo. This year everything changed dramatically, as another arena of confrontation appeared, where the Americans are actively consolidating their presence. And we are talking, as you may have guessed, about Australia and the Philippines. ▪️The other day, three B-2A strategic bombers flew to Amberley Air Base on the east coast of Australia. This is the first business trip to this continent in two years. How long their presence in Australia will last is still unclear, but given their flight in the coming years, we should certainly expect some joint events within the framework of -containing China-.▪️Especially now, on the southern borders of the Celestial Empire there are already there is a significant aviation group, including F-22A fighters in Australia, anti-submarine P-8A, MQ-9A and MQ-1C drones in the Philippines. This despite the fact that the Philippines already has French Rafale aircraft, and in Italian fighters -Typhoon- are stationed in Australia. Also as part of joint exercises in the region. We’ll see where all this leads, but China’s reaction is already noticeable in the increase in the number of combat aircraft in the direction of Taiwan and the South China Sea. The number of fighters at southern air bases has increased and even bombers have been relocated closer. Whether the collective West will conduct any new mass exercises is currently unclear, but such activity of the US Armed Forces and allies has definitely affected the stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

Forwarded From The Devil Walks in Dixie❗️🇺🇦🇷🇺The Verkhovna Rada adopted in the second (and final) reading a bill banning religious organizations associated with the Russian Orthodox Church. This provides grounds for an immediate ban on the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church. As my colleagues and I expected just a couple of days ago, this happened in an accelerated manner (the first reading of the document took place, we recall, last year) is clearly not without reason and is another step back for attempts to organize any -or peace negotiations. However, according to the adopted law, UOC communities will have nine months to -sever ties with the Russian Orthodox Church-. This somewhat delays the moment of official reprisal against believers and clergy, leaves the opportunity for the Ukrainian authorities, in the event of a threat of US sanctions for violating freedom of religion, to wag their tail in the right direction in time, but gives a green light to local sectarians and radicals who are already not sitting quietly since the beginning of hostilities.#Ukraine #Russia@dixi_devil - keep your eyes openTelegramRybar☦️🇷🇺🇺🇦 A new step towards banning the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox ChurchThe All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations supported the bill banning the activities of the UOC - earlier it was proposed to the Verkhovna Rada by the so-called president himself .

Today we will talk about Finland. Yesterday, two tactical flight trainings began on the territory of Suomi, lasting only a few days - Hela-2024 and Joint Fires-2024.▪️The first exercise takes place in the area of ​​Oulu airbase in central Finland off the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Only cadets on Hawk and Grob training aircraft are involved in it. The event is completely standard with quite ordinary tasks - to train pilots to fly in conditions of a full-fledged conflict with an emphasis on performing maneuvers at extremely low altitudes.▪️The second training is more interesting in geopolitical terms. In addition to four F/A-18 fighters of the Finnish Air Force, F-35As of the US and Norwegian Air Forces are participating, which flew to the Pirkkala base in the south of the country. Pilots from the three countries are currently flying in the Helsinki area and over the Gulf of Finland to increasing interoperability and interaction between NATO military personnel. Something completely outstanding is not happening yet. However, due to the lack of hot information about the actions of the Finnish troops, in the chats of both Russian and Finnish residents (they dream of everything returning to normal), they started talking about a possible thaw in relations. But whether it is worth counting on this can be assessed by the nature of such training, as well as planned events on the official website of the Finnish Defense Ministry. Finland is a NATO member, so such exercises (sometimes even provocative) will be regular.

The initiator was the Commission to Investigate Facts of Foreign Intervention. The appeal states that the British Council, under the guise of humanitarian projects, carries out intelligence activities in the Russian Federation, and the media corporation Deutsche Welle, recognized as a foreign agent, not only actively produces information saboteurs, including Russian journalists, but also carries out anti-Russian media actions.📌 Let's add a few touches to the portrait of the British Council.▪️The organization reports directly to the British Foreign Office and conducts its activities in different countries under the guise of cultural formation, through which language exams are also conducted. However, it is obvious that organizations with such a profile are a convenient tool for shadow activities or recruitment in host countries. ▪️Back in February of this year, it turned out that employees of a British government organization were engaged in military intelligence in the Kherson region. In particular, they tried to recruit local residents, including trying to obtain information from their loved ones through Ukrainian refugees in the UK. And in times of peace, the British Council launched a vigorous activity in Russia, literally recruiting everyone around the liberal LOMs, who happily began working for foreign intelligence, for which they now receive the status of foreign agents. It is known that the British Council is one of the main parts of the multi-level anti-Russian a network of influence agents overseen by the British government. The tasks of organizations include (and have been for many years) not only the search and training of loyal personnel, but also their cultivation at the selection stage. Thus, Great Britain managed to acquire into its arsenal a mass of trained journalists, activists, sociologists, political scientists and other specialists who openly promote Russophobic policies. Therefore, banning the activities of such a structure is a completely logical step on the part of the Russian authorities. #Great Britain #NGOs #Russia @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport usTelegramState Duma Commission to investigate foreign interference❗️Chairman of the State Duma Commission to investigate facts of interference of foreign states in the internal affairs of Russia Vasily Piskarev told reporters about sending the commission to the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation of materials about the anti-Russian activities of a number of foreign...	https://t.me/rybar/62925	2024-08-20T04:34:49-07:00

In the Kursk region, the tense situation continues along the entire front line. The enemy is attacking with columns of armored vehicles in various areas, coming under fire from armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces and aviation.🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations are trying to strike at pontoon crossings, including with FPV drones. The enemy publishes satellite images, claiming that he managed to disable one of the two crossings on the Seim River.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces once again attempted to gain a foothold in the village of Korenevo. A column of Ukrainian armored vehicles even managed to drive along the highway on the eastern outskirts of the village in the direction of Nikipelovka, where it was destroyed by precise strikes by the FAB from the UMPC.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the configuration of the front in the Malaya Loknya area was clarified. The forward positions of the Russian troops came under fire from the Marder 1A3 infantry fighting vehicle of the 95th airborne brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Thus, the Russian Armed Forces are currently holding lines in the area of ​​Nikolaevka and Staraya Sorochina. North of Russky Porechny the front configuration has also been clarified. Apparently, after the armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were attacked by FPV drones in the village itself, the Ukrainian formations managed to travel further to the north. Today, airstrikes were carried out on enemy positions in the forest near the village of Nechaev. To the southwest, several enemy armored cars were able to reach the village of Russkaya Konopelka. This is probably the same equipment that was recently attacked in the Agronom farm by FPV drones. The Ukrainian Armed Forces were ambushed, at least one of the vehicles was destroyed at point-blank range by fire from a BTR-82A autocannon.

Last night, Israeli fighter jets carried out an air raid on the town of An-Nabi Shit in the Lebanese Bekaa Valley, located more than 60 km from the border. According to the press service of the Israel Defense Forces, the target was a weapons warehouse. The commander of the Hezbollah missile unit, Hussein Ali Hussein Suleiman, was also killed. The group's media resources officially acknowledged the death of the fighter, but did not report his combat status. In response to the Israeli airstrikes, Hezbollah fired rocket salvoes into northern Israel. About 60 munitions were fired into the Upper Galilee and Golan Heights. Some of the missiles were intercepted by air defense systems, the rest fell into wastelands. There were no casualties.🔻 The incident as a whole fits into the particular situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border: the IDF hits Hezbollah targets, which in response shells northern Israel, only sometimes leading to the death of Israeli reservists.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62921	2024-08-20T03:35:23-07:00
🌍🇺🇸 About the problems of US foreign policy in Africa and the ...	🌍🇺🇸 About the problems of US foreign policy in Africa and the lack of demand for PMCs in the American magazine IM-1776, an interesting article was published by a former analyst on West Africa of the US Armed Forces, Brendan McNamara. In it, he criticizes the American approach to working with African partners and even gives recommendations on what to do to return the Sahel countries to the orbit of Western influence.▪️The expert’s main complaint is that American foreign policy is too bureaucratic and does not allow flexible decisions to be made when the situation requires it. In addition, a condescending attitude prevents Americans from building relations with African countries.▪️The article also again raises the topic of the American-French confrontation in Africa. The expert complains that instead of replacing the French by promptly helping African partners solve security problems, the American authorities limit themselves to formalities such as military cooperation agreements, without which it is impossible to deploy troops and equipment on the territory of third countries. As a result, the palm is taken by more efficient partners, who at the same time treat Africans with respect and are not associated with the colonial past, like representatives of the West.📌Well, according to McNamara, the way out of the situation should be PMCs and government orders for work in Africa.▪️Via analysis of the work of the PMC -Wagner-, he comes to interesting conclusions that go beyond the American narrative. Thus, he rightly notes that - no matter how painful it may sound, the Russian PMC has become a stabilizing factor in the Central African Republic. Having proven themselves on the battlefield, they will be able to prove that Americans are also capable of fighting against terrorists. I remember the (allegedly unclaimed) experience of American PMCs in Iraq and other regions, where they have already proven themselves to be quite effective formations.🔻Despite completely logical arguments and assessments of objective reality, rare for American journalism, the conclusions in the article boil down to one thesis - give orders PMC-. Against the background of many years of demonization in the Western press of the Wagner PMC and not yet forgotten scandals involving, for example, Blackwater operators (which is why they had to rebrand), convince the ruling circles of the White House to openly and massively use the services of PMCs, and even according to the Russian principle, it will not be so simple. But through this and other similar publications, including the well-known Erik Prince (by the way, in the same magazine), we already see a designated request from the community of retired military personnel and a call to the authorities to quickly provide them with work. Given the number of hot spots in the world, it is likely that this request will begin to be granted. #Africa #Sahel #USA @rybarSupport UsIM—1776How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love PMCsCan America’s Counter-Terrorism Strategy in West Africa be Salvaged?	https://t.me/rybar/62920	2024-08-20T02:24:49-07:00
🔁 🇹🇯 Accusations, betrayals and political squabbles: about the...	Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🇹🇯 Accusations, betrayal and political squabble: about the split in the foreign opposition of Tajikistan The other day it became known that the Reform and Development Movement of Tajikistan (DRRT), led by Sharofiddin Gadoev, left the National Alliance of Tajikistan (NAT). 🔻NAT is a pointedly anti-Russian structure, which, for example, called on Dushanbe to leave the CSTO and accused the dictatorial regime of Russia of the murder of Navalny. Now in NAT, created in 2018 and recognized as terrorist in the country, there are only three organizations left: -Congress of Freethinkers of Tajikistan - and -Congress of Central Asian Migrants - and the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT). The latter participated in the political life of the country and was elected to parliament until it was banned in 2015 and declared terrorist. 🔻The specific reason for DRRT leaving the Alliance is unknown, but it is obvious that the opposition did not share power. Previously, party leader Gadoev accused the IRPT of inefficiency and instilling a personality cult of its chairman Muhiddin Kabiri in the NAT, as well as usurpation of power: 75% of the seats in the NAT political council were taken by representatives of the IRPT. In response to demands for equal representation, Gadoev was accused of abuse of power and treason. The latter was reported by oppositionist Saidyunus Istaravshani living in Iran, whom Gadoev suspected of working for the intelligence service of the Islamic Republic.🔻Who did Gadoev betray? According to investigators, it was he who in September 2021 contacted the ex-chairman of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan (DPT), Saidjafar Usmonzoda, who was arrested in June of this year, promising financial support and assistance from militants from radical groups from the IRPT in the event of a coup. 🔻It must be said that in recent years the leader of DRRT has been really lucky: in 2015, after the murder in Turkey (as the opposition believes, as a result of betrayal) Umarali Kuvvatova Gadoev took over control of Group 24. This is a large opposition structure of the liberal (by local standards) wing. In 2019, Gadoev, who was kidnapped in Moscow by State Committee for National Security officers, was released within 2 weeks after pressure from Western human rights activists. Carnegie Endowment expert Galia Ibragimova also points out that the leader of the DPT was loyal to the Rahmon regime and belonged to the Farkhor (Kulyab) clan, which includes such figures as the ex-mayor of Dushanbe Mahmadsaid Ubaidullayev and the head of the State Committee for National Security Saimumin Yatimov. President Rahmon himself is a representative of the Dangara clan, but without the help of the Kulyab clan he would hardly have been able to build a regime and restore order after the civil war. The lack of reliable support explains why, in anticipation of transit, the ruling family of Tajikistan organizes the imprisonment of literally everyone. Hence the accusations of betrayal by Islamists against Gadoev: their plans do not include maintaining in power in Tajikistan figures related to the previous regime. And DRRT, like the rest of the liberal groupings in the NAT, in this configuration look like -sent Cossacks-. Their task is to block the activities of those structures that pose a real danger to the Tajik elite. This also explains why Gadoev needed equal representation in the NAT. At the same time, with the help of the liberals, one can maintain contacts with the West and ensure one’s own security if Rahmon and his family lose power. The split in the foreign opposition only increases the likelihood of successful transit and reduces the West's chances of interfering in it. It is to be expected that NAT will soon be completely disbanded. #Tajikistan #CentralAsia@pezdicide no chemicals - just factsfergana.plusGadoev’s movement withdrew from the coalition of Tajik opposition forces in Europe	https://t.me/rybar/62919	2024-08-20T01:34:02-07:00

The goal of the program is to include the small states of Europe into the single cultural space of the EU. However, the total budget of the project is covered by contributions from the participating countries, which in return receive opportunities to promote projects in Europe.▪️Minister of Culture of Moldova Sergiu Prodan admitted that over several years of participation in the EU-Creative Europe program, the Republic has made contributions of more than €400 thousand. , but in the end she received only €38 thousand for the implementation of her projects. Because of this, the Moldovan government decided to leave the program.▪️However, Prodan blames this exclusively on the Moldovan society, which turned out to be not mature enough to take advantage of the opportunities that opened up. ▪️-The backwardness of Moldavian cultural circles seems to be expressed in the fact that projects about the life of the LGBT community in Eastern Europe were not submitted for grants - this is a real example of one of the applications found. ▪️ Moreover, the European Commission, which oversees the program, is now especially concerned about collecting information about LGBT representatives in the cultural sphere of Europe. 🔻Moldova’s withdrawal from the program and the words of the republic’s Minister of Culture are an excellent example of the contradictory position the state may find itself in on the path to European integration. As a result, the country will have to pay huge sums from its treasury to the EU budget, and in return receive only a small part for its own projects. At the same time, it is imperative to promote the general line in politics, economics and culture, on which the distribution of budgets will depend. However, even for this, Moldova is considered backward by its own leaders. #EU #Moldova @rybarSupport usNewsMaker-Unfortunately, we invested more than we received-.

The enemy is massively identifying IP ranges on our territories and connecting to unprotected video surveillance cameras remotely, viewing everything from private courtyards to roads and highways of strategic importance. In this regard, unless there is an urgent need, it is better not to use CCTV cameras. The use of online dating services is highly discouraged. The enemy actively uses such resources for the legendary collection of information. Military personnel should not open any links (hyperlinks) received from strangers in instant messengers or SMS messages and, if possible, avoid using phones with a large amount of both official and personal information in situations where the enemy can gain physical access to them. It is necessary to control and moderate chats, as well as promptly delete from them the accounts of persons captured by the enemy, as well as the accounts of persons whose phones the enemy has gained access to. Do not post on social networks and instant messengers made on a video recorder of video recordings of trips or conduct broadcasts/streams when driving on highways, where military equipment also moves due to the danger of revealing objects significant to the enemy. Military personnel and representatives of law enforcement agencies are recommended to disable the -People nearby - function in the Telegram messenger, remove all photographs indicating departmental affiliation, change nicknames by which a citizen can be identified as a military serviceman or a representative of a law enforcement agency, check your subscriber numbers through specialized resources that parse phone books. If in the search results your number appears as recorded from third parties in the form -Lyosha FSB- , -Pasha Rosgvardia-, -Misha 123rd regiment-, this number needs to be changed, it is compromised. Employees in the Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod regions are recommended to close their personal data, remove all geotags and linking photos to geolocations on social networks so that the enemy does not could reveal the actual location of the military and security forces. Employees of the energy industry, including the nuclear industry, need to remove their professional affiliation from social networks so as not to come to the attention of enemy intelligence services. It is necessary to disseminate it as much as possible among friends, colleagues, colleagues and relatives. 🎯 @opersvodki	https://t.me/rybar/62917	2024-08-20T00:41:11-07:00
