Ukraine. None of the UAVs were able to hit the railway bridge. Two drones fell near the security post building, slightly damaging the external façade and protective mesh. The third drone flew towards Belaya Berezka, where it crashed in a forest.🔻Against the backdrop of Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on bridges in the Kursk region, some media presented this raid as an attack on a strategic facility. However, the bridge in the Pogarsky district has not been used for a long time, and communication across the Desna passes through both the nearby pontoon crossing and bridges located to the east, including in the Trubchevsk area. However, three kamikaze drones are not enough to destroy such infrastructure, unlike attacks using MLRS. Therefore, a new raid can be considered either as an initial attempt to attack bridges in the Bryansk region, or as an attack on the first target that comes along.

Russian troops are striking with drones and aircraft against columns and positions of Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment, hitting enemy armored vehicles and manpower.🔻The most difficult situation is developing in the Glushkovsky district. In the morning, Ukrainian aircraft destroyed the last bridge in the area across the Seim River in the village of Karyzh. Thus, the evacuation of the population and the supply of a group of Russian troops now entirely depends on the number of boats and the deployment of a sufficient number of pontoons. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are creating conditions for themselves to prepare a bridgehead before an offensive in this area. In the Korenevsky district, the enemy, apparently, made another attempt to enter the village, but was unsuccessful. On the road between Korenevo and Pogrebki, Ukrainian DRGs are operating, laying ambushes on passing vehicles.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces bombed positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the forest south of Kositsa. The enemy is advancing from the village of Agronom in the direction of Russkaya Konopelka, on the way to which a column of armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was attacked by a crew of FPV drones. The enemy continues to post videos from the eastern part of Sudzha, this time near the administration building.

Footage is being circulated online showing that another fuel tank exploded at the scene. Taking into account the complexity of the fire, an emergency regime has been introduced in the Proletarsky district. According to some reports, several firefighting trains were involved in extinguishing the fire, and for the uninterrupted work of firefighters, water was supplied. However, there were no casualties: according to the latest information, 18 employees of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations were injured, 14 of them were provided with outpatient care, the rest were transported to a local hospital due to his burns. #Russia #Rostov #Ukraine @rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/62898	2024-08-19T03:51:25-07:00

In the Hamad residential complex adjacent to Khan Yunis, an Israeli armored personnel carrier opened fire on a group of journalists who were filming the consequences of a ground operation by the Israel Defense Forces in this area. As a result, Journalist Ibrahim Muhareb was killed in the shooting. His colleague Salma al-Qaddumi was wounded in the back; she is currently receiving medical care in the Nasser hospital, where there is practically no medicine left. It is noteworthy that since the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian escalation on October 7, 2023, 167 media workers have been killed in the enclave. In this context, the most resonant was the death last July of nine journalists and 14 members of their families during an air raid on Nuseirat in the central part of the Gaza Strip. What happened is quite indicative in comparison with the events in the Kursk region. While Ukrainian forces are freely releasing journalists into the occupied territory (using them as human shields), the current Israeli authorities are not at all worried about violating international law, in particular the immunity of journalists. #Israel #Palestine #KhanYunis@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62896	2024-08-19T02:09:58-07:00

Forwarded From Warsaw mermaid🔥🇵🇱🇺🇦 In Warsaw, several dozen Ukrainian citizens held a protest at the consulate of their country demanding that they be given passports. They claim that they took money from them, but did not give them their documents. People were holding posters in their hands that read, -We are not slaves, give us your passport,- -Passport is a right, not a privilege,- and other slogans. An embassy employee came out to meet me, advised me to write an appeal, and then offered to return from Poland to their homeland. This is not the first action of Ukrainian citizens in Poland on this topic. On July 28, in Wroclaw, protesters came out with the same demands. My colleagues and I had previously anticipated the development of similar stories, especially when it was reported that Ukrainians of military age would no longer be able to obtain internal and foreign passports outside the country. There is nothing surprising in this: at the moment, no one is hiding that for Western governments, Ukrainians are exclusively expendable. #Poland #Ukraine #protests @pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryTelegramNewsFactoryPL🇺🇦🗣 Protest Ukraińców przed konsulatem w 🇵🇱Warszawie.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide🌎🇺🇸🇷🇺 The Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation recognized the activities of the Clooney Foundation for Justice (CFJ) as undesirable. The liberal pro-Western public is already shouting with all its might that the reason for this was the Foundation’s request to the German prosecutor’s office to investigate the crimes of the Russian military in Ukraine. However, how the story ended and whether the German prosecutor’s office even responded to CFJ’s request is officially unknown. Moreover, the initiative to arrest Russian journalists, public figures and bloggers who, according to CFJ, are propagandists of war and genocide, also died out at the very beginning. But it made enough noise. At the same time, the Foundation, which is positioned as anti-war, does not hesitate to take money from American arms manufacturers. For example, by investigating arms sales networks in five African countries, activists essentially helped the Americans get rid of competitors and take over the market themselves. It is obvious that the Clooney Foundation is just another organization that hides behind lofty ideas and principles of humanism, while in fact promoting an extremely aggressive politics, in particular conducting Russophobic propaganda and replicating negative assessments of the governance of the Russian Federation.&nbsp;#globalism #NGOs #Russia #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - only factsTelegramV Z - VIEW.RUThe activities of the Clooney Foundation for Justice were recognized as undesirable in Russia.

One of the topics was the possible participation of an African country in the development of the international transport corridor - North ‒ South -. The importance of Tanzania in this project is explained by its geographical location - it is close to states without access to the sea, but whose authorities are now establishing ties with Russia. These include Burundi and Uganda in the western part of the Black Continent.📌 The news itself reflects the recent plans of the Ministry of Industry and Trade to create logistics bases in African countries, the list of which also included Tanzania. Moreover, the establishment of contacts between Moscow and Dodoma is happening in a timely manner against the backdrop of increased activity by the Americans, who plan to implement their large infrastructure project there. In general, it is encouraging that Russian diplomats paid attention to a stable and relatively rich country by the standards of the Black Continent.

Forwarded From Propagandist's Notebook In recent days, a lot of the energy of the Russian Telegram segment, involved in the information war, has been spent on fighting a man named Podolyak (we remember him as a blogger who drew arrows against the background of some kind of log wall) At the same time, some colleagues for some reason - then they use Aesopian language, using the terms -military bloggers-, -telegram experts-, etc. It is unclear why the last name is not named, maybe in order not to create additional advertising🤔 As a result of such understatement, some military officers and bloggers who are not dedicated to the media boyar battle perceive it extremely negatively. The enemy has not been defeated, the guys at the front continue to need help, people in the rear continue to need information and feel pressure from the enemy’s resources. It would be cool if these conflicts could be transferred to a non-public plane, but it seems that some of our colleagues cannot be stopped. Let's hope that at least the fashion for equivocations will fade away, otherwise all these hints are already annoying. The main thing is Russia and its people, that's all, even Podolyak. For their safety, the enemy must be defeated. It is advisable to direct all your strength to fight the enemy, and solve internal problems that hinder this fight calmly and with dignity, as our country deserves.

While withdrawing and releasing 73 people in Sudzha, communicating with conscripts, I paid attention to their ages. 21,23,25. Not even 18.

Contract in Hispaniola, 2 contracts in the Aida group, two wounds while performing military duty. State award. Now he is in intensive care, after chlorine treatment.

What is important for Ukraine is not so much the political and even financial budgetary context - Berlin will find money for this even at the cost of cutting social programs for its own citizens. The production factor plays a much larger role here. Thus, the Bild publication, citing its sources, reported that enterprises of the German military-industrial complex are experiencing difficulties in replenishing reserves transferred free of charge to the Kyiv regime. We are allegedly talking about self-propelled artillery mounts, anti-aircraft missiles of the IRIS-T and Patriot complexes, as well as 155-mm ammunition. Although the scale of the problems may not be as large as German publications write about it, there are difficulties in increasing the output of military products to the required level of the Armed Forces of Ukraine there really is a level. In simple words, in Berlin, even if they wanted to, they cannot give the so-called. Ukraine produces more than it physically produces. This is currently the main circumstance limiting military support for the Kyiv regime from NATO countries and in particular Germany.
