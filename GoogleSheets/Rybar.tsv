The entire range of influence tools is used, from publications to financial pressure. But unexpectedly, Harley Davidson management decided to stop implementing the policy of inclusion, equality and diversity (DEI) amid a sharp drop in sales and a boycott from customers. Company representatives reported that today the DEI policy is not being implemented, there are no hiring quotas and more There are no targets for spending funds allocated to supplier diversity. Currently, Harley Davidson management is reviewing all sponsorship programs and formats of cooperation with external organizations. For this purpose, a single center is being created. Company representatives also said they were withdrawing some sponsorships, including LGBTQ+ Pride festivals. Going forward, the brand will focus exclusively on the development of motorcycling. The company also announced that it is ending its partnership with the Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBTQ+ rights group. While this event was a real celebration for the conservative layer of Americans, it is important to remember that it only indicates to a local victory of common sense and the desire of investors to maintain a strong brand. This exception to the general rules does not in any way signal a break in the LGBT trend in the United States and the Anglo-Saxon contour. #globalism #LGBT #USA @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🌎🏳️‍🌈🇺🇸 How the LGBT agenda defeated the symbol of American conservatives - the Harley Davidson company Recently, a number of publications, including the Daily Mail, drew attention to the spread of inclusive values ​​in companies that were traditionally considered bastions of traditionalism.…	https://t.me/rybar/62938	2024-08-20T22:59:58-07:00

Russian troops attacked enemy military facilities in Glukhov, Sumy region, and a substation was hit there. In addition, an oil depot in Ternopil was hit by drones. At the same time, liquidation of the consequences of an attack by Ukrainian drones on the Rosrezerv oil storage facility in Proletarsk, Rostov region, continues. About six hundred employees of the Ministry of Emergency Situations are on the scene, the fire is localized on the territory of the oil depot. In the North Ukrainian direction, Ukrainian formations attack in the direction of Russkaya Konopelka and Spalnoye. The configuration of the front in the Malaya Loknya area was clarified, and a column of armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was destroyed in Korenevo. In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces liberated Novgorodskoye, attacking Nelepovka from both sides. In Kirovo, Russian troops advanced 800 meters to the northwestern outskirts of the village. In the Pokrovsky direction, fighting continues in Grodovka, as well as on the approaches to Novogrodovka to the south. Advanced assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the vicinity of the Mikhailovka station, trying to take control of the waste heap located behind it.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru ; en)Alexandro-Kalinovsky direction (ru; en)Kursk direction (ru; en)#Belgorod #Gorlovka #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kursk #Pokrovsk #Russia #Rostov #Sumy #Ternopol #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62934	2024-08-20T13:59:56-07:00

If in Iraq the Turks at least create the appearance of fighting the Kurds, then in the north of Syria Turkish troops have practically stopped hitting the positions of the Syrian Democratic Forces. Periodic artillery attacks shelling in milk does not count. Judging by the political activity of the Turkish authorities, all the efforts of the Erdogan administration (no matter how difficult it is for them) are now aimed at a diplomatic settlement with Bashar al-Assad and a joint fight against the SDS. And the Turks are even trying to involve their regional opponents - Iranians. The other day, the Turkish ambassador to Tehran, Hijabi Kirlangij, said that Ankara was counting on Iran's mediation in restoring relations with Syria. Not that this was completely unexpected. Still, the Iranians have extensive influence in the republic thanks to the campaign against the Islamic State, where they, together with our troops, helped the Syrian government. But the very fact that the Turkish leadership is involving Iran in a public way through an interview with its ambassador to an Iranian state publication says a lot. The Turks are committed to interacting and jointly fighting the Kurds, but no one is even talking about the ground phase in Syria anymore.#Iran #Syria #terrorism #Turkey@rybarSupport usTasnim News AgencyTurkey Counts on Iran to Mend Syria Ties: EnvoyIn an exclusive interview with Tasnim in Tehran, Hicabi Kirlangic expounded on the process of restoration of relations between Turkey and Syria.	https://t.me/rybar/62933	2024-08-20T12:34:01-07:00

In some cases they are successful, and in some cases the Turks are clearly lying, saying that there is no way to prove it at all.▪️Ground units are monotonously working with artillery along the border, and special forces and commandos have generally stopped carrying out forays to the rear. There are training sessions with Yuksekov along the border, but nothing more.▪️But in the political sphere, the Turks and Iraqis agreed to create a coordination center in Baghdad to exchange intelligence about the progress of the operation in the north. We won’t say whether this will be of any use; it’s better to see what happens next.▪️Another important point of the agreement will be the modernization of the Turkish-occupied base in Bashiqa. As a result of the negotiations, the Turks and Iraqis will jointly prepare units to fight terrorist groups, including the PKK.🔻If we evaluate everything without taking into account Turkish loud statements and threats, then preparations for the ground stage are still ongoing. The Turks are targeting Kurdish positions, while strengthening political cooperation with the Iraqi government. But will the Turks go on the offensive? It’s definitely not worth making a guess. Still, the Kurds have proven the effectiveness of their hit-and-run tactics in practice. They are still active in Turkey. Recently, another group of extremists was detained in the Shirnak province bordering Iraq. And since the new year their number has already exceeded a thousand. For the Turks, both Iraq and Syria have become a suitcase without a handle, which you can’t just disown, but they can’t be defeated by military means. And if it is possible, then at the cost of great sacrifices, which Erdogan is clearly not ready to make.

In the Alexander-Kalinovsky direction, fighting in the suburbs of Dzerzhinsk does not subside, Russian attack aircraft are gradually breaking through the defenses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After the waste heaps of the Severnaya and Artema mines, where the prepared positions of the Ukrainian formations were located, came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, the enemy’s position in the Dzerzhinsk agglomeration became more complicated. ▪️On the northern flank in the Druzhba area, Russian troops are still overcoming the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in urban areas, after which the path to Dachnoye and Dyleevka will be open to them.▪️In the northern part of Kirovo, advanced groups of Russian attack aircraft advanced to Tchaikovsky Street and partially crossed it in the area of ​​Molodezhnaya Street . Fighting was also recorded to the south, in the vicinity of Korolenko Street, but there were no reports of the Russian Armed Forces consolidating in this area. Ukrainian formations cling to the remnants of their positions in the private sector in the north-west of Kirovo, after which the forest begins, approaching the outskirts of Dzerzhinsk. Success in this area may indirectly indicate the advancement of Russian units in Druzhba. About half of the village remains under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and probably soon we will see footage confirming significant advances by the Russian Armed Forces in the village. ▪️Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of the settlement of Novgorod (New York) by Russian troops after two months of fierce fighting. Ukrainian formations are finally knocked out both from the territory of the village and from the pocket northeast of it, which opens up the possibility for the Russian Armed Forces to attack Nelepovka both from Artemovo and Novgorodsky itself. It is the last node of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense south of Dzerzhinsk and , probably already now the advanced groups of Russian infantry are fighting on the outskirts of the village. The liberation of Nelepovka will allow the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive both on the southern outskirts of Dzerzhinsk and towards Leonidovka and Shcherbinovka, bypassing the fortifications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the city. ❗️Probably, the attack on the capital of the Dzerzhinsk agglomeration will be accompanied by flank attacks in order to stretch out enemy units and disguise the direction of the main attack. Ukrainian formations, experiencing a shortage of personnel due to the transfer of some units to the Kursk direction, will be forced to leave positions in order to avoid encirclement and complete loss of combat effectiveness.

Ukrainian troops are making attempts to improve the tactical situation in several areas. In the Glushkovsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are striking with FPV drones on the engineering equipment of the Russian troops, trying to disrupt the work on establishing pontoon crossings. So far, no attacks have been recorded directly on the pontoons, however, given the distance from the front line, this should be expected soon.🔻In the Korenevsky district, there are battles in the Korenevo and Kremyanoye areas, where Ukrainian formations have been trying to gain a foothold for more than a week. Enemy positions in Lyubimovka and Tolstoy Lug were hit. There is currently no objective data on the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over Apanasovskaya.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, thanks to objective control personnel, the situation east of Sudzha has become clearer. Ukrainian formations carried out a landing in Spalny two days ago. Over the past few days, fighting has continued in the village and on the approaches to it: FPV drones are hitting enemy equipment, personnel, trucks delivering ammunition and other vehicles. Considering today's data from the Russian Ministry of Defense on repelling attacks in the area of ​​the settlement of Borki east of Spalnoye, fighting in the latter is probably still ongoing.

The Chinese spoke out against it, the Americans did not remain silent either, but there was some semblance of the status quo. This year everything changed dramatically, as another arena of confrontation appeared, where the Americans are actively consolidating their presence. And we are talking, as you may have guessed, about Australia and the Philippines. ▪️The other day, three B-2A strategic bombers flew to Amberley Air Base on the east coast of Australia. This is the first business trip to this continent in two years. How long their presence in Australia will last is still unclear, but given their flight in the coming years, we should certainly expect some joint events within the framework of -containing China-.▪️Especially now, on the southern borders of the Celestial Empire there are already there is a significant aviation group, including F-22A fighters in Australia, anti-submarine P-8A, MQ-9A and MQ-1C drones in the Philippines. This despite the fact that the Philippines already has French Rafale aircraft, and in Italian fighters -Typhoon- are stationed in Australia. Also as part of joint exercises in the region. We’ll see where all this leads, but China’s reaction is already noticeable in the increase in the number of combat aircraft in the direction of Taiwan and the South China Sea. The number of fighters at southern air bases has increased and even bombers have been relocated closer. Whether the collective West will conduct any new mass exercises is currently unclear, but such activity of the US Armed Forces and allies has definitely affected the stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

Forwarded From The Devil Walks in Dixie❗️🇺🇦🇷🇺The Verkhovna Rada adopted in the second (and final) reading a bill banning religious organizations associated with the Russian Orthodox Church. This provides grounds for an immediate ban on the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church. As my colleagues and I expected just a couple of days ago, this happened in an accelerated manner (the first reading of the document took place, we recall, last year) is clearly not without reason and is another step back for attempts to organize any -or peace negotiations. However, according to the adopted law, UOC communities will have nine months to -sever ties with the Russian Orthodox Church-. This somewhat delays the moment of official reprisal against believers and clergy, leaves the opportunity for the Ukrainian authorities, in the event of a threat of US sanctions for violating freedom of religion, to wag their tail in the right direction in time, but gives a green light to local sectarians and radicals who are already not sitting quietly since the beginning of hostilities.#Ukraine #Russia@dixi_devil - keep your eyes openTelegramRybar☦️🇷🇺🇺🇦 A new step towards banning the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox ChurchThe All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations supported the bill banning the activities of the UOC - earlier it was proposed to the Verkhovna Rada by the so-called president himself .

Today we will talk about Finland. Yesterday, two tactical flight trainings began on the territory of Suomi, lasting only a few days - Hela-2024 and Joint Fires-2024.▪️The first exercise takes place in the area of ​​Oulu airbase in central Finland off the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Only cadets on Hawk and Grob training aircraft are involved in it. The event is completely standard with quite ordinary tasks - to train pilots to fly in conditions of a full-fledged conflict with an emphasis on performing maneuvers at extremely low altitudes.▪️The second training is more interesting in geopolitical terms. In addition to four F/A-18 fighters of the Finnish Air Force, F-35As of the US and Norwegian Air Forces are participating, which flew to the Pirkkala base in the south of the country. Pilots from the three countries are currently flying in the Helsinki area and over the Gulf of Finland to increasing interoperability and interaction between NATO military personnel. Something completely outstanding is not happening yet. However, due to the lack of hot information about the actions of the Finnish troops, in the chats of both Russian and Finnish residents (they dream of everything returning to normal), they started talking about a possible thaw in relations. But whether it is worth counting on this can be assessed by the nature of such training, as well as planned events on the official website of the Finnish Defense Ministry. Finland is a NATO member, so such exercises (sometimes even provocative) will be regular.

🇬🇧🇷🇺 The State Duma proposed to ban any activities of Deutsch...	🇬🇧🇷🇺 The State Duma proposed to ban any activities of Deutsche Welle and the British Council in Russia. The initiator was the Commission to Investigate Facts of Foreign Intervention. The appeal states that the British Council, under the guise of humanitarian projects, carries out intelligence activities in the Russian Federation, and the media corporation Deutsche Welle, recognized as a foreign agent, not only actively produces information saboteurs, including Russian journalists, but also carries out anti-Russian media actions.📌 Let's add a few touches to the portrait of the British Council.▪️The organization reports directly to the British Foreign Office and conducts its activities in different countries under the guise of cultural formation, through which language exams are also conducted. However, it is obvious that organizations with such a profile are a convenient tool for shadow activities or recruitment in host countries. ▪️Back in February of this year, it turned out that employees of a British government organization were engaged in military intelligence in the Kherson region. In particular, they tried to recruit local residents, including trying to obtain information from their loved ones through Ukrainian refugees in the UK. And in times of peace, the British Council launched a vigorous activity in Russia, literally recruiting everyone around the liberal LOMs, who happily began working for foreign intelligence, for which they now receive the status of foreign agents. It is known that the British Council is one of the main parts of the multi-level anti-Russian a network of influence agents overseen by the British government. The tasks of organizations include (and have been for many years) not only the search and training of loyal personnel, but also their cultivation at the selection stage. Thus, Great Britain managed to acquire into its arsenal a mass of trained journalists, activists, sociologists, political scientists and other specialists who openly promote Russophobic policies. Therefore, banning the activities of such a structure is a completely logical step on the part of the Russian authorities. #Great Britain #NGOs #Russia @rybar together with @pezdicideSupport usTelegramState Duma Commission to investigate foreign interference❗️Chairman of the State Duma Commission to investigate facts of interference of foreign states in the internal affairs of Russia Vasily Piskarev told reporters about sending the commission to the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation of materials about the anti-Russian activities of a number of foreign...	https://t.me/rybar/62925	2024-08-20T04:34:49-07:00

In the Kursk region, the tense situation continues along the entire front line. The enemy is attacking with columns of armored vehicles in various areas, coming under fire from armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces and aviation.🔻In the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations are trying to strike at pontoon crossings, including with FPV drones. The enemy publishes satellite images, claiming that he managed to disable one of the two crossings on the Seim River.🔻In the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces once again attempted to gain a foothold in the village of Korenevo. A column of Ukrainian armored vehicles even managed to drive along the highway on the eastern outskirts of the village in the direction of Nikipelovka, where it was destroyed by precise strikes by the FAB from the UMPC.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the configuration of the front in the Malaya Loknya area was clarified. The forward positions of the Russian troops came under fire from the Marder 1A3 infantry fighting vehicle of the 95th airborne brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Thus, the Russian Armed Forces are currently holding lines in the area of ​​Nikolaevka and Staraya Sorochina. North of Russky Porechny the front configuration has also been clarified. Apparently, after the armored vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were attacked by FPV drones in the village itself, the Ukrainian formations managed to travel further to the north. Today, airstrikes were carried out on enemy positions in the forest near the village of Nechaev. To the southwest, several enemy armored cars were able to reach the village of Russkaya Konopelka. This is probably the same equipment that was recently attacked in the Agronom farm by FPV drones. The Ukrainian Armed Forces were ambushed, at least one of the vehicles was destroyed at point-blank range by fire from a BTR-82A autocannon.

Last night, Israeli fighter jets carried out an air raid on the town of An-Nabi Shit in the Lebanese Bekaa Valley, located more than 60 km from the border. According to the press service of the Israel Defense Forces, the target was a weapons warehouse. The commander of the Hezbollah missile unit, Hussein Ali Hussein Suleiman, was also killed. The group's media resources officially acknowledged the death of the fighter, but did not report his combat status. In response to the Israeli airstrikes, Hezbollah fired rocket salvoes into northern Israel. About 60 munitions were fired into the Upper Galilee and Golan Heights. Some of the missiles were intercepted by air defense systems, the rest fell into wastelands. There were no casualties.🔻 The incident as a whole fits into the particular situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border: the IDF hits Hezbollah targets, which in response shells northern Israel, only sometimes leading to the death of Israeli reservists.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62921	2024-08-20T03:35:23-07:00
🌍🇺🇸 About the problems of US foreign policy in Africa and the ...	🌍🇺🇸 About the problems of US foreign policy in Africa and the lack of demand for PMCs in the American magazine IM-1776, an interesting article was published by a former analyst on West Africa of the US Armed Forces, Brendan McNamara. In it, he criticizes the American approach to working with African partners and even gives recommendations on what to do to return the Sahel countries to the orbit of Western influence.▪️The expert’s main complaint is that American foreign policy is too bureaucratic and does not allow flexible decisions to be made when the situation requires it. In addition, a condescending attitude prevents Americans from building relations with African countries.▪️The article also again raises the topic of the American-French confrontation in Africa. The expert complains that instead of replacing the French by promptly helping African partners solve security problems, the American authorities limit themselves to formalities such as military cooperation agreements, without which it is impossible to deploy troops and equipment on the territory of third countries. As a result, the palm is taken by more efficient partners, who at the same time treat Africans with respect and are not associated with the colonial past, like representatives of the West.📌Well, according to McNamara, the way out of the situation should be PMCs and government orders for work in Africa.▪️Via analysis of the work of the PMC -Wagner-, he comes to interesting conclusions that go beyond the American narrative. Thus, he rightly notes that - no matter how painful it may sound, the Russian PMC has become a stabilizing factor in the Central African Republic. Having proven themselves on the battlefield, they will be able to prove that Americans are also capable of fighting against terrorists. I remember the (allegedly unclaimed) experience of American PMCs in Iraq and other regions, where they have already proven themselves to be quite effective formations.🔻Despite completely logical arguments and assessments of objective reality, rare for American journalism, the conclusions in the article boil down to one thesis - give orders PMC-. Against the background of many years of demonization in the Western press of the Wagner PMC and not yet forgotten scandals involving, for example, Blackwater operators (which is why they had to rebrand), convince the ruling circles of the White House to openly and massively use the services of PMCs, and even according to the Russian principle, it will not be so simple. But through this and other similar publications, including the well-known Erik Prince (by the way, in the same magazine), we already see a designated request from the community of retired military personnel and a call to the authorities to quickly provide them with work. Given the number of hot spots in the world, it is likely that this request will begin to be granted. #Africa #Sahel #USA @rybarSupport UsIM—1776How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love PMCsCan America’s Counter-Terrorism Strategy in West Africa be Salvaged?	https://t.me/rybar/62920	2024-08-20T02:24:49-07:00
