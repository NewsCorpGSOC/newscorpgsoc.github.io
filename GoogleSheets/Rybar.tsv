🇺🇸 About the progress of the presidential campaign in the USA D...	🇺🇸 About the progress of the presidential campaign in the USA Despite the fact that less than a month has passed since US President Joe Biden refused the nomination, the balance of power in the struggle for the presidency has changed significantly. And not in favor of Donald Trump: the Republican, who previously led in all polls, began to face troubles. This is due to the so-called honeymoon of Kamala Harris - after the elderly and always stammering Biden, the young and energetic Harris is basking in the attention of the press, collecting record donations and dominates the information space of American social networks. Harris is doing well with her funding - in July, the Democrat managed to raise $310 million compared to the $138.7 million raised by Trump. According to polls, she is also ahead of her Republican opponent in three key states, including the important Pennsylvania. Trump understands that he no longer controls the election agenda, which is why he is becoming increasingly nervous in public and making old mistakes - be very and uncontrollably rude, as well as make harsh statements. Moreover, he is no longer able to improvise as well as when his opponent was Biden. We have to be more constructive and not just criticize the opponent for his age. His allies and donors are concerned and note that the current approach greatly harms Trump's already scandalous image, making voters think that the Democratic opponent is focused solely on himself and personal revenge. But Trump continues to stick to the old line. Insiders said donors at a recent meeting with Trump in the Hamtons expressed hope that he would recalibrate his campaign after a series of devastating mistakes. Instead, the politician again began to talk about the stolen elections and declare that he would -put an end to fraud- in 2020, although his advisers had previously urged him to abandon such statements and move in a more constructive direction. All these problems are further complicated by the fact that Kamala Harris masterfully and unashamedly steals from Donald Trump his most successful and attractive election promises. For example, she recently followed her political opponent in advocating the abolition of taxes on tips in the country. The former president, in turn, clumsily shoots back at the fact that Harris has photoshopped people into himself in report photos from his rallies.❗️In general, Trump badly needs a relaunch or a successful debate, as a result of which he could publicly humiliate his rival. Speaking is really not Kamala’s strong point - she, knowing this, cunningly avoids unplanned meetings with the press. However, he also cannot refuse to go to fight with Trump, since the voter will consider this a weakness. Judging by Trump's statements, the parties have agreed on dates for the debates - September 4, 10 and 25 on Fox, ABC and NBC. Until they take place, it is pointless to talk with confidence about the chances of victory of one or another candidate - as practice has shown, failure at such an event can cost a politician the whole race. The battle between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris this year will be Pennsylvania, the swing state with the most electoral votes. The total amount of advertising spending that Democrats and Republicans will spend...	https://t.me/rybar/62735	2024-08-13T04:13:41-07:00

At night, air defense work was recorded over Kursk, 12 UAVs were shot down over the city and in the region.▪️During the day, information appeared about a massive shelling of Tetkino by artillery. Taking into account the enemy's pattern of actions, the likelihood of opening another section of the front is still completely non-zero. ▪️In the vicinity of enemy-occupied territory, fighting continued throughout the night. Ukrainian formations were active in the area of ​​Snagost, Korenevo and Martynovka, although they were unable to advance anywhere. 🔻Suja’s status is still unclear - judging by the lack of fresh personnel on both sides of the front, neither the Russian Armed Forces nor the Armed Forces of Ukraine have complete control over the city. At the same time, the enemy has not yet given up attempts to advance in the direction of Rylsk, Lgov and Kurchatov, while simultaneously gaining a foothold on the captured lines. In parallel, there are movements of forces in the Sumy region: for example, movements of armored vehicles have been recorded in the Glukhov area. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are also bringing up air defense systems, which, to put it mildly, is completely atypical for -DRG-. At the same time, Russian troops are intensively striking Sumy.▪️Ukrainian media are actively using the successes of past days for PR purposes and media campaigns.

In fact, system enterprises of the defense industry are now working exclusively to fulfill the state defense order, covering the needs of troops for military equipment. And an increase in production volumes will not allow the surplus to be sold abroad - now everything goes to the army. Yes, Rosoboronexport performs its function by trying to form a portfolio of orders. But this is work for a strong future.

Tel Aviv sold billions of dollars worth of weapons to the Azerbaijanis, and Israeli intelligence services and the military played a significant role in planning and approving the operation in Artsakh.▪️In addition to the commercial interest of the Israelis in supporting Azerbaijan (sales of weapons and purchase of oil), the key role was played by the opportunity to get closer through Artsakh to borders of Iran. ▪️So it would not be surprising if Baku actually agreed to the deployment of Israeli bases in Artsakh in exchange for full support. ▪️At the same time, for Iran, the sovereignty of Armenia is perhaps much more important than for the current Armenian authorities. Tehran has recently been saying every day that they do not accept border changes in the region, referring to the situation around the Syunik region and the opening of the so-called -Zangezur corridor - through Armenia, which should connect Turkey and Azerbaijan. ▪️The other day, Baku unexpectedly announced that they had agreed to exclude the corridor issue from the peace treaty with Armenia and postpone it until later. The unexpected compromise is associated with Azerbaijan’s desire to conclude a peace treaty with Armenia as soon as possible. ▪️However, it cannot be ruled out that the postponement of the corridor issue, among other things, was prompted by Iran’s position and its threats against Israel. This is evidenced, in particular, by the fact that the IDF leadership decided to withdraw its military from Azerbaijan due to fear of revenge from Iran. ▪️The possible deployment by Israel of its missiles in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, an Azerbaijani exclave, also remains a sensitive issue for Iran and Armenia.🔻The tension of recent weeks in the region clearly passes by Armenian diplomacy, which remains silent and does not express a single reproach to regional players who threaten security of Armenia. This situation is yet another proof that Armenia is losing its political sovereignty and Yerevan’s opinion is simply not interesting to anyone. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Israel #Iran @rybarSupport uswww.aysor.amIn Iranian circles, discussions have intensified about the location of Israeli secret military facilities in Artsakh and threats, and the authorities...Today, more than ever, the Azerbaijani factor is used in operations against Iran, from reconnaissance to training possible operations.	https://t.me/rybar/62732	2024-08-13T02:39:01-07:00

Forwarded From Children of Arbat Today everyone will be looking for opportunities to quickly meet with Alexei Dyumin and be the first to report the situation: Vladimir Putin wants to know which circuit he was deceived on. In February 2023, former Deputy Speaker Andrei Turchak came to inspect Governor Roman Starovoit, who, with his decision, endorsed the readiness of equipping the Russian-Ukrainian border with a fortification system. In addition, it is not clear what decision was made regarding the commander of the Grv(s) North, Colonel General Lapin, and why the Chief of the Main Staff of the Ground Forces, Colonel General Nikiforov, was sent to Kursk.

The contract value is 182 million euros, and delivery is scheduled for 2027. The document includes an option for five additional IRIS-T SLM sets, as well as the IRIS-SLX long-range air defense system. The purchase itself will be carried out within the framework of the European Sky Shield initiative, which involves the creation of a layered air defense system over EU airspace. According to some reports, part of the cost will be covered by the United States as compensation to Bulgaria for the supply of the so-called. Ukraine of its anti-aircraft missile systems and missiles for them in 2023. The Bulgarians will be able to receive anti-aircraft missile systems in three years at best - the state of the country's air defense was already far from the best level, and after the transfer of part of their few S-300 They have nothing special to provide cover with. Moreover, now the authorities in Sofia have to pay for replenishing the arsenals that they gave to the Kyiv regime for nothing.

We partially spoke out about this problem already two days ago. If we take into account the fact that such problems exist in the Russian Ministry of Defense, one can only be amazed at how great the scale of the disaster is in the context of interdepartmental cooperation. The appointment of Dyumin means Putin’s team takes full control of the situation in order to stop the fraud, and also begin to solve the problem. rather than trying to freeze it. 📌And what is happening is the best answer to what the real role and tasks of Alexey Dyumin are in the new system of the Russian Federation after the May inauguration. Apparently, it is he who will now be the specialist in solving operational problems, as well as solving problems of coordination, combat and civilian control. I remember that Dyumin was destined for the post of Minister of Defense. Well, in fact, we got much broader powers.#Kursk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62729	2024-08-13T00:23:34-07:00

And on August 8, the RusHydro delegation met with representatives from Jubes. As a result of the meeting, several agreements were concluded in the field of development of hydropower and integrated water use. In particular, the parties will implement joint projects, exchange experience and technologies, and develop human resources.🔻Such projects, although a drop in the bucket compared to other foreign investments, but have a great impact on the local economy.

Russian troops hit an aircraft parking lot at the Mirgorod military airfield in the Poltava region. The enemy launched drones in the Voronezh, Rostov, and Belgorod and Kursk regions. In the Kursk direction, the enemy attempted an attack from the Spalnoye-Krupets line in the direction of the village of Giryi, where during the attack he lost up to a dozen armored vehicles, most of which were armored personnel carriers. 4E, one of which was taken as a trophy. In the Slobozhansky direction, Russian troops repelled several attempts by the enemy to break through the state border line in the Kolotilovka and Bezymeno area. In the Artemovsky direction, Russian troops significantly advanced in the direction of Grigoryevka from Bogdanovka. In the Pokrovsky direction, Russian troops attack aircraft gained a foothold on the outskirts of Grodovka near the ruins of a brick factory on the south-eastern outskirts, and also liberated Lisichnoye and took most of Ivanovka. In the Donetsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces took full control of Yasnobrodovka, gaining a foothold on the opposite bank of the Karlovskoe reservoir from Karlovka.

At the same time, more and more footage is appearing on the Internet demonstrating the successful defeat of armored vehicles and personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces by Russian troops. 🔻In the Korenevsky district in the vicinity of Snagost, where the enemy previously launched an attack on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces, the situation is hidden - by the fog of war -. Also, the situation in Krasnooktyabrsky has not become clear, and there have been no reports of enemy units entering the populated area. ▪️Russian troops cleared Kremyanoye, where the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces units was previously recorded. During the battle, the enemy lost at least one Roshel Senator armored car, abandoned by the crew south of the village. It is worth noting that in this case, the advance detachment of the Ukrainian formations was probably ambushed by Russian troops and, lacking the support of heavy equipment, was defeated. ▪️In the area of ​​Korenevo and Tolpinskoye, Ukrainian formations launched an attack with the support of armored vehicles in order to break through the defense of Russian troops in this area. The enemy's attack was successfully repelled by Russian units, while the Ukrainian Armed Forces, apparently, rolled back to their original positions. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the situation remains steadily tense. Today, videos from the enemy appeared on the Internet, demonstrating the presence of Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the central regions of Sudzha, as well as in the Martynovka area - and, according to reports from the field, the presence of the enemy was recorded in the populated area during the day. ❗️Nevertheless, it is premature to declare complete control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over Sudzha, based solely on footage from the enemy, since at least some of the videos were recorded several days ago. At the moment, there is no official information from the Russian authorities and objective control personnel from the RF Armed Forces. 🔻In the Belovsky district, Russian units are fighting in Plekhovo; there have been no reports of the settlement coming under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. At the same time, it is known that the enemy occupied Spalny, through which Ukrainian mobile groups subsequently entered deep into Russian territory. ▪️In the morning, Ukrainian military equipment was spotted in the Girya area. Judging by the footage, the enemy was approaching from the southwest from Kamyshny. As we noted earlier, the number of armored groups that broke through to the populated area was higher than initially expected. Nevertheless, for the enemy, the attack on Giryi resulted in the most significant one-time losses of personnel and equipment recorded to date: at least seven BTR-4E armored personnel carriers were destroyed, one of them was taken by the Russian Armed Forces as a trophy. One pickup truck of the Ukrainian forces was also destroyed and an unspecified amount of manpower was eliminated.

Even in the morning, reports appeared about the enemy entering this locality: then footage of a lone BTR-4 was circulating online. Some channels also reported about a large armored group of Ukrainian formations, while others rushed to refute it, saying that this was actually a captured armored personnel carrier. The turmoil was supplemented by video footage of Russian fighters driving a similar captured vehicle. 📌However, the truth turned out to be quite prosaic. There really was an enemy breakthrough and entry into the populated area, and therefore the status of several villages to the west is in question. And there was also an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. Based on the footage of the fire, the entry into Giryi turned out to be very unsuccessful for this mobile armored group. ❗️It seems that this is the largest recorded one-time loss of personnel and equipment at the moment, at least in the Russian borderland.▪️At the beginning (0.04) - enemy equipment travels from the northwest to the southeast 51.09716437601322, 35.57585529576821, the second armored personnel carrier turns south. ▪️At the same time, at 0.39 the enemy is loading on the road east of the settlement 51.08824166887881, 35.59818238943927▪️Most of the enemy vehicles remained in the forest on the line from 51.104120445221284, 35.5625924327871 84 to 51.10063561284701, 35.57010916871723.

At the forum -Army-2024- -High-precision systems-they brought the Pantsir-SMD-E-air defense system to protect stationary objects. This is a new stage of development -Pantsir-, intended, first of all, to combat drones in the context of the ongoing SVO. The key difference is the abandonment of cannon armament and a move towards the use of mini-missiles, up to the possibility of equipping with 48 launch containers for launch mini-SAM. From the point of view of wasting expensive missiles, this will lead to savings and a reduction in the cost of ammunition, as well as an increase in capabilities. And of course, the cost is affected by the lack of a chassis (if you wish, of course, you can put it there). 📌To the question whether such complexes will guard enterprises of the fuel and energy complex, there was only a modest answer - so far not a single interested representative has been seen -. #industry #Russia @rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62716	2024-08-12T10:05:35-07:00
