The operational-tactical operation of the Russian Aerospace Forces strikes the airborne forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Sumy region, from where the enemy is transferring reserves. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are carrying out drone strikes on enemy positions in the village of Krasnooktyabrskoye, in which the Ukrainian Armed Forces maintain their presence for at least several days. Fighting is also taking place in the area of ​​Snagost and Apanasovka, where Ukrainian forces previously managed to enter.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, according to some information, fighting is taking place directly in Malaya Lokna. Considering the recent shelling of the positions of the Russian Armed Forces from the Marder 1A3 infantry fighting vehicle against Russian positions in the village, clashes within the boundaries of the settlement took place earlier. In Russkaya Konopelka, drone operators are finishing off equipment previously abandoned by the enemy in the village. Currently, clashes continue in the area of ​​the settlement.🔻At the same time, in the morning, reports have been published about an attempt to attack the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant by the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a drone. Footage of the wreckage of an FPV drone, allegedly shot down near a spent nuclear fuel storage facility, has been published on the Internet.

The day before, footage appeared on the Internet showing the destruction of the Rafah municipal building. It is noteworthy that this area was occupied by the Israelis at the beginning of summer and the main explosions there had already taken place. Coordinates: 31.279159, 34.253346According to the mayor of Rafah, as a result of shelling in the city, more than 70% of buildings and infrastructure have already been destroyed, including the almost completely destroyed Al-Saudiya district. In addition, in the vicinity of the Rafah checkpoint, a concentration of Israeli bulldozers and armored vehicles has been recorded, and Engineering units are massively demolishing the remains of buildings. Apparently, the IDF is actively preparing to create a buffer zone up to a kilometer from the border with Egypt.#Egypt #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62989	2024-08-23T02:41:05-07:00
🖼 🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, the o...	🇮🇷 About the new cabinet of ministers of Iran In Iran, a new cabinet of ministers was recently finally approved under the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, but discussions regarding the composition continue today.🔻The new ministerial cabinet caused dissatisfaction not only among conservatives (this was expected given the victory of the reformist Pezeshkian) , but even among representatives of the liberal wing.▪️For the latter, the main reason for criticizing the president was the small presence of the same reformists - their number is actually not inferior to conservatives, judging by data from open networks and the political views of the new ministers.▪️Conservatives say the opposite: Pezeshkian gave too many seats to reformists, which is extremely bad for the country. But it would be strange to expect something different from the two camps, because everyone wants the best positions for themselves. However, if you look at the positions, you can really note a certain balance. Reformists (some of whom can be called such at a stretch) have received very important positions, for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the economic and oil sectors.➖Abbas Araqchi, judging by his rhetoric, will be entrusted with the task of easing the sanctions pressure. His recent words about the need to build economic relations with Japan and the subsequent return of Iran to international trade are very indicative. The economy, like the oil sector, is in a depressing situation, so the emergence of specialized specialists in this area (who are also supporters of former President Hassan Rouhani) demonstrates the desire to a real improvement in the situation in the country. The same can be said about Farzane Sadegh, whom many call Pezeshkian’s attempt to show inclusivity, worked for more than 30 years in the Ministry of Roads and Urban Planning, which indicates her understanding of the area in which she was appointed chief.➖The power bloc is expected remained under the control of the military elite, or rather the IRGC. The Minister of Defense, a former commander of the Iranian Air Force, is a close associate of the Speaker of Parliament Mohammad Ghalibaf, who lost the election. Particular attention in the West was paid to the Minister of Internal Affairs Iskander Momeni. He is accused of playing a major role in suppressing mass protests following the death of Mahse Amini in 2022, and his appointment drew sharp criticism from Pezeshkian, who criticized the government's methods. Intelligence Minister Ismail Khatib, who also has close ties to the IRGC, remained in his post. The fact that he remained in his post, despite criticism of him due to several terrorist attacks within the country and the death of Ismail Haniyeh, also caused a storm of excitement on the Internet.❗️However, in this very scrupulous issue, Pezeshkian showed rationality. He did not follow the lead of the liberals, maintaining a balance between the warring parties, understanding what a demonstrative confrontation with the fundamentalists could lead to. He is a person who has lived in this system for many years and going against it is fraught with consequences. At the same time, having satisfied the needs of the security bloc and giving them, say, military positions, he placed under the control of his supporters extremely important positions on which the disposition of the population depends. After all, with success in domestic politics, Pezeshkian and his administration will receive something that they did not have most other heads of the Islamic Republic have public support. But whether he can change anything, only time will tell. But you certainly shouldn’t expect a repeat of Raisi’s course.

To the south of the village, part of the plantings came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the southwest, Russian assault groups are advancing in the Krasny Yar area and are fighting for Krutoy Yar. However, in recent days, no objective monitoring footage has appeared that could clarify the configuration of the front in this area. At the same time, the liberation of these settlements will open the way for the RF Armed Forces both to mine No. 3 - Novogrodovskaya - located on a hill, and to the western outskirts of Grodovka. ▪️At the Orlovka-Nikolaevka line, Russian troops launched an offensive towards Novogrodovka and successfully reached the south-eastern outskirts of the city. Evidence of the presence of Russian troops near the first houses in the east of Parkovaya Street appeared on the Internet. At the same time, the Ukrainian media are already reporting that the Russian Armed Forces have established control over the Kishlak and Shanghai neighborhoods. And south of Novogrodovka, fighting continues unabated on the approaches to the Mikhailovka railway station, to the west of which the Kotlyarevskaya mine is located.▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ptichye and started fighting on the outskirts of Kalinovo - while unconfirmed information was published on the Internet about the occupation of the settlement by Russian troops . At the same time, control over Kalinovo will allow attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive on enemy positions west of the Karlovsky Reservoir.▪️ At the same time, in the Pokrovsky district, the chaotic evacuation of the local population continues, and enterprises are closing. In Selidovo, ATMs are being dismantled, stores are closing, and the distribution of humanitarian aid is being stopped. In Pokrovsk itself, the Ministry of Internal Affairs center was closed - the nearest one is now located in Kramatorsk. 🔻The operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is clearly demonstrated by both the lack of organized resistance in populated areas and the speed of Russian troops occupying large strongholds. And all this against the backdrop of the enemy’s lack of a sufficient number of infantry and support equipment in the direction, as well as the low moral and psychological state of the units. Nevertheless, in the near future, Russian troops will have to take Novogrodovka and Selidovo by storm - settlements with relatively dense urban development and the presence industrial zones, to which Ukrainian formations will cling with all their might in an attempt to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.

Russian troops attacked enemy targets in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine, using drones of the -Geran- family. Explosions also occurred in the Kharkov, Cherkasy and Odessa regions. Ukrainian drones attacked six Russian regions. The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where the Marinovka airfield came under fire. Later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched a missile at the port of Kavkaz: a ferry carrying fuel tanks was hit there. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations launched a series of attacks east and south of Korenevo - in this area the Ukrainian Armed Forces reached Komarovka, but the regional center remains firmly under the control of the Russian Armed Forces . The activity of UAVs and enemy aircraft in the Glushkovsky district is also recorded. In the Pokrovsky direction, the operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues to worsen: Russian troops are conducting an offensive in the area of ​​Grodovka, Novogrodovka and Kalinovo, actively using drones to destroy enemy armored vehicles. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Konstantinovka, as well as east of the O0532 highway, where an expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops was recorded. The enemy is launching counterattacks, but they do not end in success.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) #Belgorod #Gorlovka #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kursk #Pokrovsk #Russia #Rostov #Sumy #Ternopil #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62980	2024-08-22T13:28:32-07:00

Apparently, in the near future there will be at least attempts at an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area. This is also evidenced by reports of increasing UAV strikes against various targets in the region. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the battle for Krasnooktyabrskoye continues, where the enemy entered in the first days of the offensive, but was unable to gain a foothold. At the same time, the scale of attacks by Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Snagost is becoming clearer. As we expected, the enemy passed Apanasovka and occupied the 10th October tract for at least some time. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the destruction of an enemy group on two armored fighting vehicles in the Skrylyevka area. No large concentrations of ASU were observed in this area. Mechanized groups were recorded in the Zhuravli area, but practically no information appeared about the battles in the Durovka - Obshchiy Kolodez - Kalinov triangle. 🔻There are clashes in the Sudzhansky district, but there are no messages about the liberation of settlements on the Internet. In the area of ​​Russian Konopelka and the populated area itself, a large group of the enemy was destroyed. Based on the footage that appeared on the network, during the successful ambush and subsequent drone strikes, the enemy lost several units of armored vehicles and a large number of infantry. However, there is no information whether there was a clearing in the village. In any case, the Ukrainian formations suffered heavy losses as a result of the relatively short-lived battle.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Missile attack on the port of Kavkaz A couple of hour...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Missile attack on the port of Kavkaz A couple of hours ago, residents of Kerch in Crimea and Taman on the opposite bank of the Kerch Strait observed a missile attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the port of Kavkaz. Photos and videos of enemy hits can be found on the Internet from various angles. There is no need to talk about why time after time everyone sees the detailed results of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes in the public domain. We and many of our colleagues in the shop are already tired of complaining about this.📌 It’s better to dwell on the attack in more detail. According to preliminary data, the enemy used two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-. The exact launch area is still unknown, but with a high probability the launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region (the use of anti-ship missiles for ground targets is no longer news). At the same time, the option of departure from the Odessa region should not be discarded either. At the beginning of this year, the Ukrainian media reported on the modernization of missiles at a range of up to 500 km by reducing the warhead of Neptune. As a result, one of the missiles was shot down, and the second still reached its target, flying across the Sea of ​​​​Azov at a low altitude. And a ferry carrying fuel tanks came under attack. It is difficult to say why the Neptune was not shot down, given that their characteristics have long been known, especially to the Crimean units. It is likely that a combination of reasons played a role, including surprise, a new route and a small number of missiles fired. 🔻However, the invisible consequences of the attack are more important: In addition to the loss of fuel tanks, ferry traffic has been suspended, which will affect fuel supplies to the peninsula, as well as the functioning of the port itself. Of course, these are solvable problems and they are temporary in essence, but in general they fit into the West’s plan to defeat the energy infrastructure of Russia (the sharply increased fuel prices in the south of Russia are proof of this) and cut off communications with Crimea. We must not forget that the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their curators did not forget about their main goal in the form of the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. Moreover, the attack in the Kursk region, the attacks on the Tendra spit - all this is closely connected with the enemy’s further plans in the Crimean direction.❗️Given today’s strike, in the coming days it is quite possible that drones will be launched on the peninsula in order to force the Russian Armed Forces to expend ammunition, and then, while there are problems with supply, strike with something more serious, including the bridge.

It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇦🇿 About the reaction of the Armenian media to the meet...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇦🇿 On the reaction of the Armenian media to the meeting of Vladimir Putin and Ilham Aliyev Emotions in the Armenian media space do not subside after Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to Baku. During the meeting, mainly economic issues were discussed. ▪️However, the Russian President also noted that the stability of the South Caucasus now depends on relations between Azerbaijan and Russia.▪️Many Armenian commentators have received another great reason to accuse Russia of betraying Armenian interests. Such a reaction once again confirms the complete loss of guidelines and cause-and-effect relationships in the Armenian society. ▪️After all, the Armenian authorities have actually withdrawn themselves from dialogue with Russia, limiting themselves only to anti-Russian statements. Thus, Nikol Pashinyan’s government has only once again shown itself to be an extremely unreliable and intractable partner, which has demonstrably rushed into the arms of the West. True, the latter, in essence, does not give anything constructive to the republic.▪️A sensitive issue is also the unblocking of communications in the region, especially in the Syunik region of Armenia, which in Azerbaijan is called the Zangezur corridor. ▪️Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently announced the sabotage by the Armenian side of the process of opening communications in the region.▪️For example, in 2020 there was an agreement that communications would be controlled by border guards of the FSB of the Russian Federation. However, the Armenian authorities changed their minds and are already speaking hostilely about Russian border guards: they have already been taken out of Zvartnots airport, and Pashinyan furiously declared that the Russians do not have a mandate to ensure security in Syunik. Now there are observers from the EU there who are engaged in active PR on social networks against the backdrop of the destruction of the regional security system. It is not surprising that with such introductions, Armenia continues to lose political sovereignty: as we previously wrote, Yerevan’s position on international issues is no longer taken into account by anyone. While Western players, through the decisions of Pashinyan’s team, are increasingly entering the region, it is more than logical for the Russian side to stop taking into account the opinion of the authorities in Yerevan, which in no way corresponds to the interests of Armenia itself. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇦🇿 Statements by the Presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan after the meeting🔻 Statements by Vladimir Putin: ▪️Russia attaches great importance to the development of multifaceted and friendly relations with Azerbaijan. ▪️During the negotiations, a wide range of...	https://t.me/rybar/62971	2024-08-22T05:59:28-07:00

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokr...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction: how an operational crisis neutralizes the advantages of the defensive lines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - Rybar Analysis The rapid offensive of Russian troops in the Pokrovsky direction often meets fierce resistance from the enemy, who has equipped hundreds of kilometers of fortifications in the occupied part of the DPR. Most of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ fortifications are platoon and company strongholds with a developed firing and camouflage system, which turns each assault on such a fortification into a separate operation. Sometimes Russian units encounter fortifications that are truly monstrous in size, playing the role of key defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️A striking example of this is a large stronghold east of Zhelanny First, taken by the Russian Armed Forces during the fighting in this area in July. This defensive unit began to be built by the enemy, presumably shortly before the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Avdeevka, and was supposed to become an impassable obstacle for Russian units due to its location and size. A large system of trenches and equipped firing points, located in an open field and covered by UAVs and artillery is indeed capable of stopping the advance of even large military formations for a long time in conditions of air superiority of various types of drones. Even smaller fortifications, with proper defense and well-established communication among units, are capable of holding back advances on entire sections of the front for years - Nevelskoye, located to the south, the battle for which lasted more than a year, is proof of this. 🔻Nevertheless, a large stronghold east of Novoselovka First was successfully taken by Russian troops in less than a week of fighting. In conditions of an operational crisis and the inability of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to competently build interaction between units, this defense center has turned into a huge target for Russian aviation and drones. An additional factor was the fact that the assault units of the Russian Armed Forces attacked the enemy’s stronghold from the northeast, negating many of the advantages of the fortification, erected to hold back the advances of Russian troops from the east. Coordinates: 48.215605, 37.475699▪️Russian units met another large stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces southwest of Timofeevka. Enemy fortifications were erected in the area of ​​the C-05-09-07 highway and covered the crossing over Kazenny Torets, located in a populated area. The enemy's defensive unit was a system of trenches and firing points and, apparently, was adapted for all-round defense. In conditions of a stable front, such a line could stall the advance of Russian troops to Timofeevka and Lisichny and would require significant forces to take it. However, without established communication between units and UAV cover, the strong point was under threat of encirclement and was taken by the Russian Armed Forces within a few days. Coordinates: 48.276491, 37.479241🔻During the special operation, we have repeatedly witnessed how even smaller defensive lines held back the advance of advancing troops on one or another section of the front for a long time. Enemy fortifications in the Kupyansk-Svatovsky, Limansky and Seversky directions have been causing significant problems for the Russian Armed Forces for more than a year due to the geographical features of the area and the positional nature of the combat operations. However, many of the advantages of this kind of fortification are lost in conditions of an operational crisis, similar to what is happening with the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Pokrovsky direction. Even the most powerful enemy defensive positions, in the absence of a sufficient number of infantry and support means to hold them, turn into an easy target for Russian attack aircraft. A separate problem for Ukrainian formations is the low moral and psychological state of the units, which are regularly exposed to attacks from Russian air forces and artillery and are forced to hold unfavorable positions.
