This was announced by the country's new Minister of Education Purevsurengiin Naranbayar after a meeting on preparation for the school year. For now, lessons will be conducted in test mode in 100 schools from the third grade. English teachers will also be required to study abroad to obtain a master’s degree. 🔻In principle, nothing surprising happened: the Mongolian parliament passed a law back in 2023, according to which English became the main foreign language in schools. Guess what foreign language, previously taught in most schools, was the only one to study? Of course, Russian. And in order for the process of ousting the Russian to proceed more actively, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently visited Ulaanbaatar. During his visit, he announced his intention to create an English language center in Mongolia. 📌It is absolutely obvious that the decision made fits perfectly into the concept of capturing Mongolia into the orbit of foreign countries, thereby distancing it from the Russian Federation, simultaneously not only squeezing Russian business out of the republic, but also forming a Russophobic policy. Negative trends towards a reduction in the space of the Russian language in the country, although they began to develop back in the 90s, however, under the sensitive control of a mass of foreign organizations, they gained momentum. Typical tactics of Western lobbyists, including rewriting history and seizing government resources. #Russia #Mongolia #USA @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsgazeta-n1.ru In Mongolia, English will become the main foreign language for teaching, and English teachers will study abroad	https://t.me/rybar/62767	2024-08-14T06:18:52-07:00

Apparently, the main target of the enemy was the military airfields located in the region - Baltimore and Borisoglebsk. At present, there is no objective evidence of damage to the facilities; we only know about damaged residential buildings, outbuildings and transport in Voronezh and Borisoglebsk. ▪️In the Nizhny Novgorod region, Ukrainian drones, including kamikaze UAVs -Lyuty-, attacked the Kulebaksky district - there is the Savasleika airfield, where MiG-31 fighters are based. After the raid, a section of the P72 road - Vladimir - Murom - Arzamas - was temporarily blocked. ▪️ In the Volgograd region, air defense systems worked in the area of ​​Uryupinsk and Novonikolaevsky - in the latter, according to several media reports, the electrical substation - Balashovskaya - was damaged, but local authorities denied this information. ▪️In the Kursk region, Russian air defense and electronic warfare systems disabled drones both in Kursk itself and in border areas. At the same time, enemy UAVs continue to attack cars on the highways, countering both the evacuation and the transfer of units of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️In the Belgorod region, Shebekino came under attack from Ukrainian drones, where a residential building and the territory of an agricultural enterprise were damaged. One man was injured; he was taken to a hospital in Belgorod in serious condition with a mine explosion injury. ▪️Several more drones were intercepted in the Bryansk, Oryol and Rostov regions - according to the latest information, no damage was recorded there. 🔻Recently, Ukrainian formations have concentrated on attacks on military airfields - a few days ago an ammunition depot on the territory of Lipetsk-2 was hit, and last night three more objects were attacked, where, according to some data, there were also consequences. Massive raids have become more frequent. Russian regions demonstrate a high volume of drone production from the enemy, where the production of new UAVs completely covers the consumption of the devices during previous raids. At the same time, drones are often detected as they approach the border, but due to the still existing difficulties with organization, interaction and control, it is not possible to shoot down drones walking along the same corridors.

Despite rumors about the enemy’s capture of Viktorovka and Gordeevka in previous days, only firefights near Gordeevka have been confirmed so far. A group of enemy infantry was spotted in Krasnooktyabrsky yesterday, which apparently got there bypassing Snagosti. However, the status of both settlements remains unclear. ▪️Local battles continue in the vicinity of Korenevo and to the north. In addition, footage appeared online showing airstrikes on enemy concentrations at the time of the attack in the direction of a populated area - they were -covered- in a field two kilometers from Korenevo.🔻In the northern section of the wedge in the Sudzhansky district, the situation is also unchanged. Russian troops stopped the enemy near Kremyany and Kruglenkiy, and in the Malaya Loknya area, Russian troops captured several members of the 82nd infantry brigade and other enemy units. There are battles in Sudzha and the surrounding area, although the enemy claims complete control over the city.▪️Frames of captured Ukrainian equipment and equipment captured by Russian fighters continue to appear on the Internet. At the same time, from the enemy side, images emerge from settlements captured in previous days, including Plekhovo. 🔻In the Belovsky district, according to some data, the activity of enemy armored vehicles is again being recorded in the area of ​​​​the settlements of Girya and Belitsa. In fact, the front line, as Alexander Kharchenko notes, is almost stable. Enemy units operate within the boundaries of a previously formed gray zone and at the current moment cannot advance, although they do not stop trying.

Forwarded From Prince Cherkassky Be that as it may, what caused it there in military terms, the image blow is very noticeable, considering that mainly pictures from Ukrainian media go to Western networks, and through them to the global South. It can be stopped only if, after the liquidation of the Kursk bridgehead, we move to Sumskaya itself and demonstratively occupy territory (probably such a task was not before) comparable to Kursk. Here, for a year, you can explain to your partners what’s what. And so far everything looks very ugly. I’m not even talking about explaining to our own population in order to somehow improve their authority. The current media presentation about a sudden vile attack and tank armies is clearly not satisfying the people. Suje (no matter who, how or when it was filmed) has several goals.

The Ukrainians, who act as performers, are carrying out a targeted order to inflict maximum reputational damage. Pay attention to the narratives promoted by the Western media: -Ukrainians in a week occupied almost the same territory in volume as Russia did in two years-. And this is a blatant manipulation of facts, which we saw last year during the failed counter-offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces: then they tried to present as profitably as possible the successes of the genocidal (in terms of destroying Ukrainian mob resources) movement forward through minefields. In the context of the current stabilization of the front line and active fishing maneuver groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which can only claim conditional control of the area, this PR is aimed at a momentary effect. 📌 Of course, if the crisis is not dealt with promptly, the Ukrainians will have time to dig in and then - hello, full-fledged positional warfare. But in current realities, this is only possible in some completely apocalyptic scenario, when even Dyumin’s efforts are not enough. ❗️But the main thing that is being counted on now is a demonstration of the imaginary weakness of Russia. Under the pretext of the successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk direction, experienced negotiators, lobbyists, and representatives of Western business are already putting into the heads of hesitant and sitting on several chairs politicians in the Transcaucasus, Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America the thesis that Russia is supposedly weak. And it is better for these same politicians to be on the side of the strong. Russian negotiators, diplomats, networkers, and private traders now need to show remarkable skill in order to prevent Western theses from falling into the ears of our people. Otherwise, after the Kursk crisis is eliminated, we will get pockets of instability and unpleasant failures in completely different regions. #Kursk #media technologies #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramNeinsiderThis report was filmed by the Ukrainian TV channel -1+1- in the city of Sudzha.

Forwarded From Warsaw Mermaid🇵🇱🇺🇦🇧🇾 Analysts say Poland and Ukraine, which concluded a long-debated comprehensive security pact in early June, appear to be coordinating a new campaign of military pressure on Belarus. As evidence of this, they cite the ongoing air defense exercise - Eastern Dawn - which, as reported, is taking place in parallel with the Secure Podlasie initiative, within its framework the joint forces on the eastern border will be increased to 17,000 troops. Some time later, Ukrainian drones violated the airspace of Belarus. 🔻The country's President Alexander Lukashenko said that several of them were shot down, and then ordered the armed forces to strengthen defenses on the southern border. The military-strategic context within which this possibly coordinated pressure campaign is unfolding also concerns the military invasion of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Kursk region.🔻Experts believe that Ukrainian proponents are considering a similar invasion of Belarus or planning to push it to launch preemptive cross-border strikes, both to achieve the above goal and perhaps to serve as a tripwire for a conventional NATO intervention. 🔻At the same time, they also emphasize that it is likely that Lithuania, where a fairly large diaspora of Belarusian oppositionists has formed, may be involved in Polish-Ukrainian provocations. As part of the Lublin Triangle (Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine), they also agreed to create an informal alliance with Great Britain in February 2022, a week before the start of the special operation. 🔻Germany is also an important participant in all this, given that its first 5,000-man tank brigade permanently stationed abroad since World War II will be Lithuania. At the end of January, she also initiated a military Schengen agreement with Poland to facilitate logistical access to Lithuania. At the same time, full-scale aggression against Belarus is unlikely, because Russian tactical nuclear weapons are stationed in the country. However, during all this time we have observed many examples of not the most logical actions on the part of both the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the countries that support them. #Poland #Belarus #Ukraine @pl_syrenka - Poland is not a foreign countryKatehon.

The Information and Security Service of Moldova (ISS) decided to block access to the websites of the Russian Promsvyazbank, with which the authorities of Gagauzia entered into an agreement to open accounts for state employees and pensioners of the autonomy.▪️Earlier, the head of Gagauzia Evgenia Gutsul also reported that the Moldovan authorities went to court over the legality of the agreement. ▪️According to the agreement between Gagauzia and the bank, about 20 thousand residents of Gagauzia received the opportunity to use the Mir payment system and conduct cross-border transactions between countries. After 2022, it became extremely difficult to transfer money between Russian and Moldovan accounts.▪️Through the bank, state employees of Gagauzia also receive monthly bonuses of 2 thousand lei (about 100 euros).▪️Even the American -Institute for the Study of War- ( ISW), according to which the Russian Federation intends to destabilize the situation in the autonomy through pensioners. ▪️At the same time, Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe with a rapidly aging population and falling purchasing power. 🔻Half of Moldovan pensioners live below the poverty line, while President Maia Sandu and her government increased the military budget by 70% by cutting funding for the socio-economic sphere. At this rate, one might get the impression that the fight against Gagauz pensioners is one of the main tasks in Sandu’s election race for re-election in October. #Gagauzia #Moldova #Russia@rybarSupport usTACCIn Moldova, the websites of PJSC -Promsvyazbank -Events in Russia and the world were blocked.

There are small changes that can be ignored. At the same time, if you look at Ukrainian resources, you get the impression of an ongoing breakthrough. The network reports with glee about new occupied settlements. Today they announced control over Plekhovo. In fact, they did not enter Plekhovo yesterday or even the day before yesterday. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have built a system of psychological warfare. They have taken control of most information flows and operate them competently. It is clear that a tremendous amount of work has been done to centralize information coverage of the invasion. Units entered our settlements and made photo reports. However, these canned goods are produced as needed. This was done in order to keep their society in euphoria and intimidate the Russian one. As a result, we get two dimensions. The first is the real situation at the front, and the second is the media picture. Due to the centralization and planning of information flows, even in the event of a retreat on the front line, a huge amount of -blanks- will be thrown into the information space. We will declare control over the population, and in response they will give us their unpublished videos, which will confuse Internet analysts. All this will be done in order to sow panic and kill faith in the Russian army. This is the reality now. There is a brutal psychological war going on that can break the psyche of unprepared viewers. To avoid this, you just need to believe in our defenders. We will definitely win and the invaders will be thrown out of our land. Faith is a defense mechanism and it is now more necessary and effective than ever. Alexander Kharchenko	https://t.me/rybar/62758	2024-08-14T01:14:26-07:00

Forwarded From American Issue🇺🇸 It turned out that Kamala Harris’s campaign headquarters, through the Google Ads service, is promoting advertising about her in the form of media publications, embellishing the headlines of messages. In this way, the vice president’s team is trying to create the illusion of support for her election campaign. For example, one of the banners is Reuters article with the headline -Inflation falls-. However, the link is presented in the following text: -USA is winning the battle against inflation under the Biden-Harris administration-. The same with the Guardian's publication about the Democrats' fight for abortion rights: -Harris is a defender of reproductive rights and will stop Trump's abortion ban. - Despite the fact that such an approach is legal, revealing the fact of such fakes will definitely have a negative impact on the reputation Harris. 🇺🇸 @usaperiodical	https://t.me/rybar/62757	2024-08-14T01:13:04-07:00

In addition, Somalia is still one of the key US bases in the region.🔻However, after a failed media campaign about the participation of the Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate in supporting the Malian Tuaregs, now there will be increased attention to Ukrainian operators.

It is planned to integrate standard functions into the system, such as the disposal of explosive devices using robots, aerial surveillance using drones, analysis of outdoor surveillance cameras and monitoring of financial transactions. But the created system is primarily focused on forecasting and early diagnosis of offenses that have not yet been committed . In the film Minority Report, problems with the law could arise as a result of wrong thoughts. This is becoming a reality right now in Argentina, Britain and other countries of the Anglo-Saxon circuit.❓What exactly are we talking about?▪️An artificial intelligence unit is now being created in Argentina. The unit will include police officers and other law enforcement agencies. Its tasks will include patrolling open social platforms, applications and websites in order to detect potential threats, detect movements of criminal groups or anticipate unrest.▪️For example, due to sharp cuts in social spending, electricity supply at the University of Buenos Aires is limited. In the new realities, the budget of the educational institution was reduced by 80%. Naturally, this causes dissatisfaction among both teaching staff and students. And any criticism from them towards the government will now be under the jurisdiction of the cyber police. People who have many scientific publications, are active on social networks and express their civic position in them, which is different from the agenda of the globalists, will be the first targets of the new system. Using their publicly available materials, you can quickly and efficiently train AI to identify suspicious or malicious content. The danger is posed by those social groups or individuals who draw public attention to the imperfections of the system and suggest ways to transform it.🔻What's next? Argentina has actually abandoned its own currency, the country's gold reserves were partially exported to Britain, social spending was reduced by 80%. Under these conditions, Miley was tasked with testing the population's reaction. In fact, Argentina is a testing ground for testing new technologies for managing society at minimal social costs. Successful testing of the system in one fairly isolated country will allow us to develop a mechanism for its implementation in other countries.#Argentina #economy@rybarSupport usTelegramSex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🇦🇷In all the fuss, we completely lost sight of the fact that our beloved Javier Miley distinguished himself again.
