The rocket is solid fuel, medium range, in the upper range of it, what the Americans call -intermediate- - between 2.5-3, and 5.5 thousand km. Equipped with maneuvering head units, apparently with strapdown deployment. At the same time, the minimum range dead zone can be significantly tightened with this approach. Obviously mobile.

In response, Palestinian forces fired on Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) positions in the Netzarim corridor, and also launched a rocket at Kerem Shalom. In the West Bank, Israeli security forces arrested at least 12 Palestinians. In total, since October 7, 2023, the total number of detainees is more than 11,700 people.

The attack was a response to US plans for the production of medium- and shorter-range missiles at the facility. The President also stated that in the event of an escalation, Russia will respond decisively and in a mirror manner, and targets for destruction will be selected depending on threats to the country’s security. It is characteristic that previously there was no information about Oreshnik in open sources, and even many specialized experts today about heard it for the first time. This means that the complex was developed without understatement in the strictest secrecy.❗️Vladimir Putin also directly stated that Russia has the right to use weapons against military facilities of those countries that give permission to use their long-range weapons to strike Russian territory. This wording is unambiguous, and the message to sponsors is the so-called. Ukraine is obvious. How exactly they will perceive it - we will see in the near future: unlike past times, this time the warning was illustrated much more clearly.#weapons #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65584	2024-11-21T09:53:32-08:00

And this trend, where the Addis Ababa government is losing its position, continues.▪️The elections held in Somaliland made adjustments to the subsequent situation in the region. An opposition group came to power, open to dialogue with the federal authorities of Somalia and refusing the intervention of foreign powers. The latter means opposition to the Ethiopian authorities in influencing Somaliland, which Addis Ababa wanted to use as a logistics port for their needs.▪️But at the same time this triggered a new round of constitutional crisis, which led to a break between the leadership of autonomous Jubaland and the federal authorities due to the Jubaland government’s refusal to hold direct elections. In general, the Ethiopian authorities can take advantage of this to strengthen their position in the autonomous regions of Somalia. Thus, one of the bases of the African Union mission was transferred to local militias, and not to the country’s armed forces.▪️The fighting had the usual character of small skirmishes, sometimes involving aviation and drones of the Turks and Americans. Clashes were also recorded between Somaliland separatists and militias of the autonomous Puntland. An unstable situation remains in Somalia, and power is actually limited to control over Mogadishu, while other territories remain under the rule of local clans. The country itself is turning, looking at what is happening, into an arena for confrontation between regional leaders in the struggle for influence.

But each flight is a whole complex of events involving a lot of forces and means. The video itself, as Revenge of Good Will noted, will give -Topgan- a head start.

But still, this survey is very indicative for demonstrating changes in sentiment among Ukrainian citizens.▪️In 2022, the number of citizens who considered a war until victory as the only possible option was 73%. In 2024, at the time of the survey, the figure barely reached 38%, and there were 30% more supporters of peace.▪️The difference is also noticeable on the territorial issue. In 2022, supporters of the Ukrainian regime were more than 60% in favor of continuing the war. At the same time, according to the classics, the most militant ones were the residents of the western regions, that is, those who were not particularly affected by the fighting. But in 2024, the situation changed. In the Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov and occupied Zaporozhye regions, only 27% of the population is in favor of the war, and in the central and even western regions the number of supporters of continuing the fighting remained only 40 - 43%, that is, almost half as much.▪️At the same time, GALLUP interviewed people separately , advocating a speedy peaceful settlement, regarding the possible abandonment of territories. And 52% of respondents were in favor of concessions, 38% were against, 10% refused to answer or did not know what to answer.▪️In addition, Ukrainians’ hopes for quick accession to NATO and the EU are beginning to weaken, as well as the approval of the US leadership. In 2024, 40% approve of the US actions at the pre-war level, although after the start of the military war the figure was 66%.❗️The situation of the Ukrainian authorities has worsened in the last year - huge territorial and human losses became the reason for the introduction of total mobilization, which does not stop, but is only gaining momentum . The population, which is accustomed to watching everything from TV, does not like this. The life of Ukrainian citizens has become much harder, Western support seems to continue, but residents of so-called Ukraine see that the previously stated goals are unattainable, so more and more people are starting to think about a peaceful settlement , as the only possible. And another reason for the decline in government support is the disposal of a significant part of the Ukrainian nuclear layer, which advocates war to the last. The ranks of far-right nationalists, including women, have thinned significantly, and the ordinary population is already quite tired of the fighting.

The offensive began at the end of last week and now we can already talk about the results. ▪️Southwest of the key settlement in the area, Russian troops liberated Rovnopol. In the village, soldiers of the 5th Guards Army recently hoisted the Russian flag. The fighting in this sector has continued for the last week, but now the Russian Armed Forces have finally gained a foothold in Rovnopol. In Novodarovka, fighting continues in the center of the village. To the east in Makarovka, there remains a focal presence of scattered enemy detachments on the northern outskirts, but there is no talk of any successful counterattacks, much less control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the populated area.▪️From Yasnaya Polyana and Shakhterskoye, a very significant advance was noted towards Razdolnoye. Several forest belts, as well as strongholds, came under the control of Russian troops. In fact, now units of the 40th Infantry Brigade and the 5th Tank Brigade managed to reach the outskirts of Razdolnoye, and the 139th Infantry Brigade managed to bypass the settlement from the north from the side of the Nalivach and Shulicha gullies, almost reaching the T-05-18 highway. Some of the strongholds to the southeast were taken without any problems, and at some the Ukrainian formations are desperately resisting.▪️South of Razdolny, according to available data, in some areas it was possible to move up to five and a half kilometers to the west south of the Maltabar gully. The Russian Armed Forces were able to reach almost the outskirts of Bolshaya Novoselka, advancing along the O0510 road. It is between the Kashlagach River and the highway that the greatest advance of Russian troops is recorded. In the interval between the Kashlagach and Shaitanka rivers, the enemy was also knocked out of several forest belts. South of Shaitanka, west of Novodonetskoye, there are also noticeable successes, where units of the 37th Motorized Rifle Brigade are advancing: the advance was about five kilometers in the direction of Blagodatnoye.

🇫🇷🌾 In France, protests by farmers against the EU agreement co...	🇫🇷🌾 In France, protests by farmers against the EU agreement with the MERCOSUR countries on the removal of customs duties on their agricultural products continue for the fifth day. The protests began on Sunday at the call of the main agricultural trade union FNSEA.🔻Protests related to the discussion of a free trade agreement between the EU and MERCOSUR are timed to coincide with Macron’s visit to Argentina and the G20 summit in Brazil, but have every chance of continuing after events. On Sunday, in unison with their German colleagues, French business executives blocked the border in Strasbourg - the Kehl Bridge. Ports in Le Havre, Rouen and Bordeaux are also blocked. A march of farmers to Brussels is planned for Monday. 🔻The protesters represent different interests: ▪️The main trade union of farmers, FNSEA, represents large farmers and the agro-industrial complex, who do not need competition in the form of cheaper, more massive products from Latin America and stuffed with pesticides banned in the EU. Of the 178 pesticides used in Brazil, 138 are banned in France, the French Corn Society proved in March. However, it is the difference in phytosanitary standards that makes these products much cheaper, and everyone understands that, due to inflation, the French will buy them. ▪️The more conservative and radical trade union Coordination Rurale, well represented in southwestern France, including near the city of Agen, represents small and medium-sized livestock farms that are already losing money due to the import of Ukrainian agricultural products into the EU, including chicken meat. Any duty-free quotas from Latin America - and now we are talking about 98,000 tons of beef, 25,000 tons of pork and 160,000 tons of chicken - would be a death sentence. In recent days, farmers have marched on tractors in the regional centers of southwestern France: Oche, Perigueux, Limoges, Bordeaux, Pau, Nimes, Rodez, Guere, and also reminded of themselves in the middle cities of Brittany, and the cities of the northeast of the country. In rural areas, farmers disable road cameras - however, since 2013, they have suffered at every mass protest. And in the suburb of Bordeaux - Pessac - brave suppliers of agricultural products break into councils, confiscate EU flags and burn them.❗️So far, it seems, there is a simple warm-up with symbolic actions, but they are overlaid with general dissatisfaction with the policies pursued to please the world transnational elites, the plight of farmers and winemakers after a rainy summer and political instability in France after parliamentary early elections at the end of June.🔻The French themselves do not support the protests of the farmers, but they do not interfere either. According to polls, 81% of the local population supports the rallies, and 75% are opposed to signing an agreement with MERCOSUR in principle. But most EU governments are in favor of the initiative, including industrialists in Germany and Spain, where they are looking to Latin American markets as a salvation from the EU's own recession. Poland (where the agrarians are also strong) and Italy may join France in the protest front against the treaty. #France@rybar together with @fifthrepublicSupport usTelegramFifth Republic	https://t.me/rybar/65576	2024-11-21T06:07:11-08:00

The Kupyansko-Svatovsk direction in the past weeks was marked by an intensification of hostilities and a breakthrough of Russian troops into Kupyansk itself. While fighting is going on in the city in the eastern part, to the south the Russian Armed Forces are gradually pushing through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Kolesnikovka and Zagryzovo. ▪️In mid-November, Russian troops broke through the defenses of Ukrainian formations northwest of Petropavlovka. The offensive began during the rotation of Ukrainian Armed Forces units, which did not allow them to organize defense and quickly transfer reserves due to a shortage of manpower. 🔻As a result of a successful attack, the entire forest area and the Kulagovo railway station came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, which Russian attack aircraft subsequently relied on to advance to Kupyansk. After the liberation of the station territory, the Russian Armed Forces began an offensive along the railway track, taking advantage of the elevation changes and disorganization of the enemy. Soon, advanced armored groups entered the northeastern outskirts of Kupyansk and gained a foothold in the private sector. ❗️After this, one of the main goals of the Russian units became the territory of the Kupyansky feed mill, which is one of the key strongholds of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the eastern part of the city. Its release will allow the Russian Armed Forces to take under fire control the section of the N-26 highway from Kupyansk to Petropavlovka, while the object itself is protected from enemy counterattacks from the latter by an impassable peat bog. In parallel with this, the attack aircraft began to advance towards the dairy plant and sugar factory, without encountering significant resistance. Fighting broke out over the territory of both enterprises, while the enemy transferred reserve units to the site. According to available data, the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to partially stabilize the situation and at the moment neither side has stable control over the industrial zone. ❗️It is currently difficult to determine the exact configuration of the front in the city and its surroundings. The enemy, trying to reduce the media effect of the breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces in Kupyansk, publishes footage of objective control with a serious delay. Russian units have also so far refrained from covering the fighting in the city, focusing on the success of the operation. ▪️To the south there are battles on the outskirts of Glushkovka. Earlier, the RF Armed Forces managed to dislodge the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the territory of the Kolesnikovka station in the forest and advance north, reaching the outskirts of the village both along the left bank of Oskol and east of Kolesnikovka. Success in this sector will allow Russian troops to form a southern claw encirclement of Ukrainian Armed Forces units in the Petropavlovka-Novoosinovo sector, aimed at reaching Kupyansk-Uzlovoy, which is regularly subject to air raids by the Russian Aerospace Forces. Over the past month, the Russian Armed Forces have carried out several successful local attacks south of Berestovoe. During one of them, a Russian armored group attacked the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from the north and landed troops that drove the enemy out of the strong point. Tactical successes were also noted in the Stelmakhovka area - several forest belts to the west of the village came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. 🔻Probably, the main efforts of the Russian command on the southern flank of the Kupyansk-Svatovsky direction are aimed at expanding the wedge driven into the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kruglyakovka area. In the long term, it is also possible to create the preconditions for a future attack on Borovaya, another important enemy logistics hub on the left bank of the Oskol Reservoir. Simultaneously with this united front, work is also underway in the Liman direction, where the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in the Pervomaisky area, control over which is also important for the breakthrough to Borovaya.

🇮🇱🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Galan...	🇮🇱🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu and Galant Less than an hour ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Prime Minister and former Minister of Defense of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galant, for war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip.🔻Since the information is confirmed by Israeli media, it can be stated that the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel with acceleration drove into the wall. In fact, this is a continuation of the confrontation, the next episode of which was the investigation against ICC Prosecutor General Karim Khan, probably initiated by supporters of the current Israeli leadership. Of course, no one will arrest Netanyahu and Galant (as well as our President Vladimir Putin). This is rather a slap in the face and a serious diplomatic blow to the reputation of the ultra-Orthodox.📌 But the ultra-Orthodox themselves and also their supporters (for example, like Chabadniks, many of whom are first-rank officials in the so-called Ukraine) will have cause for great concern. After all, for them this does not mean anything good, at least in the short term. Everything that happened is similar to the demobilization chord of those who stand behind Biden. In recent weeks, the US authorities have been doing everything that will undoubtedly affect Donald Trump after his inauguration. Granting permission to Ukrainian formations, new packages of military assistance - this was done to complicate the resolution of the conflict. Donald Trump himself has close family ties with the ultra-Orthodox, and the order against Netanyahu and Galant will also affect Trump. And this, in turn, will have an impact on the Ukrainian elite, which will be more difficult for Trump to support.❗️In the short term, the ultra-Orthodox in Israel will begin to try on the image of victims of anti-Semitism, simultaneously mobilizing everyone they can, supposedly to resist hostile pressure from the outside. That is, continue to pursue an aggressive policy against its neighbors.#Israel #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport uswww.news1.co.ilבית הדין הפלילי בהאג הוציא צווי מעצר Please contact us, * Please: Please contact us חיילים	https://t.me/rybar/65574	2024-11-21T04:58:17-08:00

The main feature of the video was that militants began using drones to attack government forces, and the narrator particularly noted the influence of Ukrainian forces on new combat tactics using drones. According to a member of the KTD (Uzbek, judging by the language), drones have become an effective tool that is much cheaper than missiles or other weapons , but they can strike at concentrations of people, equipment and firing points, as they showed in the published footage.🔻The news that immediately comes to mind is that units of the Ukrainian The GUR trained militants in Idlib to assemble, modernize and use drones against the Russian Armed Forces and the Syrian Arab Republic. Before the appearance of this information, terrorists were not observed in the methodical use of these technologies. There were isolated episodes, but not so often. The Uzbek terrorist KTD did not directly say who trained them, but the facts in the form of hints about the success of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this direction speak for themselves. All this once again demonstrates the influence of the special operation on the course of armed conflicts. Interest in unmanned technologies has increased due to the low cost of materials and high possibilities for their use, which is expressed not only in Syria, but also in other regions such as Africa or Myanmar.#Russia #Syria #terrorism #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65569	2024-11-21T04:39:01-08:00
🖼 🌍🇪🇸 About migrant flows to the Canaries Exacerbation of the...	🌍🇪🇸 About migrant flows to the Canary Islands The aggravation of the internal political situation in northeast Africa has caused significant changes in the routes of migration flows. In the past few years, African refugees have chosen routes not through Libya, but through the Comoros Islands, which belong to Spain. Numerous migrants from Gambia, Senegal, Mauritania and other West African countries use the services of smugglers to cross the sea. The relative cheapness and geographical accessibility attract Africans who have little to lose. Moreover, various Western NGOs calmly distribute money, which is just enough to transport them to Europe.❗However, this route is the most dangerous. According to Western analysts, approximately 95% of all fatal migration flights occur in the Atlantic. At the same time, the number of migrants does not decrease, but rather increases. So, since 2023, the number of arrivals to the Canary Islands has increased by more than 1000%.🔻This issue raises concerns in the EU. The Spanish authorities clearly do not want to see tens of thousands of illegal migrants on their territory, especially in the tourist area, which could create security problems and affect the tourist flows that bring in a lot of money. Therefore, more than 200 million euros were allocated from Europe to Mauritania to fight illegal immigrants. And the Spanish fleet participates in joint patrols with their Senegalese and Mauritanian counterparts. And, of course, this does not bring any results while there are millions of Africans living in poverty and dreaming of moving to Europe. And the financing of social programs by various NGOs only encourages people to spend the money they receive on a -new life-.High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #migration@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65568	2024-11-21T03:40:08-08:00

The most important was the strike on the YuzhMash industrial enterprise in Dnepropetrovsk, during which an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) could have been used. According to some signs, an ICBM could actually be used for this (this can be seen from the characteristic multiple warheads), which is the first successful combat use of this type of weapon in the history of military conflicts. The combat units were non-nuclear. Although there is talk on the Internet about the RS-26 Rubezh, the type of missile is not reliably known. Ukrainian formations were unable to shoot down the ICBMs, as evidenced by the arrival footage.❗️This can be called a clear signal to the sponsors of so-called Ukraine (especially on the anniversary of the Maidan) against the backdrop of Western permission to use long-range missiles. Time will tell how much they understood it. But today’s strike is truly a non-trivial move, since nothing like this has happened before. And there is reason to believe that this is not the last such application.#Dnepropetrovsk #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65566	2024-11-21T02:54:55-08:00

According to them, they were given an ultimatum: to surrender their powers or establish contacts with the authorities of the Islamic Emirate. Recently, many of this kind of pressure on the ambassadors of the now defunct republic has intensified. Many countries began to demand similar actions from them. In July, the Taliban announced that they no longer recognize the diplomatic missions created by the former government of Afghanistan and the passports, visas and other documents they issued. It is logical that it was in Germany that they took drastic measures: the Germans are trying to resolve the issue of deportation of Afghan refugees. This issue was already discussed during the chancellor's visit to Central Asia two months ago. And taking into account how the migration situation in Europe and Germany, in particular, has worsened, the new trends are quite understandable. The funny paradox is that people who fled the war with the Taliban indirectly and without their desire help the new Afghan authorities resolve the issue of their legitimization at the international level arena. And the Germans, quite possibly, will give impetus to other European states to do the same. But, looking at these actions of Germany, theses about the growing danger of the Islamic State in Afghanistan look even more artificial. In Europe, the Taliban are accused of allegedly not coping with the Islamic State, but at the same time they themselves are taking steps towards recognition of the Islamic Emirate as the legitimate government in the country. #Afghanistan #Germany@rybarSupport usfergana.mediaGerman authorities forced the Ambassador of Afghanistan and the Consul General in Bonn to leave resign	https://t.me/rybar/65564	2024-11-21T01:37:01-08:00

They are planning this because of difficulties crossing the Kazakh-Kyrgyz border, which arise with enviable regularity. In fact, in Astana, they use their geographic location in this way to fight competitors in favor of their carriers, which causes damage to other sectors of the Kyrgyz (and not only) economy. This is not the first time this corridor project has been talked about. Last summer, Governor Igor Babushkin announced the participation of Astrakhan shipping companies in it. Later, in November 2023, a memorandum of understanding was signed at the first SCO transport forum in Tashkent. For the Kyrgyz economy, as well as for the Russian one, the presence of alternative routes (and multimodal) is important, since there must be diversification in any area.

The Moroccan armed forces are purchasing the Akinci drone, which has already proven itself on the Dark Continent, and the Turkish Armed Forces themselves are actively using them against the Kurds in Iraq. For Morocco, this is not the first Turkish drone - they have already used the Bayraktar TB2 in operations against Western Saharawi rebels. Not to say that it is very effective, since sometimes their attacks led to the death of civilians and gold miners in Mauritania. In addition, Turkish companies are interested in exporting their training aircraft to Egypt. The Hürjet presented by TAI is a cheaper analogue of Western products for air force modernization, and according to plans it can be used as a light attack aircraft. But here, too, the nuance is that these are promising aircraft that have not even been put into production yet, and their real capabilities are unknown. So far, only two prototypes have been built, which should replace the American training T-38. In general, the fact that Ankara is trying to sell its products to unstable markets is a long-established trend. And they have success.

It was Sargsyan, in the status of deputy minister, who represented the Armenian Ministry of Internal Affairs to American officials, reporting on the progress of reforms in the law enforcement sphere and the development of new programs under the auspices of the State Department and the US FBI.❗️As we wrote, in the United States they are putting Armenian security forces under the control. And it is obvious that the main motive of the Americans is not related to the real fight against crime. Moreover, in recent years, violence and crime in Armenia, on the contrary, have increased.

Ukraine. As it turned out, almost immediately after the start of the SVO, Project Alchemy was assembled under the auspices of the British Ministry of Defense. 🔻In addition to military personnel, it included intelligence workers, analysts, specialists in the field of honey, industrialists, scientific experts and other persons united by the goal of achieving an increase in the escalation of the current conflict. Their tasks included organizing cyberattacks, sabotage, even terrorist attacks on Russian territory, as well as drawing up a plan to change power in the country. They were also involved in developing a strategy for conducting combat operations and drawing the maximum number of NATO countries into the conflict. As part of the project, the sabotage of negotiations in Istanbul in the spring of 2022 was carried out. Some of the recommendations of Alchemy have already been implemented, including a strike on the Kerch Bridge and the creation of cells for murder, sabotage and terrorist attacks in the Russian rear. At the recent NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer voiced the ideas developed within the project, and the British crown officially promised to support the so-called. Ukraine -as long as it takes -.📌 Another heap of official documents again proves the facts of subversive activities and deliberate escalation, but Great Britain is only a tool here.

According to the PRC, the delivery was agreed with the Chinese authorities. If earlier the Chinese coast guard gave a tough response to such actions, then recently there has been no reaction to the delivery of goods. It's all about the bilateral agreement concluded in July 2024, which made it possible to resolve this issue at least temporarily. When the document was first signed, some observers argued that it would not be respected due to conflicting provisions. However, four months have already passed since the end of July, and the Filipinos have already delivered cargo three times without resistance from the Chinese side. 📌 And yet this does not mean that relations between China and the Philippines have normalized. Manila recently passed a law delineating the country's exclusive economic zone, parts of which are disputed in Beijing. China responded by releasing a map of the territorial waters of one disputed island and increasing patrols near it. At the same time, there have been no serious clashes in the waters between the Chinese and Filipinos for some time. However, after the determination of a new US foreign policy course, the time may come to review the existing agreements between the Philippines and China. Therefore, if it is beneficial for both sides to sabotage the situation, they will definitely take advantage of this opportunity, which could lead to further incidents of varying degrees of severity. #China #Philippines@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usAP NewsChinese and Philippine forces again avoid a clash in a fiercely disputed shoal under a rare dealThe Philippine navy has transported food and other supplies to a territorial ship outpost in a shoal in the South China Sea without any confrontation with Chinese forces guarding the area.	https://t.me/rybar/65549	2024-11-20T08:32:06-08:00

The German publication Der Spiegel published another sensation about the bombing of the Nord Streams: according to journalists, it was allegedly carried out by 12 citizens of the so-called. Ukraine under the leadership of Roman Chervinsky, who previously trained at the CIA. ▪️The article says that the bomb was prepared by a retired demolition expert, and the training took place in a lake and a flooded mine on Ukrainian territory. Later, the group with fake Romanian and Bulgarian passports arrived in Poland, where they rented a yacht.▪️In the process, saboteurs from among IT administrators and air conditioning specialists encountered many problems, including seasickness. As a result, they were able to plant six bombs on the branches of the gas pipeline, but one did not work, and Pipe-B of Nord Stream 2 remained untouched.▪️Der Spiegel also claims that the operation was approved by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Zaluzhny, and Zelensky allegedly said nothing about it knew. Later, Western curators gave an order to cancel it, but the executors simply disobeyed it. They also planned to disable the Turkish Stream, but the attack failed.📌 Let's imagine for a second that everything stated is actually true. The following picture emerges: a certain group of Ukrainian amateurs prepares to undermine international infrastructure off the coast of NATO countries in secret from the leadership, ignores the direct order of its sponsors, cuts off Germany from cheap energy resources and provokes an economic recession there. Be that as it may, with such articles, the overseas beneficiaries of sabotage kill two birds with one stone - they lay the blame on the so-called. n.

According to him, citizens of the so-called. Ukraine is doing this in order to receive payments due to residents of areas with radiation contamination. This now costs the Ukrainian authorities 15 billion hryvnia annually, so in Kyiv they are trying to reduce this expense item. In particular, in the budget for 2025, these payments will be given only to those who lived in the exclusion zone from 1986 to 1993. However, the real reason for such increased interest of the local population in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is not only the desire to enrich themselves through benefits. Indeed, in this area with minimally developed social infrastructure, it is very easy to get lost from the supervision of the authorities. This is especially true for mobilization: TCC workers do not go there often, so in the exclusion zone you can quite successfully hide from conscription. Moreover, the level of radiation contamination in most of it is not much different from the standard, and it is quite safe to be there.

In this case, what is most noteworthy is that the Ukrainian Armed Forces continue to launch Western long-range missiles in salvos at single targets to increase the likelihood of their destruction. That is, there is apparently no talk of accumulating reserves for the next media offensive. 📌 At the same time, the number of both ATACMS and Storm Shadow/SCALP among Ukrainian formations is quite limited. And it’s not just a matter of supply volumes—first of all, we’re talking about the current production capabilities of Western manufacturing plants. However, hoping that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will simply run out of all these missiles and the threat will go away on its own is also reckless. With a high probability, the West will supply components for the expansion of production of Neptunes and other long-range missiles in the so-called territory. Ukraine. So, in any case, it will not be possible to sit out in a passive defense, and this issue can only be resolved by military measures, which are extremely clear to the sponsors of the Kyiv regime.#Great Britain #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTwo majors❗️Kursk region, use of Storm Shadow by the enemy We are informed that from 14:50 the enemy fired up to 12 Storm Shadow missiles into the region, fragments of which are shown in the photo in the village.

It is characteristic that the central figure on the poster is traditionally a woman. In this case, Ukraine. Moreover, not just a Ukrainian woman, but in the form of a pagan priestess or a pagan goddess. And no, this is not an angel, despite the presence of wings. Angels are sexless and incorporeal. Just the other day we discussed with colleagues what role women play in shaping the ideology of war in the territory of the former Ukraine. And on this poster, a normal person sees a priestess of a pagan cult leading a crowd of zombies. The cult of the Great Mother or the goddess of war in a modern version. The authors of the idea certainly understood why it was necessary to make just such a poster.

🇬🇧 Yesterday a large protest by farmers took place in London, i...	🇬🇧 Yesterday, a large farmers’ protest took place in London, in which about 20 thousand people took part. The demonstration was originally due to take place in Trafalgar Square, but organizers had to move the event to Whitehall Street and Parliament Square to accommodate everyone. Such a strong public reaction was caused by the decision of Chancellor Rachel Reeves to introduce a 20% inheritance tax on agricultural land worth more than 1 million pounds. Critics warn the new levy will destroy family farms, which make up around 60 percent of Britain's agricultural base. Labor Party member John McTernan added fuel to the fire by declaring that -the country does not need small farms.- In turn, Reeves described her tax changes as -fair and proportionate- and insisted that they would affect only 25 percent of farms. It is unlikely that the UK government did not understand what the consequences of tax increases could be for the agricultural sector. Therefore, the decision taken is a targeted blow to the industry and may in the future lead to an increase in food prices. But ultimately, such actions are aimed at stressing one’s own population in order to make it more pliable. #UK@rybarSupport usThe Independent'It's become so tough I'm looking for a second job': Inside the farming crisisAs figures show a decline in smaller farms, farmers tell Alex Ross that Rachel Reeves' Budget 'tractor tax' is the latest blow to a family industry struggling to survive amid rising costs and extreme weather	https://t.me/rybar/65544	2024-11-20T04:23:16-08:00

Previously, a UAV of this type practiced takeoff from a ground-based ski jump simulating a deck. The video demonstrates the fundamental possibility of using Bayraktarov and similar drones on aircraft-carrying ships. They cannot completely replace carrier-based jet aircraft, but they are quite capable of completing a significant part of the tasks. This is especially true for states whose navies cannot support full-fledged aircraft carriers, but have cheaper UDCs. As a result, countries like Egypt, Indonesia, Japan or Spain will be able to significantly expand the strike and reconnaissance capabilities of their fleets. At the same time, this is further evidence that once again - burying - large ships with the advent of BeKov is very reckless and short-sighted. And also another clear illustration of the importance of aircraft-carrying ships, contrary to some populist slogans.#UAV #Turkey #fleet@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65542	2024-11-20T03:04:06-08:00

After the elections, President Maia Sandu and the leaders of the ruling PAS party admitted -mistakes- in the work of the government and promised to take into account -the opinion of citizens- in the formation of a new cabinet of ministers. However, in this matter, Sandu’s team did not keep their promises, since no real changes occurred. ▪️The head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Vladimir Bol, was transferred to head the Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development. Boley is associated with the agricultural crisis in Moldova: he is also credited with protecting large agricultural holdings offshore to the detriment of national interests and local producers. ▪️Bolya took the place of Andrei Spinu, who is called one of the main corrupt officials of the Sandu era and one of the most influential people in her team. He himself recently announced his resignation, but this is seen as a political move by PAS to temporarily remove the main irritant for society. ▪️The only new face in the government was the Minister of Agriculture Lyudmila Katlabuga. At the same time, she admitted that she does not yet have a program of action, although she was entrusted with the most critical area. ▪️The head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Adrian Efros, resigned, and his position will be taken by the ministry’s Secretary of State Daniela Misail-Nikitina, who does not even have a specialized legal education. As a result, the government limited itself to only three minor changes, although mass resignations were predicted. Even the Minister of Justice, Veronica Mihailova-Moraru, remained in office, although Sandu herself recently announced the complete failure of reform in this area. Once again, Sandu and PAS are not keeping their promises, since there will clearly not be any fundamental changes in the work of the already ineffective government. This is also due to the fact that Sandu’s team does not tolerate dissent and people of other views, which is why the choice of managers is limited in advance.#Moldova @rybarSupport usInterfaxThere will be personnel changes in the Cabinet of Ministers of Moldova.

However, his visit gained popularity for completely different reasons. While on the beach, the head of the Israeli government addressed the Palestinian population with the following proposal - he promised to pay $5 million for each freed Israeli hostage held captive by Hamas. He guaranteed those who responded to the call free departure from the enclave along with their families. 🔻It is noteworthy that Benjamin Netanyahu made a similar proposal 13 months after the escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is not something new - previously everything was limited to SMS messages and leaflets, which offered to transfer information about the places of detention of captive Israelis for a fee. However, even if the IDF manages to obtain informants in this way, it will not be so easy to save the hostages. Especially considering that often such operations not only did not produce results, but also led to the death of Israelis in captivity. Among Hamas members there are even fewer willing to agree to such a proposal, and this is not only due to fears of being exposed. Agreeing to the Israeli proposal does not guarantee protection: at best, such militants will end up in an Israeli prison, at worst, they will simply be taken by the IDF to an unknown destination after completing their mission. 📌 Such statements are much more aimed at the Israeli audience, especially those participating in anti-government protests demanding a deal with Hamas. This allows Israel's ruling authorities to claim that they did everything possible for a peaceful outcome, but the Palestinians left them no choice.#Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65539	2024-11-20T00:21:11-08:00

The agreement opens up the opportunity for joint exercises and training of Congolese military personnel. It is also another episode of increasing interaction with the authorities in Brazzaville.📌 In fact, the Republic of Congo is becoming the next point of attraction for Russian interests on the West African coast after Equatorial Guinea, whose leadership is also building bridges with Russia. Previously, a construction agreement was concluded with the Congolese authorities oil pipeline with the involvement of Russian companies. Now interaction with the country is being established through military-technical cooperation. Yes, this memorandum is more like a -declaration of intent- than a more serious agreement. However, in any case, this is another small step to strengthen positions in West Africa.#Africa #Congo #Russia@rybarSupport usfunction.mil.ruMeeting of Deputy Minister of Defense A.

🔁 ATACMS and media sovereignty In 78 days of autumn, Russian air...	Forwarded From NechaevATACMS and media sovereignty During 78 days of autumn, Russian air defense intercepted 79 ATACMS missiles. Until November 17, few people were interested in this, since analyzing statistics from the Ministry of Defense reports had become a routine even for employees of specialized media, let alone ordinary people. But on November 17, everyone became alarmed. Why suddenly? Oh, yes: The New York Times reported Biden's decision to approve long-range strikes deep into Russia. In the language of NATO countries, this is called -allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles on Russian territory.- The phrase requires translation: • Allow Ukraine = try to shift responsibility to a proxy, in order to then repeat the sacred phrase that the United States and NATO are not parties to the conflict; • Apply = pretend that the -red button- is being pressed by proxies that have their own reconnaissance and target designation system. In reality, this is done by the American satellite constellation, data processing and transmission centers in the USA, Britain and France, as well as specialists loading flight missions into rockets (details here); • On the territory of Russia = on the territory of Russia within the borders of 1991-2013, of course, because missiles are flying across Crimea, eastern Novorossiya and Donbass without Biden’s sanction, since in their picture of the world it is Ukraine. Further, this phrase is picked up not only by Reuters, Le Figaro and other El Pais, but also by almost all Russian federal media, including state ones. And everything is presented as if there are no new regions, as if the air defense does not shoot down ATACMS missiles month after month, as if the Supreme Commander in June and September did not explain the operating principle of such systems and did not voice Russia’s possible responses to the obvious expansion of the conflict zone. Further - worse. After lunch on November 19, one of the most quoted Russian agencies releases news with the headline -The Ukrainian Armed Forces launched the first strike with an American ATACMS missile on Russian territory-. First? No, colleagues. Not even 101st. A few hours later, apparently, one of the agency employees came to his senses, remembered the referendums of 2014 and 2022, the changes in the Russian Constitution, the successes of air defense - and changed the headline: -The Ukrainian Armed Forces launched the first ATACMS strike deep into Russian territory-. Also a controversial formulation, but oh well. Let's note a more important thing. The ATACMS story exposed the lack of media sovereignty in Russia. What does this lead to in practice? On the one hand, to the psychosis of the masses and the formation of a distorted picture of the world among millions of readers. This can be seen in media traffic, comments on social networks and query statistics in search engines. People ride on emotional swings. And on the other hand, it leads to the creation of an erroneous illusion for the enemy: -Judging by their reactions, if you press a little more, then maybe they will flinch?!-. They won’t flinch, of course. But the perception of the limits of what is permissible will be adjusted not in our favor and will require much greater resources to restore parity and balance of power. What to do? To begin with, it is worth realizing that sovereignty is not only political, economic, military, technological, cultural - but also media, because this is the 21st century and multi-domain operations are only gaining momentum. Therefore, you should not help the enemy in information and cognitive wars. And most importantly, sovereignty begins not with an official in the Kremlin, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the FSB, but with your loved one, your way of thinking, self-discipline and responsibility. Otherwise, a strange situation arises: the military shoots down ATACMS in commercial quantities, and the media (not all) do not even try to repel someone else’s media missile and launch a counterattack. And it should be!	https://t.me/rybar/65529	2024-11-19T13:25:02-08:00

The goal of the operation is to unblock those encircled in the Signal Corps, which have been holding it since April 2023. To do this, the Sudanese army will have to break through either through industrial zones or through densely populated Shambat and Samrab.▪️Also a significant event was the cutting off of the Sennar salient, as a result of which it will become more difficult for the RRF to supply its group in the Blue Nile and Sinj. During the fighting, government troops took the large city of Dinder. The rebels did not sit on the defensive and during the counterattack they occupied the village of Tambol, carrying out a massacre in it: ▪️There were reports of the successes of the RSF in the Ed-Dueim area and their capture of several villages north of the city, and in El-Fasher, neither side cannot achieve success. At the same time, recently there have been more and more incidents related to violence against the civilian population by the rebels. Despite the successes of government forces, they still find it difficult to regain territory. And the lack of dialogue between the parties due to the fact that all peace initiatives are taking place under the patronage of the United States only prolongs the conflict. Against this background, contacts between representatives of the Sudanese authorities and Russia look curious: Energy Minister Mohiddin Al-Naim Said said that Russian companies are invited to work at oil production facilities in safe Sudanese areas. He also agreed on the supply of turbines to the Power Machines company for the hydroelectric power station in Merowe. In fact, even a war-torn side can provide projects attractive to domestic investors. This also means that prospects for post-war cooperation in civilian areas are already being laid.

The Bundeswehr has intensified the implementation of the Operation Plan -Germany-. The secret strategic document includes the procedure for preparing the country in case of war with Russia, writes Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitun. For these purposes, military department officers provide consultations and training to enterprise management during wartime. In particular, at the events of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry, recommendations were made to train at least five additional truck drivers for every hundred employees. This measure is due to the German military’s concerns about the unreliability of 70% of German drivers who come from Eastern European countries. In relation to such workers, it is recommended to draw up a plan outlining what to expect and how to handle such employees. In addition, it is recommended to engage in self-sufficiency in backup sources of electricity, through the purchase of diesel generators or wind power plants. The document also lists all structures and infrastructure that are especially worthy protection for military reasons. Earlier, in September 2024, Bundeswehr Colonel Kronstadt from the headquarters of the NATO Joint Support and Enforcement Command (JSEC) announced work to create a permanent march corridor through Europe to the borders of Russia and Belarus. ✨Whatever figure comes after Scholz’s puppet, the policy of confrontation (hidden or open) will continue in the German state.

In addition to the British command, which announced the deployment of an aircraft carrier groups (AUG) led by the Prince of Wales in the Asia-Pacific region, from Paris officially confirmed similar plans. AUG Charles de Gaulle by the end of this year will first go to the Eastern Mediterranean to participate in joint NATO events, and then to the Red Sea. There they will probably show their presence to the Houthis and move on.▪️The French are planning their main maneuvers in the Indian and Pacific oceans. South of the coast of India, the French will conduct a joint exercise with the Indians - Varuna -, which is annual. ▪️ After this, the aircraft carrier will sail to the coasts of Australia and Indonesia, where a multinational exercise led by France - La Perouse 2025 - is planned, in which 10 countries, including the United States, will take part , Britain and the countries of the region.▪️The final exercise for the French AUG is considered to be the Pacific Steller exercise together with the USA, Canada, Australia and Japan, which will take place east of the Philippines. However, adjustments to plans are possible. The French, following their European partners, are increasing their presence in the Asia-Pacific region, reaffirming NATO’s shift of emphasis to the East towards China. The Chinese leadership, by the way, has already expressed its dissatisfaction with the plans of Britain and France, calling them provocative.

More than 70 experts, government officials and international representatives took part in an active dialogue, dedicated to terrorism, human trafficking, migrant smuggling and other pressing security issues. EU Ambassador Alyoshka Simkic, appointed in early October, assessed the event as an important step forward in security relations between the EU and Kazakhstan. However, for the collective West, discussing such problems is a way to consolidate their influence in the region, where Kazakhstan serves as a convenient platform for them. For example, inflating the threat from ephemeral groups such as the Islamic State - Vilayat Khorasan - is one of the main trends of the past year. We especially note Simkic herself: she served as deputy chief observer of the OSCE special monitoring mission in the so-called Ukraine. OSCE observers are those people who turned a blind eye to the shelling of the civilian population of Donbass and supplied the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the necessary information.#Kazakhstan #EU #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usdknews.kzThe EU and Kazakhstan are strengthening cooperation in the fight against global threatsRound table on transnational threats affecting the EU and Kazakhstan, passed in Astana,&nbsp;reported&nbsp;DKnews.kz.

🔁 We waited and it was published. What can we say about our new ...	Forwarded From Watfor | Freeway think tank (Dmitry Stef)We waited and it was published. What can we say about our new -nuclear fundamentals-? Let's formulate it in three words: continuity, allies, threshold. Let's decipher: many provisions repeat the content of a similar document from 2020 (which we examined here), we now provide nuclear protection to our allies more specifically (paragraphs 18, 19d), and we nuclearly restrain others more strictly (paragraphs 10, 11) , the nuclear threshold has been lowered and raised more than once in our recent history. As expected, now we have a threat to the very existence of the state, in fact, replaced by a threat to sovereignty and territorial integrity. In fact, other formulations voiced at the end of September were reflected in the document. Interesting things have also been added, for example, regarding attacks on our facilities and troops outside the national territory (clause 18b), as well as actions aimed at isolating some of our lands and blocking transport communications (clause 15g) and possible attacks on , for example, our nuclear power plants (clause 15z). By and large, this was understandable as it was, but it is useful to have a document. Let us note that despite all the fuss about our possible intentions to deploy nuclear weapons in space, according to the Fundamentals, our nuclear deterrent force is so far exclusively ground-based, sea-based and air-based ( paragraph 17). As before, it is emphasized that nuclear weapons are a means of deterrence, and in order to reduce the nuclear threat, any military conflicts, not just nuclear ones, must be prevented (paragraph 5). The author’s favorite point about the continuity of nuclear deterrence, but only until the use of nuclear weapons, has also been preserved (paragraph 14). Accordingly, without any restoration of deterrence through use, we will find ourselves in some new world. In a very uncomfortable world. Let us also note the preservation of the somewhat crooked formulation about ballistic missiles (clause 19a). Apparently, we are talking about SLBMs, ICBMs and, possibly, IRBMs, but, of course, now everyone is running in circles around the ATACMS- dispenser. Let us emphasize once again - in any case, there is no automatism in the entire section III and there cannot be. These are the conditions, and the decision will be made by the President (clause 20) based on the completeness of the data processed by decision support systems. Well, then he will, perhaps, inform his counterparties in other countries and international organizations (clause 21). What is the reason for all these changes? Everyone talks about the air defense system, about attacks by Western missiles, and so on, but global subjects cannot be taken out of the equation. Nuclear arsenals tend to grow; the emergence of new nuclear powers cannot be ruled out; in recent years, nuclear weapons have been returning as a key factor in international military-political relations. At the same time, you should not consider nuclear weapons to be a magic wand: it is a useful tool, but by no means a universal one. You have to be strong, as they say among their people, across the entire spectrum. We’ll interrupt the quick analysis here, but we won’t finish it. Stay with us.#stratdelaPS And references to arms control, including as a basic principle of nuclear deterrence, have also disappeared from the current text. It's sad, but it seems true. Perhaps, by the next update of the document, this tool will return to its rightful place in the national security arsenal.	https://t.me/rybar/65521	2024-11-19T06:46:02-08:00

A serviceman cannot just break away and go to another sector. Here the connections of unit commanders come to the rescue, and the relatives of one soldier are sent to rescue others... Synopsis: The Russian Armed Forces continue to liberate the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic. On the way – the city of Krasnogorovka. As is often the case in the city, combat operations are complicated by the presence of civilians, who are often trapped or even used as cover by the enemy. Russian troops face a difficult task: to organize the evacuation of civilians without losing fighters. In such conditions, the professionalism of drone operators is fully revealed, who not only carry out timely reconnaissance, but also cover attack aircraft, leading people to a safe place. Among the civilians who find themselves in a trap, there are also relatives of those military personnel who are fighting in other directions. Soldiers, fulfilling their duty, cannot themselves come to the aid of their relatives. But fighters from other units know: today they will save the loved ones of their comrades in arms, and tomorrow their comrades will most likely help out their families.📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

The reason is a natural reduction in arms exports from the so-called. Ukraine under contracts concluded before the SVO. This was caused not only by our own increased needs, but also by the consequences of Russian attacks on enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex. What happened as a whole is a logical consequence of the current situation, when, in the face of problems with recruiting manpower for the so-called.

The article contains interesting details: ▪️The main inspirer of the landing was Great Britain, which oversaw the creation of the Marine Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and called for its use - for its intended purpose, and not in the fields near Donetsk -. At the same time, in London they demanded that the crossing of the Dnieper begin immediately after the explosion of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric station in May 2023.▪️The minimum task was to create and expand a bridgehead with access to the M-14 highway, and the maximum was access to the Crimean Isthmus. For this, all four marine brigades were involved, and the calculation was based on the fact that the Russian Armed Forces did not have a second line of defense.▪️During the landing, the village of Krynki was captured, but insufficient planning, a lack of boats and electronic warfare equipment led to serious logistical difficulties. In other areas, the situation was even worse: in the area of ​​the Poyma Marines, 36 infantry infantry fighting units were covered by Iskanders, the losses amounted to 90 people killed and wounded.▪️Although initially high hopes were placed on the operation until the course of hostilities changed, by the beginning of 2024 they were in a poorly supplied the bridgehead demotivated the personnel. The situation was worsened by the transfer of reinforcements by the Russian Armed Forces from airborne units and bombing strikes, which turned the area into a lunar landscape.▪️As ​​a result, in July the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely abandoned Krynki, but this decision was late by at least two months and only led to unnecessary losses. Due to attacks on watercraft, sometimes it was necessary to escape by swimming. Although this was certainly not an easy walk for the RF Armed Forces, the enemy did not achieve a single goal - participants from the Armed Forces of Ukraine note that as a result, they only managed to draw the forces of the RF Armed Forces to the site at the cost of considerable losses - very valuable people -. At the same time, the same brigades of the so-called Marine Corps. Ukraine could rationally use it in the same Donbass. And from a more global point of view, the operation is a clear example of how Great Britain is waging a war by proxy. And all costs are borne by the so-called. Ukraine, losing operational reserve to meet sponsors' demands.#Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65517	2024-11-19T04:43:06-08:00
🖼 🇷🇺🖍 Happy Missile Forces and Artillery Day! On the morning ...	🇷🇺🖍 Happy Rocket Forces and Artillery Day! On the morning of November 19, 1942, a powerful artillery barrage marked the beginning of the Soviet offensive near Stalingrad, which became a turning point in the entire Second World War. Two years later, the date was chosen as the holiday of Artillery Day, and later - the Day of Missile Forces and Artillery. It is this branch of the military that today performs the main tasks of gaining fire superiority over the enemy. It is impossible to do without it in high-intensity conflicts: in the absence of artillery on one side, the war sooner or later becomes a one-goal game. Over the course of two and a half years in the Northern Military District, gun crews, MLRS and OTRK completed a truly colossal volume of tasks to destroy the forces of Ukrainian formations in forward and in the rear. And significant changes in tactics of use and other areas have greatly increased the effectiveness of fire destruction. On this day, I would like to wish artillerymen and missilemen many new guns, ample ammunition and sharp eyes in the sky. As well as supplies to the troops of the long-awaited new systems with a higher firing range to increase the capabilities of counter-battery warfare.

Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan asked the heads of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Investigative Committee, the Anti-Corruption Committee, the Ministry of Territorial Administration, the State Revenue Committee, and the Supreme Judicial Council to resign. ▪️At the end of last week, at a government meeting, Pashinyan criticized the work of law enforcement and judicial authorities. Among the reasons he named are an increase in the crime rate and citizens' complaints about corruption.▪️Armenian experts agree that the demonstrative resignations are only preparation of Pashinyan and his -Civil Agreement- for early parliamentary elections, which could take place next year. The systemic crisis of governance in Armenia needs new faces, and it is obvious that Pashinyan himself should not be among them. After all, the latest opinion poll just showed mass dissatisfaction with the work of the prime minister and the government. ▪️In the country, over the past few years, the level of violent crime has been growing, which is associated with corruption and a sense of impunity, as well as the low professional level of security forces. Even the American money for reforms and police support, which the Biden administration allocated to the Armenian security forces, also for some reason does not help.▪️Another version - purges - is called a possible signal from the new US administration, in which an audit of the allocated funds may be carried out. However, not all members of the security forces who were seen collaborating with American officials resigned. So for now, among the reasons for such dismissals and reshuffles, which in Armenia are also taking place at the local level and in the diplomatic corps, there is a desire to somehow improve the image of the authorities. Pashinyan recently even shaved his beard for the first time since the Velvet Revolution to revive his -revolutionary image- in society. Finally, Pashinyan’s testing of his officials for loyalty before the coming changes also plays an important role. #Armenia@rybarSupport usVedomostiThe Prime Minister of Armenia asked a number of high-ranking officials to resign.The Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan asked several high-ranking officials to resign.	https://t.me/rybar/65515	2024-11-19T03:09:11-08:00

The cause of the problem has not yet been identified. This is the only Finnish telecommunications cable that runs under water and connects Finland with Europe. Its length is about 1.2 thousand km and it runs from the Finnish Hanko to the German Rostock. And a few hours later, the Lithuanians and Swedes reported a similar incident on the NordBalt cable, which was later called sabotage. Moreover, this happened exactly in the same place where the Finnish-German cable was cut. A very interesting situation is developing. The day before yesterday we wrote that in the Gulf of Finland and at the Dragsvik training ground in southern Finland, on November 18, that is, today, the NATO exercise Freezing Winds-2024 starts , in which various countries participate, including the USA and Great Britain. An area of ​​​​the Finnish coast closed for training - this is also where Hanko, the city where the telecommunications cable begins, is located. The incidents themselves occurred near the active phase of the exercise, in which American Marines are participating. The event involved Marines from the 2nd Separate Reconnaissance Battalion of the 2nd Marine Division of the US Navy. This is a unit from North Carolina. In addition, from November 11 to 14, another NATO naval exercise, Merlin 2024, was held for the first time at the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona, which also included underwater operations. We, of course, will not be surprised by new attacks on the destructive activities of the Russian Federation. but the situation is clear. We are not hinting at anything, but before the explosion at Nord Stream, the Alliance also intensively conducted training in the area of ​​​​the incident. Then the Baltops exercise took place.

An EU grant (32 million euros) within the framework of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Route project will carry out a major overhaul of the railway sections in Moldova:◾️-Valchynets-Ocnita - – is part of the route from Romania to Ukraine through the Vinnytsia region. The route passes through the city of Mogilev-Podolsky and has long been used for the delivery of weapons and fuels and lubricants for the Armed Forces of Ukraine;◾️-Balti-Ungheni-Chisinau- - will help improve capacity in the Romanian direction and is intended to relieve congestion on the northern routes of communication with Ukraine; ◾️-Chisinau-Cainary- - will connect the central railway tracks with the southern route for the delivery of goods from Odessa to the Black Sea and Danube ports through the stations - Cimislia-Bessarabka-Etulia-Giurgiulesti-. These sections provide for the replacement of the canvas, restoration of the embankment and other work. on 128 km of roads. The seriousness of the EU's intentions to restore the tracks is indicated by Moldova's commitment to establish supervision over the work. For this purpose, the State Enterprise - Railway of Moldova - has already signed a contract with the Greek 🇬🇷 Obermeyer Hellas and the German 🇩🇪 DB Engineering&amp;Consulting. In October 2024, more than 8 thousand tons of rails were delivered to Moldova by four ships for the reconstruction of the railway section - Bendery - Bessarabka-Etulia-Giurgiulesti- (233 km). Previously, we analyzed the plans and progress of projects to connect the railway infrastructure of the EU countries and Ukraine. Some of those routes will connect with Moldovan railways.

Since the beginning of November, the configuration of the front along the entire border has undergone virtually no changes, but four days ago the Israelis launched a surprise offensive and have already achieved some successes. ▪️In the western sector, Israeli units became more active in the middle of last week: during this period, Al-Jabane, as well as at least the outskirts of Teir Harfa and Shamaa, came under the control of the Israel Defense Forces. In the latter, the Israelis occupied the Shamun al-Safa mosque, which is located in the southeast of the village. To the south, Israeli troops are advancing from the outskirts of Yarin both towards Alma al-Shaab and the same Teir Kharfa. At the same time, Hezbollah fighters practically do not undertake counterattacks, limiting themselves to ambushes and missile launches at Israeli positions in the settlements they occupy. ❗️The offensive in this area opens up quite large prospects for Israeli troops, who can begin moving in the direction of coastal An-Nakura, which they never managed to break through from Labune. On the other hand, establishing control over Shama and Majdal Zun will allow them to take positions on the mountain hills. From it it will be possible not only to fire at all nearby Hezbollah targets, but also to continue moving towards the Mediterranean coast.▪️In the central sector, the main clashes are unfolding in the Bint Jebel area, where the Israelis have already attempted to advance several times. One of them ended quite tragically for them: on Wednesday, Israeli soldiers from the Golani brigade were ambushed, as a result of which six people were killed and four more were injured. To the east, IDF units are advancing from Ait al-Shaab in the direction of Al-Kawz. In recent days, they have managed to somewhat expand the zone of control here, but so far Hezbollah fighters have managed to maintain confident control over Al-Kawza, thwarting all attempts by Israeli troops to gain a foothold on the outskirts of the village.▪️Fierce fighting is still taking place in the northeastern sector Khiam - dozens of messages about shootouts and attacks in the vicinity of the city appear on the Internet every day, however, given the lack of objective control personnel, it is possible to establish the exact configuration of the front in this area difficult. At the same time, Israeli troops attacked south of Markaba and north of Hula. Most likely, they will try to bypass these populated areas and occupy Tallusa and Beni Hayyan, with the expectation that Hezbollah’s defenses in this area are weaker than on the Markaba - Rat al-Talatin line.

🖼 ❗️🇬🇧🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 Each creature has a pair: again about Weste...	❗️🇬🇧🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 For every creature: again about Western long-range missiles I remember when Western countries only approved the use of their long-range missiles in new territories and Crimea, unfortunate analysts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) immediately rolled out a list objects to strike. Then we decided to help not only our military personnel, but also ordinary citizens, by publishing an analysis of the time of approach of each missile - both ATACMS and Storm Shadow / SCALP, for which they received a lot of gratitude. And today ISW again published a list with important objects in their opinion in the territory Russia is within missile range, starting from the Bryansk region and ending with the Krasnodar region. We did a new analysis of the time of arrival of these missiles. In our analysis, we considered not only the Kursk region, since we extremely doubt that the Armed Forces of Ukraine, with a push from the West, will limit themselves to only one region. Any object in any region can be used under the pretext of protecting the Ukrainian Armed Forces. One of the main targets for Ukrainian attacks are tactical and army aviation airfields, which provide the necessary advantage to our infantry units. They were the ones that ISW paid attention to, so we put them on the map.▪️The ATACMS OTR should be considered the most dangerous due to its flight speed and difficulty in detecting and subsequent defeat. At a distance of 120 km, the OTR will fly in 1 minute 20 seconds, and at a maximum of 300 km - in 3 minutes 20 seconds.▪️Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles have been used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces for a long time, and air defense units are more adapted to them. They will fly to a distance of 120 km in 9 minutes, and to 270 km in a little more than 20 minutes.▪️We also took into account the German Taurus missiles in the analysis, since the likelihood of their approval also exists taking into account the tactics of the current Western governments. -Taurus- faster than -Storms-. 120 km will be covered in 6 minutes 11 seconds, and 300 km in 15 minutes 30 seconds.❗️This is an approximate calculation taking into account the maximum flight speed of rockets, which may vary. In addition, the countdown was carried out from a conditional line along the border, which can also change depending on conditions - aircraft or launchers can be either further from the border or closer to it. To achieve maximum range, the enemy will have to approach close to the demarcation line. This is to some extent beneficial for us, since it increases the chances of timely detection and destruction, so the Armed Forces of Ukraine will take such risks extremely rarely. And these calculations are applicable not only in the marked regions on the map, but also in other areas, for example, in Rostov or in the Krasnodar Territory, since the distance will allow the use of missiles in these directions, which should be kept in mind when organizing defense.

This news also reached our news agencies.▪️According to journalists, the Defense Space Administration has begun production of the following series of UAVs: reconnaissance AYBARS-II, ADAN 70, Patroller-20, assault SZK-290, MIKIYA-20 and some semblance of the Oturukpokpo transporter. Only now , none of them were developed in Nigeria. For example, AYBARS-II for the Nigerian Armed Forces was purchased in January 2024 from the Turkish company BMC Defense Technologies. Judging by the names, the remaining UAVs were also purchased from lesser-known companies in Turkey. ▪️Even though these models were presented as a promotion at arms exhibitions, the fact is that there is no real production in Nigeria. And the primary source was the Nigerian media reviewing African weapons.🔻As we have repeatedly noted, due to their cheapness relative to Western UAVs and a large selection, Turkish drones have become the main procurement objects for African armies. Of course, many would like to promote them in the arms market, in including Nigerian manufacturers striving for regional leadership. But other than advertising at all sorts of inter-African exhibitions, they are good for nothing. #Africa #UAVs #Nigeria@rybarSupport usTACCZBC: Nigeria has begun production of its own line of UAVs.

🖼 🇮🇶🇹🇷🏴 About the progress of the Turkish operation in Iraq...	🇮🇶🇹🇷🏴 About the progress of the Turkish operation in Iraq After the terrorist attack in Turkey, everyone expected the start of the ground phase of the Turkish Armed Forces against the Kurdish forces, as indicated by loud statements from the top leadership of the republic. But the Turks, after carrying out several massive attacks, calmed down. Whether this was due to the elections in the United States or the diplomatic efforts of the Iraqi authorities, who do not want another chaos in their country, is difficult to say now, but in fact the activity of Turkish troops has really decreased.🔻Over the past week 10 flights of F-16C/D fighters and 11 flights of drones - Akinji - were noted in northern Iraq. A total of 16 strikes were carried out, of which two were carried out by artillery units of the Turkish ground forces.▪️The targets chosen for the strikes remained unchanged. The Turks attacked PKK positions hidden in the mountainous terrain, firing points, various warehouses and cars with Kurds from the PKK (as they stated in press releases from the Ministry of Defense).▪️The problem is that this information cannot be verified. We saw with our own eyes how Akynci and Bayraktar work, and it is difficult to say for sure in the case of Iraq. The Kurds are very well camouflaged, and in most cases the Turks strike at random.❗️The activity of the Turkish Armed Forces over the past week can be considered standard daily, that is, on average, on an unremarkable day, a couple of fighters and two drones fly for target designation and strikes (-Bayraktary- and -Anki - are not taken into account, since there are a lot of them flying). At first glance, there is nothing remarkable about this, but, tracking the statistics flights of aviation and drones, you can see in advance the preparations of the Turkish side for intensification, which will be visible in the increase in flights and strikes on the occupied territory. Currently, there is a lull in this direction (as well as in Syria), but the Turks will not give up what they want just like that. And the Erdogan administration is also keeping silent for now, as if waiting for some favorable moment.

🖼 🇦🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the Australian -Abrams- for the Armed Force...	🇦🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 About the Australian -Abrams- for the VSUArchangel Spetsnaz writes that in connection with the delivery by the Americans of the first batch of M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks to Australia, we should expect in the coming weeks the delivery of outdated models -Abrams-, which were in service with the Australians, for the needs Armed Forces of Ukraine.📌 Even with the official announcement of the transfer of this or that equipment, the Americans may not actually give up something. This was the example of many countries - Taiwan alone suffered from this many times. Moreover, before that, the new Abrams were shown by the Australians in single quantities at an exhibition in mid-October, but there were no further facts of their receipt.❗️ Having studied the flights of transport aviation of the Australian Air Force , we noted that throughout November, four or five C-17 heavy transport aircraft made more than one flight to the United States. You can’t say for sure why, but everything coincides with the statements of the Australian authorities about the receipt of the first batch. Therefore, the delivery of tanks, at least some part, most likely took place. As for the so-called Ukraine, whose authorities have been begging these tanks from Australia for more than a year, progress is noticeable in this direction. Particular activity of heavy cargo aircraft was also noted in the area of ​​​​the city of Perth, a port on the western coast of the continent, which is used for transportation from Australia to the Middle East and Europe. It is much more convenient to send dozens of units of heavy armored vehicles by sea than by air. At the same time, on October 28, one of the Australian C-17s made a long flight from Amberley airbase to Rzeszow, Poland, with a stop in the Middle East. Rzeszow is a transit point where Western countries unload weapons and equipment transported for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And this flight looks very interesting in the context of statements by the Australian leadership. If we add to this the permission to strike with long-range missiles and the obvious preparation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces for a counterattack, then tanks are what the Ukrainian formations lack, so their transfer is either already underway or will take place in the near future.

Forwarded From Awakening Dragon 🐲🇰🇵🇰🇷 News is coming from North Korea about the IV meeting of commanders and political instructors of the battalions of the Korean People's Army. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in his speech during the event, talked about American support for Ukraine, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and the creation of an analogue of NATO in the region. In addition, Kim called for every effort to be made to improve preparations for war. In his opinion, every day represents a precious opportunity for this. 🔻After reading this, we can conclude that military operations on the Korean Peninsula will begin in the near future. However, it is important to understand what kind of war North Korea is preparing for. In our opinion, we are talking specifically about a defensive scenario. This is indicated by the construction of defense structures that began this year on almost all parts of the border with South Korea, the recent destruction of roads and railway lines connecting the two countries, as well as the conclusion of an agreement with Russia that includes an article on providing assistance in the event of an attack. . ▪️The last point appears to reduce the likelihood of any military action on the peninsula, because the treaty is aimed at containing the threat from the emerging alliance of the United States, South Korea and Japan. In general, the outbreak of a major conflict in the region now does not seem to be a very realistic scenario. Especially when it comes to an attack on South Korea by the DPRK. Therefore, the warlike rhetoric of both sides should be divided into two. @awaken_dragonTelegramTwo majors🇰🇵 November 18, KCNA: Kim Jong-un accused the United States and South Korea of ​​creating the most tense situation in history on the Korean Peninsula.

🔁🖼 ❗️RT analysis: which ATACMS missiles are the most dangerous ...	Forwarded From RT in Russian❗️RT analysis: which ATACMS missiles are the most dangerous and how many of them the US has Among the modifications of these missiles, two types stand out.▫️The first is the MGM-140B ATACMS Block 1A with a cassette warhead. ▫️The second is MGM-168A ATACMS Block 1A (QRU) with a high-explosive fragmentation part. Both versions have a launch range of up to 300 km and are dangerous for both military and industrial facilities. Since the 1980s, about 3.5 thousand ATACMS missiles of all modifications have been produced in the United States. Of this amount, about 600-700 units have already been used in combat, including 414 missiles during operations in Iraq in 2003. As of 2024, the United States, according to various estimates, may have about 2 thousand missiles in stock, including both new manufactured missiles and refurbished old ones. However, part of this supply may be unavailable due to expiration or other factors. It is known that a key feature of all modifications of ATACMS missiles is high-speed dive from the upper layers of the stratosphere at a speed of about 1100-850 m/s at angles greater than 75-80°. In some cases, such trajectories extend beyond the vertical sectors of view of the guidance radars of the S-400 and S-300V4 complexes. And therefore, an important part of the preparation for repelling an ATACMS attack will be the distribution of individual anti-aircraft missile divisions and regiments in a missile-hazardous direction for a sufficient level of separation. It is also worth noting that the S-350 -Vityaz- medium- and long-range air defense systems have high potential in the fight against ATACMS. the missiles of which will be able to shoot down ATACMS even in the event of anti-missile maneuvers due to the presence of a system of gas-dynamic rudders. It is known that this system does a good job of repelling HIMARS strikes in the Donetsk direction.🟩 Subscribe | Send news | Read analytics	https://t.me/rybar/65493	2024-11-18T04:50:38-08:00

Despite the fact that on the northern flank on the approaches to Mirnograd the activity of the Russian Armed Forces has decreased slightly, to the west of Selidovo Russian troops continue to expand the zone of control on the flanks near the city.▪️On the northern front, attacks are recorded at the Grodovka-Nikolaevka line, where, according to the results of several attacks Over the past weeks, Russian troops have been able to occupy several enemy strongholds. Enemy aviation activity is noted, using guided bombs to strike positions of the Russian Armed Forces. On the northern approaches to Novogrodovka there are oncoming battles. The enemy regularly counterattacks based on Mirnograd and defensive lines in the area of ​​the railway in the direction of mine No. 3 -Novogrodovskaya-. One of the fortified areas north of Novogrodovka and west of Krutoy Yar is currently, apparently, a contested territory in which UAV operators of both sides are operating with varying success.▪️At the Grigorovka-Novogrodovka line, a significant expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops is also recorded. Vast fields to the northeast and southwest of the M-30 highway have been cleared of the enemy. In addition, attack aircraft occupied several strongholds of Ukrainian formations in the area. The information is confirmed both by information from the field and by footage published on the Internet.▪️In Petrovka, meanwhile, several units of armored vehicles and vehicles of Ukrainian formations were destroyed, which with enviable consistency Ukrainian commanders send along the same targeted route along forest belts near the railway. In Grigorovka, on the western outskirts, the Russian flag was raised by soldiers from the 1437 motorized rifle regiment of the Alexandria Brigade.❗️In addition, the control zone in the vicinity of Novoalekseevka was significantly expanded. Russian attack aircraft reached the outskirts of Yuryevka, where fighting began. By now, the settlement has most likely been taken: the control of the Russian Armed Forces over half of the village is reliably known.

The construction of the Rasht-Astara branch is currently underway, in addition to which Russian companies want to invest in construction of a road with Russian standard gauge from Parsabad to Bandar Abbas.📌 Hypothetically, this project looks very, very promising, since it will significantly reduce both the time and costs of logistics from both Russia and Iran. Now trade goes through the Caspian Sea and periodically by air, but this cannot be compared with the railway in terms of volume and speed. Plus, Russia will have access to the Persian Gulf and India, with which there is also an active trade in goods. There are many nuances that need to be overcome, for example, the electrification of the railway track, which will take a lot of time. But upon completion of the construction of the branch from Astara, the situation will be significantly easier.❗️The long-term benefits from this project exceed the possible costs, since when the designated goals are achieved, everyone will benefit - Russia and Iran as the main operators, and Azerbaijan as a transit country.#Azerbaijan #Iran # Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65488	2024-11-18T03:50:17-08:00

And central to it is the influence of artificial intelligence both on the formation of these threats and countering them. Significant changes in this area are expected next year due to a sharp technological leap in the field of AI and the emergence of new methods of disinformation, propaganda, deception and falsification thanks to technologies based on AI such as deepfake content.▪️The authors of the article pay great attention to the use of malware to steal personal data and ransomware, which in connection with The emergence of new resources has also become even more sophisticated. ▪️In addition, according to the Americans, the old traditional ciphers are outdated. Due to the development of quantum technologies, methods that were previously effective no longer work, and next year the question of more stable encryption standards will become relevant. ❗️But with all this and the current assessment of modern threats in this space, the Americans left clichéd points about the -Big Four- - this is how they call Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, as the main sources of cyber danger within the framework of geopolitical confrontation.🔻With the advent of artificial intelligence, various spheres of life accelerated their development.

Rybar: 🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 On permission to use long-range missiles Since the Americans, represented by the outgoing administration, decided that there was no point sitting quietly on Sunday evening and, apparently, gave the go-ahead for the use of ATACMS in the old Russian territories, it’s time... ❗️🇷 🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 Beats long-range missiles at the old territories: how many missiles? And in conditions of approval from not only the United States, but also Great Britain and France, to fire long-range missiles at the old Russian territories, you need to look at it from a pragmatic military point of view. The euphoria of the Ukrainians was during the transmission of HIMARS, -Abramsov-, -Storm Shadow-, ATACMS, but it was short-lived. This did not lead to truly positive results, and Russian units adapted each time (even the head of the UK Ministry of Defense openly admits this, saying that any know-how lasts only two months). The West always transferred exactly as much to the Ukrainian Armed Forces as was needed for the Ukrainian formations to continue the conflict and causing limited damage to Russia (but not defeat).📍With the approval received, the situation will not change: they will only hit those targets that are approved by the countries that own these missiles and complexes. 🔻If these words are not convincing, well, let’s talk in the language of numbers (we already did an approximate calculation in early November). At the beginning of October, the Armed Forces of Ukraine had on its balance sheet: ▪️from 6 to 8 ATACMS missiles (one salvo); ▪️from 20 to 30 Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles (from two to three salvos).▪️in early November, increased activity was recorded at Starokonstantinov, which may indicate additional deliveries. At the same time, throughout November, strikes were carried out on the airfield on a daily basis in order to reduce these reserves. Even if we assume that new batches of missiles were delivered to the territory of so-called Ukraine, then we can talk about a maximum of a couple of dozen missiles of each type. Their further fate, how many of these shipments were burned as a result of Russian attacks of the last month, is unknown. This is far from being a military threat that will be difficult to cope with. In the current situation, we are talking about repelling a very small number of familiar types of weapons, which our troops have learned to fight through trial and error in the Northern Military District zone. ❗️And this should be viewed primarily as a political move (as part of a general increase in stakes before the conflict moves into another phase), which will clearly be used by the Trump administration in order to further justify a possible refusal to directly support the so-called Ukraine (- The Biden administration even allowed strikes with precision weapons, but the Ukrainian Armed Forces failed-). In fact, sources from the Trump administration are already saying in the media that this decision may be reversed after Trump’s inauguration. #Russia #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇺🇸🇺🇦 About permission to use long-range missiles Since the Americans, represented by the outgoing administration, decided that there was no point in sitting quietly on Sunday evening and, apparently, gave the go-ahead for the use of ATACMS on old Russian territories , it's time...	https://t.me/rybar/65467	2024-11-17T12:58:53-08:00

Earlier, strikes were carried out deep into Russian territory. For this purpose, aircraft-type drones were used, and among the targets, incl. There were also elements of the country’s strategic security: Tu-95 missile carriers and over-the-horizon radars. However, it is inappropriate to compare a drone flying at low speed with a warhead of up to 50 kg (maximum) and high-speed missiles designed to break through air defense lines.❗️It is important that if missile strikes inland (and the border areas have already been hit more than once by Western missiles ) countries will take place, then this will also solve the problem of studying the operation of our air defense system against American missiles around strategic objects. In this case, the missiles are still nuclear-free. The Supreme Commander stated in September that such a resolution would mean the direct participation of NATO countries in the conflict.

I’ll add a few words to my colleagues’ analysis: where will the missiles fly? Yes, everything is there. Military airfields, warehouses, military bases, perhaps hospitals too. - why - all there -? But because nothing new happened. These same missiles have struck before. Crimea, Novorossiya, Lugansk, attempts to strike the Crimean bridge. - the situation differs from the previous one only in the direction of the missile strikes. - Our air defense troops are familiar with these types of weapons. Remember how at first the enemy managed to break through the air defense, and how, the further, the more often the enemy failed. - yes, American missiles, as well as British and French, pose a great danger. But they know how to shoot them down. Much will depend on the decisions of local military leaders. For example, the deployment of aircraft at military airfields will have to take into account the new capabilities of the enemy. - The enemy continually attacks all our groups with different types of weapons. Yes, simpler, but still. The enemy is using Highmars, Hummer air bombs, drones and modernized S-200s. Has this somehow stopped our troops? - enemy drone strikes on our cities have generally prepared both the military and civilian authorities, and there are proven algorithms and protocols for responding in the event of an emergency - our air defense units are constantly learning and improving their skills. Even at the Yaroslavl Air Defense School, cadets are trained taking into account the experience of the Air Defense Forces - very important! After the first blows (and there will be, no doubt), incredible euphoria will reign in Ukrainian public spaces. Kyiv politicians will talk a lot of pretentious nonsense. The entire territory of the former Ukraine will celebrate hysterically. Under no circumstances should you pay attention to this. This is not the first time they will ride on emotional swings there. It is important for us not to sit on them - this will have the most minimal impact on the result of military operations as a whole. It's impossible to break us with this crap. Scare too. We will win without any doubt. We had more serious problems. We have already gone through and overcome so much that we will deal with this too.

Forwarded From SOLOVIOV🔴🔴🔴 Full text of Vladimir Putin’s statement on possible permission for the United States and its allies to fire long-range missiles deep into Russia dated September 12, 2024: This is not about permission or prohibition for the Kyiv regime to launch strikes on Russian territory. He also inflicts with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles and other means. But when it comes to the use of Western-made high-precision long-range weapons, this is a completely different story. The fact is that I have already talked about this, and any experts will confirm this, both for us and for us. in the West, the Ukrainian army is not able to strike with modern high-precision long-range systems of Western production. She can't do this. This is only possible with the use of intelligence data from satellites, which Ukraine does not have, this is data only from satellites or the European Union, or the United States - in general, from NATO satellites. This is the first. The second and very important, perhaps the key, is that flight missions in these missile systems can, in fact, only be carried out by military personnel of NATO countries. Ukrainian military personnel cannot do this. Therefore, we are not talking about allowing the Ukrainian regime to strike Russia with these weapons or not allowing them. We are talking about making a decision about whether NATO countries are directly involved in a military conflict or not. If this decision is made, it will mean nothing more than the direct participation of NATO countries, the United States, and European countries in the war in Ukraine. This is their direct participation, and this, of course, significantly changes the very essence, the very nature of the conflict. This will mean that NATO countries, the USA, and European countries are at war with Russia. And if this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions based on the threats that will be created for us.✍ Subscribe to Solovyov!	https://t.me/rybar/65461	2024-11-17T12:21:52-08:00

This will at least force tactical level units to respond, since additional protection will be needed, especially air defense systems, and not only. We are talking about basic human ingenuity, that is, some will need to understand that formations and movements in columns will become even more dangerous.❗️And another nuance is that if Washington actually allowed the use of ballistic missiles, then other countries will follow the United States And, in addition to ATACMS, Storm Shadow and Scalp will fly in the Kursk region. And the Taurus may also appear (Scholz is also on the verge of leaving the German Olympus). Therefore, it’s time to look at the map, on which we also plotted the range of JASSM cruise missiles, which can hit even further. This is another step towards increasing the degree of conflict to the extreme point, which will not change the outcome, but will create big problems. The example of Crimea and new territories is proof of this. Difficulties arose, strikes were sometimes missed, but subsequently the number of missed missiles became less and less, and the enemy achieved no practical benefit. For now, we must wait for official confirmation from the White House, which remains silent. And all this at the moment looks like a test of the response of our leadership, especially after Vladimir Putin’s words that this will be regarded as NATO’s entry into the conflict.

Forwarded From Systemic pesticide💡🇱🇹🇪🇪🇱🇻🇷🇺 The Baltic countries once again illustrated the saying - to spite my mother I will freeze my ears -. In the center of the capital of Lithuania, a clock was installed that counts down the time remaining until the Baltic states withdraw from the energy ring with the Russian Federation and Belarus. A complete shutdown should occur on February 8, 2025.🔻On this day, the Baltic countries will disconnect from BRELL (the energy ring is named after the first letters of five countries: Belarus, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and join the unified European energy system. The Lithuanian authorities call this decision not just a political act, but an extremely important step from the point of view of national security. At the same time, the process is much more complicated and more multi-level than falling into another budget abyss, although the Balts will experience this in full. Disconnection from BRELL was officially recommended by NATO structures back in 2017. The plan for exiting it was drawn up in 2018, and Lithuania most fiercely hurried the project, while Latvia and Estonia preferred a wait-and-see approach. And this is quite logical: after all, they will be connected to the continental European power grid using the Lithuanian-Polish connection. 📌However, in this case, none of the countries will be able to win. BRELL allowed countries to keep the energy sector in relative balance: to do balancing due to the flow of cheap electricity from Russia and Belarus during consumption peaks, and in other periods to give it back, and at the end of the day, it turns out that no one took anything from anyone. In other cases, such a service must be paid for separately, and at an expensive rate, but in the BRELL energy ring it was, in fact, provided for free. But now the public of the Baltic states is being prepared not only for rising prices for electricity and even a possible shortage, but they are also persistently repeating: such a step necessary because Russia plans to disconnect everyone from the ring after the treaty expires on February 7. #energy #economy #Russia #Baltics @pezdicide no chemistry - just factsEADailyIn Lithuania, they started counting down the time of power outage from Russia at the wrong time: prices are risingIn the center of the Lithuanian capital, a clock was installed that counts down the time remaining until the Baltic states leave the country ;energy rings with&nbsp;Russia and&nbsp;Belarus.

US Air Force B-52H bombers flew over the Baltic Sea, Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania launched guided aerial bombs at the Kazlu-Ruda training ground. Judging by statements to NATO, the training was carried out according to a conflict scenario in the Suwalki corridor area. There were four reconnaissance aircraft in the air during the B-52N strikes. They assessed the actions of Russian military personnel in the Kaliningrad region. NATO reconnaissance aircraft operate on the same principle in the Black Sea, looking for air defense positions and other important objects.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated that a female operator of the Igla MANPADS shot down her first target during today’s strike by the Russian Armed Forces. Let’s not pay attention to the fact that the filmer (also a woman) simply recorded the missile taking off, but for some reason hitting the stated target decided to leave them behind the scenes, accompanying them with the words -Gotcha!-. The point is not that, but that the Ukrainian authorities deliberately focus attention on women. In the conditions of widespread mobilization, men will soon run out, but people will still be needed. And there are fewer and fewer radicalized individuals like Taira in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and it is necessary to popularize service in the army.

Around 4-6 in the morning, a group of unmanned boats was spotted in the area of ​​gas fields west of Crimea. These are those objects that, after the start of the special operation, ceased to function for security reasons, but the infrastructure in the form of towers remained there, and periodically the Ukrainian side tries to seize them and land them personnel on existing platforms.❓The last one was in September. Drilling platforms are quite large in area and can accommodate weapons such as ATGMs or MANPADS, as well as fuel and supplies. Moreover, they can be equipped with communications equipment and repeaters, which will increase their capabilities at sea. Remember the inglorious landings in Crimea? Their main disadvantage was that the distance was large, and there was no way to supply the units and monitor their movements. And it’s impossible to retreat, so the missions were always one-way. And to solve this problem, the Main Intelligence Directorate wants to control these towers. But our units immediately detected the appearance of BECs and sent an interception group after them, which began shooting them with small arms. As a result, four of the five drones were destroyed, the last one turned around and departed in the direction of Odessa. There was also a sixth one, but he took a different route and was spotted 35 km from Cape Tarkhankut, where he was conducting reconnaissance. But after a Black Sea Fleet helicopter was sent after him, the BEC turned around and also disappeared in the direction of the Odessa region.❗️The important thing is that there have not been such BEC raids for a very long time, and the resumption of their activity indicates that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have replenished their supplies. Today, a missile threat was introduced several times in Crimea, including in the eastern parts of the peninsula. We will watch, but clearly the enemy will not stop at just this attack.

The enemy traditionally stated that most of the missiles and drones were shot down.▪️The main target of the Russian troops, judging by messages on the Internet, were energy facilities and enterprises related to the production of military products. The strikes were carried out on major cities, including Kyiv, Odessa, Dnepr, Kremenchug and Krivoy Rog. The latter also has problems with the operation of boiler houses, there is a partial lack of heat and water supply in the city, and critical infrastructure is powered by generators.▪️After the attacks, emergency power outages were introduced in various regions of the country, including Kyiv and Odessa.

While the media emphasizes the Chinese leader’s readiness to work with the new US administration, the parties also touched upon other important aspects during the negotiations. In particular, the results of the past four years were summed up - not least in both Chinese and American press releases are occupied by the achievements that were achieved during this period. In addition, Xi and Biden discussed issues related to relations between the two countries. There was also the expression of opinions on regional issues, positions on which differ on both sides. The list includes the South China Sea dispute, the Korean Peninsula and, of course, Taiwan. ▪️The Ukrainian conflict was also on the agenda - the American side once again expressed concern about Beijing’s support for Moscow, and the Chinese presented their consistent position on this issue. In general, nothing new. It is noteworthy that the Chinese press release paid much attention to the principles and framework of bilateral relations. The Chinese side identified red lines, which included the Taiwan issue, human rights, China's system and path, as well as the PRC's right to development. They, according to the Chinese press release, should be indisputable. 📌In general, nothing breakthrough was expected from the meeting, because one of its participants will leave the White House early next year. The Chinese will conduct a more detailed dialogue with the new American administration, for which, most likely, the ground was already prepared at this meeting. Perhaps, with the help of the mentioned principles and red lines, the Chinese authorities outlined the contours of interaction with the cabinet of Donald Trump, directly indicating what is possible and what is not.

The parties thus continue to lay the foundation for a full-fledged trilateral alliance aimed at containing threats not only on the Korean Peninsula, but throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Consider the mention of the South China Sea problem in a joint statement issued following a recent meeting. The creation of the secretariat is another step towards institutionalizing the US-South Korea-Japan partnership. It must be considered in the context of the conclusion of a trilateral cooperation agreement this summer, which outlines the contours of the development of defense ties, but is not legally binding. The same will most likely affect the activities of the secretariat. Therefore, the activities of the new body may be complicated by changes in the political course of the three parties. While it is too early to talk about changes in the foreign policies of Japan and South Korea, the new term of Donald Trump’s presidency could make significant adjustments to the trilateral partnership. And in this situation, even attempts to formalize ties may be ineffective. #USA #South Korea #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usKyodo News+Japan, U.S., South Korea set up secretariat to enshrine cooperationThe leaders of Japan, the United States and South Korea announce the creation of a secretariat to further align their policies and actions, about two months before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returns to power with his go-it-alone approach to foreign…	https://t.me/rybar/65448	2024-11-17T02:10:03-08:00

Within a month in the United States military personnel and specialists from various structures and companies in the US, UK and Australia tested the implementation of the Centurion AI system, developed by Saab, as part of the called the Convergence project. The point is that in the AUKUS format the technology of swarm use of drones using artificial intelligence was successfully tested. The drones successfully hit the targets, and after that it was noted that data from the UAV was simultaneously sent to specialists from three countries. That is, we get the following picture: The Anti-China Alliance is introducing new technologies, relying on the experience of a special operation, where Ukrainian formations tested the swarm system in various directions at the front. We did not note any actual combat use, but we saw FPV drones flying in a wedge in both the Kherson and Donetsk directions. The combat use of AI capabilities is the expected result of the development of these technologies. But another important point is that the British confirmed the successful exchange of data between the countries of the bloc through the same system. That is, AUKUS is gradually turning from a PR block into a real counterweight to China in the region. #Australia #Great Britain #USA #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65447	2024-11-17T01:19:32-08:00

The number of bilateral agreements between countries has increased significantly over the past 15 years. One of the very first and most important agreements was the 2010 agreement on cooperation in military training, which paved the way for Somali commands to Turkey to take courses. And recently in training center in Isparta, training began on conducting counter-terrorist operations for ten special forces - Gorgor - the Somali Armed Forces - about 400 people in total. Every year the Turks conduct similar courses for Somalis, but previously their number did not exceed 100-200 people. Turkish instructors are now training twice as many Somalis. With the Turks viewing the Horn of Africa as an area of ​​strategic interest, increasing aid to Somalia seems a natural way to consolidate its presence in the region. #Africa #Somalia #Turkey@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65444	2024-11-17T00:01:27-08:00

They have -Bayraktars-, leased from the USA MQ-9A, in addition to this, they have Warmate. Recently they sent the UAV -Kruk- to the so-called Ukraine. Recently, sea trials of a submersible autonomous system called -Gavia- were carried out in the port of Gdynia. This is a drone capable of performing tasks underwater at a depth of up to 1000 meters with a duration of about 6 hours. The developer, of course, is not the Poles. In December 2023, Teledyne Tech. opened a service center for servicing unmanned drones together with the Polish company ENAMOR, where they developed -Gavia-.🔻The main task of this system is military, since they are tested in mine action operations and in monitoring the underwater situation. Moreover, the Poles have already sent a drone to the Aegean Sea, where it was involved in the Aegean Seal exercise. Since in order to correctly assess the effectiveness of this or that weapon in the West, it is customary to send it all to the so-called Ukraine, then this is also possible in this case. The Ukrainian side has already used similar BECs - Remus, supplied by the Germans. So, if they appear somewhere near Odessa, we will not be surprised. #Poland #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65443	2024-11-16T23:34:24-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for November 17, 2024▪️ The past week was full of headlines in the world press about possible -negotiations- against the backdrop of the formation of his administration and cabinet by US President-elect Trump. The voiced lists contain many critics of the Ukrainian regime and the constant allocation of money to Kyiv. It is significant that many of Trump’s planned appointments ended up on the Ukrainian website -Peacemaker- or were subjected to harsh criticism by Ukrainian government departments. However, Trump has not yet come into his own, and the Biden administration plans to pump up the Armed Forces of Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of weapons and equipment by January 20 (the lion's share of which will remain in the United States, of course).▪️ Simultaneously with many catchy articles about -negotiations- in Europe continues military preparations for a big war with Russia. A US missile defense base has been opened in the city of Redzikowo (Poland), and Rheinmetall's profits are growing. Even Scholz’s demanding and clumsy call to the Supreme Commander took place against the backdrop of regular news about new supplies of German air defense systems to Kyiv. That is, for now the words in newspaper articles are separate, but the real actions of the countries of the potential enemy are separate.▪️ At the front, the Russian Army maintains the initiative, pushing through the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in several directions. Kurakhovo is being compressed into a semi-encirclement; heavy fighting has broken out in the city itself. The hysterical undermining of the Kurakhovsky reservoir dam by the Armed Forces of Ukraine also did not help matters: the volume of water was not enough to create a water barrier to the west of the reservoir. ▪️ A new element was the entry of our units into Kupyansk. Fierce fighting ensued, but the assault groups managed to gain a foothold in the industrial zone. The zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces is expanding further to the south - at Kruglyakovka and Kolesnikovka. ▪️ Fighting continues for every house in Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk) and Chasov Yar. Pokrovsk is being prepared by the enemy for defense; our troops on the approaches to the city are pulling up their rear and expanding the zone of control around previously achieved lines.▪️ The front has also begun to move in the Vremevsky direction. They report the advance of the Russian Armed Forces towards Novodarovka and Rovnopol. It should be understood that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have retained the same attack helicopters, and at least one case of their use has been recorded. ▪️ The Armed Forces of Ukraine on the Zaporozhye front are urgently staffing the second line of defense with diverse units, awaiting our large-scale offensive.▪️ The news about -beautiful reports- from the Kursk region became unpleasant this week. It is reliably known that extremely difficult battles are taking place, the enemy is throwing reserves and expensive NATO armored vehicles into battle to release some of its units. The Ukrainian Armed Forces are drawing more and more forces into the region, which has actually become a new Bakhmut meat grinder for them. Weather conditions aggravate the situation for the enemy. ▪️ Due to the large expenditure of personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Kyiv is intensifying mobilization measures, announcing the need to send another 160 thousand people to the front. Despite the low level of moral and psychological state of the enemy troops, the draconian regime makes it possible to solve the problem of maintaining an organized defense. The formation and arming of Ukrainian Armed Forces brigades in NATO countries continues. Mass desertion and the low level of training of newly formed enemy units have not yet led to the collapse of the front. ✨Thus, the information wave about Trump-style negotiations does not affect the front. The Russian army continues its offensive on several fronts, and heavy fighting is taking place. It is most likely that the closure of the project - Ukraine - by the Western owners will last as long as it brings profit. That is, until the last Ukrainian.

On November 14, all Ukrainian information resources exploded with news about the alleged murder of a civilian woman by the Russian military in the village of Terny, DPR. As evidence, two screenshots from the video taken from the copter were attached. The crest bashfully decided not to show the video itself. And today it became clear exactly why. Guardsmen of the 144th Motorized Rifle Division, as the village is liberated, are evacuating the population from the combat zone, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine used there as a human shield for about two years. A couple of days ago, our fighter took two more people out of the village. At that moment, a Ukrainian machine gunner began working on all three from cover. As a result, our fighter and two civilians were killed. The video clearly shows the bodies of the Russian military man and the locals whom he accompanied, trying to save, and also captures the moment when another of our soldiers, who came out to the sound of shooting, also came under fire from an ambush and died .I will remind you once again that the Little Russian lies every time he opens his mouth. I hope this video will be reviewed by the relevant authorities and international organizations, which will take the necessary measures. Unfortunately, people’s lives cannot be returned, but the Kiev regime and everyone involved in the execution of its criminal orders must be punished for their atrocities.

🇦🇲🇺🇸 On the possible vector of American policy under Trump in...	🇦🇲🇺🇸 About the possible vector of American policy under Trump in Armenia Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan had a telephone conversation with US President-elect Donald Trump, in which he presented information about the current situation in relations between the countries in recent years. The issue of possible changes in the policy of the new US administration In relation to Armenia, the latter's public is extremely interested. After all, Pashinyan’s team openly relied on Kamala Harris, which once again emphasizes, to put it mildly, the short-sightedness of the Armenian authorities.▪️For example, the Armenian Ambassador to the United States Lilit Makunts participated in the election campaign of the Democratic Party. And last summer, together with a delegation of deputies from the ruling party - Civil Contract - she attended the Democratic convention in Chicago, where Harris was nominated as a presidential candidate. This is enough for the current authorities of Armenia to be considered by the new administration as an asset of the Democratic Party, which was bribed, among other things, with American taxpayers' money. ▪️From an economic point of view, Armenia is not of significant interest to Americans. So the attitude towards the country will depend solely on external factors. First of all, from Trump’s relations with Iran and Russia, against which the Americans are able to continue to use Armenia. ▪️Although Trump used the Armenian issue during the election campaign: he accused the Democrats of allowing ethnic cleansing of Christians in Nagorno-Karabakh. But the statement was clearly designed to win back the votes of the Armenian diaspora in the United States. At the same time, the largest lobbying organization of Armenians, ANCA, did not support any of the candidates, accusing both parties of promoting Azerbaijan and defeating Armenia. 🔻However, one thing is clear: the new administration in the United States will not in any way affect the return of Armenia’s subjectivity in regional politics. The pro-Turkish vector of the country's development will continue, and Azerbaijan will continue to put pressure on the Armenians, demanding new concessions. #Armenia #USA @rybarSupport usTACCPashinyan and Trump discussed issues of regional importanceEvents in Russia and the world.

The practice can only be welcomed - in recent years, the Russian Armed Forces have had enough captured samples. This is especially true for Western-made infantry delivery vehicles, which have high security in comparison with the BMP-1/2 or MT-LB. The Bradleys are a fairly durable vehicle that can be used purely as a transporter. In this case, the bottleneck is a possible shortage of components, but a lot of trophies have been collected recently, and some can be disassembled for spare parts. In any case, it is more appropriate than just distribute them at exhibitions. #Russia #Ukraine@rybar support ustelegrama-person-bearing aircraft and a slightly modified armored car-4x4, executed by the Canadian company -streit Group- on the Ford-550 chassis.

Suddenly, very unusual news came from the Seversk direction, although again related to the fake capture of populated areas. This time it was positive.▪️Several commanders in this direction were detained and removed from their positions due to deception of the higher command. We are talking about some commanders from units of the 3rd Army: someone was detained and arrested, someone was removed or transferred to a lower position. The event affected several brigade and battalion commanders. ▪️This, as we wrote, was expressed in -occupation- exclusively on the Internet through friendly bloggers and war correspondents of Serebryanka, Grigorovka, Belogorovka and Verkhnekamensky, as well as, apparently, Vyemka (as well as feverish attempts to recapture it).▪️Alas, instantaneous there was no reaction: the system is inert, and attempts to expose lies are perceived as -pressure- (principle - if they criticize, it means I’m doing everything right-). As a result, the initial reports about, to put it mildly, -problems- (although this can more be called outright outrage) ultimately did not result in anything: commanders of different levels synchronized watches and continued to fool high headquarters. It’s good that after that scandal there were no statements about the liberation of new settlements (and that’s a joy).🔻As a result, everything turned out to be much more prosaic: higher authorities came and wanted to visit the -liberated-Belogorovka, which was already, in theory, deep-deep the rear, since Grigorovka and Serebryanka were allegedly taken. And only then the scale of the deception was revealed, which went not only to the media, but also to higher headquarters. Moreover, the lies were not only not only in the reports, but also -legendized-. Correspondents were invited to the positions to interview fighters who boasted in the media about the capture of non-existent villages. 📍On the Internet, of course, there is an opinion that they allegedly managed to take some positions, then the enemy counterattacked, after which they had to be abandoned. However, in reality there was no talk of any capture - neither then nor now. And now, regardless of whether the voice of those crying in the wilderness was heard, or the deception was actually revealed by accident, the activities of at least some of those responsible have already attracted the interest of specialized services. And we very much hope that questions about both the mediocre waste of personnel in unprepared assaults and the wearing down of armored groups from month to month against the same support will be raised at the very top. #media technologies #Russia #Seversk #Ukraine #fake@rybarSupport usTelegramCallsign《OSETIN》After coverage of the situation by Comrades Majors, Rybar, Podolyaka and other channels near Belogorovka (in the Seversky direction), namely, incorrect reports from the command, incomprehensible assaults and more - the result appeared.

At first, the helicopter crew unsuccessfully tries to shoot down the drone with a cannon, but ultimately uses an air-to-air missile to destroy the target. The video shows several points at once. On the one hand, this is further evidence of the fundamental possibility of using helicopters to combat drone strikes, given the appropriate organization and technical equipment. At the same time, the recording illustrates the difficulties in defeating drones. As we wrote a year ago, not every type of aircraft is suitable for this - the Mi-24 and Mi-8 with old avionics are worse suited for this role than the Mi-28 and Ka-52. However, the number of the latter is limited, and they are required at the front. In any case, one can observe an active search for means of countering UAV attacks in rear areas, from mobile fire groups and protective metal screens at oil refineries to interceptor drones. It cannot be ruled out that specialized small aircraft will soon appear.#Russia #Tatarstan #Ukraine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65432	2024-11-16T07:19:17-08:00

The decision was made at the direction of Vladimir Putin in response to US sanctions, implying restrictions on the import of Russian uranium products in 2024-2027 and a complete ban from 2028. 🔻In accordance with the new decision, it will no longer be possible to simply export enriched uranium to the United States or do so under foreign trade agreements with persons registered in the jurisdiction of the United States. However, an exception is provided in the form of supplies under one-time licenses issued by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC). It seems that now the supply chain will change somewhat: China will be able to buy enriched uranium in Russia, then it will be sold to Europe, and from Europe it will follow in the USA. In the States, by the way, there are plans to commission 200 GW of capacity by 2050. How much they will be able to add 35 GW in the next 10 years remains to be seen. In general, peaceful nuclear power is now intended to serve first-tier countries and manufacturing countries, like China and South Korea. At the same time, those countries that have lost their economic importance are experiencing all the difficulties from curtailing their nuclear program - this is exactly what is happening in Germany or Japan. It is unlikely that in the near future we will see the creation of a uranium embargo system, but there is clearly a process of tightening control over deposits, enrichment. And, of course, the construction of nuclear power plants. #Russia #USA@rybarSupport usgovernment.ru The government introduced temporary restrictions on the export of enriched uranium to the USA Resolution No. 1544 of November 14, 2024	https://t.me/rybar/65431	2024-11-16T05:52:06-08:00

Over the past few hours, a video has gone viral on social networks with Azerbaijani citizens walking with Azerbaijani flags at the Moscow Financial and Legal University (MFLU) and who, at first glance, are shouting - Cut the Russians, Azerbaijan -.🔻But online -twisted- the situation. The video circulating on the Internet is a screen recording from the social network Instagram, which is banned in the Russian Federation. In the original, the shouts of -Yaşasın Azərbaycan!-, which means -Long live Azerbaijan-, are clearly audible. Due to the poor quality of the screen recording, the sounds were distorted, and it seemed as if the Azerbaijanis were calling to go against Russian citizens, and the general sentiments of the population towards ethnic communities in the country, in in particular - to the Azerbaijani one, they did the rest.❗️ Moreover, the personnel are not even from MFYU. Apparently, the original video was filmed at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation on Leningradsky Prospekt. On November 14 at 17.00 there was a student festival for Azerbaijani students. This was reported on their channel, which has now been deleted. In the background footage you can see MADI University, which is also located on Leningradsky Prospekt.📌 There was no specific call from these students. The distorted recording and the attitude of the population towards foreigners from the neighboring countries against the backdrop of the situation in Russia did everything by spreading the video on social networks. And the reason for all this is the failures in migration policy, which resulted in hundreds of incidents with migrants, including from Azerbaijan. Ethnic communities feel at home in Russia, regardless of laws or regulations, which leads to such events. The reaction of most Russians was quite expected. Wandering around the center of Moscow with the flags of another country and shouting slogans in your own language in Russia - all this will be regarded as disrespect for the Russian-speaking population and Russia itself, which is what ultimately happened. #Azerbaijan #multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65427	2024-11-16T05:43:38-08:00

At night, reports appeared about the alleged resignation of President Aslan Bzhania, but he said that he would do so only when the facility was liberated. Afterwards, early elections will take place, where the politician will nominate his candidacy.📌 Although some resources managed to see almost a -color revolution- in what happened, in fact the event does not stand out too much against the background of the local political background. In 2014, the opposition also seized buildings in Sukhum, as a result of which the head of the republic, Alexander Ankvab, resigned. Moreover, Aslan Bzhania himself came to power in 2020 during similar protests, which were accompanied by the storming of the presidential administration building and the resignation of Raul Khadzhimba, who previously removed Ankvab. So such political crises in Abkhazia are rather the norm. It is also worth noting that this usually happens without bloodshed and very violent clashes, although in Abkhazia almost every house you meet has a firearm. Such protests are also not explicitly anti-Russian, at least at the moment.❗️However, all this does not remove the points already noted: the republic, which lives off the Russian budget, refuses to conclude an investment agreement with Russia and wags its tail on other issues. Which leads to reputational and other costs, which over time will raise certain issues head on. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65425	2024-11-16T03:35:06-08:00

If you analyze the activity in local social networks, it is striking that it is women who are the most radical supporters of the war until the last Ukrainian. This is also facilitated by a whole created cult, and it manifests itself not only in well-known videos with necrophilic motives. Just look at the well-known Tyra from Azov or other similar popular volunteer paramedics with a characteristic appearance. Tellingly, losses among this category have increased recently, as obituaries on Instagram indicate. And in parallel on the so-called Ukraine is gradually starting to raise the topic of not only lowering the conscription age, but also the mobilization of women. And it is quite possible that when this goes beyond talk, the Kiev regime will lose its extremely significant non-obvious part of the nuclear electorate. In connection with this, the very breakdown will come, after which everything will collapse for him. #mediatechnology #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramAndrey Medvedev Mazepa's comrade-in-arms, Cossack, Pyotr Ivanovich Ivanenko, a man wrote to his wife on March 2, 1692: -Ganno!

To this end, the delegation of the autonomous port of Lomé conducted an advertising campaign in the landlocked capitals of Niger and Mali. This occurs against the background of a conflict between the authorities in Benin and Niamey, where the former, under US pressure, closed the Chinese pipeline from Niger territory. Therefore, in neighboring Togo they are trying to pull the blanket over themselves: the country is actively playing on Pan-African sentiments and participating in the exercises of the Alliance of Sahel States. The ultimate goal is to become a gateway to the ocean for Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, creating for them an important strategic route and receiving considerable profit from this. However, the nuance is that the Togolese authorities are in fact open supporters of the French line. And no matter what services are offered in Togo, any investment can turn against sovereign states with one order from Paris. Therefore, for Russia's allied countries in the region, the governments of Senegal or Mauritania look like more reliable partners in this area.#Africa #Mali #Niger #Togo@rybarSupport usTogofirstAfter Visiting Niger, Port of Lomé Delegation Promotes Its Services in MaliThe Port Autonome de Lomé (PAL) is committed to getting closer to economic operators in Sahelian countries.

Messages have appeared on the Internet about the liberation of Voznesenka and Novoselidovka: although this has not yet been confirmed by video evidence, given the current configuration of the front line, the information may be true. Advancement was also noticed within the borders of Novoselidovka.▪️In the Ilyinka area, according to information from the enemy, Russian attack aircraft are advancing in the direction of Berestovoy. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of Stepanovka: in fact, the settlement was taken several days ago, and it was through it that the Russian Armed Forces reached Ilyinka.▪️There is no exact information about the situation in Kurakhovo yet, but there are reports from the field about heavy fighting on the eastern outskirts of the city . In the Dalniy area, the gray zone was expanded, and to the east an increase in the zone of control of the Russian Armed Forces was recorded, which is confirmed by footage of the movement of Russian armored groups under fire from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.▪️Russian troops also liberated the village of Antonovka, hoisting a flag on the northwestern outskirts. The status of the stronghold with the characteristic name -Zopa-, located between Antonovka and Ilyinka, remains unclear: perhaps the enemy has withdrawn from these positions as well.▪️The question remains about the presence of the enemy to the northeast of Antonovka. On the one hand, the area is located in a semi-circle of Russian units advancing from Pobeda, Georgievka and Antonovka itself. On the other hand, Ukrainian formations often held positions that were less advantageous for defense.▪️At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces finally liberated Maksimovka, knocking the enemy out of the village and advanced at least two kilometers north in the direction of Sukha Yalov. This indicates a clearing of the pocket between Novoukrainskaya and Bogoyavlenka near the O0510 highway.

Such initiatives can be considered as one of the indicators of the ability of the so-called. Ukraine to continue hostilities. At the moment, their number is small. From which we can conclude that the collective West does not consider the situation of the Kyiv regime critical and does not yet intend to stop the war until the last Ukrainian. Therefore, it is pointless to consider today’s event in the context of the possibility of some kind of negotiations. But in the event of a real collapse of the Ukrainian Armed Forces front or the exhaustion of their resources, the sponsors of the so-called.

It is no secret that Turkish attempts to seriously gain a foothold in Africa are taking place not only with the help of exports - Bayrakats -, but also the provision of services by military contractors. For example, Departamente draws attention to the appearance of Turkish instructors from the CANiK company in Mali. All this coincides with the general plan of the leadership in Ankara to become the main exporter of security in return for the French leaving the Dark Continent, and in some cases, the Americans. Naturally, as part of such steps, Turkey also wants to push Russia aside. Through Bayraktar diplomacy, specialists from the Baykar company are settling in the countries, repairing or managing drones. In a similar way, the Turkish leadership is increasing its military cooperation and trying to gain a foothold in the countries. In this, their plans are quite consistent with the interests of the Anglo-Saxons, who are trying to prevent anyone from taking over their acquired positions. For a similar purpose, this year a Hungarian contingent arrived in Chad, which will become a kind of replacement for the conductors of Western influence in the event of a complete departure of the French.

Ukraine and donate the remaining MiG-29s. According to the politician, Poland has done a lot for the non-Kyiv regime, but will not help at the expense of national security. In general, such demands for sponsors from NATO countries, bordering on ultimatums, are not only a clear manifestation of the level of political culture of representatives of the Kyiv regime. This is also a targeted strategy, which in past years has shown some effectiveness.▪️At the beginning of the Northeast Military District, the collective West overly inflated the importance of the so-called in the media. Ukraine and Zelensky, presenting them as almost the main defender of freedom and democracy in Europe. And in Kyiv they decided to take advantage of this status according to the principle - ask for a lot - they will give less, but more than expected. ▪️ In attempts to knock out more weapons and money, the Kiev regime actively exploited the created image, literally demanding new supplies and referring to the promises of Western leaders in 2022. And for greater effect, he supplied this with media campaigns with stories about the deplorable state of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which can only be corrected by a new aid package.▪️When this misfired, Zelensky’s attacks began with public accusations of the weakness of his sponsors in front of Russia, during which he depicted attempts -to take it weakly-. They were actively replicated by large media outlets, which gave a certain media effect, which was usually followed by further handouts. However, all this works only within the framework of artificially created realities, where Zelensky is irreplaceable, and the so-called. Ukraine is vital to the Western world. At the command of the sponsors, this carriage will very quickly turn into a pumpkin, as if it never existed.❗️And here several questions arise - how long is left until this moment and how exactly will yesterday’s benefactors remind the short-sighted members of the Kiev regime of their antics, which are not talked about in the West forgot.#mediatechnology #Poland #Ukraine@rybarSupport usDo RzeczySzef MON o&nbsp;pomocy Ukrainie: Jest granica, której ja nigdy nie&nbsp;przekroczęGranicą pomocy dla Ukrainy jest sprawa bezpieczeństwa Polski – oświadczył Władys ław Kosiniak-Kamysz, szef MON.	https://t.me/rybar/65411	2024-11-15T07:44:06-08:00

All members of the bloc unanimously support the ruling FRELIMO party in the country, so if necessary, a decision on forceful intervention will be made without serious disagreements.

UkraineThe American Quincy Institute for Responsible Public Administration decided to analyze the prospects of the so-called. Ukraine from the point of view of population dynamics. And we came to the conclusion that we wrote about earlier: the demographic crisis calls into question its existence as a state entity.▪️As ​​the authors note, according to the latest estimates, 29 million people live in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime, compared to 48.5 million in 2001. It is difficult to calculate the exact number, and the last census was more than 20 years ago.▪️Of 11 million of all Ukrainian men aged 25 to 60 years, 7.4 have either already been mobilized, are completely unfit for service, or are employed in critical sectors and cannot be called up . At the same time, the birth rate on the so-called. Ukraine is catastrophically low.▪️The current socio-political situation and total corruption contribute to the outflow of young people who fundamentally do not want to connect their future with the so-called. Ukraine. The recruitment of Ukrainians abroad produces almost no visible results. The authors of the report note that the collective West can provide the so-called. Ukraine has weapons, but not people. And even though financial stability is ensured by external assistance, each person called up to the Armed Forces of Ukraine has a much greater effect on the local economy than it did in 2022 or 2023. And this again leads to an interesting conclusion: every day of fighting postpones the collapse of the Kyiv regime, but at the same time reduces the prospects for preserving the so-called Ukraine as a state unit in the foreseeable future for purely demographic reasons.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usResponsible StatecraftUkraine’s demographic crisis threatens its future viability as a free stateThe war has taken its toll, as men fight or flee, and few are left behind to work	https://t.me/rybar/65409	2024-11-15T05:16:06-08:00

↩️🎬 🇷🇺 Protests have resumed in Abkhazia against an agreement ...	Rybar: Video 🇷🇺 Protests have resumed in Abkhazia against an agreement allowing Russian companies to invest in projects on the territory of the republic. The local parliament has postponed its ratification, but demonstrators are demanding that the authorities vote against the document today. The stated reason for the opposition's protests is fears that if the agreement comes into force, Russian businessmen will buy up the land and prices will rise significantly. Also, those who disagree argue that after this there will be an influx of foreigners and strangers who will take all the resources of Abkhazia. The only problem is that by refusing the investment agreement with Russia, the republic will cut off the only real opportunity to improve its financial situation. And also at least somewhere to improve the condition of the infrastructure, which, due to the peculiar local management, is in the same form as it was 30 years ago. In the current situation, Abkhazia is largely faced with the question of economic survival, which is more pressing than the fears of the development of hotels in decaying cities. Resistance to the agreement in these conditions looks at least irrational, especially against the backdrop of the fact that the republic already lives entirely at the expense of the Russian budget.❗️This is also another consequence of mistakes in politics in the post-Soviet space, when they often preferred to use carrots where they needed to be used whip. The agreement could have easily been pushed through back in the 00s on the wave of recognition of Abkhazia’s independence, but then they preferred to sweep the problem under the rug. But in the end, they still had to return to the same issue. Only from a less advantageous position, bilateral economic benefits and possible reputational costs lost over 20 years. #Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65403	2024-11-15T03:15:06-08:00

It was attended by the heads of all Central Asian states with the exception of Turkmenistan. Against the backdrop of proposals for urgent food and medical assistance, it is very characteristic that the most radical statements about the creation of a Palestinian state as the only solution to the conflict were made by the President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon.🔻But not this important in the context of the summit itself. During the event, the President of Tajikistan proposed creating a joint fund to finance large investment projects with Saudi Arabia. In addition, he touched upon the issues of creating logistics centers and launching air services with the Kingdom. And in this case, the Tajik leader skillfully decided to take advantage of the moment and try to monetize his participation in the summit on the situation in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.

🇩🇪🇷🇺 Yesterday, the Russian-language segment of the Internet ...	🇩🇪🇷🇺 Yesterday, the Russian-language segment of the Internet circulated the news that German auto brands could officially return to Russia in 2025. According to the head of one of the German consulting firms, this needs to be done as quickly as possible in order to avoid a complete loss of the Russian market. As in the case of a similar Japanese initiative, the reasons here are obvious: German concerns are suffering large losses, and the situation is further complicated by the crisis of the local industry. Therefore, they are trying to find any sources of income that could improve the situation at least a little. Sanctions against the Russian car market as a whole turned out to be a failure: European manufacturers lost profits and factories, but there were no fewer cars in the country, since Chinese manufacturers occupied the niche.

After the liberation of Ugledar and the breakthrough to Zolotaya Niva, and then Shakhterskoye, Russian troops moved on to the systematic liquidation of the now Vremevsky wedging, advancing in the direction of Bolshaya Novoselka from several directions at once. ▪️From the eastern flank, Russian troops are gradually advancing along a broad front at the Zolotaya Niva - Shakhterskoye line. The offensive is taking place along the O0510 highway leading to Bolshaya Novoselka and the Kashlagach River. To the south, near Novodonetsky, the presence of separate detachments of the Ukrainian Armed Forces still remains.▪️At the same time, fighting intensified in Makarovka, where Russian troops hoisted a flag on one of the buildings in the village, almost completely destroyed by the fighting. Currently, about a third of the populated area is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces; the enemy is trying to counterattack in order to prevent Russian troops from gaining a foothold.▪️The greatest successes were achieved at the Levadnoye-Priyutnoye line. First, Russian troops crossed the Grushevataya gully southwest of Novodarovka. During the fighting, they managed to gain a foothold in the forest belts on the approaches to the latter; less than a kilometer remains to go to the settlement.▪️ At the same time, the attack aircraft attacked in the direction of Rovnopol, a small village with one street. Currently, fighting continues within the borders of the village. The enemy is moving assault groups to the village, trying to stop the breakthrough of the defense in the area. In the wake of the successes of the Russian army, the Ukrainian authorities announced the evacuation of several front-line settlements. At the same time, for the first time in the direction, an attempt was recorded to strike an FPV drone on a Mi-24 helicopter of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

It's no secret that information coverage of a special military operation does not always go smoothly. With colleagues we discussed ways to establish dialogue along the line -region - -people - in the context of responding to negative news feeds from the Northern Military District, and argued about what methods of building ideological narratives and military-patriotic education will have an effect here and now. 📌One of the most pressing problems is the post-war integration of Northern Military District veterans as a new elite into society. As part of the seminar, it was possible to formulate several directions for the correct positioning of heroes and the formation of the necessary messages for society. The most important thing is for people to understand that the state appreciates their contribution to the victory (and the financial side here is the very last thing you need to think about). Special thanks to colleagues from Hispaniola @spainrus, Alexey Zhivov @zhivoff, Alexander Asafov @aasafov and Daniil Bezsonov @NeoficialniyBeZsonoV for a lively discussion and his vision of ways to solve problems: we were also able to look at some of them from a new angle. #WSRF #media technologies #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65388	2024-11-14T10:10:29-08:00

The complex is part of includes three Mk.41 launchers with SM-3 Block IB and SM-3 Block IIA interceptor missiles and an AN/SPY-1D(V) radar. The range of the SM-3 Block IIA exceeds 1200 km, the radar for identifying air targets (cruise missiles, drones) as part of the missile defense system is about 500 km. In addition, this missile defense system provides for the use of new SM-6 anti-aircraft missiles, which can not be used only to protect airspace, but also against surface targets, such as ships. The Americans successfully conducted tests in 2022. The most important point is that Redzikovo is located a little more than 100 km from Kaliningrad. Taking into account the range of both anti-aircraft missiles and the anti-ship version of the SM-6, in the future the base was created to control the Baltic Sea and our fleet in the water area. This is another coin in the wallet for increasing the degree of tension in the Baltics, which Western countries have been purposefully and methodically doing in recent months . This especially began to manifest itself with the entry of Finland and Sweden into the Alliance. And with the commissioning of the new base, NATO has another reason to intensify exercises in the region as part of testing the complex.

Several hits occurred in the vicinity of the youth development center in the suburbs of Kudisiya. A three-story residential building in the western district of the Syrian capital Al-Mezze also came under fire. Israelis use it from time to time, which is primarily due to the nearby military airfield of the same name. According to the Syrian Ministry of Defense, 15 people were killed and at least 16 more were injured of varying degrees of severity. At the same time, the Israeli media claimed that the target of the raid was a certain headquarters of the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 🔻Previously, the Israeli Air Force also attacked the province of Homs: there were hits in the outskirts of the city of El-Quseir. And although the details of the raid did not appear in the media, it is highly likely that the targets were Hezbollah facilities, which are used, among other things, for the transfer of weapons. It is noteworthy that the day before the Israelis also attacked several bridges across the Orontes River to worsen the supply of the Lebanese group. Judging by the footage of objective control that appeared on the Internet, Israeli aviation managed to destroy at least some of them.

He excited the Armenian information field with the statement that Yerevan, in addition to -peace- with Azerbaijan, needs to formalize a strategic agreement that will be based on the concept of -real Armenia. But here’s the problem: the main problem for the so-called. The -real- Armenia lies in the fact that in Azerbaijan they do not soften the bellicose rhetoric and call the neighboring republic -Western Azerbaijan-, declaring the need for the return of Azerbaijanis to their -historical lands-. ▪️Pashinyan also came to the conclusion that the content of the Declaration of Independence is that the Republic of Armenia cannot exist, since the Armenians are looking for a homeland outside the real country. Thus, the prime minister continues to disavow the document, which hinders Azerbaijan. Let us recall that the Constitutional Court of Armenia has already ruled references to it unconstitutional. ▪️-The strategic deal between Yerevan and Baku from Pashinyan’s fantasies is very similar to consolidating the pro-Turkish vector of development of Armenia, although the parties cannot even come close to signing a peace treaty yet.▪️Pashinyan also added that he conveyed to Ilham Aliyev proposals for unblocking transport communications in the region, but, as usual, did not provide any details to the public. It can be assumed that the key issue is the withdrawal of Russian border guards and the transfer of control over transit flows in the region to Turkey. In the future, of course, we are talking about the implementation of the Middle Corridor to Central Asia. 🔻Once again, Pashinyan’s statements about the so-called. -real Armenia- show that everything goes towards satisfying other people’s geopolitical ambitions, in which the Armenians are destined for the most unenviable position of losers in the Turkic environment. And the prime minister’s new information about strategic relations with Azerbaijan is preparing Armenian society for this role. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia #Turkey @rybarSupport usSputnik ArmeniaYerevan wants to conclude a strategic deal with Baku.

The gun is installed in an open turret on a T-54 or T-62 chassis. The rate of fire does not exceed 1-2 shots per five minutes, but a powerful caliber and a range of 40-60 km compensate for the low rate of fire. Now in Ukrainian channels this photo is called proof of the arrival of North Korean soldiers in the North Korean military zone, since this type of weapon can only be used by military personnel from DPRK.❗️However, this is not direct evidence of the presence of military personnel of the DPRK Armed Forces. A comprehensive strategic partnership has been concluded between Russia and the DPRK, and our colleagues from the DPRK could easily train our units in their use. For example, the Russian Armed Forces have been using North Korean anti-tank systems for a long time. Therefore, this fact can be interpreted in two ways. There is no objective evidence yet. At the same time, the involvement of North Korean specialists would be a logical step. That people, that weapons are needed at the front, and the involvement of foreigners will solve this problem. If the other side can, then why can't we? But for now, it’s worth dwelling on the appearance of North Korean military equipment - this is really good news. After all, in addition to the Koksanov, the DPRK has other weapons, for example, the 300-mm KN09 MLRS with a range of 220 km. Or even better - the 600-mm KN-25 super-large-caliber MLRS, capable of striking at 380 km. This will allow us to expand our combat capabilities in the face of an offensive, and North Korea will have an ideal opportunity to test its equipment in real combat.#DPRK #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65382	2024-11-14T07:48:36-08:00

In October, Malaysian military personnel hosted units of the Armed Forces of Australia, South Korea and Great Britain on their territory, and in early November, the Malaysians made a return visit to the country of Kangaroo to participate in the event -Dask Jering-. It is already coming to an end the other day, but what's interesting is that it didn't get much media coverage. Perhaps this is due to the nature of the exercise, in which special forces units of the two countries took part. The Australians included military personnel from the Commando reconnaissance and sabotage regiment, and the Malaysians included a special detachment of Marines from the Malaysian Navy. In total, there were about 500 people who trained in covert operations behind the lines at the Holsworthy base in Sydney.🔻As we see, the Malaysians are increasingly appearing in joint maneuvers on the part of the so-called QUAD bloc. Either they accept the British, or they learn to work with Australian specialists. It will be interesting to see what Chinese reaction will be to all this action from Malaysia.

The goal is to resolve common security problems, primarily the situation around the Kurdish military-political organization PKK. The motives of the Iraqi authorities can be explained by their reluctance to expose the country and population to another bloody conflict. Turkey is still planning an operation against the Kurds (especially after the terrorist attack at the TAI plant), but Iraq does not need this, both from the point of view of security and its reputation. Currently, several groups are operating on Iraqi territory, whose interests are different from the authorities in Baghdad. An international coalition that does not take into account the opinion of the official leadership, pro-Iranian groups fighting the United States, the Turks who occupied northern Iraq under the pretext of fighting the Kurds. And also the Kurds themselves, who are waging their own war. Organizing a political dialogue is an opportunity to at least try to reach some kind of compromise with all factions, each of which pursues its own interests in the country.#Iraq #Syria #Turkey@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiIraq wants to hold a regional security conferenceIraq would like to hold a regional conference in the coming months security conference to resolve common problems in this area with Turkey, Iran and Syria,...

🇺🇸🇵🇭 About the possible purchase of Typhon by the Philippine ...	🇺🇸🇵🇭 About the possible purchase of Typhon by the Philippine military The story of the Typhon medium-range missile launch system deployed by the Americans in the Philippines continues. The other day, the minister of defense of the island state gave an interview in which he expressed his desire to purchase this type of weapon. The Philippines needs Typhon for, firstly, the projection of power in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, which China claims, and secondly, for the defense of its territory in the event of a hypothetical attack from the same Chinese. At first glance, there are no difficulties in purchasing this missile system. However, there are a number of potential obstacles that Philippine authorities may face. ▪️First, there is still a Missile Technology Control Regime in the world, of which the United States is a member. According to this agreement, the parties voluntarily refuse to sell missiles with a range of 300 km to other countries, which are precisely what is needed for the Typhon system. Of course, if desired, any agreements can be circumvented and alternatives can be found. However, in this case, the Philippine authorities will need to conduct long negotiations with the Americans, during which they will most likely be required to make significant concessions. ▪️Secondly, to purchase Typhon, as well as maintain its maintenance, you will need to allocate a considerable amount of funds. The Philippines, on the other hand, is a relatively poor country that purchases the same boats for its coast guard with the help of Western partners. The country's military budget mainly consists of expenses for the personnel of the armed forces and maintenance of existing military equipment. Therefore, in the Philippines, in the event of a potential purchase of Typhon, they will have to allocate even more money to defense, which could initially go to other important needs. 🔻The position of the Americans on this issue is also unclear. On the one hand, given Donald Trump's past presidency, he may again begin to shift more responsibility for the defense of allies onto themselves. The purchase of a missile system corresponds to a similar course. On the other hand, the acquisition of Typhon by the Philippine Army would mean the loss of important American leverage.

Previously, the Israeli authorities declared all buildings in this locality illegal and subject to demolition. And while local residents were ready to dismantle their houses, no one was going to destroy the only mosque in the village. And this morning, soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces entered Umm al-Hiran with the sole purpose of finishing what they started and destroying this religious building. Several residents tried to prevent this, as a result of which they were detained. 🔻The destruction of Bedouin villages in the Negev is far from a new practice, the justification for which is often the lack of a building permit for residents, although in reality it is much more reminiscent of simply the forced relocation of the local Arab population. At the same time, no matter how the Palestinians and local Bedouins try to resist, in reality, not everyone manages to defend their settlements, including against the backdrop of a lack of unity and only unfounded support from the international community. #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65375	2024-11-14T04:03:02-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪The owners of the German concern Rheinmetall count profits from the war in UkraineAccording to company data for 9 months. In 2024, sales of weapons and ammunition reached a record level of 1.554 billion euros, and weapons and ammunition systems exceeded sales in 2023 by 608 million euros (64%). The growth was facilitated by an increase in supplies of artillery shells to Ukraine and Germany, primarily due to the inclusion in the production process of the Spanish plant Expal Munitions, purchased in 2023, which produced shells worth 352 million euros. According to our data, the price of one 155-mm projectile from Rheinmetall is 2.7 thousand euros for the Bundeswehr and about 4 thousand for Ukraine, which, taking into account the profit received, shows the enterprise's capacity in the region of 125.7 thousand projectiles in 9 months or 14 thousand per month. The volume of orders from Rheinmetall reached approximately 20 billion euros, which is 73% higher than in 2023 (11.3 billion euros). Economic growth was ensured, among other things, by orders from the Bundeswehr for the Skyranger 30 and NNBS air defense systems, the Puma infantry fighting vehicle and the Boxer armored fighting vehicle.✨For the second year now, the profits of Western military-industrial corporations have been growing, for which there is no point in slowing down the increasing production.

🇺🇦 About the decrease in donations from the Ukrainian populatio...	🇺🇦 About the decrease in donations from the Ukrainian population of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Bloomberg published an interesting article with the headline - While the war continues, Ukrainians began to donate less for the needs of their military personnel. According to the publication, there is a sharp decline in income from donations. As an example, the two largest volunteer organizations - the Pritula Foundation and -Come Back Alive-, which faced a drop in donations of 20% and 15% compared to 2022, are given. Other funds lost even more - from 40% to 90% of income. According to the publication, this reflects a decrease in the willingness of Ukrainians to contribute to defense at a difficult moment on the front line. Ukrainian volunteers explain this by the deterioration of the financial condition of Ukrainians, as well as by the growth of economic difficulties.🔻To begin with, it is worth saying that the financial situation of the ordinary Ukrainian citizen has really worsened. And every day it becomes even more deplorable due to the degradation of the economy and the shortage of personnel caused by general mobilization. In addition, the first and second foundations (and small organizations too) in the last year and a half have been better known to the Ukrainian public as scammers , who collect money for -wunderwaffe-, and at best they bring to them outdated junk, bought at the price of an MQ-9A Reaper UAV. One story with the Pritula satellite is worth something. In addition to this, total mobilization, unpopular measures, to which is added corruption in all structures. The population's fatigue from the war is becoming increasingly noticeable, so the drop in donation income is a consequence of the accumulated problems in the country, which no one is doing or intends to do anything about.#Ukraine@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comAs War Grinds On, Ukrainians Donate Less to Their MilitaryPrivate donations to Ukraine's military effort have plummeted, an indication that Ukrainians' readiness to contribute to defense is waning as the war-torn nation looks warily to the future after Donald Trump's reelection.	https://t.me/rybar/65373	2024-11-14T02:59:01-08:00

In addition to Venezuela, whose problems the senator voiced almost every week (this was his job), or the so-called Ukraine, they were worried in Baku.➖According to the Azerbaijani media, Rubio is known for his anti-Azerbaijani activities in the Senate. He and then-Senator Bob Menendez introduced an initiative on September 27, 2022, calling for the release of Armenian prisoners of war and sanctions for war crimes.➖In November 2023, Rubio supported the Senate-passed Armenia Defense Act, which would block U.S. military aid Azerbaijan. He also stated that American taxpayers' money should not be sent to Azerbaijan - a country that has brought instability to the region. I remember that for several weeks in Azerbaijan they relished the news of the detention of Bob Menendez and his subsequent resignation from office. True, he was then replaced by Ben Cardin, who continued the policy of his predecessor, calling for blocking military aid to Baku. But the Azerbaijanis forget about the role with which the Americans present themselves in the Transcaucasus. They do everything visually to show their peacekeeping efforts.

It became known that from November 8 to November 12, North Korea used GPS signal jammers over part of the Yellow Sea. South Korea claims that the purpose of such actions is an attempt to disrupt the operation of ships and aircraft located in the waters. However, no incidents related to air or sea transport occurred during this time. ▪️According to one of the South Korean ministries, the interference is associated with the transmission of signals with higher intensity than normal GPS frequencies. Such actions could affect how land, sea and air transport systems receive information. By the way, this is not the first time this has happened this year. GPS signal jammers were used in March and also in late May and early June. Therefore, in the general context of the situation, nothing extraordinary happened. 🔻Pyongyang has not yet received information explaining such actions. However, it can be assumed that they are related to the regular exercises. North Korea most likely conducted training to counter drones that could cross the border from the South. Let us recall that, according to the position of the North Korean authorities, the drone with leaflets that flew over Pyongyang in October of this year belonged to the South Korean military. It is believed that it was launched from a South Korean island located in the Yellow Sea. Perhaps, in this way, Pyongyang continues to respond to the events of October, and is also preparing for new drone launches from South Korea, which are so disturbing to the North Korean authorities. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News AgencyN.

Evidence of several migrants who returned to their homeland is presented. However, what is noteworthy is what is said in this article: On the one hand, migrants do not hide the fact that they received a passport primarily for the sake of benefits and maternity capital. Many -left everything in Russia- and preferred a voluntary and quick renunciation of citizenship, so as not to be taken to war. ➖The other emphasizes that deprivation of citizenship is accompanied by gross violations. The opinion of activists is given that deprivation of citizenship of persons who are not registered with the military is a mechanism for forcing them to participate in war. The resulting situation is that the narratives contained in the article contradict each other. How can it be that deprivation of citizenship is a mechanism of coercion for war, but at the same time migrants themselves refused to fulfill the duties of a citizen of Russia. But being surprised by the actions of Radio Azattyk is like being surprised by the snow in winter. Frantic propaganda is directed against everything that happens in Russia and even without providing evidence - this is the standard way of working of this kind of media, and the migrant issue is now one of the key narratives for promoting anti-Russian sentiments in Central Asia.#multinationalism #Russia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65370	2024-11-14T00:07:21-08:00

Forwarded From Two Majors#Summary for the morning of November 14, 2024▪️ Yesterday morning, the Russian Armed Forces launched a combined missile and drone strike on Kyiv for the first time in the last 73 days. To defeat specified targets, air-launched missiles from strategic bombers were also used.▪️ Heavy battles for Plekhovo and the settlement continue in the Kursk region. New Sorochina, the enemy fires with cannon artillery and uses many drones. The concentration of enemy efforts is evidenced by the destruction by the Marines of our 155th brigade of the heavy English tank Challenger 2, a rather rare and difficult to operate tank. The very fact of its transfer of the Armed Forces of Ukraine as a reserve to the Kursk region speaks of the enemy’s intention to hold occupied lines in our region at all costs. The group of troops - North - advanced into the village with heavy fighting. Novoivanovka and forests in the Malaya Loknya area. The enemy throws fresh reserves and NATO armored vehicles into battle and puts up fierce resistance. OTRK and -Tornado-S- crews continue to work at the collection points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reserves in the Sumy region.▪️ From the Kupyansky direction at night, enemy resources reported the entry of our troops into Kupyansk, which marks the beginning of the battles for the city. According to enemy estimates, two columns of Russian equipment moved from the Liman First area to Kupyansk. They managed to enter the city and land troops, who dispersed to houses in the area of ​​​​Svatovskaya Street. The enemy describes the situation as -the main entrance to Kupyansk-.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction west of Petrovka, the Russian Armed Forces advanced along the railway, a depth of about 1 km. ▪️ The Russian Army continues the assault on Kurakhovo and the establishment of a wide pincer movement around this city, important for the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. So, in the north there are battles in the Ilyinka area, from the south our troops are advancing on Dalneye.

❗️🇷🇺🪖 Damage to property and -revaluation- of injuries: about ...	❗️🇷🇺🪖 Damage to property and -revaluation- of injuries: about the next high-profile amendmentsYesterday's amendments adopted by the State Duma once again became the cause of widespread popular discussion and indignation: guided by the principle -we want the best-, gentlemen deputies received a reaction -as always-. Although it would be possible to work through the expert community, ask for opinions (publicly), launch comments in the media and TG, and give the necessary explanations at the moment - and the level of popular anger would be much lower. However, this is too complicated.🔻What did they want?▪️The need for compensation and recovery of funds from damaged property did not appear out of nowhere: in the Charter there is no concept of -loved-, and such cases, alas, are not uncommon. Thus, most likely, they wanted to protect, first of all, financially responsible persons (to some extent) and begin to fight write-offs and negligent attitude towards government property. Plus, this matter applies primarily to volunteers: they may not always be financially responsible persons, they often use property listed on the balance sheet of personnel departments, and even from them the demand was not the same as from military personnel. But for military personnel, everything is not So: they were brought in under articles of embezzlement, damage to property, and causing harm - there are plenty of relevant articles on the Internet, so finding them is not a problem. Now both contract soldiers and volunteers are equal (almost).▪️A single payment of 3 million rubles for injuries led to a huge number of inappropriate payments and room for fraud. There were often cases when the five-hundredth caused cosmetic harm to their health and received their three million, joyfully rubbing their paws. According to ZMO Anna Tsivileva, the same payments created a feeling of distortion among those who suffered severe physical and emotional injuries, since for minor injuries also relied on the same amount. But on the other hand, at the same time this created broad confidence among the military personnel that their health would be guaranteed to be taken care of and everything would be compensated in the moment: and now this moment, alas, is no longer so unshakable.🔻What happened?▪️Combat magazines no one has canceled the actions: a competent (or cunning) commander will calmly handle the loss or damage of property as a result of shelling or a clash (in fact, this is how it is usually done). The fines imposed on volunteers in the form of salary and bonus for length of service amount to 30-50 thousand rubles in total. Large amounts cannot be fined. Will this help solve the systemic problem? Hardly. Will it help make up for the deficit slightly? Also doubtful. But as an instrument of administrative pressure, it will probably partially work.▪️Differentiation of wounds can (and will certainly lead) to room for a double interpretation of certain cases of harm to health (alas, there are enough problems in the field of military medicine). It is enough to remember how much people now do not like to consider shell shock and psychological trauma as a serious obstacle to continuing to complete tasks. This step will save money, but there remain risks for -free interpretation- of the amount of harm to health - and scope for excessive -savings- (because -such instructions-), as well as scope for corruption conspiracies. There will clearly be more work for the DVKR units.📌Money began to be counted - sooner or later this would have happened. The appearance of relevant bills is a ridiculous attempt to reduce the waste of money and start saving. Another question is that in their current form the bills are half-hearted and, to put it mildly, do not work. However, when did we have and what really important bill immediately began to work as it should? #WSRF #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65367	2024-11-13T21:20:12-08:00

Likely. the event itself occurred simultaneously the other day simultaneously with the advance to the south from Orlyanka.

And if the loss of the road, in principle, will not become a big problem, since there are duplicate routes and detours, then blocking the railway for some time can already create problems.▪️military logistics have been disrupted for some time: the route along the only railway line through The Kherson region is cut off (we could, of course, be wrong and there may be workarounds, but so far [judging by data from open sources] everything looks exactly like this);▪️get by the railway is only possible through the Crimean Bridge and the Kerch crossing with a ferry, which now do not lose their importance. On the footage that appeared on the Internet, at first glance, there are no traces of external influence, and the overpass collapsed, apparently, under a truck that violated the weight regime (and we will frankly: due to wear and tear of the infrastructure). Therefore, in the current conditions, it is certainly impossible to speak unequivocally about sabotage.

On March 30, the parliament in Mogadishu approved amendments to the constitution. According to them, the country is making a transition from a parliamentary form of government to a presidential one, a five-year term of office is being introduced for government bodies, and direct elections were also introduced at the national and regional levels.▪️The last point was ignored by the Jubaland authorities who, in an effort to consolidate their leadership, did not dare to undertake electoral reform. Bypassing the federal government, the upcoming elections for the head of Jubaland will be held on the basis of indirect voting. The demarche was soon followed by a severance of ties with the Somalis. Until a compromise is found, the state will be governed by local structures.▪️In Mogadishu, this act was called -regressive,- which was followed by an appeal to the contingent of the African Union mission to occupy the airport of Kismayo, the capital of the autonomy. This order was followed after the Prime Minister of Somalia plans to visit Jubaland in order to personally draw a federal line. Only the allies said that they cannot occupy the airport, because it is under the jurisdiction of local authorities. Now the Ethiopian authorities are supplying the autonomous regions and trying to gain as much influence over them as possible, including occupying some key positions in cities. They are also unhappy that Egypt will be the main guarantor of security in the new Somali mission. In this situation, it is obvious that the Ethiopians will continue to rock the situation, putting pressure on Mogadishu through their puppets in the form of the autonomous regions of Jubaland and Puntland.#Africa #Somalia @rybarSupport usHiiraanJubbaland suspends cooperation with federal government, citing constitutional violations Kismayo (HOL) – Jubbaland Regional State administration suspended cooperation with the federal government, citing federal non-compliance with Somalia's constitution and disrespecting Jubbaland's autonomy.	https://t.me/rybar/65352	2024-11-13T09:27:01-08:00
🎬 🇮🇱🇺🇸🇵🇸 On the appointment of a new US Ambassador to Isra...	🇮🇱🇺🇸🇵🇸 On the appointment of a new US Ambassador to Israel Yesterday, US President-elect Donald Trump announced the appointment of Republican Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, known for his openly pro-Israel views, to the post of American Ambassador to the State of Israel. ▪️Against the background of this, Huckabee’s old interview with the Israeli media and the country’s army radio surfaced on the Internet, where he stated that there is no West Bank. According to him, in reality there is a region - Judea and Samaria - which - was given to Israel by God -. ▪️ Another thesis of the former Arkansas governor caused a certain resonance: he allowed Israel to annex the territory of the West Bank and expand Jewish settlements there, which he, contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 2334, he does not consider them illegal.▪️As ​​expected, with the election of Trump, quite favorable conditions are being formed for the ultra-Orthodox authorities of Israel. Radical politicians like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have long been talking about the need to return Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank. Now they will be able to realize this opportunity. It is worth noting the current US Ambassador to Israel, Democrat Jacob Joseph Lew: he did not distinguish himself with such harsh statements and spoke only about the need to conclude a deal between the Israeli side and the Palestinian groups for the exchange of hostages.❗However, the fact of the appointment of a loyal Israeli ultra-Orthodox ambassador does not mean at all that the policy of the elected US president will be as pro-Israel.🔻Most likely, if Israel implements the plan of annexation of the occupied territories of the Palestinian National Authority, there will be significant resistance (if any) from local authorities in the form of the ruling Fatah party and its intelligence services will not be able to provide. At the same time, from a military point of view, the West Bank is much inferior to the Gaza Strip, where Hamas and its allies held control and which Israeli troops were able to raze to the ground. Even taking into account the existence of contacts between the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries, they will limit themselves, at best, to condemning the actions of the Israelis.▪️The chairman of the autonomy, Mahmoud Abbas, has long been considered a kind of Gauleiter of Israel: instead of repelling the constantly invading Israeli forces, the PNA security services do not hinder them in any way and even facilitate them by fighting with cells of Hamas and other groups.▪️The same applies to the armed factions -Palestinian resistance-. Yes, there will be pockets of discontent and escalation of the conflict, but it is unlikely that this will develop into an acute phase of confrontation, much less stop the Israeli government. Taking all this into account, Israel will be able to relatively quickly digest the West Bank, reducing it to a state pressed against the Dead Sea or the Jordan River a small Palestinian enclave.📌 Well, the ultra-Orthodox Israeli government will be able to begin implementing such a plan whenever there is a need for a new armed conflict, the presence of which would help the ruling coalition led by Benjamin Netanyahu justify its presence in power.#Israel #USA #Palestine@ rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65351	2024-11-13T08:35:10-08:00

The operation of the Chadian armed forces -Haskanit-, carried out since the beginning of November, despite the unfounded accusations of the West of killing civilians, is yielding results.▪️Chad's General Staff announced the liquidation of 96 Boko Haram militants and the death 17 military personnel during the cleanup. The marshy terrain with a huge number of small islands, of course, complicates the process, which is why the fighting will continue for a long time. It is noteworthy that following the announcement of the start of the operation, the question was raised about Chad’s withdrawal from the Joint Special Forces (MNJTF), which, in addition to it includes Nigeria, Benin and Cameroon.▪️The government argues for this by the general ineffectiveness of the organization, which is why it has failed to ensure security in the Lake Chad region. And now the Chadian authorities are dealing with this issue themselves. One can understand this position - it is worth remembering only the recent news from Nigeria, where almost every month some new group raises its head. At the same time, the armed forces, which were reformed by American advisers, cannot cope with this. For Debi the Younger, this is a successful political move and in many ways reminds the Chadian public of his father. At one time, Idriss Deby also led successful military campaigns against various militants, finding support in society.

Now our military personnel have a common system for monitoring the air situation with the Armenians and a joint air defense control center there. The 102nd base in Gyumri is subordinate to a joint group of troops commanded by an Armenian general and who never gave the command to open fire on our air defense. We are also talking about the Second Karabakh War and the events after. According to previously concluded agreements, Russian troops cannot shoot first. And the Armenians themselves practically did not shoot back after that war.❗️And it would be appropriate to say that the Armenian authorities really cooperated with the Ukrainian ones. It seems that the matter never came to the transfer of missile weapons, but they supplied the Ukrainian Armed Forces with other things. It is known about the transfer of spare parts, engines, wheels, transmission elements, control units, instruments, zips for servicing Soviet and Russian equipment from warehouses, as well as equipment and medical equipment. All this was done as secretly as possible in order to prevent leaks, such as there were during conversations about the transfer of Tochka-U complexes. But the fact remains a fact. The current administration is certainly not an ally of Russia, but rather the opposite. #Armenia #RussiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelRybar🇦🇲🇮🇳 The ongoing Indian series in Armenia is being followed by all analysts and observers interested in the Transcaucasus.

The region because of which the French began their investigation, since it directly affects the interests of the Fifth Republic. 15 countries on the continent already have drones or agreements for their supply. And there are so many states that have considered or are considering purchasing Turkish drones that it is easier to count those countries that have not done so. If you look at the presented map, everything becomes obvious without words. Turkish drones, due to their low cost relative to Western UAVs, as well as a wide range of options both in the choice of drones themselves and on-board weapons, have become an ideal option for African countries. To perform basic tasks patrolling or fighting terrorists, that is, to counter an enemy without air defense systems, UAVs of Turkish companies are formidable weapons. Why during the air defense Have the Bayraktars become useless? Our troops adjusted their tactics and sent short-range air defense systems to cover the units, which made it possible to destroy more than a dozen of these UAVs.🔻Now in the Northern Military District of the Ukrainian Armed Forces they are used only for reconnaissance and guidance thanks to the installed Canadian cameras, which provide high detail even from long distances. But in Africa, the same Bayraktars are a powerful argument in the fight against terrorism. The Turks, taking advantage of the moment, advertised their UAVs and occupied this niche in many regions, since the countries of Africa or Asia could not afford to buy multimillion-dollar MQ-1s, not not to mention larger models like the MQ-9. Therefore, the fears of the French are quite justified, as their expansion continues.

Moreover, unlike Europe, cooperation here proceeds mainly through localization of production, which expands the geography of Turkish presence. In the Middle East, Turkish drones were purchased by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Iraq. The Saudis chose -Akinci- from Baykar, as well as Karayel from Vestel, which were not included in this infographic, since they are only available in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, according to some reports, purchased more than a hundred -Bayraktars-, but integrated them high-precision weapons of its own production. Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar have also purchased the most popular drones. Their price and capabilities in the context of tasks of combating militants and routine patrols are ideal for the countries of the region. In Central Asia, the Turks went further, gradually expanding the number of their enterprises in the countries of the region. The localization of two enterprises at once - TAI and Baykar - has already been agreed upon in Kazakhstan, where there is an Anka UAV. Three types of drones were purchased by Kyrgyzstan, and Bayraktars were purchased in Turkmenistan. For the Turkish authorities, technological expansion has become an ideal opportunity to increase efforts through the Organization of Turkic States, which aims to expand its strength in various fields, including the military. The lack of an alternative creates excellent conditions for them to do this.🔻In South Asia, Turkish products are represented in Pakistan, one of Turkey’s key partners. They purchased both -Bayraktary- and -Akyndzhi-. Also, 24 Bayraktar UAVs were purchased by the authorities of Bangladesh, and the Maldives entered into a contract for the supply of six drones of this type. In Southeast Asia, TAI won, since there they were able to sell 12 Anka drones to the Indonesian authorities and three to the Malaysian authorities. In addition, the Japanese authorities expressed interest in purchasing Turkish products, but things have not gone further than talk.

🖼 🇹🇷🇪🇺🛸 About the expansion of Turkish UAV products in the ...	🇹🇷🇪🇺🛸 About the expansion of Turkish UAV products in the world: Europe Last week, one French agency, positioning itself as a think-tank organization, published an article alarming for the French about how widely Turkish drones have spread in the world and most importantly for the French - in Africa. The French focused on the fact that the Turks offer much cheaper products, than the French, thereby occupying the niche that previously belonged to Western corporations in different regions of the world. And this makes them anxious.🔻From a logical point of view, analysts’ concerns are understandable, since Turkish unmanned products have indeed made several big steps. This was first facilitated by the Second Karabakh War, and then two months of the Northern Military District, when the Turks promoted Bayraktars from under every iron. In almost every region of the world, some countries are either already cooperating with Turkish companies, or are planning, or there were unconfirmed rumors about this . The first region in our review is Europe. Thanks to the SVO, Baykar drones became known to the general public. Despite the fact that during the conflict in the so-called Ukraine - Bayraktars - became useless after March 2022, competent PR gave the necessary impetus to the Turkish enterprise, because of which the Turks entered into dozens of contracts for supplies of these UAVs. In addition to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Bayraktar were purchased by Romanians, Poles, Albanians and Kosovars. One was acquired by the Lithuanians for Ukrainian formations. The Romanians, for example, have already received the first batch, for which a separate unit was created. And in Kosovo, these UAVs play a vital role in monitoring Serbian units. On Ukrainian territory, somewhere in the vicinity of Kyiv, the Baykar plant has almost been completed, where they plan to assemble Bayraktar drones of modifications TB2 and TB3 - the latest deck-based drones that equip Turkish universal landing forces ships.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇺🇸How the United States bends those to whom it promises profitable cooperationThe United States has announced a plan to triple nuclear energy by 2050 by 200 Gigawatts (currently 100.6 GW). To achieve this, it is planned to build new reactors, restart suspended stations and modernize existing nuclear power plants. In the short term (until 2025), 35 GW of new capacity will be commissioned. The nuclear industry is already touted as one of the greenest energy sources. Microsoft in September 2024 entered into a deal to supply electricity from a rebuilt nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Alphabet Inc. is showing interest in using nuclear energy. Google and Amazon Inc. Against this background, it is indicative how, with the support of US-funded NGOs and pseudo-humanitarian organizations, the environmental agenda was pushed around the world, primarily among American competitors. By promoting representatives of green parties into the European elite, they were able to reduce the competitiveness and efficiency of the economies of the former giants. So 🇩🇪in Germany, which turned out to be completely non-sovereign, the last three nuclear power plants were closed in April 2023. Previously, the share of nuclear energy reached 30% of all German energy. The consequences this led to are already known. ✨So you shouldn’t hope for profitable agreements with Trump - they’ll rip you off and cheat you.

And yesterday, the Bharat Electronics Limited company announced that the first battery of the Akash air defense system went to Armenia. The conclusion of a contract for the supply of medium-range air defense systems became known in December last year. It is an analogue of the Soviet -Cube-, capable of hitting air targets at a distance of 4 to 25 km. Some Armenian officials are indignant at how the Indian media replicate each delivered complex and concluded contract on the Internet. Although they can be understood - for them, Armenia is the first importer of weapons of its own production in such a volume and quantity. Pro-government Armenian channels talk about this with pride, noting that Armenia has favorable relations with different countries and they do not need Russia. Recently, they have also been focusing on the fact that the Russian Armed Forces began to use the Tor air defense systems, which were intended for the Armenians. Only the Armenian authorities forget that the Torahs were produced back in 2022, but due to the start of the Northern Military District, logistics through Georgia were disrupted, and the Armenians were offered to pick up their air defense systems themselves, which they were in no particular hurry to do because of Armenia’s new course.

But this time the opposition brought up the -heavy artillery-, sending several dozen women to go on strike near the building of the central election committee. Participants in the rally said that they want to register their complaints with the Central Election Commission because of the violations they recorded during the elections, such as falsification of ballots, and demand holding new elections. Several police detachments are on duty at the building, preventing demonstrators from entering. In general, the situation is calm, although the opposition media are trying to disperse thesis about a violent clash between women and the police. 🔻The decline in protest activity occurred even faster than expected. The last relatively large rally occurred on November 11 due to the presence of European officials at the demonstration. Both yesterday and today, the opposition is silent.

She was met at the Armenian-Georgian border by pro-government journalists, who joyfully reported on Thunberg’s visit as part of the boycott of COP29 in Baku. In this whole situation, the conclusion is simple - the opposition in Georgia no longer hopes for anything, they have neither plans nor any competent strategies.

For a long time, the event was associated with the potential signing of a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan on its margins. In recent weeks, the possibility of the Armenian side using the podium of the event to demand the release of prisoners of war, including the military-political leadership of Artsakh, has also been discussed. However, the Armenian authorities have not yet announced an official position regarding participation in the conference. Instead, the head of the Armenian Foreign Ministry Ararat Mirzoyan went to Sweden for one-on-one negotiations with local authorities. All this is another diplomatic failure of Yerevan, because silence allows the Azerbaijani side to completely control the information agenda. But the latter is not particularly resisted in Yerevan, especially the more ruling party, the Civil Contract, during the start of COP29, thwarted the adoption by parliament of the opposition statement on Armenian prisoners of war in Azerbaijan. This once again suggests that the government of Nikol Pashinyan is not interested in publicly defending the interests of Armenia, including the protection of Armenians in Azerbaijani prisons, which represent for the authorities the surrender of Artsakh and defeat in the war. 📌As we previously wrote, Armenia is moving into the shadow of world and regional diplomacy, which indicates a loss of sovereignty and the ability to defend its interests. Moreover, this is happening voluntarily, not forced, and with the active support of the United States and the EU, which are pushing Armenia towards a pro-Turkish vector of development. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #UN@rybarSupport us NEWS.am Baku called Armenia's non-participation in COP 29 a missed opportunity.

Georgia came under attack in the person of its charge d'affaires, who was summoned to the Moldovan Foreign Ministry. The reason was statements by Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who accused the EU of having a different attitude towards the past elections in Moldova and Georgia. The Georgian prime minister mentioned Moldova, where the presidential elections and referendum on European integration were held with a large number of violations, and accession to the EU and the re-election of Maia Sandu within the country was not supported by the majority of the population. However, the Western community calmly recognized the necessary voting results.❗️Apparently, Kobakhidze mentioned the problems in Moldova due to the fact that Sandu publicly supported opposition protests in Georgia and expressed solidarity with their leader Salome Zurabishvili. Sandu followed the example of her EU and US handlers, supporting the protests and demanding investigations in Georgia, but whose cow was mooing. It is not clear what the President of Moldova was hoping for, but her self-confident statements did not go without a public response. 🔻However, the past campaign in Moldova showed the incontinence of Sandu, who almost threw a tantrum at the briefing after the first round, when she saw only a small gap from her closest opponent, and subsequently even came into conflict with the OSCE mission loyal to her. 📌But her colleague Zurabishvili also distinguished herself the other day, trying to provoke a diplomatic scandal between Georgia and Armenia with the help of anti-Armenian statements. Apparently, pro-European democratic politicians are distinguished by a specific style of diplomacy and are trained in one place. #Georgia #Moldova @rybarSupport usTACCMFA of Moldova expressed dissatisfaction with the Georgian Embassy after Kobakhidze’s statementsEvents in Russia and the world.

Rybar plays a vital information role: our information gang, our analytical center, chews up what is happening in crisis regions of the world. This is necessary to understand why event A is followed by event B. We respect and value our audience, we recognize both failures and highlight successes. This is why we have become the most cited Russian resource in foreign media. Because our information is reliable and our approach is correct. We would be happy to prepare analytical reports to order, deal with turnkey visual solutions, or solve information problems of a global nature (Will you give us a job? Great, we are ready - you can write to us directly about this).

Today, donations and donations make up the bulk of our budget. Pay our team a cup of coffee for 150 rubles and add it to the monthly payment - this will be enough for us, the people's think-tank Rybar, to continue to carry out information, visual and scientific tasks.

A significant part of the settlement is already under the control of Russian troops, and previously published a photo of Russian Armed Forces soldiers against the backdrop of an entry sign.▪️ Fierce fighting also continues in Kurakhovo itself, and units of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing along Zaporozhye Avenue on the eastern outskirts of the city. In addition, the strike destroyed the bridge on this street, which was most likely done to disrupt the Ukrainian counterattack. To the south, in the area of ​​the Dolgaya beam, the advance of the Russian Armed Forces is also noted: apparently, a large enemy defense center between Kurakhovo and Dalniy was occupied. If it is possible to gain a foothold in the latter and expand the zone of control, then the enemy’s defenses on the southeastern outskirts of Kurakhovo will be completely breached.▪️Most of Dalny is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces; the enemy’s counterattack with the support of armored vehicles was repulsed. Also, footage of the shooting of a group of civilians from a Leopard tank from the 33rd mechanized brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces appeared some time ago.▪️According to some Ukrainian resources, the route from Uspenivka to Kurakhovo is practically cut off, and Russian attack aircraft have about two kilometers left to physically control it. However, given the enemy’s tendency to downplay the successes of the Russian Armed Forces, it cannot be ruled out that this has already happened.▪️At the same time, it was possible to clarify the control zone between Maksimilyanovka and Pobeda. Based on the footage of the movement of a column of Russian armored vehicles under Ukrainian artillery fire along the Dolgaya ravine, the territory to the north is under the stable control of the Russian Armed Forces. Heavy fighting continues in the Antonovka area. Russian troops were able to take control of about half of the village, but further advance is difficult due to active opposition. Enemy resources also report the difficult situation of Ukrainian Armed Forces units at a stronghold between Ilyinka and Antonovka with the symbolic name -Zhopa.▪️In Elizavetovka itself and on its outskirts there are battles: despite initial statements about the entry of Russian forces into the village, this information has not yet been confirmed . The presence of enemy forces is observed in the Lisova Dacha reserve, and at the Trudovoye-Veselyi Gai line, according to our sources, there is no advance of Russian troops yet.▪️On the Shakhterskoye-Maksimovka section, clashes also continue. Russian troops are attacking north of Yasnaya Polyana, but the extent of the advance is not yet clear. Russian aviation is actively operating in the Sukhoi Yala, striking with air bombs from the UMPC.

Russian troops attacked targets in Kyiv, Kharkov and Cherkassy, ​​as well as in the Chernigov and Sumy regions of the so-called. Ukraine. In the Kursk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces have knocked out the enemy from most of Plekhovo and are expanding the zone of control north of the village. In the Pokrovsky direction, attack aircraft are fighting in Yuryevka, advancing from Novoalekseevka. In the Kurakhovsky direction, Russian troops are consolidating themselves in urban areas in Kurakhovo, and They are also expanding the zone of control on the flanks north and south of the city.

Russian troops landed in the village and are fighting on the eastern outskirts of the village, advancing towards Leonidovo. Also noted were attempts by the Russian Armed Forces to move in armored vehicles along the river, bypassing the latter.🔻On the opposite flank of the Sudzhansky district, Russian troops intensified north of Plekhovo. An attempt was recorded to swim across the Psel River. The bridge was destroyed during the fighting, so the landing party was forced to cross to the opposite bank of the river in boats, where they came under fire. In Plekhovo itself there are also significant successes. Thanks to footage published by the enemy, it was possible to establish that the Russian Armed Forces already control about 80% of the village; on the western outskirts near the farms, a focal presence of Ukrainian formations remains. Most likely, in the near future the settlement will be completely liberated.▪️In the neighboring Korenevsky district, enemy attacks south and east of Kremyany are repelled every day. A broken convoy of Ukrainian Armed Forces equipment south of the settlement was finished off by fiber optic drones - Prince Vandal of Novgorod -: at least three damaged and abandoned armored vehicles were recorded. 🔻The same drone, but already in the Sudzhansky district, hit another M1A1 Abrams tank in Sverdlikovo. Another tank and armored fighting vehicle were hit by them near Zeleny Shlyakh. Recently, the Internet has seen an increase in personnel successfully hitting targets, which may indicate the establishment of mass production of copies.

The other day we made a detailed analysis of a study conducted by the Gallup consulting agency, where we noted disappointing results for the current government in Armenia.

Pashinyan and Co. have growing problems due to unpopular political decisions that are leading the country into the abyss of the unknown.

Among foreign mercenaries there are many odious characters, but there are also some completely disgusting ones. One of them is Valdas Bartkevicius, who, with the sanction of the Lithuanian authorities, likes to fight monuments and memorials through vandalism and emanation of need.▪️Bartkevicius lives in Lentvaris, works as an assistant to a deputy of the Seimas and since 2024 has been leading the Lithuanian branch of the NGO -Friends of Ukraine Foundation-. In 2014, he supported the Maidan, and in 2020, an attempted coup in Belarus. In his native country, Bartkevicius (to the best of his abilities) is engaged in splitting the population, which fits well into the plans of the Lithuanian authorities.▪️In 2022, Bartkevicius established connections not only with Ukrainian NGOs. For example, with the structure -Our House-, which was actively recruiting Belarusians into the Kastus Kalinovsky Regiment, as well as the Turkish organization Russians in Antalya against the War (RAWA), which was engaged in the supply of cars for Ukrainian formations.▪️At the same time appearing on LBS Bartkevicius does not particularly strive, preferring to live in Lithuania and engage in actions there in support of the so-called. Ukraine, then meetings with participants of the Right Sector and various performances.▪️In March, Bartkevicius expressed support for the perpetrators of the terrorist attack in Crocus by bringing a bucket of collected feces to a spontaneous memorial to the victims in Vilnius. And today he posted footage of himself defecating on the monument to those killed in the Great Patriotic War in Cossack Lokna in the Kursk region.

In the Kazakh media, the discussion of the topic of minority protection is entering a new circle, which intensified after the partial satisfaction of the petition - We are against open and hidden LGBT propaganda in the Republic of Kazakhstan! -, as well as the recent parliamentary request of the ruling AMANAT party activities of the queer feminist collective - Feminita - addressed to the Prime Minister and the Prosecutor General of the country. To introduce restrictions on the dissemination of sexualized content among children, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Kazakhstan had to turn to all the laws of the Republic - from the Constitution to the Act on the Rights of the Child, according to which government agencies, individuals and legal entities are obliged to protect the child from the negative impact of the social environment, information , propaganda and agitation -. However, the decision began to be challenged by the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law and Human Rights Watch, which are funded by the Soros Foundation. So the victorious reports of the local press and hopes for the defeat of LGBT are premature: the protection of the rights of minorities in Kazakhstan is carried out by serious, well-rooted organizations with impressive funding.🔻For more information about who, under the guise of LGBT, is promoting the traditions of bacha-bazi in Kazakhstan, read our new article .High resolution infographicsEnglish version#Kazakhstan #LGBT #globalismProject -Rybar-Will LGBT propaganda be banned in Kazakhstan* It all started in the summer, when it suddenly became clear that there is a civil society in Kazakhstan	https://t.me/rybar/65315	2024-11-12T08:21:06-08:00

In addition to ongoing training with the Indonesians, they have also started the Trident 2024 event with Singaporean military personnel. About two thousand troops are involved in the exercise. The parties plan to practice landing personnel on the coast of Queensland, as well as conduct two operations in urban areas and the jungle. IAI Heron-1 reconnaissance UAVs will also be used. By the way, conducting such training in Australia is due to a specific reason - in tiny Singapore there is simply not enough space for such events, which is why they have historically resorted to the services of Taiwan and other allied states. 📌 This is precisely why the Singaporean authorities made a deal with the Australians to modernize a training site in Queensland worth a billion dollars. In return, military personnel from Singapore will be able to use the facility once construction work is completed. Given that one of Singapore's policy priorities is to build up its military power, the opportunity to conduct training in Australia is of utmost importance. So the scale and complexity of exercises like Trident 2024 will only grow in the future.

And with a quick search we see the news: the company Geltek, a manufacturer of skincare cosmetics with scientifically proven effectiveness, has received the official status of a small technology company (MTK). Surely many, like us, are hearing about the so-called MTC register for the first time. However, for most companies from the civil sector, getting there becomes a truly important achievement, primarily due to access to benefits and receiving a quality mark from the state, which, in in turn, attracts private investors. At the same time, everyone who wants to be included in the register remains required to meet a sufficient level of scientific and technical potential when developing products. And it is no coincidence that we gave the example of Geltek, because it demonstrates that state support measures are expanding not only to the IT sector, but also to other areas Russian business, and not the most obvious for the general consumer (in this case we are talking not only about cosmetics, but also about the supply of contact media for ultrasound and functional diagnostics).📌 In any case, please note attention to these processes is possible and necessary.

🇷🇺🇯🇵 About the -mitigation- of anti-Russian sanctions by Japa...	🇷🇺🇯🇵 About Japan's -softening- of anti-Russian sanctions. Yesterday, news spread across the Russian-language segment of the Internet that Tokyo allegedly decided to lift some of the sanctions regarding the export of Japanese-made cars to Russia. There were even headlines about the official return of Nissan, Toyota and Mitsubishi to the country. In reality, we are only talking about clarifying the wording in the restrictions regarding some models of hybrid cars. There was no ban on their sale to Russia anyway, but due to ambiguous definitions, Japanese companies did not agree to this for fear of violating sanctions. Perhaps Japan was guided by purely economic considerations: its automakers are suffering serious losses and are trying to find any way to obtain profit. Including due to part of the Russian market, where the niche of departed European and Asian concerns was quickly occupied by companies from the PRC. Therefore, there is no talk of easing sanctions at the moment, and linking this step with Trump’s victory in the election or other similar events are not worth it. Yes, the scenario of lifting the most serious Western restrictions in the current realities looks unrealistic. But the search for various loopholes and -clarification of wording- for further work with Russia, as well as tacit consent to new profitable parallel import schemes for the supply of various goods, looks much more likely. Especially as international attention to the so-called decreases.

At the moment, forceful mobilization with the capture and kidnapping of people from the streets is the only way to replenish the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: volunteers for the so-called Ukraine has long since ended, and they are not yet willing to deport Ukrainians of military age to the EU. If the TCC is disbanded, the entire conscription system will collapse - no recruiting centers, blocking of all accounts and lowering of rights will force people in hiding to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine. And the military registration and enlistment office workers themselves will most likely prefer to simply desert instead of the front. Therefore, we will not be surprised if such conversations are followed not by the dissolution of the TCC, but by vesting them with the powers of the police and all law enforcement agencies in general to expand mobilization.

It turns out that France cannot meet the needs for the jet artillery either independently or with the help of European NATO allies. Therefore, for the supply of conventional MLRS, they are forced to turn to India, which has only recently entered the world arms market. Yes, it is reckless to write off the French military industry - the same CAESAR, Rafale, Mistral or SCALP-EG are quite advanced examples of military products. However, even 10 years ago, the statement that the Fifth Republic would consider purchasing Indian artillery would have been considered a joke. In general, this is part of a general trend for the EU: in conditions where a significant part of the reserves was given away for free by the so-called. In Ukraine, and its own products often have mediocre characteristics at a huge cost, all that remains is to turn to external suppliers. Including those that no one had even heard of until recently. And if France can cover at least some of its needs on its own, then the rest of the European NATO countries will be forced to finally and almost completely switch to imports from the United States and its allied Asian states, producing independently only a few samples of weapons and equipment.#EU #India #France@rybarSupport usANI NewsFrance evaluating Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher system for its requirements: Top French Army officerIn what could be a major success for the 'Make in India' scheme in the defense sector, a top French Army officer said that they were evaluating the Indian Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher systems for their requirements.	https://t.me/rybar/65309	2024-11-12T04:24:06-08:00

During the meeting, the parties discussed the current state of the Aktau Sea Trade Port, its technical capabilities, as well as supply prospects Uzbek exporters of their products through the port. Abay Turikpenbaev noted that the port is expanding its capabilities, becoming an important component of the Trans-Caspian international transport route. During 2024, it plans to increase the volume of transit by more than 5 million tons, and in the future, work is planned to expand the port’s water area. 📌 If Uzbekistan agrees on supplies through the port, then this will expand opportunities not only for Uzbekistan, but also for Russia, since it will increase the potential opportunities for exports to Russia through the Caspian Sea. At the same time, the role of Kazakhstan in transit transportation is strengthening, which would prefer to take over the entire logistics between Europe and China. Astana and Beijing are working in this direction: this is evidenced by reports of the launch of container rail transport from Xinjiang. But at the same time, everyone should understand that container shipping under no circumstances can replace land routes due to its high cost and the need for developed infrastructure. Therefore, this is largely the creation of another route to diversify logistics, but not a replacement for standard routes. #Uzbekistan #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usdknews.kzXinjiang launches freight rail route to Central Asia On Wednesday, a train carrying 45 containers of auto parts left the city of Wusu in the north -western China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which marked the launch of international cargo	https://t.me/rybar/65308	2024-11-12T03:05:19-08:00

The reason was the detention of local oppositionists who opposed the ratification of an agreement with Russia, allowing Russian companies to implement investment projects in the republic. Protesters gathered in the squares of Sukhum and other cities, blocked roads and clashed with local security forces. The protesters, in their own words, consider the agreement to be a sale of Abkhazia and a deprivation of sovereignty and rights. An interesting situation arises: in a republic that lives entirely at the expense of Russia, they are demanding that Russian businesses be denied the opportunity to invest in its infrastructure. At the same time, they are taking openly unfriendly steps, such as displaying an exhibition in honor of the terrorist Shamil Basayev. The point is not only that such actions are akin to a shot in the foot and interfere with the influx of Russian investments into the Abkhaz economy, which, thanks to effective local governance, today remains in approximately the same state the same as 20 years ago. It is important that this happens in a republic that exists at the expense of the Russian budget. This is another clear example of the consequences of the country’s policy in the near abroad, when they preferred to use carrots where they needed to use sticks. As a result, such inexplicable generosity in the post-Soviet space began to be taken for weakness, almost reaching the point of ultimatums.#Abkhazia #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65305	2024-11-12T02:10:13-08:00

According to it, a patient who may die within 6 months will have the right to voluntarily die. To do this, two independent doctors will have to verify the independence of the decision, and the High Court will have to approve the request. At least seven days must pass between the doctors’ reports, and after the judge’s decision, another 14 days. The person will be allowed to change his mind at any time, and if he finally agrees, he will have to self-administer the lethal substance. Pressure or coercion to commit suicide will be punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Members of the House of Commons will take part in the first debate and vote on the bill on November 29. If it is approved during the first discussion, then parliamentarians will gradually begin further discussions and introduce amendments to the legal act. Looking at what is happening, the question arises: wouldn’t this be the first step towards allowing people to die not only incurably? sick people, or anyone in general for absolutely any reason? How has this already been implemented, for example, in Canada? #Great Britain&nbsp;#globalism@rybar together with @oldGBRSupport usbills.parliament.ukTerminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill publications - Parliamentary Bills - UK ParliamentDocuments, and debates for Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill	https://t.me/rybar/65304	2024-11-12T00:59:49-08:00

There he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who during the negotiations expressed hope for the beginning of a new chapter in bilateral relations. During the meeting, the situation in the South China Sea was not discussed. The parties entered into a memorandum of understanding in the field of oil and gas production in those parts of the water area where the claims of Indonesia and China intersect. 🔻The signing of such an agreement is a significant event. The wording - overlapping maritime claims - in the joint statement makes it clear that Indonesia takes into account the claims of the PRC to the water area. And although Jakarta has already stated that its position on the issue has remained unchanged, before that the authorities claimed that, in general, they do not recognize Chinese claims to Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. 🔻After Prabowo was elected to the presidency, experts and observers assumed that he would defend rights to the water area in the same way as last President Joko Widodo did, if not even tougher. Now it seems that everything could go according to a slightly different scenario. However, taking into account the foreign policy course of the Jakarta authorities, it is too early to discount the chance of implementing tough measures in this area. After all, Indonesia most often tries to seek a balance in international relations with other states, especially with such important players as China. #Indonesia #China@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe China-Global South ProjectChina’s Xi Hails ‘New Chapter’ in Relations With IndonesiaChinese President Xi Jinping told his Indonesian counterpart that Beijing hopes for a	https://t.me/rybar/65303	2024-11-11T23:41:52-08:00

According to information from the field, leaked onto the network, armored vehicles and personnel died due to - beautiful reports - about supposed control of the road and, as a result, unconducted engineering reconnaissance of the area. At the same time, the total mining of the territory of the Kursk region by the Armed Forces of Ukraine is an absolutely clear fact for our military.▪️ Yesterday morning, 13 Tu-95ms strategic bombers caused a blackout in Ukraine (to avoid overloads in networks in the event of an attack).

Kurakhovo is also surrounded on three sides by a wide area, attacks from the south are coming to the village. Further, from the north, the Russian Army is developing its success along the Kurakhovskoye reservoir, the dam of which was blown up by the Ukrainian Armed Forces yesterday. This action, at most, will make it difficult to cover Kurakhovo from the north.▪️ The troops of the Zaporozhye Front of the Russian Armed Forces, according to the estimates of the speaker of the enemy’s southern defense forces, are planning to begin assault operations in the coming days. At the same time, the enemy declares that in the Zaporozhye direction our troops numerically exceed the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇩🇪🇷🇺🇺🇦 Everyone today is discussing the Telegraph article about the plans of the British Prime Minister and the French President to persuade Biden, before leaving the American political Olympus, to give the green light to the use of long-range missiles against Russia. But the main thing here is not to forget about one more thing, not completely independent ruler - Olaf Scholze, whose country also actively continues to supply the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the further development of the conflict no matter what.♦️For example, now at the Starichi training ground in the Lviv region, preparation and combat coordination of the 5th separate tank brigade is underway - a formation that began to be formed back in 2022, and it was supposed to lead the 2023 offensive with Abrams and Challenger tanks. But then that offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces happened, which ended in major losses and the brigade was never put into operation, and the equipment was scattered among other units. But finally, the 5th brigade is almost ready - at the end of December they intend to transfer it to the Kurakhovsky direction. What is interesting here is that it now includes several tank battalions, and each of them has been allocated 10 Leopard 2 tanks. If we assume that in a standard brigade from 2 to 4 battalions, we get from 20 to 40 units of German tanks. Well, plans to transfer them to Kurakhovo indicate that the enemy still does not intend to just surrender these territories, since he is ready to throw a newly formed elite brigade into battle only from the training ground. #Germany #Russia #UkraineGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelTwo Majors🇩🇪GermanyStill German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in an interview with ARD: Scholz: -Yes, I’m going to talk with the Russian president- Journalist: -when will the right time come?-Scholz: -Soon- .✨The worthless puppet of the United States, sponsoring the war in Ukraine, brought...	https://t.me/rybar/65299	2024-11-11T12:47:02-08:00

Objective monitoring footage confirms the advance of Russian fighters clearing basements and positions in dilapidated houses. In the Pogrebki area, it was possible to clarify the configuration of the front line. Considering the recent movement of armored vehicles of the Russian Armed Forces along the road in the direction of Malaya Loknya, the entire territory east of Maryevka is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️In the neighboring Korenevsky district, another attack by an armored group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine east of Kremyany was repelled. It was also possible to determine that the section of the front near the Verkhnyaya Bloshka ravine and the Verkhny Shpil tract is occupied by Russian troops, who during the clashes captured several units of enemy equipment.

It is unnecessary to talk about the importance of combat aviation during the Northern Military District, especially if we are talking about the well-proven Su-35S, which three years have repeatedly demonstrated their capabilities. Therefore, the appearance of new aircraft in the Aerospace Forces cannot but rejoice.

Judging by the publications, the Ukrainian Armed Forces damaged the locks in the Starye Tern area: this led to the overflow of the Volchya River, which flows in a westerly direction. At the moment, the Ukrainian authorities are announcing a slight increase in the water level in the river. Stary Terny and Shevchenko, located close to the shore, are at risk. Footage from the enemy has already appeared on the Internet, demonstrating difficulties with the passage of vehicles. The probable flooding zone will stretch for tens of kilometers west of Kurakhovo up to the village of Bogatyr. All settlements are located in lowlands, so the water is unlikely to go beyond the boundaries of residential buildings.🔻 Although the enemy was clearly guided by the intentions of slowing down the developing offensive of the Russian Armed Forces, the effectiveness of such measures is questionable. Taking into account the current configuration of the front line, by the time the main troops of the Russian Armed Forces approach Starye Terny, the water level will most likely have already begun to decline. Of course, Ukrainian resources, in their characteristic manner, blamed the incident on -Russian shelling-, but artillery shell hits are unlikely to cause any serious damage to the dam. In contrast to charges placed in advance in the right places.📌 By the way, this is not the first such action carried out by the Ukrainian Armed Forces: in addition to the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station dam, the enemy had previously destroyed dams near Kozarovichi, Bakhmut, Avdeevka and other locations during the retreat. Moreover, in some cases, such scorched earth tactics also led to the fact that Ukrainian units ended up in the flood zone.

This year, counter-terrorism training took place in Cherat, Pakistan, but next year it will take place on South African territory. ▪️Another Passage Exercise took place in Djibouti during the visit of the Pakistani Navy ship Zulfiquar to the port of the African country. The visit was aimed at strengthening cooperation in the naval sphere, and military attaches and ambassadors were also present on board. Such small steps are part of Pakistan's strategy adopted back in 2019 to strengthen its influence in Africa. It is largely due to the opposition of India, which itself is making great efforts to gain a foothold on the continent.

This time the target of the raid was the section of the highway between Damascus and Homs. ▪️According to Syrian sources, the hit was on a convoy with humanitarian aid for Lebanese residents in the vicinity of Shamsein, located in the countryside south of Homs. ▪️As a result of the attack, three people were injured, and a large column of smoke appeared at the arrival site. Traffic along the section of the highway was temporarily restricted under the pretext of ensuring the safety of citizens.▪️Israeli media claim that the target of the raid was a convoy with ammunition for Hezbollah. They either did not acknowledge the hit on humanitarian supplies at all, or commented in the context of the fact that they allegedly planned to send weapons to Lebanon along with them. In the morning, there were also reports of Israeli Air Force strikes on the border settlements of Al-Qasr and Khosh al-Seyyid Ali. Almost any attack on them is justified in a similar way, since the transport corridor from Syria to Lebanon passes through them.

At the same time, there are no objective control shots that could confirm the breakthrough. At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces made significant progress in the fields near Novoalekseevka and broke into Sontsevka, the homeland of the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev. There are battles in a populated area not far from the museum, which the Ukrainian Armed Forces are shelling from tanks. ▪️On the eastern flank, Russian troops are advancing on Kurakhovo from Maksimovka, the fighting has shifted to the outskirts of the city. At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces carried out an attack in the area of ​​the Dolgaya gully in the direction of Dalniy, bypassing the main defensive fortifications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Footage of the work of a tank crew of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in a forest belt less than a kilometer from the settlement was published on the Internet. Thus, within a week, it was possible to advance more than five kilometers in this area, creating a threat of enveloping Kurakhovo.▪️In the south, Russian units advanced north and east of Bogoyavlenka, knocking the enemy out of the forest belts, and continued their attack on Vesely Gai. At the moment, information about the liberation of the RF Armed Forces of Trudovoy with the subsequent assault on Uspenivka is premature and does not correspond to reality. In the Maksimovka area, Russian troops, according to preliminary data, destroyed a special forces group of the 10th Special Forces Regiment GUR from the company -Honey Eater-, and also hit two armored vehicles -Kazak- and BMP. According to other sources, the Honey Badger group of the 169th training center -Desna- came under fire. In addition, there are reports of advanced groups entering deep into Elizavetovka, but they have not yet been confirmed either by objective control personnel or sources from the field. On the western outskirts of Antonovka, the presence of a small number of enemy forces remains. At the same time, messages about the alleged blowing up of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir dam began to spread on the Internet. However, so far they have not been confirmed either by information from the field or by objective control footage - today they tried to present as the latter a photo of the Kozarovych dam in the Kyiv region, destroyed in 2022 by Ukrainian forces.

This time the fired missile reached the central part of the country, where it was intercepted near the small settlement of Beit Shemesh. A fire broke out at the site where the ammunition fragments fell. Although Arabic-language media reported that a huge fire had allegedly broken out, in reality the fire was extinguished by local fire brigades within a few hours. 📌 At the same time, not far from Beit Shemesh there is the Sdot Micha airbase: according to some data, aircraft missiles, including those with nuclear warheads, are stored at the facility. Officially, Israel denies the presence of nuclear weapons, but this has long been an open secret. According to Houthi speaker Yahya Sari, during the attack Ansarallah used a hypersonic ballistic missile Palestine-2. This is not the first time it has been used against Israel - back in September, ammunition of this type crashed in an open area near the settlement of Kfar Daniel.🔻Meanwhile, at night a series of strikes were also carried out on Yemen itself: this time the aircraft of the American-British coalition worked on the outskirts of a large the city of Saada, as well as several settlements in the province of Amran. Apparently, the target of the raid was again Houthi launchers and weapons depots, which were used, among other things, to attack civilian ships in the Red Sea region. It is characteristic that the last recorded such attack was at the end of September.

The visit was organized with the support of the German Foundation for International Legal Cooperation (IRZ), which works to change the legal and judicial systems in other countries. The adoption of the Lobbying Law is one of the requirements for candidates for EU membership. Recently he was officially accepted into the so-called. Ukraine, which has already been plundered as part of promoting the interests of Western business. In the case of Moldova, the act will be a logical step towards destroying the sovereignty of the republic, but in a legal way. After all, lobbying will work only in the interests of EU business, and not the Moldovans themselves. Just recently, a scandal broke out in the country about the future sale of Moldovan lands to foreigners, which will definitely be demanded in Brussels in the event of European integration. Moreover, about 75% of the territory of Moldova is fertile black soil.📌 So the lifting of the ban on the sale of national lands to foreigners is quite organically combined with the possible adoption of a law on lobbying. After the re-election of Maia Sandu and the victory of the referendum on European integration, such decisions can be made without regard to public opinion. #Germany #EU #Moldova @rybarSupport usMoldpresMoldova ar putea avea o lege privind activitatea de lobbyChişinău, 11 nov. /MOLDPRES/.

And although such videos do appear from time to time, they usually only demonstrate the fact of the attack without recording the consequences. But from a propaganda point of view, such videos were quite effective, although in the vast majority of cases the incidents themselves did not lead to such critical consequences for the IDF fighters as was presented in the Arabic-language media. This is especially true for the defeat of Israeli armored vehicles, which almost always withstood hits from homemade ammunition. Circumstances have led writers sympathetic to the Palestinians to sometimes exaggerate the successes of Hamas ambushes. For example, just a week ago, footage of destroyed Israeli armored personnel carriers was distributed on the Internet, which was presented as a successful defeat of both the equipment itself and the entire crew. In reality, it was filming the skeletons of remotely blown up old cars used as means of disintegration.. 🔻Nevertheless, a solution to the problem of reducing the number of images appearing and their quality was found. Armed with After Effects and a game engine similar to Unreal Engine, the authors began publishing videos in the Arabic-language segment simulating successful Hamas ambushes that defeated both IDF personnel and armored vehicles. At the same time, the process of creating such videos is relatively simple, especially if you select the necessary models in advance. Yes, and everything follows the same scenario: create maps and transitions in After Effects, and 3D models through the game engine. As a result, it takes up to one day to create the final product. #Israel #mediatechnology #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65285	2024-11-11T03:48:06-08:00
🇦🇲🇺🇸🇷🇺 About American activity in Armenia In the press bure...	🇦🇲🇺🇸🇷🇺 About American activity in Armenia The press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) reported that the United States has intensified the work of pro-Western structures in Armenia for the final reorientation of the republic to a pro-Western course. According to the statement, the State Department is expanding training courses for representatives of key government Armenian institutions and intend to ensure a wider presence of foreign advisers in the government of the republic. The US task remains the same - to stimulate anti-Russian sentiments in Armenia, discredit cooperation with the CSTO and the EAEU, as well as create materials about the oppression of Armenians in the Russian Federation. At the same time, all the indicated processes themselves have long been launched: ▪️A political adviser from the State Department has begun working in the Armenian Ministry of Defense, and the discrediting of relations with the CSTO is in full swing. For this reason, in the West, the authorities in Yerevan are rushing to sign a truncated version of the peace treaty with Azerbaijan, which will open the possibility of launching the legal process of the country’s withdrawal from the Organization. At the same time, a hasty -peace- mediated by the West will give rise to new threats in the region, since the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is clearly far from over. ▪️A purge of pro-Russian personnel in security structures is underway in Armenia. The head of the National Security Service Armen Grigoryan is responsible for this process, who plays a key role in negotiations with American intelligence.▪️The Americans are working to bribe Armenian law enforcement agencies, and the Prosecutor General of Armenia Anna Vardapetyan works closely with the US Embassy and Western structures.▪️In Washington they are overseeing the creation of parallel structures . In 2022, the Foreign Intelligence Service appeared, which was created as a counterweight to the National Security Service, and for which they already want to provide access to state secrets. It was headed by lawyer Kristine Grigoryan, who was trained by USAID.▪️Finally, the United States is trying to sever relations between Armenia and the Russian Federation in the field of nuclear energy, trying to persuade the Armenians to close the nuclear power plant and accept a plan for the construction of a small modular station. At the same time, all American projects in this area failed. 🔻American politicians do not even hide that they are preparing extremely difficult times for Armenians in the name of -getting rid of - Russian influence. The US Helsinki Commission has already held hearings on Armenia, which means that work is underway in expert circles to strengthen the anti-Russian agenda in the republic. The main problem for the Americans is favorable Armenian-Russian trade relations within the EAEU. But it is no coincidence that the Americans are openly preparing Armenians for dire consequences. #Armenia #Russia #USA @rybarSupport ussvr.gov.ruForeign Intelligence Service of the Russian FederationOfficial server of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation on the Internet.	https://t.me/rybar/65284	2024-11-11T02:50:14-08:00

🇺🇸⚙️ About DARPA's initiative to create -flexible-military manu...	🇺🇸⚙️ About DARPA's Flexible Defense Manufacturing Initiative The Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently announced the Freedom Forge 2.0 workshop. It is dedicated to the concept of rapid deployment of military production, the relevance of which has become especially obvious against the backdrop of hostilities in the so-called. Ukraine and the need for the rapid establishment of mass production of products. Currently, it can take months or years to create a new military-industrial complex enterprise in the United States and other NATO countries, but DARPA is looking for ways to reduce this period to a few days. According to the plan, the facilities should not represent huge factories, but a network of decentralized flexible production facilities with the ability to be deployed anywhere. 🔻It is proposed to implement this with the help of advanced scientific achievements: instead of the usual machines and conveyor belts, the authors of the concept consider it necessary to use robots that will -form- the required part from a workpiece. All necessary equipment is planned to be manufactured on site using 3D printers. In simple words, DARPA is striving to create a system in which a plant built in a short time can produce almost any military product, from a drone body and artillery ammunition to a tank turret. Within this concept, it is enough just to download a new technical process to make changes to the design or even change the type of product being produced. The authors were clearly inspired by the example of the revolution in unmanned aerial vehicles, where thousands of FPV drones are produced in relatively small workshops, and developers quickly make the necessary changes to the design. However, simply scaling this experience to all other branches of the military industry still looks poorly feasible.📌 As Ilya Kramnik noted, in practice everything comes down to cooperation with conventional industries, which already ruins the whole concept. Moreover, the military-industrial complex of NATO countries is experiencing difficulties due to this and other problems, such as a shortage of personnel and competencies. And the existing exceptions, rather, confirm the rule: the same F-35s produced like pie are made at completely standard capacities. Nevertheless, the question of finding methods of flexibility and adaptability of military production in itself is quite relevant. And the DARPA initiative indicates that the United States does not ignore the -industrial- component of the NWO experience and strives to be proactive, coming out to the next conflict more prepared than any potential adversary. #industry #USA@rybarSupport usHighergovDARPA-SN-25-07. pdfView and download contract opportunity document DARPA-SN-25-07.pdf uploaded on 10/28/24 by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency	https://t.me/rybar/65282	2024-11-11T00:54:16-08:00

Representatives of 54 African countries and about 20 ministerial delegations took part in it. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his deputy Mikhail Bogdanov held many meetings with African colleagues. The negotiations covered not only a fair world order, but also other specific things: ▪️ An agreement was concluded with the Rwandan and Central African ministers on a visa-free regime for persons with diplomatic and service passports. It looks like a small thing, but in the case of the Central African Republic, it is very important: previously it was extremely difficult to obtain visas to the country, which delayed many processes in various areas of Russian presence.▪️During negotiations with the Deputy Chairman of the African Union Commission, special attention was paid to supporting African initiatives, in particular - assistance in increasing the peacekeeping potential of the African Union -. The latter, in the event of real steps in this direction, can shake the military pressure from the collective West - it is the main sponsor of AU missions and is currently cutting costs on them.▪️In the field of economic cooperation, we can highlight the statement about the imminent opening of a trade mission in Senegal and Tanzania. Cooperation along this line has intensified this year and is already producing positive results, although problems due to the reluctance of business to expand into new unexplored markets, unfortunately, remain relevant.🔻In general, the meetings that took place emphasized the friendly nature of relations between Russia and African states, despite against an international background. The Russian authorities once again showed a special approach to each participant, receiving small but quite clear preferences from each forum participant.

Four radio engineering battalions of the 3rd radio engineering brigade in the amount of 1,700 military personnel and over 140 units of specialized equipment, including several NUR- radars 15M Polish-made. These are stations that are designed to detect air targets at a distance of 240 km and an altitude of about 30 km manufacturer's statements. During this exercise, the Poles test the effectiveness of their equipment.📌 According to the exercise plan, units of the 3rd brigade will conduct comprehensive reconnaissance with all their forces across the territory of Poland, with an emphasis on the Kaliningrad region. And the Poles pay the greatest attention to the Suwalki corridor. During training, military personnel of the Polish Armed Forces organized a line of conditional defense along the corridor and conducted intensive reconnaissance in the area. In other words, the Poles conducted a comprehensive reconnaissance of our activity along the border under the pretext of an exercise. Units of this kind are not limited to airspace surveillance. They have various electronic reconnaissance systems on their balance sheet, and supposedly protection from Russian aggression is a good reason for placing specific equipment along the border.

This is the first time for Netanyahu that he has not received an invitation since becoming head of government. In addition, some left-wing Jewish organizations in the United States refused to participate in the event under the pretext that they did not want to be associated with supporting the policies of the Israeli government.📌 How tired everyone is of the ultra-Orthodox government and their methods that the head of government of the Jewish state was not invited to an important status event ?JFNA is the flagship organization representing more than 350 independent Jewish communities throughout North America. It collects and distributes more than $2 billion annually in support and grants to Jewish communities. The actions of the ultra-Orthodox are now causing rejection among a significant portion of Jews around the world. So, apparently, the ultra-Orthodox plan for waging a pan-Jewish jihad is coming apart at the seams.#Israel #Canada #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65264	2024-11-10T07:45:08-08:00

From November 11 to 14 in the central part of the country -Otava-2024-. The main maneuvers of the exercise will take place over the Rovaniemi airbase. Residents of nearby areas have already been warned about increased aviation activity, shootings and frequent fighter flights these days. Two F/A-18 squadrons of the Finnish Air Force and several Swedish JAS-39 aircraft will participate in it, which will operate from their territory. A total of 1 thousand people and 20 aircraft will take part. According to the plan, pilots of the two countries will train for emergency take-offs from air bases in case of an attack, including the conditional relocation of aircraft to bases in Sweden and Finland, as well as border patrol and infantry support.🔻Scandinavian states are increasing cooperation under the auspices of NATO. Even before joining the Alliance, these countries maintained extensive contacts with the bloc, but it was after joining NATO that the intensity increased significantly. And they are not going to stop in Scandinavia, since maneuvers with American bombers are expected in the coming days.

During the clash, several attackers were killed and wounded by the shepherds.▪️The attack was the first high-profile incident in the history of a terrorist group with ties to the Islamic State. It is noteworthy that many media outlets call it a new one, despite the fact that it was was founded back in 2018. Even then, it was known about cattle thefts and the collection of religious taxes in the north of Sokoto state.▪️The group gained great strength in connection with the coup in Niger, when many Fulani herders, fearing instability, fled to the south. There they were recruited by their fellow tribesmen in Nigeria. Since then, Lakurava has gained strength in the areas of Tangaza, Gada, Illela, Silame and Binji, and has recently penetrated further south into the state of Kebbo, with which the last attack was associated.🔻The emergence of new gangs are already commonplace in Nigeria. Only recently have we observed the expansion of the West African affiliate of al-Qaeda in the country. Now supporters of other terrorist groups are raising their heads. It is worth noting that the Americans played a special role in preparing an army unable to cope with internal threats. Thus, the latest army reform was carried out on the advice of the US Africa Command. And the benefit of turning Nigeria into a stronghold for militants of all stripes is obvious - an oil-rich country could become a regional leader. Actually, by offering their security services, Western actors only prevent the collapse of the country.

This time, the capital Sanaa, as well as several other provinces of the country, including Amran, came under fire. After the raid, the Pentagon reported the destruction of Houthi weapons depots, which were used to attack ships in the Red Sea region. Apparently, the attack was a response to another interception by Ansarallah fighters of an American MQ-9 Reaper drone - this is the 12th drone of this type shot down by Yemenis since the beginning of the escalation of the conflict in October 2023. However, recently the intensity of Houthi attacks has decreased significantly. If back in September the speaker of the movement, Yahya Sari, repeatedly reported both on the launching of ammunition towards Israel and the defeat of civilian ships, then by November such attacks had practically ceased. #UK #Yemen #USA@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65259	2024-11-10T05:06:42-08:00
🖼 🇦🇿 About plans to create a brigade of unmanned aerial vehicl...	🇦🇿 About plans to create a brigade of unmanned aerial vehicles in Azerbaijan Azerbaijan continues to improve its armed forces. It has become known that in the near future a UAV brigade will be created within the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, which will combine the current drone squads. It will include all units with drones that are in service at six airfields and air bases, such as Salyan, Guzdek, Kurdamir, Yevlakh, Dallyar and Nakhichevan. The UAV brigade will have reconnaissance drones, attack drones and also loitering shells. That is, these are the Turkish -Bayraktars- and -Akinci-, as well as the Israeli kamikaze drones Harop. Although the -Bayraktars- and -Harops- played a significant role during the Second Karabakh War, in addition to them, the Azerbaijanis will probably include other less massive and not entirely publicized samples of unmanned equipment.🔻Trends in military conflicts are steadily changing. From the primacy of armored fists in combat operations, everything moved to targeted strikes with the subsequent introduction of ground units. Azerbaijani troops quickly learned the importance of new trends, starting to implement them years before the Second Karabakh War. The Russian special operation has further strengthened the new role of unmanned technology, so that individual UAV structures are becoming a key part of the world's armies.

French Defense Minister Sebastian Lecornu signed a decree on the transfer to the Ukrainian side of about a dozen SCALP cruise missiles and an unknown number of Mistral anti-aircraft missiles. He stated that SCALP will allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to carry out strikes behind the front line, and the Mistrals are required to protect the airspace from attacks by the Russian Armed Forces in depth against the backdrop of the onset of cold weather. No matter how they play out the show that the Ukrainian formations do not have long-range missiles, they will be supplied with the required quantity for periodic attacks on Russian territories. A dozen -Skalpov- is the supply for one full-fledged salvo from the Su-24M. That is, the French transferred exactly as much as the Ukrainian Armed Forces needed now. And this was the case throughout the entire conflict. And they are probably already at Starokonstantinov, since quite recently Western satellites were intensively monitoring the airfield and nearby railway stations. This usually happens when new batches of missiles are delivered.#Russia #Ukraine #France@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇧🇷🇺🇺🇦 The Archangel of Special Forces expressed doubt that the Ukrainian side really has a problem with long-range missiles.

However, individually, this situation will not create a serious situation for each foreign worker threats, but in the aggregate everything looks different.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the raid of Ukrainian UAVs on Russian regions T...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 About the raid of Ukrainian UAVs on Russian regions Today, Ukrainian formations once again launched drones across Russian regions: currently, 93 enemy drones are known to have been intercepted by air defense systems in eight regions of the country. ▪️This time the Moscow region was subjected to the most massive attack: Russian anti-aircraft gunners worked in the urban districts of Ramenskoye, Kolomna and Domodedovo, where at least 34 UAVs were shot down. Due to the raid, all Moscow airports temporarily suspended operations; restrictions have now been lifted. There were consequences: one of the devices crashed onto a car in the village of Sofiino, and in the village of Stanovoe, two houses caught fire after the drone fell. One local resident was injured and was hospitalized with burns to her face, neck and arms. ❗️Against the background of the raid, a significant amount of video materials have again appeared on the Internet, including those demonstrating the positions of air defense crews in the Moscow region. And as has been noted more than once, current measures to combat this kind of espionage are not enough in the interests of the enemy. ▪️Another 31 drones were shot down over the territory of the Bryansk region. As a result of the fall of one of them, a fire broke out in non-residential buildings. ▪️In the Rostov region, Ukrainian drones tried to strike Kamensk-Shakhtinsky. In the vicinity of a populated area, three drones were neutralized by electronic warfare. ▪️In the Kaluga region, a UAV fell on the territory of a garage cooperative in the city of Sosensky: a small fire broke out at the scene of the incident, which was promptly extinguished. ▪️Also, air defense systems worked in the Belgorod, Kursk, Tula and Oryol regions: according to the latest information, there were no consequences there. Judging by the flight route of the drones, Ukrainian formations launched from the territories of the Chernigov and Sumy regions. There are two field airfields in the Chernigov region that could be used for this. 🔻As in most previous attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine towards Moscow, there is no strategic sense in this raid. It is, first of all, aimed at solving problems in the PR plan - both diverting the attention of its own population from the worsening problems at the fronts, and demonstrating the remaining capabilities for such attacks.

🔁 #Review #Summary for November 10, 2024 ▪️ The main internation...	Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for November 10, 2024 ▪️ The main international event of the week was the election of Trump. Despite the fact that he will take office on January 20, 2025, Trump has already begun to decisively influence world politics. We are primarily concerned with his intention to redirect American budget spending from Ukraine to the confrontation with Iran and China. There have already been leaks in the Western media that outline a plan to introduce British and European troops along the supposed demarcation line on the Ukrainian front (which is unlikely to suit the Kremlin), while recognizing the territories occupied by the Russian Armed Forces as Russian, including Crimea (which is unlikely to suit Kyiv) . At the same time, the only political force influencing the positions of the parties on this issue remains the Russian Army, which is increasing the pace of its offensive on a number of sectors of the front. ▪️ In the Kursk region, our troops are increasing pressure on the enemy, cutting off his infantry and equipment from the main forces and destroying his reserves in the Kursk region. Heavy oncoming battles continued all week; the Ukrainian Armed Forces deployed armored vehicles for counterattacks. However, there are no significant changes in the LBS, although one cannot fail to note the restoration of control over the section of the State Border near the settlement. New Path, which is confirmed by footage of the installation of a mine barrier and - dragon's teeth - by our military personnel.▪️ In the Pokrovsky direction, our troops, after successful offensive operations on Selidovo, are pulling up the rear and leveling the front line. At the same time, attacking actions continue in the direction of Pokrovsk (Krasnoarmeysk) itself, as well as to the southwest of Tsukurino, closing the Ukrainian Armed Forces units north of the Kurakhovsky reservoir into half-coverage.▪️ Kurakhovo itself becomes the next logical target. Our units carried out reconnaissance in force in the east of the city. From the south, along a wide front (25 km, from liberated Antonovka to Shakhterskoye), the Russian Army is building on its success after breaking through the Ugledar fortified area of ​​the Ukrainian Armed Forces. There is a likely plan to cut off the main road to Kurakhovo in order to deprive the Ukrainian Armed Forces of supply in the city.▪️ The news from the Seversky direction, from which previously untrue information about the capture of populated areas by our troops, became tragic. They reported from the ground that a frontal assault without fire support led to unjustified and senseless losses on our part. The call sign of the commander who gave the order has already become known.▪️ The situation in Ukraine behind the front line is characterized by obvious thugs, as well as open US agents (Bezuglaya), discussing the topic of mobilizing women. It is most likely that in this way Kyiv is preparing the public for the lesser evil of lowering the mobilization age. The latter will mean accelerating the depopulation of Ukraine. ▪️ The supply of weapons and equipment to the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the United States after the election of Trump and before his inauguration will receive a new impetus - the Democratic Party and Biden are allocating $6 billion for these purposes. In addition, the West continues to deploy military factories and restore the military industry, which was greatly curtailed after the collapse of the USSR. It is also important to link logistics to Ukraine into a single network (including railway), which corresponds to the goals of numerous NATO exercises for the lightning-fast transfer of large forces to the eastern flank of the Alliance.✨ Thus, the policy of the United States and its minions in the Ukrainian direction is becoming hysterical . Before Trump officially takes office, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be digging into the ground, since one of the options (according to Trump, again) for the development of the situation will be to freeze the conflict on the positions reached by the parties. For our side, such a scenario is unacceptable, because the West is using the respite to prepare for an even bigger war and pump up the Kyiv regime (though without Zelensky) with weapons and equipment.

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, several attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces were repelled here. The first evidence confirming the fact of the offensive of Russian troops began to arrive from the Sudzhansky district. Footage of an attack by an armored group moving along Orlovka south of Pogrebki has been published on the Internet. Probably, the events took place at the same time when reports began to arrive about the entry of the Russian Armed Forces into Staraya Sorochina. At the moment, an advance of at least several kilometers in a southern direction has been recorded. In fact, at the moment, the plan is being implemented to encircle the enemy to the west of the Malaya Loknya River in the forest belts near Kruglenkoe. If we manage to gain a foothold in Viktorovka, then the defending group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine will fall into the -cauldron-.🔻In the Dmitryukov area, there are facts of the enemy using mock-ups of armored vehicles, such as infantry fighting vehicles. One of them was hit by a fiber-optic controlled drone, which made it possible to establish a fake due to the quality of the camera. On the opposite flank, UAV operators hit the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Darino.

This time citizens gathered at the State University and Marjanishvili metro stations and moved along the streets of the capital. Having passed by Chavchavadze Street, the protesters headed to Heroes Square, which was blocked due to the march. Having reached their destination, some politicians spoke to the protesters and called for them to continue to fight.🔻And in general, that was the end of it. Unlike previous demonstrations, this time there were even fewer people who simply came out with the crowd, reached the point, and were told the standard routine about the -fight for freedom and joining the EU.- That’s it. No additional activity, no clashes with security forces - the opposition didn’t even try, which already speaks to the prospects of pro-Western supporters. The ruling party of Georgia acted as competently as possible, not interfering with their activities and simply observing everything from the side. The oppositional spirit went away on its own. Yes, pro-Western politicians have called for new rallies, but soon the people will get tired of this. The situation in Georgia now very much resembles Armenia, where the protests were also more for show, but there was no practical sense from them.

The most fierce clashes are taking place in the area of ​​Pervomaisky (Pershotravnevoy) and in the Terny-Yampolovka section, where the last bridgehead of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is located on the left bank of the Zherebets River. ▪️Messages about significant successes of the Russian Armed Forces west of Artemovka began to appear on the Internet in mid-October. With the help of a drone, a Russian flag was fixed on one of the towers in Pervomaisky, which gave rise to speculation about the liberation of the village. However, at that time it was not possible to clarify the line of combat contact due to the lack of objective control footage demonstrating the physical presence of Russian units in the village. On November 6, enemy sources published a video proving the presence of the Russian Armed Forces at least on the western outskirts of the settlement. At the same time, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the complete liberation of the village. It is likely that by now the attack aircraft were able to penetrate deeper into the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and take up positions in the central part of the village. At the same time, there are still some civilians remaining in the settlement, who took refuge from the forced evacuation of the enemy and were waiting for the approach of Russian troops. ▪️To the south, units of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing in the area of ​​the Terny-Torskoye bridgehead, which serves as a key defense center for the left flank of the enemy group in the Seversky direction. After the liberation of Novosadov, Russian troops, during fierce fighting, were able to knock out Ukrainian formations from the northern part of Tern. The geographical features of the area and the high degree of destruction of the village give an advantage to the defending units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Artillery and aviation are used to break through the defense line - in the last week alone, Russian Aerospace Forces pilots carried out more than a dozen airstrikes against temporary deployment points and enemy positions in the area of ​​populated areas. ▪️The second attack vector of the Russian Armed Forces is aimed at the junction of the enemy’s defensive lines between Yampolovka and Torskoye. Success in this sector would allow Russian troops to dissect the Ukrainian Armed Forces' bridgehead and isolate defense centers, simplifying their subsequent assault. Footage of a Russian armored group landing was received from this area, but the outcome of the battle remains unknown. ▪️In Serebryansky forestry the battles are going on with varying degrees of success. A few days ago, the Ukrainian Armed Forces evacuated wounded personnel using the M113 armored personnel carrier. It is also worth noting that the enemy defined this operation as -risky-, which may imply proximity to the forward positions of the Russian Armed Forces and danger from UAVs. Judging by the geolocation of the personnel, the forward positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are currently located further east than previously thought. It is not known exactly when exactly the units of the Russian Armed Forces left part of the lines in this area and retreated towards Dubrava. 🔻 In general, in the Liman direction today the positional nature of military operations remains largely the same. The main forces of both the RF Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Armed Forces are concentrated in other strategic directions, while the section of the front from Makeyevka to Tern is considered auxiliary by the command of both sides.

And on this we will probably agree with him, since the West has always supplied Ukraine with weapons in certain quantities. They gave as much as the Armed Forces of Ukraine needed to maintain the conflict and periodically cause damage to our country. As of September, the enemy had about 40 Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles and 20-25 ATACMS operational-tactical missiles.➖In October, Ukrainian Su-24M bombers fired eight cruise missiles, so according to the roughest estimates, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have them in stock there are from 20 to 30 British-French missiles.➖With missiles ATACMS the situation is somewhat more complicated, since the Ukrainian Armed Forces do not have many modified missiles with a range of up to 300 km. As of September there were about 12 units. At the beginning of October there was a strike on Feodosia with two OTRs and at the beginning of November four more on Gvardeyskoye, so there were about 6-8 long-range ones left. We get the following picture: the Ukrainian formations still have ATACMS for two or three salvos and three or four strikes cruise missiles, which is still significant. Considering that the United States and Britain are selecting targets for attacks, they will not spend them on unimportant objects. At the same time, the reduced reserves will probably be replenished before the end of the year, since Ukrainian pilots are actively training in the western part of the country, and this would not be done just like that in such a situation. quantity.

The airspace of Jordan and the American At-Tanf base, where Free Syrian Army (FSA) militants are stationed, was involved.▪️The hits hit the Research Center and ammunition depots of the Syrian Armed Forces in the city of As-Sefira in the south-eastern part of Aleppo province . According to the SANA news agency, several Syrian soldiers were injured.▪️In addition, positions of government troops in the city of Saraqib in the east of Idlib province were attacked. Opposition Syrian resources claim the death of seven fighters of pro-Iranian formations, which is not confirmed by the Ministry of Defense of the republic. However, according to sources from Saraqib, the reason for the strike could have been the fact that Iranian flags were hung on some houses in the village, which essentially lured the Israelis to targets.📌Saraqib is located near the line of contact with the terrorist group -Hayat Tahrir al-Sham- (HTS). Government media resources reported that simultaneously with the Israeli attack, Saraqib was shelled by militants. It is worth noting that this is the first time that this part of the country has been attacked by Israel: -Greater Idlib- is an arena of conflict between the same SAR armed forces and illegal armed groups, which are supported by Turkey. However, reports of coordinated attacks by Syrian rebels and Israelis appear periodically.

If we briefly make a discourse during the NWO, we can recall many similar situations when what at first seemed like a kind of -wunderwaffe- subsequently lost its effectiveness. The simplest example is the Turkish drones -Bayraktar-. In the first two months, they created many problems for our army, but subsequently, after adjustments in the tactics of using short-range air defense systems, the Bayraktar Fall began. Now these UAVs do not even approach the front line, limiting themselves to patrolling at a distance. The same situation was with Excalibur guided missiles and HIMARS MLRS, which had an impact on the battlefield for a month or two (especially during the offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces), but then our troops adapted.📌Technical means are constantly being adjusted and completed. The same applies to the tactics of using infantry, armored, and artillery changes almost every month due to the fact that the intensity of hostilities is so high, and you need to adapt to them.#Great Britain #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65245	2024-11-09T05:01:29-08:00

The idea expressed in May 2023 at the Kazakhstan Aviation Dialogue is becoming a reality. The new regional organization included Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Mongolia took part in the meeting as an observer. According to the Vice Minister of Transport of Kazakhstan Talgat Lastaev, EACAC will become a platform for the exchange of experience and joint work on aviation security issues. At the meeting, plans were presented to create an Excellence Center training center under the auspices of the Aviation Administration of Kazakhstan, as well as a unified base of inspectors. This simplifies the conditions for the operation of air traffic between Europe and East Asia. We have already written about the activities of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in this direction. EAAC essentially should facilitate interaction between regional airlines, but also create conditions for new carriers to enter the market. But it is too early to judge the prospects of this format based on just one meeting. Let's see how the participating countries approach the implementation of the agreements. #Armenia #Kazakhstan #Kyrgyzstan #Tajikistan #Uzbekistan #Mongolia #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKazakhstan truthFor the first time in Central Asia, a regional civil aviation organization has been created.

A suicide bomber detonated a suicide vest at Quetta railway station in Balochistan province. As a result, 26 people were killed and over 60 were injured. Militants of the separtist group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility. Their statement said that the targets were cadets of a military infantry school who were planning to travel by train to their destination. Of the 26 dead, 14 were military personnel. And of the 60 wounded, 46 were representatives of the army and security forces of Pakistan. At the same time, the Quetta-Peshawar railway route has only recently resumed service. It took about a month and a half to repair the site that had been blown up by the same militants. The terrorist situation in Pakistan has seriously worsened in the last two years, which is clearly visible in the statistics of terrorist attacks. In 2023, 789 extremist acts were committed, as a result of which 1,524 people were killed and 1,463 were injured. Just a month ago, on the eve of the SCO summit in Islamabad, an offshoot of the AOB - the Majid Front - attacked a bus with Chinese citizens near the Karachi airport. The Baloch have traditionally opposed the Pakistani government, and with deepening cooperation with China, which is investing in the port of Gwadar, their activity has increased significantly. #China #Pakistan #terrorism@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65241	2024-11-09T02:53:01-08:00

But sometimes even in our feed there are paid advertising posts where our content is used. Often, outright scam is advertised and, excuse me, information guano that has absolutely no value. Let’s take, for example, the closed channel NE.CAXAP, which simply steals other people’s content and passes it off as its own. An example is in the given screenshot. If there is clickbait advertising using our words and our videos, then there is hardly anything really worthwhile there - on the other side of the ad. Remember: no one will ever lure anyone to their advertising for truly interesting and high-quality content. It will go viral and become viral on its own. But to steal from others in order to attract an audience to your closed trash heap - yes, people can do this. To be honest, it is at such moments that you begin to understand what Roskomnadzor is guided by when introducing separate restrictions on the purchase and sale of advertising for this kind of resources.

🇮🇱 An investigation will be launched against ICC prosecutor Kar...	🇮🇱 An investigation will be launched against ICC prosecutor Karim Khan due to harassment. According to Reuters, an agreement on an external investigation was reached on November 7 at the Assembly of States Parties of the International Criminal Court. The publication refers to an internal document distributed among the member states of the court. In it, Khan is asked to resign from his duties during the investigation and transfer powers to one of his deputies. Khan himself denies the accusations. Karim Khan is known to the Russian public for issuing an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin in 2023, but the ongoing investigation against him is highly likely connected to another circumstance.🔻In May of this year, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because of Israel's inhumane actions in the Gaza Strip. The latter accused the ICC of bias, and called Karim Khan himself an anti-Semite. A month after this, the ICC pre-trial chamber postponed making a decision on Netanyahu, and already in August the first reports of suspicions against Karim Khan of molesting a subordinate appeared, and now, apparently, the matter has reached its final point. Moreover, no one is talking about the arrest of Netanyahu anymore. In this example, you can see the methods of the ultra-Orthodox. If anything, they will simply call you an anti-Semite and fabricate some kind of case. So to speak, democracy in the style of the ultra-Orthodox. #Israel #UN@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65238	2024-11-09T01:13:32-08:00

Representatives of the alliance discussed with the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armenian Armed Forces Artur Yeroyan and the Head of the Department of Defense Policy and International Cooperation Levon Ayvazyan prospects for Armenia-NATO cooperation. If you said that you were surprised, you would be lying. It is not without reason that in our conversation about the need for reforms in the CSTO and the CIS we mentioned Armenia and the demonstrative anti-Russian actions of the Armenian leadership. The Armenian authorities are doing everything to show with all their appearance their true intentions and attitude towards Russia. Taking this into account, we are soon expecting the arrival of NATO instructors, since Yerevan is no longer particularly worried about its status in the CSTO. #Armenia #NATO@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65235	2024-11-09T00:18:02-08:00
🇨🇳🇲🇾 The South China Sea has been surprisingly calm lately...	🇨🇳🇲🇾 The South China Sea has been surprisingly calm lately. Against this background, the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to China and his meeting with Xi Jinping looks curious. And although during the negotiations the parties discussed economic cooperation, it cannot be ruled out that they also raised the topic of the disputed waters. This is hinted at by Ibrahim’s statement that the authorities of both states have similar positions on many regional conflicts, which most likely includes the South China Sea. 🔻At first glance, this is really true. There have not been any serious clashes between coast guard ships of China and Malaysia for quite some time. And the commitment to not involving extra-regional states in the dispute is shared by both Beijing and Kuala Lumpur. However, this does not cancel the existing contradictions. Malaysia's policy is aimed at asserting its rights to the waters, as well as increasing its military presence there. The country is hatching plans to build a military base in the South China Sea, which clearly contradicts the position of the PRC. 📌 And yet, compared to other countries in the region, such as the Philippines, tensions between Malaysia and China are not so pronounced. Not only Kuala Lumpur benefits from this, ensuring strong trade ties with the Chinese, but also in Beijing. After all, the Chinese authorities set an example of developing relations between the countries participating in the dispute without Western interference, which has recently been abused in the Philippines and which greatly hinders China in implementing its plans. #China #Malaysia @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usSouth China Morning PostChina’s Xi calls for stronger ties, greater ‘political trust’ with MalaysiaPresident Xi Jinping meets Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, urges stronger ‘coordination on international and regional issues’.	https://t.me/rybar/65234	2024-11-08T23:35:17-08:00

Conflicting reports are coming from the Kursk direction about the offensive of Russian troops in the Sudzhansky district. At the same time, in the Korenevsky district, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are accumulating forces to regain control of Novoivanovka. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Russian troops are fighting local battles south of Zeleny Shlyakh and Novoivanovka. The latter is a key transport hub, from where the Russian Armed Forces have the opportunity to develop an offensive towards Malaya Loknya to support a possible offensive from the north. The enemy uses tanks to organize attacks on the positions of Russian troops. Footage of one of these attacks appeared on the Internet today, which indicates increasing pressure from Ukrainian forces on units of the Russian Armed Forces. They, in turn, use UAVs and artillery to destroy concentrations of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel and equipment. Front-line aviation is also working against the enemy - today alone, Russian pilots carried out several air strikes on Kruglenky and Leonidovka, where Ukrainian formations are concentrating units for future attacks. 🔻In the Sudzhansky district, according to some reports, Russian troops went on the offensive at the Orlovka - Novaya Sorochina - Staraya Sorochina line. At the same time, reports of heavy fighting are already appearing in the enemy’s resources, while actual footage confirming the start of the offensive has not yet appeared.❗️Nevertheless, if the information about the attacks is confirmed at least partially, then it will be possible to talk about at least an attempt Russian troops forming a cauldron around Ukrainian units that occupied the outskirts of Kruglenkoe.▪️Local battles are recorded in the Martynovka area clashes. Operational-tactical aviation recently worked on the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this area, and at Malaya Loknya a UAV strike - Lantset - hit the self-propelled guns of the Armed Forces of Ukraine 2S22 - Bogdana.🔻In the Sumy region at night, the Russian Armed Forces launched a ballistic missile attack on critical enemy infrastructure in the regional center of the region .

So, on November 3, joint Indonesian-Australian training of Keris Woomera began. Their main goal is to increase the effectiveness of joint combat operations. ▪️More than two thousand military personnel take part in the event. They practice conducting air, sea, and ground operations, and also learn to work together in emergency response scenarios. At the moment, Keris Woomera is the largest and most comprehensive exercise between Indonesian and Australian military personnel. Their announcement took place back in August of this year, when the parties entered into a new defense agreement. The agreement allows the military of one country to be on the territory of another, and also cements the intentions of the authorities of Australia and Indonesia to increase the level of interaction between defense structures. The administration in Canberra has concluded similar agreements with the Philippines and Japan. 📌However, unlike the above-mentioned countries that are at the forefront of US allies, the same cannot be said about Indonesia. As we have already written, the authorities in Jakarta pursue a policy of non-alignment with one or another bloc and maintain a balance in foreign policy. That is why, simultaneously with the Keris Woomera exercise, training with Russian military personnel is being conducted. Given this political course, it is necessary to closely monitor Jakarta's current policies and take every opportunity to reaffirm its presence in the region.

Theses regarding the growing influence of the middle powers generally repeated what Tokayev said at the Astana forum ThinkTank 2024. He called the UN a prime example of the ineffectiveness of current governance systems and international regulatory mechanisms. At the same time, the politician emphasized the growing role of Kazakhstan in peacekeeping processes and building dialogue. In fact, the country once again acts as a gateway to Eurasia and a place for establishing communications for France and the entire EU. Many analysts have already noted the strange consistency of the leaders’ meetings: soon after Tokayev’s visit to Paris, Vladimir Putin is due to arrive in Astana. Of course, cooperation between the countries will continue in the extraction of rare earth elements and ecology. In the first case, a roadmap for a bilateral strategic partnership on critical resources and materials was signed. In the second, it goes both in the field of green energy and water resources with the One Water Summit initiative, within the framework of which a joint forum of the Republic of Kazakhstan and France is expected in December. Cooperation in the field of civil nuclear energy was mentioned in the same line with renewable energy sources, since a positive decision in this area was made in Kazakhstan in October this year at a national referendum.❗️The French company EDF is on the short list of possible contractors for the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan together with CNNС (PRC), KHNP (South Korea) and Rosatom. Therefore, the mention of such cooperation by Tokayev and his meeting with the General Director of Électricité de France Luc Remont caused a storm in the Kazakh segment, where they began to assert that France would build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. It’s funny that just a few days before Tokayev’s visit to Paris , a large delegation from the Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan visited South Korea, also declaring their readiness to cooperate in the field of nuclear energy. Of interest was that turbine manufacturer Doosan was among the companies visited. This corporation was now supposed to participate in the construction of two power units at the Temelin nuclear power plant in the Czech Republic under the auspices of the already mentioned KHNP, however, with the combined efforts of the American Westinghouse and the same EDF, this prospect is becoming a little foggy, as well as the possibility of the South Korean contractor constructing a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. #Kazakhstan #France #Central AsiaSupport usGazeta.RuUranium and other strategic minerals.

In the north, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Grigorovka and Novoalekseevka, while on the southern flank, Russian attack aircraft are confidently advancing along the northern shore of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir. ▪️On November 3, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the release of Vishnevoy, which confirmed the consolidation of the Russian Armed Forces in the locality. Taking advantage of the disorganization of enemy units, Russian troops broke through to Grigorovka, located northwest. The armored groups advanced along the nearby forest belt, after which they carried out a landing. The stormtroopers knocked out the Ukrainian formations from their positions in the village and, after consolidating on the occupied lines, are launching an offensive on the south-eastern outskirts of Petrovka. ▪️The capture of Vishnevoy allowed the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive also towards Novoalekseevka. On November 4, footage of the hoisting of the Russian flag, filmed by Russian military personnel on the eastern outskirts of the village, appeared on the Internet. In the following days, the attack aircraft completely liberated the village, pushing the Ukrainian Armed Forces back towards Yuryevka and forest belts to the west. 🔻During the successful offensive of Russian troops in the area from Grigorovka to Novoalekseevka, a wedge was formed in the position of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. For the enemy, it is dangerous with the prospect of a possible semi-encirclement of Ukrainian formations in two new areas at once: Lysovka - Petrivka and Novoalekseevka - Zarya. ▪️On November 7, the Ministry of Defense announced the liberation of Kremennaya Balka west of Tsukurino, which was later also confirmed by information from the field. Despite enemy resistance, the Russian Armed Forces pushed through the defenses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces north of the village, which made its liberation a matter of time. ▪️To the south, the Russian Armed Forces are developing an offensive along the northern shore of the Kurakhovsky reservoir. By November 6, units of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Stepanovka and installed the banner of their unit on one of the houses in the village. After this, the assault groups, in a series of attacks, advanced to Ilyinka and started fighting on the north-eastern outskirts of the village. At the same time, the artillery of the Russian Armed Forces suppresses the firing points and positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces at strong points north and south of the settlement. ❗️Messages continue to appear on the Internet about the advance of Russian troops towards Berestki and even to the northern outskirts of Starye Tern. So far, the information has not been confirmed either by objective monitoring personnel or by reports from the field. ▪️To the southwest of Maksimilyanovka, the Russian Armed Forces significantly expanded the zone of control, breaking through the defensive line of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and occupying at least one line of trenches near the Dolgaya beam. Stormtroopers advance into gaps in the defensive lines along the ravine, attacking at the joints of the fortification lines in the forest area. At the moment, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces are advancing along the Dolgaya gully towards Kurakhovo, trying to create a springboard for a further assault on the city, while at the same time advancing from the south in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction.

The reason is simple - against the backdrop of the TCC raids, a significant part of the male population decided to literally sit at home. Indirectly, this conflicts with the data of the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy that 8 million able-bodied citizens are not working and are not looking for work. Authorities propose to combat the decline in the number of conscripts into the Armed Forces of Ukraine by stopping the kidnapping of people from the streets by TCC officers. True, such measures are unlikely to be able to reverse the situation against the backdrop of general trends of increasing war fatigue in Ukrainian society. They manifest themselves, for example, in the increase in those wishing to go abroad permanently or in the increase in the number of cases of unauthorized abandonment of units. 📌 Therefore, the only way to recruit manpower for the enemy is to tighten the force mobilization and scale of TCC raids. What, in fact, is now happening in the territory controlled by the Kyiv regime in cities from Kharkov to Lvov. At the same time, it is too early to talk about the exhaustion of the human potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, certain processes are already visible to the naked eye - nothing like this happened either in 2023, or even more so in 2022. #Ukraine@rybarSupport us RBKV The Verkhovna Rada announced a decline in mobilization in Ukraine. The pace of conscription of mobilized people is decreasing, a member of the Rada said.

🇹🇷🇹🇷 About the prospects of the UTG after the summit in Bishk...	🇹🇷🇹🇷 About the prospects of the UTC after the summit in Bishkek On the 15th anniversary of the Organization of Turkic States, the UTC summit was held in Bishkek, which was presented as an epoch-making event, followed by fundamental changes and reforms. And now let’s sum up the results of the summit.▪️The composition of the event participants remained the same, but special attention was paid to the arrival of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who was presented with an honorary award. Also this year, it was decided to formalize the political unification by approving the OTG flag.▪️As ​​for the opinion of DTM colleagues regarding the deterrent factor of OTG in the form of money, the Turks are trying to invest in large volumes, despite their problems. The main problem of the bloc is the fantastic nature of the goals they set for themselves.❗️The very idea of ​​uniting the Turkic world looks in its current form as an extremely unlikely idea.➖Firstly, the participating countries are in different orbits of influence of different political forces. A significant part of Central Asia is under the influence of Russia, if only because a huge part of the population of these countries works in Russia. Azerbaijan, no matter how the Turks talk about a single nation, is still under the influence of Mountain Jews, who are close in spirit to the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. ➖Secondly, there is a financial issue. Turks can invest in these countries, invest in economic development (they do this), but for them there will be no results in the short term. The Central Asian republics will take the money and say -thank you- and that’s it. The words of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev confirm this. He proposed creating a Turkic Investment Forum. The Turks present this as a way to consolidate influence, but if we read between the lines, adjusted for the local mentality, we get - let’s get more money.➖ Thirdly, the main task of the UTG in the coming years is to try to earn trade flows from China, displacing Russia in region. It is in the interests of the collective West that work on the Middle Corridor and the UTG has intensified. However, this requires billions of dollars in investments in infrastructure, which will be so expensive that not everyone can afford it. At the same time, workers and specialists are needed, which are not available in Central Asia, since most of the working-age population has left for Russia or Europe. For example, we need electrification of the region and for the railway, in particular, as well as maintenance personnel. Local construction of this kind will not be able to cope. The Turks are also not the best specialists, as can be seen from their bitter experience, and the cheapest and most practical option is to receive help from China. Summarizing the above, we get the conclusion: OTG in the form in which it exists now is a populist-economic project, in in which the West, Britain primarily, through the hands of Turkey, is trying to oust Russia from Central Asia, as well as to ride the economic flows from China. But in order to do this, the Turks, within the framework The OTG needs to reach an agreement between the participating countries, with China and Russia. It will be difficult to achieve real initiatives even among themselves, and here there are also Russia and China, who will not sit idly by.❗️In the short term, the bloc’s expansion plans are unlikely to reach the desired point due to many problems and the need for gigantic investments. Even in the cultural sphere, the Turks are trying to promote their interests, but the only thing they have been even slightly successful in is the alphabet. But the transition to a new alphabet is such a time-consuming process and also financially expensive that it is too early to talk about prospects. And as long as locals go to Russia to work, there can be no talk of any Turkish expansion. But the UTG project cannot be underestimated. If the OTG is considered by interested parties as a long-term project to strengthen influence in Central Asia, then serious problems may subsequently arise. Moreover, in the military sphere, UTG is trying to develop cooperation by leaps and bounds. #OTG #CentralAsia #Turkey@rybarSupport usTelegramDTM🇹🇷🇦🇿🇺🇿🇰🇿🇹🇲🇰🇬 Erdogan called the Turks with 34 letters: the 11th died down in Bishkek OTG summit ▪️This year the organization turned 15 years old.

🔁🖼 America continues to seethe over Trump's victory in the pres...	Forwarded From Tina Kandelaki America continues to seethe due to Trump's victory in the presidential election. There is a new trend on TikTok - women are promising to give up sex for the next 4 years while Trump is in power. All this has already happened in human history, friends. Aristophanes wrote his comedy - Lysistrata - two and a half thousand years ago. In it, wives refuse intimacy with their husbands due to dissatisfaction with the protracted war between Athens and Sparta. True, it didn’t work out very well: the irresponsible women always tried to run home to their abandoned loved ones. I believe that in the millennia that have passed since the time of Lysistrata, humanity has changed very little. And no matter what harsh oaths Trump’s disappointed opponents and opponents make now, very soon life will take its toll. Life always takes its toll.	https://t.me/rybar/65213	2024-11-08T05:25:40-08:00

Judging by articles in the media, the main focus of the negotiations was on cooperation between Russia and the DPRK. Politicians mentioned that the parties would work together to contain it, but have not yet presented any specific measures. Perhaps we are talking about the possibility of introducing new sanctions. During the negotiations, emphasis was also placed on the development of defense ties not only between South Korea and Japan, but also trilateral relations with the United States. The parties called the partnership in this triangle the most important against the backdrop of threats from the DPRK. 📌 Despite statements, the trilateral format of cooperation may suffer during the second presidency of Donald Trump. This is indicated by his actions during the previous term. Yes, the parties made attempts to -protect- the alliance from possible decisions by Trump - an agreement was concluded in August, which formalized plans for holding trilateral negotiations and exercises. However, as we have already written, the agreement is not legally binding, so Trump may simply not comply with it. Of course, it remains to be seen about the future prospects of American policy in the region, which will depend not only on Trump’s personality, but also on the chosen team. However, authorities in Seoul and Tokyo need to prepare for any outcome, and the question of the effectiveness of the bilateral partnership without the participation of the United States still remains open. #SouthKorea #Japan @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News AgencyS.

🎬 🇮🇱🇳🇱 About the night riots in Amsterdam In the capital of ...	🇮🇱🇳🇱 About night riots in Amsterdam Riots occurred in the capital of the Netherlands after a football match between Ajax and the Israeli team Maccabi. Throughout the night, Israeli citizens were beaten in the streets, attacked with knives and tried to be run over by cars. The event has already been dubbed a Jewish pogrom on the Internet. Five Israelis were taken to hospitals. The bulk of the attacks were carried out by local residents from Morocco, Turkey and other Muslim countries, who shouted pro-Palestinian slogans. Police detained more than 60 rioters, while reports of hostage-taking were not confirmed. Israel's national airline, El Al, announced the launch of free rescue flights to evacuate more than 2 thousand people, although its planes usually do not fly on Shabbat. IDF transport planes with medical personnel also flew to the Netherlands.🔻According to statements by Israeli officials and resources, this was not a spontaneous, but a well-thought-out action, planned two weeks ago. According to them, yesterday Dutch law enforcement agencies warned about the possibility of attacks, but they simply ignored it. The Internet, as expected, began to compare the unrest with the events of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany, the anniversary of which, ironically, will be tomorrow. Israeli President Isaac Herzog demanded that the Netherlands resolutely combat any manifestations of anti-Semitism and help in the evacuation. However, the Israeli fans themselves added fuel to the fire: in Amsterdam they tore down Palestinian flags, had fun and sang -Hava Nagila- at the national monument to the victims of the Second World War . And during the match they refused to observe a minute of silence for those killed in the flood in Spain.❗️What happened is, on the one hand, another evidence of serious demographic changes in the population of large European cities. Yesterday's refugees from Muslim countries and their descendants are becoming a force that is increasingly easier to mobilize for street actions, and it is increasingly difficult for the police to counteract this. At the same time, the policies of the ultra-Orthodox Israeli authorities and their public demonstrative disregard for decisions of the UN Security Council and other international norms against the background of personnel The bombing of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip more strongly provokes some segments of the population of Western countries to such attacks. Against this background, there is no guarantee that this will not happen in other European cities in the future. #Israel #Netherlands@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/65208	2024-11-08T03:57:31-08:00

At some moments it even seemed that the British press had completely forgotten about the events taking place in their own country. First of all, such strong interest is due to economic factors - the British are afraid of the consequences of Trump's introduction of duties on the import of foreign goods. According to analysts, protectionist measures will lead to a decrease in the growth rate of the UK economy by 0.7 percent, an increase in the inflation rate by 3-4 percent, as well as an increase in the key rate. The story of the participation of representatives of the ruling Labor Party in the Democratic election campaign adds to the severity of the situation. Trump's team filed a complaint with the independent Federal Election Commission in connection with -unlawful foreign interference in the election campaign-.▪️Prime Minister Keir Starmer had to justify himself and convince everyone that the incident would not have a negative impact on relations with Trump. After the election, the head of the British government congratulated the American politician and emphasized the long-standing special ties between the countries. Less fortunate was Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who, while a member of the House of Commons in 2018, called the US president a sociopath who hates women and sympathizes with neo-Nazis. The head of the foreign policy department had to give a separate interview and state that these are -old matters- that will not prevent him from improving relations with Trump. It is still difficult to assess the consequences of Donald Trump’s coming to power for the development of British-American relations.

According to enemy statements, such UAVs make up about 50% of all those launched using the so-called. Ukraine has devices of this type. The purpose of their use is to -discharge- Ukrainian air defense systems, the ammunition for which is limited both by Western supplies and by the production capabilities of NATO countries in general. This can explain the increasing frequency of raids on Geranium Kyiv, which have been going on almost continuously in recent days. At the same time, calling this a cheap means of combating enemy air defense is reckless: as we have already written, technically Geranium is only becoming more difficult from year to year. In addition, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to save missiles for air defense systems and are trying to fight these drones with the help of anti-aircraft artillery. How effective such tactics are in terms of cost-benefit ratio - time will tell. However, in any case, the efforts of the Russian Armed Forces to reduce the combat effectiveness of the Ukrainian air defense and weaken the cover of the rear areas of the so-called are visible.

The structure was created in 2023 by the team of Arseny Parfenov from the State Polytechnic University named after. V.G. Korolenko, whose activities in Latin America we have repeatedly talked about. As it turns out, currently four Open Education Centers have already been created in Venezuela, and Russian has been introduced into the curriculum in six schools as a second foreign language.

Both the leadership of the UAE, which is the main sponsor of the Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), and Chad came under attack. ▪️Sudanese authorities have decided to end contracts worth $6 billion previously concluded with the Emirates. They mainly concerned the construction of the Abu Amama port on the Red Sea, as well as an economic free trade zone and a tourist zone around the structure. In addition to political motives, the end of cooperation was also due to the fact that the contract was not implemented on time. In fact, the Sudanese government has significantly curtailed the prospect of even the very possibility of post-war dialogue with the UAE.▪️The leadership in Port Sudan also filed a complaint against Chad with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, which belongs to the African Union. The accusations related to the support of the SBR: the downed Il-76, working in the interests of the militants, was heading directly to Chadian territory. This again shed light on helping the rebels from N'Djamena. By the way, all these proceedings open a certain window of opportunity for Russian departments that can fill the resulting vacuum in these areas. This is especially true for the project of the Navy logistics center on the Red Sea coast, which has been raised more than once.#Africa #UAE #Sudan #Chad @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇸🇩🇷🇺 About the downing of an Il-76T with a Russian crew over SudanAt 4 am on October 21, an Il-76T transport plane 76T was shot down by Sudanese rebels from the Rapid Reaction Forces, who have been waging war against the official government for the last year and a half.

🇦🇲📊 Public opinion poll in Armenia: power rating During the la...	🇦🇲📊 Public opinion poll in Armenia: power rating Over the past year, the approval rating for the actions of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has been consistently low. In October, almost 58% of respondents were dissatisfied with Pashinyan’s work, 35.4% were dissatisfied with the work of the government, 43% of the parliament, 39% of the president.🔻Parliamentary elections In a hypothetical parliamentary election, 16.5% would vote for the ruling party -Civil Contract-, and 6.4% - Armenia bloc. 30% said that they would not participate in the elections, 33.2% refused or found it difficult to answer, or did not choose anyone. The ruling party has already begun to push through parliament odious amendments to the Electoral Code, which will allow the election results to be annulled in the event of a state of emergency or martial law being introduced. After the signing of peace with Baku, early elections will most likely follow in Armenia in a situation where society will be extremely dissatisfied with the authorities. Although a slightly larger proportion of citizens give preference to the Civil Contract, its rating is still low, and the absence of other preferences indicates a blurring of the political field. The latest protest in Armenia faced precisely the latter, which for several months has not developed a clear program.🔻Like many previous surveys, the current one shows the crisis state of the Armenian society, which is dissatisfied with the authorities, the foreign policy course, but at the same time has no other moral -political guidelines. And although the Armenian authorities self-confidently declare that the main thing is the economy, the main problem for the Armenian society remains the feeling of an external threat and it is obvious that against such a background, Pashinyan’s peace-loving policy does not inspire confidence.

Ukraine and Moldova? The majority (52%) believe that this is impossible, and 35% believe that Armenia has a chance. Since the summer, the idea of ​​European integration began to periodically appear on the Armenian agenda, and now the issue of holding a constitutional referendum on joining the EU is being considered. Mythical European promises in the context of internal political problems and diplomatic failures are the only thing that Nikol Pashinyan’s government can now offer to the population of Armenia. So far, the EU has limited itself to just starting negotiations on visa liberalization, which reinforces false promises. After all, the problem with the hypothetical European integration of Armenia is that it is impossible without Georgia, which, as we know, has had pretty bad relations with the EU.🔻Modernization or closure of nuclear power plants The Armenians were asked a pressing question about the country’s energy security: what should the government do in the field of nuclear energy?&nbsp ; The first option is to modernize the existing nuclear power plant by 2036. The second is to close the nuclear power plant and build American modular nuclear reactors. 63.7% were in favor of modernizing the Armenian nuclear power plant, which is maintained by the Russian Rosatom, and 25.5% were in favor of closing it and implementing the American project. As we wrote, the United States is trying to sell Armenia a non-existent project of new small modular reactors. The Americans themselves have not yet developed a working SMR technology, and their similar projects have failed miserably.

🇦🇲📊 Public opinion poll in Armenia: security threats In Octobe...	🇦🇲📊 Public opinion poll in Armenia: security threats In October, another opinion poll from GALLUP was held in Armenia, the results of which, as usual, demonstrate apathy in Armenian society and dissatisfaction with the foreign policy course of the authorities.🔻 -Peace - with Azerbaijan To the question - do you think you are possible to conclude a -peace treaty- before the end of the year-, only 8.3% of respondents answered positively, and 64.6% - negatively. The government of Armenia constantly states that they are ready to sign -peace- even now, especially with this They are constantly rushing to the USA. However, a tense information background remains between Yerevan and Baku, which looks more like preparation for another escalation than a movement towards -peace-. So the disbelief of the Armenian society in the promises of normalization is quite understandable. The other day, the Russian Foreign Ministry just stated that the -quick peace- promoted by Western pseudo-mediators will not lead to anything good, but will only create new risks of tension. 🔻Concessions to Azerbaijan and Turkey When asked whether Armenia should make new concessions to establish closer relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey, 90% answered - no, we have nothing more to concede - and only 7% believe that the country has no other choice .The level of Turkophobia in society is invariably high and it is impossible to imagine a calm attitude towards concessions in the name of -normalization-. Moreover, Baku and Ankara themselves are not ready to compromise and view Armenia as a losing side that can be presented with new demands and threatened with force. The Armenian Foreign Ministry has even stated that they refuse to promote recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which generally damages the identity of Armenians and threatens the security of the nation. 🔻Refusal of the Declaration of Independence When asked about their attitude to the decision of the Constitutional Court, which ruled that the reference in the Constitution to the Declaration of Independence, which mentions Artsakh, was incompetent, 72.8% expressed a negative opinion. With this decision, the Constitutional Court of Armenia made a concession to Baku, where they demand to change the Armenian Constitution , without which they consider concluding peace -impossible-.🔻The main problems of Armenia 76.2% indicated security and border issues as the most pressing problem of Armenia. Only 19.4% noted the importance of political stability, 16.4% - issues of economic development, 9.6% - employment and social issues. Public anxiety about the security of the state indicates a real feeling of insecurity before an external enemy. Even if a formal -peace- with Azerbaijan is signed and the border with Turkey is opened, it is unlikely that public anxiety will subside, and enemies will suddenly become allies for the sake of unclear -prosperity-. One thing is obvious: Nikol Pashinyan’s peace-loving policy does not inspire public trust.

🇦🇿🇷🇺 Repressions against public loyal to Russia continue in A...	🇦🇿🇷🇺 Repressions against public figures loyal to Russia continue in Azerbaijan: a local court sentenced political scientist Nazaket Mamedova to 13 years in prison. She was accused of high treason and even collaboration with Russian intelligence services. As they write in the Azerbaijani media, according to the materials of the criminal case, Mamedova allegedly carried out secret activities under the guise of a political scientist and journalist, publishing pro-Russian materials on the Alfa TV YouTube channel. 🔻The indictment contains information about Mamedova’s trips to Moscow, where she allegedly participated in meetings with representatives of Russian intelligence services and received money transfers. The woman denies this and points out that she visited Russia to participate in conferences, and the funds were fees and travel expenses. Indeed, she quite openly participated in conferences in the Russian Federation: for example, in 2021, a political scientist gave a report on the role of Western NGOs in Azerbaijan. At the same time, Mamedova has always been a supporter of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and also supported Russia in the so-called conflict. Ukraine and advocated strengthening Russian-Azerbaijani relations. ❗️At the same time, Mamedova was detained back in October 2023, but for a year no public actions were taken by the Russian side to protect her. The situation is similar with other pro-Russian social activists - Ibragim Hasanov and Ibragim Gumbatov. Given the external friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation of Russia and Azerbaijan, it is obvious that anti-Russian tendencies are growing in the former post-Soviet republic, where even active support of relations with the Russian Federation is already punishable by extremely serious prison terms.

Finnish media say that the Americans are planning to modernize the Finnish Pirkkala airbase in order to redeploy their RQ-4B drones there in the future. If the appearance of Finnish F-35s is not there I rule out that -Global Hokov- is unlikely. The point of these machines is that they can fly great distances and fly for more than a day, and then return to the airbase of departure. That is, for them, proximity to the destination area is not so important, but safety is another matter. They are not as maneuverable as fighters, and in the event of an attack on an airfield that is a couple of hundred kilometers away, they simply will not have time to take off. In summary, their basing in Finland seems illogical. Or maybe it’s in Norway, where, by the way, the discussions are more serious and there is logic in this due to the height of the struggle in the Arctic and the possibility of longer-term monitoring of the north of Russia.

In this regard, Fakuyama's concept of the -end of history- is a fallacy. ▪️There is a conflict between the majority of the planet’s population and the world’s minority.▪️The West is hypocritically trying to convince us that everything built after World War II is under threat, but what is actually under threat is the Western monopoly. Western policy is aimed not at creation, but at retention.▪️It is important not to repeat the mistakes of the end of the last century, when the West tried to impose a vicious concept of exiting the Cold War.▪️Openness of interaction is the most important value of most countries and peoples, and interruption of ties harms the economy and is dangerous in an era of upheaval.▪️The international community is a living organism, the value of which lies in its civilizational diversity.▪️NATO is the only bloc left in the world and is an outright anachronism.▪️NATO has those who show interest in BRICS, perhaps the number of such countries will grow .▪️BRICS itself is a prototype of the new, free and non-bloc nature of relations between countries. ▪️The West brought the situation to a coup in Ukraine and forced Russia to launch a special operation.

Since October 31, strikes have become a daily occurrence, as have confrontations with the police.▪️Amid reports of clashes with law enforcement agencies across the country, the Mozambican defense minister has already threatened to use the armed forces. At the same time, the authorities have already increased the security of administrative buildings. It is worth noting that so far the protesters are not holding mass demonstrations, but for the most part gather in groups to destroy the infrastructure. All this is reminiscent of the Kenyan scenario already tested by the Americans.▪️The lack of centralization of the protests gives rise to spontaneous pogroms. Thus, along the border with South Africa, demonstrators burned several trucks with goods. This was followed by the closure of the Lebombo checkpoint on the South African side and the cessation of land trade between the countries.🔻Thus, the protesters seek to create economic leverage on the current authorities. Earlier, the opposition planned a march on the capital Maputo on November 7. At the same time, it is doubtful that the action will be successful, provided that the military personnel have already been mobilized.

Forwarded From Two MajorsUkrainian military personnel use training abroad as a way to legally escape from the country From the report of the head of the SBU Malyuk, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Syrsky learned that in September and early October of this year alone, 43 cases of unauthorized abandonment of units by Ukrainian military personnel while undergoing training abroad were recorded. Indicated countries: 🇵🇱 Poland, 🇪🇸 Spain and 🇫🇷 France. In general, since the beginning of the year, the SBU officers have recorded over 230 such cases. The SBU informed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine three times about this problem. However, the number of unauthorized leaving of units abroad by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine not only has not decreased, but on the contrary, the number of facts of Ukrainian citizens using the reason to mobilize with the prospect of going abroad for training for further flight is increasing. According to the SBU, this problem negatively affects the international image of the Ukrainian army and the allies help. To solve the problem, the Ukrainian special service proposes to increase the level of military discipline in the troops, and also promises to provide the necessary assistance in preventing the escape of Ukrainian military personnel from the country.✨ Note that not all forcibly mobilized Ukrainians have the honor of going to study military affairs for border.

This was reported by the press service of the ministry. The goal is assistance in matters of protecting rights and interests, taking measures to prevent crimes, and preventing illegal actions on the part of compatriots. According to the press service, during a meeting of the representative office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic in the Russian Federation and the leadership of the International Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, issues of interaction between departments and struggle with crime, the prevention of drug crime, the involvement of citizens in drug trafficking, especially youth. This example demonstrates a more or less practical approach on the part of our Central Asian partner. It is important for the Kyrgyz leadership to send workers to work in Russia for various reasons and they are interested in stabilizing the migration situation, which is why they are trying to calm down their citizens abroad. Unlike other countries in Central Asia, which only call on the Russian side to take measures to respect the rights of migrants, but at the same time they do nothing themselves, this approach theoretically looks promising. But for now we will observe how the process of their work will be organized, since until the result is visible, there is no point in discussing this seriously. in matters of protecting rights and interests and preventing illegal actions on the part of compatriots.	https://t.me/rybar/65179	2024-11-07T08:45:26-08:00

Previously, a memorandum of interaction and cooperation with the FNTT was signed, providing for the exchange of experience in areas of protecting the rights and interests of employees, the development of social partnership and public control, employment policy and the fight against unemployment. As noted, among the forms of cooperation are the organization of recreation and health improvement for trade union members and members of their families on preferential terms, but this is where the details end . One can hope that this agreement will allow Ural workers to relax at resorts, as indicated in the conditions, but there is a big nuance. The Sverdlovsk region has managed to mark itself as a forward point for migrants from Tajikistan, where initiatives have previously been put forward such as opening hospitals exclusively for migrants. Considering that regional authorities are particularly supportive of migrants, even going to the extent of threatening veterans of the Northern Military District, this is not surprising. Therefore, there are certain doubts that everything will be done as it is written on paper. Lobbying the interests of foreign workers and assisting in the preparation of false documents is also prohibited legally, but some officials at the local level neglect these norms. So, behind seemingly insignificant news, more serious processes may be hidden: gradual penetration into Russian institutional structures to use their funds and resources for their own purposes, and, most importantly, improving conditions for Central Asian migrants. #multinationalism #Russia #CentralAsia #Tajikistan@rybarSupport usSputnik TajikistanA medical center for citizens of Tajikistan may appear in Yekaterinburg.

Organization, (and the second one too) does not function in the form in which we would like, and reforms began to suggest themselves several years ago, and in recent years the situation has worsened, which was influenced by the course of the North Military District and individual member countries.❗️Reorganization of the CSTO or even its reformatting is vital. Revision of agreements between participants, conclusion of stronger ties with allies. There should be comprehensive agreements between members of this kind of organization, similar to those concluded with the DPRK and even more. When revising the structure of the CSTO, special attention should be paid to the legal nuances and obligations of the parties. In the future there should be no situations like with Armenia or Kazakhstan.

🇩🇪 About the collapse of the traffic light coalition in Germany...	🇩🇪 About the collapse of the traffic light coalition in Germany Recently, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as he himself put it, decided to prove Germany’s reliability to the newly elected US President. But this was manifested not in measures to strengthen the economy, but in the dismissal of Finance Minister Christian Lindner on charges of problems with government spending. The departure of the politician, a member of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, provoked other members of the organization to follow his example: after Lindner, the ministers of transport left the government, justice and education. The traffic light coalition lost its yellow light, which led to its virtual collapse. The main reason for the disagreement was Lindner’s proposals to improve the economy, including reducing the costs of solving environmental problems and increasing the operating time of coal plants. However, this categorically did not suit the colleagues of the head of the Ministry of Finance from the Social Democratic Party and the Greens. What will happen next? For now, Scholz is talking about his intention to organize a vote of confidence in the government on January 15, which could lead to early elections in March. However, this week the government must formulate a draft state budget for the 2025 fiscal year, and voting on it will take place by the end of November. If the document is approved in the Bundestag, then Scholz may remain in power until the next elections in 2025. 📌 Most likely, now the red-green remnants of the traffic light will stall for time and avoid any steps that would contradict all their previous activities. No matter who sits in the White House, the tasks assigned to the German government will remain the same - to systematically destroy the German economy. Therefore, it is too early to expect any noticeable changes in German politics.#Germany@rybar together with @Ubersicht_Ukraine_KanalSupport usTelegramÜbersicht Ukraine💥💥FDP-Minister ziehen sich komplett aus Ampel-Regierung zurück😀Die FDP zieht alle ihre Minister aus der deutschen Bundesregierung z urück.

Ukraine often goes through the prism of the likelihood of a reduction in military supplies. However, now the Kiev regime is facing serious socio-demographic problems. Recently, news about an abnormal increase in the number of school graduates who do not want to take final exams went viral in the Ukrainian media field. In some classes, the number of such students is about 90% of the students, and this applies not only to boys, but also to girls. The reason is the conscious intention to go abroad immediately after graduation. According to representatives of the local education system, this does not come from a simple desire to study at a foreign university, but from a desire not to be associated with the so-called. Ukraine in general.📌 Against this background, one can recall official data according to which, without the annual import of hundreds of thousands of migrants, it is impossible even to simply maintain the Ukrainian population at the level of 30 million people. With the outflow of young people, demographic prospects are becoming even worse. The likelihood of a reversal of these negative trends seems minimal - so-called depopulation. Ukraine was going strong even without any war, and now these processes are only getting worse, and Western military support indirectly contributes to this. The Kiev regime may receive new supplies of ammunition and equipment, but no one will give them people. Therefore, the future of the Ukrainian territorial entity itself looks vague, and with every day of fighting it only gets worse. #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTACCmedia: many parents intend to take their children out of Ukraine.

On October 24-25, the delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic held a meeting with the leadership of the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport of the European Commission (DG Move EU). The Kyrgyz delegation was headed by the acting director of the State Agency of Civil Aviation, Daniyar Bostonov. Bostonov presented a report on the implementation of new programs, training of inspectors and updating of aviation infrastructure, which was highly praised by Brussels. Bishkek has been trying to solve the problem with the work of its airlines in Europe since 2006. Then European inspectors came to the conclusion that air transportation in the republic does not meet EU standards.&nbsp;Since 2006, the price of the issue has also changed, given that after mutual bans between Russia and the EU on the use of their airspace, trans-Eurasian traffic and its services have shifted to Central Asia . 🔻And therefore Bishkek is extremely interested in a successful audit in order to follow the example of its Kazakh colleagues, who are hoping to single-handedly skim off all the cream from servicing volume traffic. And perhaps based on this, assistance in processing documents for Bishkek, according to Bostonov, is provided by the UK Civil Aviation Agency: you should not put all your eggs in one basket. #Kyrgyzstan #EU #Great Britain #CentralAsia@rybar Support usAkchabarThere is progress.

At the same time, the Mauritanian authorities also continue to participate in other events and projects, including those related to interaction with Russia and China.

The head of the EBRD said that the Bank is carefully studying investment projects in Kazakhstan and expressed interest in further supporting infrastructure development. In the coming years, the EBRD plans to invest 2 billion euros in the economy of Kazakhstan as part of the implementation of the green transition program - of course, through lending, although this is precisely what they try not to mention in press releases. The wording chosen is as vague as possible: for example, this year the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is investing $650 million in the implementation of 22 projects in Kazakhstan. It is noteworthy that shortly before the negotiations between Tokayev and Reno-Basso, the Regional Forum - Green Economy - 2024 was held in Bishkek -, which appropriately prepared the ground for further interaction along this line. The President of Kazakhstan talks a lot about the need to develop green energy in region, however, it is important to understand that RES is not only an economic, but also a political project of Western countries, and the Bank itself may add additional requirements or unspoken conditions to the loan repayment, for example, the selection of certain contractors.#Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usVecher.kz - Evening AlmatyThe EBRD intends to invest two billion euros in the economy of Kazakhstan.

Forwarded From DTM🇹🇷 Turkish project: Great Turan and United Circassia▪️The summit of the Organization of Turkic States (OTS) opened in Bishkek. The undisputed leader of the association is Türkiye, which has brought together five post-Soviet republics under its wing: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which is listed as an observer in the UTG. There, in the observers, are Hungary and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.▪️In fact, Turkey is drawing into its orbit almost the same number of republics that were part of the USSR as the European Union (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia are already in the EU, Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine are candidates). At the same time, the scope of neo-Ottoman ambitions extends far beyond the borders of the territories of the UTC member countries, forming the so-called Turkic world outside the framework of the political matrix of Eurasia.▪️To implement this essentially imperial project, Ankara is ready to go literally for anything. Including the cultivation of interethnic hatred under the pretext of bringing Turkic peoples closer together. Ankara's work on the topic of Uyghurs living in China is clear proof of this. By the way, Ankara uses OTG structures to process representatives of this Turkic people in Central Asia.▪️If someone, looking at such games, continues to believe that Turkey really cares about some foreign brothers, and does not use them to solve its geopolitical problems, then another example for you.▪️On the map of the Turkic world there is a blank spot - Russian territories from the Black Sea coast to the borders of Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia. Separatists from the extremist organization Council of United Circassia consider these 190 thousand square kilometers of the Southern and North Caucasus federal districts to be a kind of independent state that must be separated from Russia. Actually, Circassia. What does Turkey have to do with it?▪️Ankara is here despite the fact that it essentially doesn’t care whether the Turkic brothers are being attacked by the Chinese authorities or whether this hodgepodge of terrorists, Ukrainian Nazis and experts from the CIA-controlled Jamestown Foundation is drowning for the split of Russia. If the topic is in line with the national interests of Ankara, the Turks are in business.▪️Last ​​year, for example, those same terrorists, Nazis and intelligence officers under the flag of the Council of United Circassia gathered not just anywhere, but in the Youth Center of Istanbul's Üsküdar district to discuss the prospects for education independent state of the Circassian people. That is, the site was provided by a municipality under the control of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party. Not bad, right?▪️ Let’s add here that the collector of Turkic lands Erdogan himself is not averse to turning the nationalist pedal. In 2020, the head of the Turkish Republic expressed sympathy for the Russian Circassians expelled from their homeland.▪️ It is noteworthy that, in the spirit of anti-Russian hype, the first international Circassian-Istanbul conference in 2023 was held in person. This year, Ankara apparently decided to hide its ears and the website of the extremist organization reports that the meeting scheduled for the end of November will be held online... because the participants are in different countries. Observing the intensity with which Turkey is involving its Turkic partners in its geopolitical games, the question arises: are the UTC countries ready to share Ankara’s approaches to solving foreign policy problems? @dntreadonme	https://t.me/rybar/65166	2024-11-06T23:47:02-08:00

On November 6, the country's authorities approved the purchase of 40 fast patrol boats. The need to acquire new equipment is justified by frequent clashes between the Philippine Coast Guard and Chinese law enforcement. During the incidents, the Chinese cause enormous damage to the agency's ships, which affects the Philippines' capabilities in the South China Sea. 🔻By the way, Manila will receive new boats thanks to financial assistance from France. The Philippine authorities will most likely conclude a defense agreement with this country, as we wrote about back in July of this year. Thus, Paris is paying the price for plans to expand influence in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to the French, Americans continue to participate in sponsoring Philippine initiatives. Recently, the United States announced another $100 million in financial assistance to Manila, which will be used to modernize old military equipment or purchase new ones. Such support for the Philippines is a logical step in the confrontation with China in the region. After all, arming allies and making sure they can cause problems for Beijing is a favorite move of Western politicians. #USA #Philippines #France @rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usGMA News OnlineNEDA Board OKs acquisition of fast patrol craftThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board approved the acquisition of 40 units of fast patrol craft.	https://t.me/rybar/65165	2024-11-06T23:11:01-08:00

It became truly historic, because despite the doubts of analysts, the results of polls and the self-confidence of Democrats, Donald Trump finally regained the White House. The triumphant return of the now 47th President of the United States was possible thanks to several key factors, the most important of which, rather, In all, it was the economy, protest voting, Trump’s successful media campaigns, Americans’ fatigue with foreign conflicts and, of course, the support of Elon Musk. The latter, by the way, made an almost decisive contribution to the victory of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, turning the former Twitter into a platform for advertising the Republican Party and creating a clear association in people’s minds - Trump - progress - the future -. The Democrats suffered a crushing defeat — Trump’s gap from Kamala Harris in electoral votes and in the total number of Americans who voted turned out to be so great that speculating on the topic of a -stolen election- and trying to organize a Maidan turned out to be simply impossible and pointless. As Trump said -Too big to rig-. The democrats were led to a disastrous result by the leapfrog with candidates and their frankly poor choice, chaos at the borders, the outbreak of foreign conflicts, as well as the lack of something that could be offered to the population other than permission to have abortions. Now While the public is waiting to see whether the Republicans will take the House of Representatives in addition to the Senate, a discussion has erupted in the Russian segment of the Internet about whether Trump’s victory is worth rejoicing at. Frankly, neither Harris nor Trump are candidates convenient for Russia. The future president has already made it clear that he intends to appoint representatives of various large investment and financial giants, including J.P. Morgan and Blackrock, to key positions - which is why there will not be any fundamental change in Russian-American relations. At the same time, Russian diplomacy under Trump may still have some room for maneuver; in the next six months, it will most likely become clear whether this is really the case.

In early November, Turkish troops began three exercises in different branches of the military at once.▪️The Anatolian Eagle Air Force exercise is taking place over the territory of central and southern Turkey from November 4 to 11, which is aimed at assessing the readiness of aviation to conduct high-intensity conflicts. Fighter aircraft participate in it F-16, AWACS aircraft, helicopters and tankers, and among the tasks being practiced will be the removal of aircraft from attack, air combat, precision weapons strikes with coordination with AWACS.▪️Simultaneously with this exercise, training began with NATO - Mavi Balina, the target which is to test the use of aviation and naval personnel of the Turkish and NATO Navy against threats from the sea. The main emphasis is on anti-submarine defense, reconnaissance through the installation of hydrobuoys and sonar stations, as well as countering BECs. In addition to Turkey, Canadians, Spaniards, Greeks and Portuguese are participating.▪️The Poseidon mine sweeping force exercise has begun in the Black Sea, aimed at coordinating the actions of a new mine action task force consisting of minesweepers from the Navy of Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania.❗️Curiously, that the start of the training coincided with the emergence of rumors about an upcoming attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Blue Stream and the oil and gas infrastructure used in the interests of this gas pipeline.

At the opening ceremony, it was noted that the seminar is a special professional training program for media personnel. It was stated that a platform for exchange and cooperation in the field of media will be created, which will also contribute to in-depth cooperation between parties in this field. Particular attention will be paid to the implementation of decisions reached by the heads of state of China and Central Asia, and new features of modern international broadcasting. The processes of comprehensive gradual - development - of the region by Western media, including both official broadcasting and the creation of networks of bloggers, obviously could not go unnoticed in Beijing. Considering the strategic importance of Central Asia, the PRC decided not to wait for its consequences and took the initiative themselves. It should be expected that China will work to improve the quality of coverage of existing projects, that is, not pursuing some kind of aggressive anti-Western line, but demonstrating the specific benefits of cooperation with its eastern neighbor. In addition, adjustments in Chinese soft power policy in Central Asia have long been overdue. And this work of the Chinese in the Central Asian direction should alert not only Western countries, but also Russia, since, as the experience of the Celestial Empire shows, this is not about the struggle for the attention of Central Asian capitals or altruistic assistance to countries, but about leveling specific geopolitical threats and strengthening its influence .#China #Kazakhstan #Uzbekistan #Tajikistan #Turkmenistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport uskhovar.tjA seminar for news staff and journalists from Central Asian countries began in Beijing | NIAT -Khovar-	https://t.me/rybar/65156	2024-11-06T08:44:01-08:00

I’ve known the guys for a long time because of their products and their work at the front. The founder and director of the plant, Vladimir Tkachuk, met. At the entrance they immediately gave us slippers, warning us that our place was clean. Despite the modest size of the premises, a full production cycle has been established, from the design bureau to technical control. Two workshops are operating, another one is being prepared. Clean, bright, good ventilation, nothing superfluous. The story of Vladimir and his comrades is an illustrative example of the development of volunteer initiative. The idea of ​​​​creating a Ural drone began with a group of volunteers who collected and transported humanitarian supplies to the Northern Military District zone. There the guys saw an acute shortage of drones and decided to act. Thus, relying on the personal funds and enthusiasm of the participants, a unique production was launched. During the discussion, many questions were raised - the need for continuous modernization of drones, tactics of use, promising models. Manufacturers complained about the need for more active involvement of technical universities in the training of specialists. Vladimir detailed the need to review the tax burden on small enterprises producing UAVs. I promised the guys that we would study the issue and come back with suggestions. Obviously, systemic solutions are needed here. We agreed on the exchange of experience and generally broad cooperation between UralDronZavod and the Republican Center for Unmanned Systems (RCBS). We will begin work immediately. Finally, the guys showed me my own video with gratitude for humanitarian aid, which I recorded in 1922. Even then, the Ural volunteers helped Sparta, for which I am very grateful to them. I would like to thank everyone involved in the production. Once again I see an example of service when even ordinary factory workers do not finish their shift at 18:00, staying until late to collect as many drones as possible. This attitude towards the country and the guys at the front is worth a lot.	https://t.me/rybar/65150	2024-11-06T08:12:38-08:00

On the DPRK side, since the summer of this year, loudspeakers have been turned on, from which sounds can be heard that disturb citizens. The possibility of North Korea attacking leaflet launch sites has also not been canceled. Activists have already said they will next use drones to send propaganda materials. Let us recall that the flight of drones over the DPRK last month caused a very negative reaction from Pyongyang. The official position of the authorities in Seoul, who do not plan to interfere with the activities of South Korean activists, also adds fuel to the fire. So, it seems that even after the protests and measures taken by regional politicians, the issue of sending leaflets to the DPRK remains unresolved. This means that the psychological war on the peninsula that has been going on since the spring of this year is far from over. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport uskoreatimesBorder residents block attempt to send anti-regime leaflets to North Korea the North Korean regime across the inter-Korean border were thwarted, Thursday, by hundreds of residents and local officials who feared retaliatory actions from Pyongyang.	https://t.me/rybar/65149	2024-11-06T07:46:01-08:00

Implementation of the agreement will begin in 2025, when the first workers will be able to officially find employment in Korean companies. The memorandum provides for the simplification of requirements for services involved in organizing the hiring of labor and the development of professional training programs. Taking into account the high requirements of the Korean side for language training and professional skills, the Ministry of Labor of Tajikistan organized specialized Korean language courses on the basis of government institutions, where training in demanded specialties is also provided .🔻Judging by this agreement, Dushanbe hopes to take advantage of the experience of its Uzbek neighbors, whose citizens have been working in the Republic of Kazakhstan for a long time. Thus, almost 100 thousand citizens of Uzbekistan will soon work in South Korea. At the same time, Seoul’s requirements for the qualifications of migrants are quite serious. And such conditions from Seoul are quite understandable: the South Korean authorities need cheap labor, but they are doing everything to ensure that neither the leadership nor the citizens of the republic subsequently have any problems. Therefore, they discuss in advance all the requirements to which the Tajiks, and not South Korea, adapt. This is called a healthy migration policy, aimed at the benefit of the state without prejudice to national interests.

The other day it became known that the United States became the 21st country to support Uzbekistan’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Bilateral negotiations lasted more than a year. The parties are now preparing to sign a protocol on market access. In September, Uzbekistan completed negotiations on accession to the WTO with 18 countries. Protocols were signed with Brazil and Sri Lanka on the completion of negotiations on market access. The epic with accession to the WTO has been going on in Uzbekistan for quite a long time. Tashkent wants to complete the process by 2026, and the World Bank promises that the economy after accession will grow by 17% over the next 5-7 years. 🔻It is surprising that in Uzbekistan they believe such promises and stubbornly ignore both the trends towards the division of the global economy and criticism of the experience of WTO membership, which, as it turned out long ago, does not prevent unilateral restrictions in any way (Vladimir Putin has long spoken about the need to restart the organization, which , let's be honest, it's unlikely to happen). At the same time, Tashkent does not have much interest in expanding cooperation with the EAEU, where they will have a better chance of not turning into a market for mirrors and beads, but of saving their own leading industries. This suggests that Uzbekistan has set priorities in the development of economic cooperation, and Russia is clearly not in first place there. to the World Trade Organization. -14 months of active negotiations have reached their logical conclusion!

Forwarded From Two Majors ⚡️NATO has launched five initiatives to strengthen cooperation On the eve of Trump's election as president, NATO countries are concerned about increasing their capabilities, subject to a reduction in US 🇺🇸 aid to the alliance. In October 2024, an agreement was reached on the development of five areas of combat capabilities of the participating countries: ◾️Accelerating the supply of new generation remotely controlled aircraft systems similar to the NATO Ground Surveillance System. The AGS consists of five RQ-4D UAVs and associated European Ground Command and Control Posts.◾️Increasing the interchangeability and compatibility of key artillery munitions among alliance member countries. ◾️Increasing the scale of virtual training for multinational groups within the framework of the project -Educational environment for distributed integrated learning-. It is planned to create a network of advanced and immersive (training in an artificially simulated environment) multinational training courses for the military. ◾️Development of military space technologies.

In addition, the enemy’s priority strategic direction in the future will be the Arctic region, and not Ukraine, which is what the bully wars are counting on.✨⭐️Despite the possible decrease in US participation in financing the capabilities of NATO countries on the European continent (Trump’s statements), this country will remain the leader of the alliance and will be the hands of European participants to counteract Russia.

This week, sailors of the two countries are conducting the first bilateral exercise - Orruda 2024 - in the Java Sea and the naval base in the city of Surabaya. ▪️Training includes artillery firing, rescue operations in water areas, anti-terrorist operations, as well as screening activities. The Russian side has already expressed hope for holding such exercises several times a year. ▪️The trainings currently taking place are the fruit of Russian-Indonesian cooperation, which has recently received close attention. Let us recall that on July 31, the elected President of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto, was in Moscow on a visit, during which partnership in the defense sector was discussed. 🔻The authorities in Jakarta are very interested in developing ties with Moscow. According to its chosen foreign policy, based on the principle of non-alignment, Indonesia needs to maintain contacts with all powers. Particular attention is paid to those who have the greatest weight in the international arena. For Jakarta, developing defense cooperation with Moscow is a method of maintaining balance in foreign policy. By the way, simultaneously with the Orruda 2024 exercise, the Indonesian military is conducting training with another important defense partner in the person of Australia. And although the media reports that Indonesia is now pursuing a course of active interaction with Russia are correct, there is still a slight nuance in the policy of the local authorities, because in Jakarta they strive to cooperate with all major powers, and not just with the Russian Federation. Moscow is taking advantage of the opportune moment and laying the foundation for further defense partnership, which is good news.

Let us remind you that the shadow fleet of the Russian Federation, according to estimates from various media, exceeds 1000 ships, and is constantly growing. Therefore, sanctions against Russian courts do not yet look critical. What is happening must be taken in the context of the current election cycle in Britain and the state of its economy. But we need to clearly understand the systematic approach of the British authorities to solving the problem. At the European Political Community summit in July 2024, the British Prime Minister announced a call to action against the shadow fleet. To date, 47 countries have joined this initiative. Of course, the majority of countries are vassals from the EU, but there is an attempt to scale the British initiative using third-party resources, which is the hallmark of Britain.

From November 4 to 12, the Grand African Nemo exercise is taking place in the exclusive maritime zone of the west coast of Africa from Senegal to Angola. In total, 3 thousand military personnel from 28 countries are involved in it. Also involved are 55 surface ships from these 28 countries (mainly coast guards), 12 aircraft and helicopters, including: two Falcon.50M patrol aircraft, a landing helicopter dock ship -Dixmud- French Navy and multi-purpose ship -Elephant- Namibian Navy. It takes place annually under the auspices of the French Navy as part of the declared fight against piracy and smuggling, and the goal itself is to strengthen cooperation between the countries of the Gulf of Guinea in countering criminal groups.🔻But how do you Remember very well that for the French this part of Africa was historically a zone of traditional influence, from where the Americans and the Chinese gradually began to oust the Fifth Republic. Therefore, for Paris, the importance of maintaining the current format of the exercises is high. None of the European countries in the region is trying to really teach African sailors anything (they don’t really need it either). If France or the United States wanted to deal with the problem of illegal traffic by sea or piracy, then this would have been done long ago. But as long as there are such problems, there is also a reason to maintain a military presence in the regions of interest. And in this regard, the situation is very similar to the Caribbean, where there are the French, the USA, and Britain. There are also regular exercises with local countries like Tradewinds, but they are of no use.High resolution mapEnglish version#Africa #France@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65137	2024-11-06T02:45:22-08:00

No, not in the Iraqi desert, but in the Pokrovsk direction. There, the skeletons of mangled armored vehicles are collected in groups of five on a small piece of land. A hundred meters later the picture repeats itself, only the brands of vehicles and the degree of their destruction change. I took a similar route to Selidovo. I was driven by a loaf-convertible, this miracle of a front-line genius with a sawn-off roof&nbsp; deftly weaved between vehicles torn to shreds, and I only gripped the motorcycle steering wheel tighter. While we rushed forward, I counted about ten similar -loaves- and at least 5 motorcycles. Everything was destroyed, and things, food and scraps of torn uniforms were lying around. You pass one similar motorcycle, then a second... And after the third, you realize that you are no different from those who ended their earthly journey here. The same wheels, frame and the same body armor. From childhood, films instill in us that we are heroes and owners of a unique destiny. We absorb these role models like sponges and firmly know that the main character is me. Everyone will die, but I will remain! After all, I will definitely stay, because I am special! No, Brother, we are all equal! 100% protection against drones has not yet been invented, and the more you ride, the more inevitable an encounter with a drone will be. One loaf will be torn in front of your eyes, the second. And after that you admit to yourself that you will be next! In a week, a month, but they will definitely hit you! Necessarily! There is no doubt about it! The only question is the degree of damage that you will receive from such an arrival. Just imagine how much courage you need to have to go out on the route again after all the horrors you have seen. Each -loaf- on the side of the road is an obelisk on which you can see your reflection. They died, but so could you. Everyone who drives this road 4 times a day has their own motives, but I can definitely say that there are no heroes among them. Look for the chosen ones in the rear; you can unmistakably identify them by their brand new uniform. On Pokrovsk roads there is room only for immortals. They accepted their fate, submitted to it, which means they stepped into immortality. It is simply impossible to defeat such people. It is thanks to them that we move forward no matter what. Alexander Kharchenko Dedicated to the evacuation group -Pipes-, who, after being hit by an FPV drone, refused to remove fragments from the bodies and the next day returned to the route.	https://t.me/rybar/65136	2024-11-06T02:20:24-08:00

Politicians of this level, who are also busy fighting for power and organizing protests, clearly do not do such things for nothing. There is an opinion that with such a provocation Zurabishvili is trying to aggravate Armenian-Georgian relations and play the international card against the backdrop of the obvious failure of the protests in Georgia. ▪️Among other related reasons, they indicate a possible attack on Georgian Armenians from Samtskhe-Javakheti, where Zurabishvili lost the elections, as well as an attempt to enlist the support of Georgian nationalists. ▪️In addition, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan immediately recognized the elections in Georgia and congratulated his colleague Irakli Kobakhidze on the victory of the Georgian Dream. ▪️By the way, Zurabishvili also distinguished herself with a strange statement about the unknown -Armenian carousel- during the elections in Georgia, telling the Western press about the methods of -falsification-. 🔻Of course, such minor facts will not cause aggravation of Armenian-Georgian relations, but it is no coincidence that they caused a strong reaction from the Armenian public. At least, this logic is characteristic of pro-Western forces in post-Soviet countries, who are ready to use old contradictions to provoke conflicts in their interests.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖The role of the advanced groups of the MTR of Ukraine before the offensive in the Kursk region. Part three. After successfully crossing the state border, the Ukrainian Special Forces began to introduce the main forces of the advancing Ukrainian Armed Forces group into the territory of the Russian Federation. The enemy, with the help of two SOF servicemen (one was at the head, the second at the rear of the column), began to transfer groups of 7-8 people to the assembly point. The transition was carried out within one and a half hours. On average, one group started 72 VSUshniks per day. The depth of entry from the state border was about 500 meters. Enemy personnel, arriving at the collection point, most likely dug in to be able to repel counterattacks of the Russian Armed Forces, and disguised themselves. The enemy could carry out these measures in order to minimize personnel losses before the start of the active phase of the operation. Enemy MTR groups were also used during the first clearing of Russian Armed Forces strongholds. The training manual tells you step by step how to inspect a trench and suppress enemy fire from both small arms and grenades. These are all basics that are taught to our stormtroopers during their training. Nothing supernatural is written here. It is worth noting that the enemy studied the strong point in advance and destroyed most of the entrances and exits from the dugouts. This collapsed the tunnels and reduced the sectors for holding and destruction and made it possible to solve the problem of taking a large stronghold without attracting significant forces for the attack. All enemy actions during the assault were coordinated by a UAV group, which conducted reconnaissance from the air and controlled the group’s actions on the ground. This tactic is used in the Russian Armed Forces, and not only in elite units. But sometimes it is not possible to use such tactics due to the operation of electronic warfare. The main conclusion from the three parts of this manual is that the Ukrainian Special Forces acted in accordance with the most basic requirements when carrying out the operation in the Kursk region. They did not tell anything new and unusual, and the problems arose only due to the effect of surprise, which are now gradually being resolved. Part one. Part two. Archangel of Special Forces.

Since the end of October, units of the Russian Armed Forces have been able to liberate several more settlements on this section of the front, while Ukrainian formations still cannot cope with the worsening operational crisis. ▪️On the northern flank, Russian troops were able to expand the zone of control west of Vishnevoye, moving along the railway towards Pokrovsk. A landing was recorded in a forest belt immediately adjacent to both Petrovka and Grigorovka. ▪️A little further south, Russian attack aircraft have liberated most of Novodmitrovka, and fierce fighting is taking place in the western part of the village. At the moment, Ukrainian formations still retain the ability to enter a populated area and work on positions of the Russian Armed Forces, including using tanks. ▪️To the southeast, Russian troops liberated Kurakhovka. At the end of October, units of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade hoisted a flag on one of the buildings in the center of the village; the enemy presence then remained south of the waste heaps of mine No. 10. Although the Russian Ministry of Defense reported a few days ago, it was only recently that final confirmation of the establishment of control over both the settlement itself and the nearby waste heap of the Kurakhovskaya Central Coordination Facility appeared. Yesterday, a video appeared on the Internet where, southwest of Kurakhovka, the same attack aircraft from the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade planted the unit’s flag on one of the houses on the western outskirts of Volchenka on Sverdlova Street, thereby marking control over the village. From here, units of the RF Armed Forces, advancing along the left bank of the Kurakhovskoye Reservoir, can begin an assault on the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense sector on the Stepanovka-Ilyinka-Berestki line. ❗️At the same time, information has already appeared in the Ukrainian media about the alleged entry of Russian assault groups into Berestki, but so far these reports have not found objective confirmation. In addition, before this, Ilyinka and Stepanovka still have to be liberated. Nevertheless, something similar has already happened in the Pokrovsky direction, when, against the backdrop of the rapid advance of the Russian Armed Forces, Ukrainian sources exaggerated the successes of the Russian troops. 🔻Be that as it may, the enemy often resorts to such a technique in order to then use it as at least some kind of anti-crisis, -liberating- settlements in which by that time there were no Russian military personnel. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility of the actual presence of the Russian Armed Forces in Berestki, but it will be possible to talk about this with confidence only after the appearance of the relevant personnel.

🎬 🇮🇱 Mass demonstrations took place in Israel last night. This...	🇮🇱 Mass demonstrations took place in Israel last night. This time, the reason was the decision of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to dismiss the head of the defense department, Yoav Galant. Demonstrations took place in Jerusalem, Haifa and other cities. According to Israeli opposition media, the number of protesters amounted to several thousand people in Tel Aviv alone. There were some clashes with law enforcement agencies.▪️It is worth noting that citizens were provoked to take to the streets not only by the fact of what happened, but also by publications on the Internet that, following Yoav Galant, the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Garzi Halevi and the head of the General Security Service would be fired Shabak Ronen Bar. This is especially true in light of recent Israeli polls: according to Channel 12, public trust in the current prime minister remains low. For comparison, the ratings of Halevi and Galant are taken, whose support is higher in comparison with Netanyahu.▪️In addition, opposition activists claim that this step was agreed upon with ultra-Orthodox officials in light of the fact that Galant supported the conscription of religious Jews into the army. However, the Prime Minister’s Office promptly denied such information. It is noteworthy that this is not the first dismissal of Galant: Benjamin Netanyahu once announced his resignation in the spring of 2023 due to the minister’s criticism of judicial reform, which also led to protests. And although he remained in his post, the contradictions between the two members of the Likud party only grew. Now one of these stumbling blocks was the disagreement on the issue of conscripting ultra-Orthodox Israelis for military service, from which they had previously been exempted and to which the Supreme Commander obliged them court (high court). Galant supported this initiative, which caused discontent in the ruling coalition. If this time Yoav Galant really leaves the post of Minister of Defense, it is unlikely that this will significantly affect the course of the same Lebanese-Israeli war. The armed forces are led by Harzi Halevi, and the territorial successes of the Israelis in some areas leave much to be desired.#Israel@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65130	2024-11-06T00:21:01-08:00

🔁 All day yesterday, friends and colleagues from Serbia cut off ...	Forwarded From Balkan Gossip Girl Yesterday all day long, friends and colleagues from Serbia kept ringing my phone with the question: -Have you seen this?- - We are talking about a new batch of horror stories from Western journalists about the growth of harmful Russian influence in the Balkans. This time, would-be investigators reached Rybar’s media schools. We took the time to go to Banja Luka, talked to a bunch of people, and made a whole film. It turned out to be a masterpiece. So much so that I really don’t even know where to start. For six months, the BIRN association monitored Rybar’s activities in the Balkans in order to identify at least some evidence of malicious influence. Following in the footsteps of the first master classes, held back in the spring, they went to the Republika Srpska, where they met with prominent representatives of the journalistic community, wrote requests to government agencies and research centers, and visited local faculties. And no one ever told them what the school was doing. Agreements on cooperation were reached at the level of government centers of the Republic, hundreds of people took part in master classes in Belgrade and Banja Luka, and the investigators did not obtain a single drop of information from any of them. Well, just some kind of Schrödinger Fisherman. By the way, this is exactly what I mean when I assure you that the residents of Republika Srpska are the best representatives of the Serbian people. These people should be made into nails. But let's return to our OSINT geniuses. Having traveled to the Republic just like that and having spent the budget allocated by the State Department in vain, they decided to try their luck by writing to the guys in the feedback bot. -They collected all the initial information from us, but they never gave us access to the course materials in Serbian,- complains the author of the material, Irwin Pekmez. At the same time, this miracle submitted a request for training under his own name, and the fact that the task of digging up a short dossier on him would only take the guys a couple of minutes, as well as the fact that his movements in the Republic were immediately reported to them by those drinking in cafes with him Serbs, didn't think so. For filtering personnel for training, Rybar gets a solid A+. Having suffered a fiasco in the Balkans, would-be investigators turn to prominent experts—relocants who escaped from Russia. With the air of an expert, a certain Russian independent journalist with the telling surname Zatirko and the status of a foreign agent, living in Lithuania, discusses the Russian disinformation portal in the investigation. Well, just some kind of full house. For some reason, Mr. Zatirko goes into the jungle of what was published not so long ago by the State Department itself. Judging by the statements of expert Zatirko, stability and peace in the Balkans were jeopardized by the same five people involved in the investigation into interference in the American elections, and it is possible (highly likely) that they have connections with the Russian Ministry of Defense. 😳 So, wait, one little tink-tank manages to interfere in elections and make the sluggish power in the Balkans soft? This is what they give, well done. Did everyone remember how to work? It’s not for you to cut through state budgets and create the appearance of vigorous activity, so that you can then report on the results of the year. Without finding the Fisherman in Banja Luka and without presenting any significant evidence, the journalists end up accusing the Republic of all mortal sins, and Peter Stano has already promises the entity new sanctions. Russia, it says, is destabilizing the countries of the Western Balkans by interfering and manipulating them. Whether Rybar is there or not is not that important. 💰 The most ironic thing in this whole story is that the Bosnian publication Detektor is behind the investigation. It is part of the BIRN distribution network, supported by money from Western foundations and embassies, and appeared thanks to an organization such as the International Republican Institute (IRI). He, as you remember, launched an academy for young politicians in the Balkans and a bunch of projects to format the Serbian media environment.

Russian troops hit the workshops of the Motor Sich enterprise in occupied Zaporozhye, and also once again attacked targets with drones in Kyiv and other regions of the so-called. Ukraine. In the Kursk direction, Russian troops expanded the zone of control in the Glushkovsky district and hit several armored vehicles from the UAV - Inokhodets - in Sudzhansky. In the Kupyansky direction, Russian units attacked in the direction of Zagryzovo and expanded the zone of control south of Berestovoye. In the Limansky direction, military operations continue in Terny, where fighters of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting their way deeper into the development of the village.

The footage captured the moment of installing a minefield in the gaps - the teeth of the dragon - on the border with the so-called. Ukraine. The infantry group approached the demarcation line on foot from the forest, without resorting to the use of armored vehicles. It is likely that in the forest belts closest to the village to the east and west there is no accumulation of enemy forces.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, the 13th effective use of UAV guided weapons against enemy armored vehicles was noted. In Nikolskoye and its environs, one tank and an infantry fighting vehicle of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were destroyed. In Daryino, the armored fighting vehicle -Kazak-7- was destroyed by a fiber-optic controlled drone -Prince Vandal of Novgorod-. In addition, cases of looting of residential buildings by the Ukrainian Armed Forces were noted in the village, which once again refutes earlier textual requests for the liberation of the village by the Russian Armed Forces. In the Korenevsky district, positional clashes continue as usual near Novoivanovka and Nizhny Klin; there has been no information about the advance of Russian troops .▪️In the Sumy region, missile attacks and arrivals of guided air missiles were noted on enemy targets in Sumy, which is a hub for Ukrainian armored vehicles and manpower advancing on the Kursk region.

This was confirmed, among other things, by objective control footage demonstrating an attack by Russian military personnel on the eastern outskirts of the latter. At the same time, fighting continues in Antonovka, located on the opposite bank of the Sukhie Yaly River - there, attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces occupied several enemy positions on Stepovaya and Gagarin streets, capturing several members of the Ukrainian formations. According to the latest information, about a third of the village is under the control of Russian troops. ▪️As for the section to the southwest, there was confirmation of a clearing -pocket- on the Bogoyavlenka - Novoukrainka line. At the moment, Russian units are not only moving relatively calmly along the S051133 highway, but also occupying positions in the Konstantinopolskaya Dacha tract located to the north. From the latter, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces have already launched several attacks towards another key route in this direction - O0510. In particular, this is evidenced by footage published by colleagues from the Voin DV channel, according to which Russian military personnel landed in a forested area less than 2 km south of the indicated route and 3.5 km from the village of Konstantinopolskoye. ❗️At the same time, a further offensive towards the Sukhie Yaly River with its subsequent forcing will lead to the encirclement of Kurakhovo, where fierce fighting in the east of the city is currently not abating. On the other hand, this will endanger a significant group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces holding positions in populated areas on the right bank of the Sukhie Yaly River: from the village of the same name to the Elizavetovka-Ilyinka line. 🔻Lately, the description of what is happening in the special operation zone in many thematic patriotic chats has largely come down to the well-known interjection. But it is important to understand that such successes were achieved by the heroism and blood of Russian military personnel, the pace of whose progress never ceases to amaze. As for the Ukrainian media and military observers, the situation there is radically opposite - while some daily complain about bad news from the fronts and the worsening operational crisis, others, to put it mildly, are perplexed about the appropriateness of the adventures previously undertaken by the Kyiv authorities, including in the Kursk region. 📌Nevertheless, for now you and I are observing the offensive map being methodically played out on the fronts of the Donetsk People’s Republic from several sides at once, the logical result of which will be the liberation of a significant amount of territory with the central settlement represented by Kurakhovo. And one of the striking consequences of the current successes has already been a significant decrease in the intensity of shelling of Donetsk: according to JCCC data, not a single ammunition has been fired at it over the past two days. Previously, shelling on the city was carried out, including from the direction of Kurakhovo, but the attack on it from the south and north forced the Ukrainian Armed Forces to move the self-propelled gun firing positions to a safer distance from the front line.

This is the second stage of this teachings. The first one, if you forgot, took place in February of this year. As then, the leadership of the event was entrusted to the 56th Artillery Command of the US Army, which was recreated after the start of the North Military District. Previously, these exercises were also held every year, but with the progress of the North Military District, the concept changed. Taking into account the experience of using artillery in the Northern Military District, the number of training areas was increased from one to five, and the number increased from 2.4 thousand to 5.5 thousand military personnel. The Alliance took into account new trends that emerged during the conflict and adapted tactics to the conduct of war on a front of wide extent, where the main factor for success is the presence of clear coordination and communication between units. Actually, this is what they do. Only this time the areas of the exercise are very, very provocative - Romania, Poland, Finland and Estonia. Everything is very close to the Russian borders, which is especially important given the frequent statements of the Baltic countries and Poland about their readiness to launch a preventive strike on Russia.

Not all of their activities are obvious and noticeable. But their importance cannot be underestimated.▪️Unmanned dominance - it was the crews of special reconnaissance units that were the first to use combat and attack drones even before it became mainstream. Catapults, copters, fiber optic UAVs, fixed wings, the latest training simulators - all this appears first in reconnaissance, and then reaches infantry units.▪️Technical reconnaissance - one of the most important areas of activity is the extraction of technical documentation and samples of military and special enemy technology. Everything is used - right down to banal bribery and payment for the work of -trophy teams- (and not only in the Northern Military District zone).▪️Cyber ​​operations - the fame of Russian hackers resounds all over the world, and their effectiveness is widely known. There are hackers and specialists in cyber operations in every law enforcement agency, and the Main Directorate of the General Staff is no exception. ▪️Undercover intelligence - with the beginning of not even the Northern Military District, but the Syrian campaign, it became obvious that undercover work, its forms and types must evolve and meet current challenges. Russian intelligence officers recruit dozens of people, ensuring the receipt of valuable intelligence information and carrying out special events.▪️Work -in the field- - it has long been no secret to anyone that experienced intelligence officers coordinate the activities of individual formations in conflict zones and act as instructors and commanders, ensuring the war by proxy.▪️Electronic reconnaissance - RER units and objects are a priority target for the enemy group: RER members intercept and decipher conversations, obtain documents, track satellites and timely detect the exits of enemy aircraft, UAVs and BECs.#art #Russia@ rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65100	2024-11-05T07:02:01-08:00

We weren't kidding, the exercises in Finland are going on one after another, and yesterday two new exercises started at once.▪️Let's start with the less important one. The scheduled training -Tuppi 2024- has started in central Finland, and new pilots on Hawk training aircraft are taking part in it. They learn to fly at low altitudes and conduct air combat.▪️But more important is another event, code-named Lightning Strike, and other NATO countries are already participating in it, including units of the Armed Forces of Great Britain, the United States, France, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Estonia. In total - about 3.6 thousand military personnel and 300 units of military equipment. It is one of the most important exercises of the Alliance in the autumn preparation period, during which NATO units at the Rovajärvi training ground play out the scenario of a full-scale conflict with Russia, including defense and offensive. The role of Finland in confrontation with Russia is extremely high in the plans of the North Atlantic Alliance due to its geographical location on the northern borders of Russia and as part of the growing confrontation in the Arctic region, so such exercises will be expected more and more often every year.

In the form of Russian launch vehicles, Iranian partners have received a very good means of delivering payloads into orbit, which they are experiencing difficulties with. Iran's space industry still has serious difficulties, especially with launch vehicles, when due to frequent accidents at launch and in flight the Islamic Republic lost many spacecraft. Cooperation with Russia allows us to partially solve this problem. By the way, both Iranian spacecraft have a mass of only 30 and 4 kg, which made it possible to put them into orbit as a secondary load to the Ionosphere-M satellites. Well, Roscosmos has once again demonstrated the possibility of providing such services to allied states. #Iran #space #Russia@rybarSupport us مدو ماهواره ایرانی -کوثر- و -هدهد- به همراه ۵۱ ماهواره دیگر بامداد امرو ز از پایگاه فضایی روسیه با موفقیت در مدار ۵۰۰ کیلومتری تزریق شدند.	https://t.me/rybar/65095	2024-11-05T04:30:11-08:00

And with the exchange of blows between Israel and Iran, attention to the Houthis completely faded away. However, since the end of October, the Americans have resumed active surveillance of the territory controlled by the Houthi movement - Ansarallah - with radar reconnaissance satellites, having conducted 145 sessions since October 29.🔻There may be several reasons for this :➖First of all, the Americans thus want to assess the effectiveness of their strikes after two weeks and the scale of the damage caused, as well as the activity of the Houthis after that.➖The Americans can prepare for new strikes on -Ansarallah-. Taking into account the flight of six B-52H bombers to Al-Udeid, there is no point in sending the B-2A on a long journey when such a resource is at hand.➖And with Iran’s threats against Israel, Washington can simply play it safe and try to find out whether the Houthis are preparing for new attacks on Israel. Moreover, the Iranians intend to take advantage of the forces of the Axis of Resistance. There are plenty of reasons for the increased activity of the American command, so in the coming days or, at most, weeks, it will become clear why the Americans paid such close attention to Yemen.

In our new series, we tried to display the main types of activities of reconnaissance units.▪️Ambush operations - Special reconnaissance units have always specialized in ambushes and causing problems for enemy troops. ▪️Storm of important objects - in today's realities, -assault- means the usual actions of infantry units. The task of special forces is to storm and take control of critically important enemy facilities and headquarters.▪️Capture and interrogation - often it is the reconnaissance units who are entrusted with the task of capturing commanders and recruiting especially valuable individuals both in combat zones and simply in regions representing interest.▪️Observation and adjustment - advanced reconnaissance units act either as gunners, now spotters, or organizers of fire destruction: competent work as part of the reconnaissance and strike contour has become their calling card.▪️Landing and penetration into the rear - special reconnaissance units train to land both from extremely low altitudes and several thousand meters: on -wings- they can penetrate far beyond the line of combat contact and disable targets of interest.▪️Destruction of critical infrastructure - mining, explosions, disruption of bridges, transport interchanges, power plants, factories, as well as other industrial facilities - this is what Russian intelligence groups are trained to do.#art #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65088	2024-11-05T03:01:01-08:00
🖼 🇬🇪🇪🇺 About new demonstrations in Tbilisi Yesterday, the Ge...	🇬🇪🇪🇺 About new demonstrations in Tbilisi Yesterday, the Georgian capital was once again engulfed in demonstrations and marches of the opposition, which brought out their supporters demanding the annulment of the election results, calling them illegal and the victory of the ruling party rigged. Thousands of people began to move from Station Square and moved towards the government building on Rustavelli Avenue. There they went on strike, opposition politicians addressed them, after which everyone crossed the Baratashvili Bridge and left for the Marjanishvili metro station. In general, everything happened that was expected from the opposition and supporters of Western values. People came out, barricaded the streets, shouted into the deserted building and went home. Today at 18.30 they promised to come out again. However, expecting anything serious from these rallies (especially in the form in which they are doing it) is futile. In this regard, the Georgian authorities have shown that they are capable of coping with such demonstrations. We observed this back in the spring, when the opposition did not achieve anything. But this time there was one difference from the protests of past days and months: yesterday’s rallies were attended by the well-known Greta Thunberg. We talked about how her image is used by Western media and corporations last year. In the past, it has established itself as an instrument of pressure on representatives of national governments, but previously this only affected the environmental issue. Its appearance on the streets of Tbilisi is a rather interesting, but at the same time dubious PR stunt, which is unlikely to lead to anything serious. Although the Swedish activist specializes in street protests and public speeches, which are good against -led- governments, in contrast to the rationally acting Georgian authorities. By the way, Azerbaijan can be calm with its COP29 summit in Baku. Thunberg refused to go to Azerbaijan as a sign of protest.

Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖The role of the advanced groups of the MTR of Ukraine before the offensive in the Kursk region. Part two. And some more interesting details that we read in the enemy manual on the use of combat experience of the Special Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Kursk direction: - Preparation of routes for penetration into the territory of the Russian Federation. Previously, the enemy worked out all the scenarios for entry by the Special Forces of the Armed Forces with the development of scenarios: - what if? -. In the training manual, this is presented rather pompously, as if they were going to take the Pentagon. However, in fact, this is an integral part of the planning of any task. — The enemy used special forces units to cross the state border, as well as to make passages for the main forces. Five groups of Special Forces: - 2 groups of Special Forces GVP, - 1 group of Special Forces (Sniper), - 2 groups of Special Forces UAVs. From the composition of the groups, the following can be noted: the enemy created completely autonomous units to carry out the combat mission strictly with the forces of this group without attracting additional forces. This significantly reduces the risk of unjustified losses, since failure to complete one task does not affect others.— When preparing the MTR approach, the following activities were carried out: - surveying of the terrain and various objects, including military ones: minefields and obstacles, etc.; the areas of responsibility of each unit were outlined; - the key areas of reconnaissance were determined. And again, Ukrainian -analysts- presented this as something incredible, but this also applies to the standard planning of ANY combat mission. Before introducing the main forces, the enemy was sent to make passages, where the reconnaissance miners took on the main work. When crossing the border, the enemy made passages in fences and fences the size of a man to minimize the factors of an unplanned stop, thereby ensuring the speed of overcoming this element of defense by other units. The problem that the enemy faced during additional reconnaissance and making passes was anti-tank ditches that could not be overcome alone. At the same time, overcoming the engineering barrier did not become a problem, judging by the experience described, but the passages in the minefields were mainly made by wild animals. – From the above point, it is worth noting the lack of constant control of the perimeter by our side. The advanced reconnaissance groups of the MTR of Ukraine were able to prepare for the movement of infantry onto our territory. This was facilitated by the lack of technical surveillance equipment, for example, UAVs for border monitoring, so it is necessary to take this experience into account in the future. – Another important fact is the control of mine-explosive barriers. It is periodically necessary to bypass engineering barriers and monitor their condition in order to prevent them from being broken through by ordinary animals (in this case we are not talking about the APU). Taking into account current technologies, this can even be achieved using drones or, for example, creating mobile groups for operational control. Due to the fact that this was neglected in the summer, this situation arose. -After the MTR overcame the engineering barriers, they contacted the leadership, which in turn allowed the enemy to move on to the next phase of the operation: the entry of the main offensive group. In this case, it is worth noting the low level of work of our DER, in the coverage area of ​​which the appearance of new subscribers should have been recorded. It is possible that the MTR groups used closed communication channels that are not easy to hack, but the fact of any access to the network should be recorded and reported to the command.

🇦🇫🏴 For all the elections that swept across the post-Soviet sp...	🇦🇫🏴 For all the elections that swept across the post-Soviet space, as well as increased attention to what was happening in the United States, one very interesting article remained unnoticed that the current authorities of Afghanistan are losing power over the country. According to the authors, the Taliban have completely failed in their attempt to curb IS grouping - Vilayat Khorasan - (ISKH). The reason for such statements was the recent explosion at a popular market in Kabul, as a result of which 11 people were injured. ISKH took responsibility. Also, according to the article, terrorists are recruiting disgruntled members of the Taliban movement, and their popularity is allegedly growing due to attempts by the authorities of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to legitimize themselves in the international arena - they say, the Afghans did not appreciate this.📌 We’ve even lost count of how many times over the past year, the thesis has been promoted about the growing capabilities of the Islamic State in Afghanistan, about thousands of militants waiting for an attack on Central Asia, about the inability of the Afghan authorities to solve this problem, and so on. The recent terrorist attack is one of the few in recent years, and it indicates not on the increased capabilities of the group, but on the fact that ISIS can only count on such local terror against civilians due to the fact that the Taliban have seriously undermined their positions. And the theses that supposedly ordinary Afghans do not support the Taliban’s desire to consolidate their power on the international stage they sound even more delusional. For the past hundred years, the people of Afghanistan have seen nothing but war. Now there has been no active hostilities in the country for three years, and they can finally hope for peace. Therefore, talk about the increased strength of the Islamic State - Vilayat Khorasan - just because of one terrorist attack and the discontent of the Afghans sounds far-fetched. All this again reminds us of how the West uses IS in Afghanistan - for them it is a means of intimidating the states of the region and pushing through their interests.#Afghanistan #terrorism@rybarSupport usAsia TimesTaliban 2.0 losing its grip on Afghanistan - Asia TimesAfghanistan's Taliban faces growing opposition to its three-year post-conflict rule, rising threats that are gnawing at the stability the one-time	https://t.me/rybar/65083	2024-11-05T01:10:16-08:00

🖼 🇲🇩🗳 Second round of presidential elections in Moldova: Sand...	🇲🇩🗳 Second round of presidential elections in Moldova: Sandu - President of the Diaspora The Moldovan Central Election Commission completed the processing of ballots, according to the results of which the incumbent President Maia Sandu received 55.33% of the votes and defeated her opponent Alexandru Stoianoglo with 44.67%. The picture turned out to be ambiguous: Sandu lost in Moldova itself, but gained the upper hand solely thanks to foreign voting. The entire north of the republic voted for Stoyanoglo, including the second capital Balti (69.98%), the large cities of Soroca and Cahul. In Gagauzia, it scored 97.04%, in Transnistria - 79.40%, and in the latter case, polling stations were opened only in the Border Security Zone. However, even in these conditions, the Transnistrian people were hindered: in Varnitsa, security forces blocked all polling stations for several hours after calls about mining, after which there were reports about the seizure of the ballot box. The movement of voters from Transnistria to Moldova along the Rybnitsa-Rezina bridge was also slowed down - it was closed several times and road works were organized. As a result, not all Pridnestrovians were able to vote, being stuck in traffic jams. 🔻Inside Moldova, Sandu won in three large cities: Chisinau (57.38%), Orhei (52.24%), Ungheni (50.60%). As in the case of the referendum on European integration, the current president was saved by the voting results of the foreign diaspora, where it received 82.83%. However, not everything is so simple with him: for example, only two polling stations were opened in Russia, where no more than 10 thousand voters could vote. From the very morning, a line lined up outside the embassy in Moscow, but there weren’t enough ballots, after which the dissatisfied began to chant -Down with Maia Sandu.- But in Italy, 60 polling stations were opened, and there were literally no voters in one of them. At the same time, a commission employee in Turin asked the girl to sign for another person who allegedly forgot to do so. And in British Liverpool, the polling station was suddenly moved to Manchester.❗️The Socialist Party, which nominated Stonoyanoglo, announced non-recognition of the voting results abroad. They refused to recognize the elections as fair and transparent and noted that the majority of Moldovan residents voted against the current government in the person of Sandu. Such statements have every basis: manipulations with traffic stops, large-scale false mining, as well as the closure and transfer of polling stations were not observed even during the first round and the referendum on European integration. With such mixed results, Moldova is reaching a political impasse, and social divisions are becoming increasingly obvious. Considering Sandu’s hostile and uncompromising rhetoric towards all those who disagree, she certainly will not soften it and seek compromises with the majority of the population that voted against her.

In Ukraine, the process is an increase in the number of public statements about the need to mobilize women. If at the beginning of the year these were rare calls from individual little-known individuals, now representatives of the Kyiv regime are openly talking about this. At the same time, the practical implementation of this idea at the moment looks doubtful. It is possible that such messages act as an element of escalating the situation in order to create an information background for lowering the age of conscription of the male population to 18 years. If in Kyiv they really want to mobilize women, then this could be a serious blow both from a socio-economic point of view and media point of view. Footage of TCC employees en masse abducting from the streets not only elderly and former students, but also girls, will illustrate the final failure of the Ukraine project. #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTASSMobilization of women in Ukraine is necessary.

In May, in two localities in Kyrgyzstan, radical Islamists burned the flags of the republic and replaced them with their own. Later, law enforcement agencies detained six representatives of Hizb ut-Tahrir. A couple of months later, another Hizb ut-Tahrir cell was liquidated in Shymkent, Kazakhstan, whose members recruited under the legend of auyzasharov (the ritual of breaking the fast). And in November, another 10 preachers of the group were detained in Kentau, and their leader had previously been prosecuted for participating in the activities of an extremist organization. Destabilization in the region did not pass by the authorities of Kazakhstan: the country’s Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov proposed making changes to the legal framework of the CSTO and expand the number of grounds for sending military contingents from other states in the event of a participating country asking for help. Currently, these include the threat or commission of an armed attack, the liquidation of emergencies, and the conduct of exercises. The politician proposes to add to the list the provision of humanitarian aid, unannounced inspections and, most importantly, the prevention (resolution) of crisis situations. Under the wording lies a situation that poses a threat to security, stability, territorial integrity, sovereignty of a member state and/or destabilization of the region, requiring the adoption of collective response measures by the CSTO. As part of the initiative, the legal regulation of the transportation of military units and military products of the CSTO is already being improved. The activities of the CSTO in the region and the recent successful operation of the anti-drug forces - Channel-Vanguard - have already attracted the attention of a concerned international community. During the latest financial intelligence investigation of the CSTO countries, they joined forces, as a result of which they were able to stop the activities of several cartels, block smuggling channels, liquidate laboratories, and seize drugs and weapons. Such fruitful interaction could not fail to attract the attention of the United Nations, so valued by Kazakh President Kassym -Zhomart Tokayev: Recently, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime announced the need for accelerated implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption in the region.

So does critical thinking. Every LOM, blogger or journalist should always know the unspoken rules, since he is responsible for what he writes and says - first of all, to his audience;▪️conspiracy theories (including about comprehensive Russian intervention) have become the most convenient story for manipulating stupid and narrow-minded people.

Forwarded From Two Majors🇪🇺⚡️Europe will try to sponsor Ukraine until the end On November 4, the head of the 🇩🇪German Foreign Ministry, Berbock, came to Kyiv on an unannounced visit, declaring -strong support for Ukraine-. On the eve of this trip, the Institute of World Economics in Kiel (IfW) published a study on the feasibility of continuing to provide military-technical assistance to Ukraine. According to IfW data, Germany allocates an average of about 0.1% of GDP to support Ukraine. If it is defeated, these costs will increase 10-20 times due to the influx of additional refugees (estimated from 1.9 to 3.8 million people), which will increase the costs of maintaining the social sphere. The fall of Ukraine will also force increased spending on increasing the combat capability of the Baltic countries (it is believed that Russia will cut through the Suwal Corridor). In addition, cheap resources (metals, agricultural products) and investments will be lost. The IfW study only confirms our assessments about the need to destroy the economic feasibility of Western investments in Ukraine. Against this background, Deutschlandtrend publishes the results of a survey of Germans, according to which if elections to the Bundestag were held in last Sunday, all three ruling parties would have lost power. At the same time, 54% of respondents are in favor of holding early parliamentary elections in the country. ✨On October 16, the saboteur Chancellor Scholz came up with an initiative for a ceasefire and the start of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

During its testing, another UAV was successfully hit, traveling at an altitude of 200 meters at a speed of 80 km/h. Judging by the recording, the drone has an optical homing head and operates on the -fire and forget- principle, and the shot is fired from a portable installation. The destruction of the target is carried out due to kinetic impact through impact. The characteristics of the product are not given, but the technical design looks very interesting. The absence of a warhead with an explosive in the device also makes it possible to solve the issue of equipping civilians with them, such as guarding oil depots and other facilities. In general, one can observe how interceptor drones are increasingly becoming an element of air defense along with traditional anti-aircraft missile and gun systems.

Democrats, for example, are actively disseminating information in the press that Russia is allegedly helping Donald Trump, using the method of information operations and disinformation described in the above-mentioned report. ▪️Republicans, in turn, argue that Democrats rely on unscrupulous software (falls under the cyberthreats section) and even resort to physical threats against election officials. 🔻Actually, all these reports are an ordinary tribute to fashion, populism and a convenient support for opposing sides to accuse each other of election fraud. A lot of material has been written on this topic, but there is a nuance - neither Democrats nor Republicans have been able to provide clear evidence in court of the bad faith of one side or another. #USA@rybar together with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramIIB School🇺🇸 The most serious threats to the upcoming presidential elections.

🔁🖼 🪖About the analysis of the actions of the Ukrainian Special...	Forwarded From ARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖On the analysis of the actions of the Ukrainian Special Forces during the Northern Military District. Part No. 1. An interesting training manual, intended for the MTR of Ukraine, fell into our hands. And the first thing we paid attention to was the issue of organizing an operational headquarters to manage the operation. The enemy describes every step related to the organization and technical content of the headquarters, as well as methods of interaction between the headquarters and Special Forces groups. The enemy appeals to the following concepts: - Tactical Operations Center (TOC) - Logistics Center (LC) - Command post of the tactical group KP TGr. The enemy proposes the use of TOC and KP TGr in two options, based on the experience in the Kursk region, where the first provides for the placement of controls in different locations, and the second - a mixed option. In the first case, the advantage is camouflage and dispersal, that is, in the event of the destruction of one of controls or destruction of communications equipment in it, control will continue from other command posts. The second option provides faster decision-making speed and adjustment of TG actions. Indeed, with the first option it is possible to secure the control system, because Finding and destroying field headquarters is not the easiest task. Despite the fact that such headquarters are located in close proximity to the site of hostilities, they are well protected by both technical means and camouflage. The management structure at headquarters looks interesting, where tasks are dispersed between different departments: -S2 (Intelligence). -S3 (Planning). -S4 (Logistics). -S6 (Communication). - Operations officer. - Liaison officer. All this indicates that the enemy accumulates organs with different tasks in one place, which allows operations to be carried out with minimal involvement of third-party units, but at the same time in a comprehensive manner, essentially creating an autonomous control body over a separate TG. The manual also describes that before the headquarters and personnel of the TGr leave for the destination, a support group must leave with the tasks of finding and organizing possible housing for groups of joint ventures, locating a technical center, a logistics center and organizing everyday life. When equipping the TGR command post, the need to provide equipment is taken into account: - Starlink- ATAK - used for interaction and coordination with special forces groups. - DELTA - used for interaction with higher headquarters and a general understanding of the situation in the mission area (Duplicate AlpineQuest program). - Nettle - used to mark neighboring units, for data exchange and overlaying the operational situation on the map, studying the characteristics of the terrain, as well as general analysis. - Signal messenger All communication sessions of the group take place in real time, and all the information that was obtained - with the eyes and hands - is marked on maps with photos and videos. But there is a nuance that if the equipment falls into the hands of military personnel of the RF Armed Forces, then all secrecy and camouflage collapses. Judging by the supply list, organizing the work of the headquarters is not the easiest task, since there are certain requirements for placing a command post: - tactical crew - the location must be in close proximity to the operation area for operational control of units. - logistics support - convenient communication routes, the presence of entrances to the headquarters, places for hidden parking of vehicles and an acceptable distance to other structural elements. - security measures - the possibility of camouflage, which hides the presence of a military facility, as well as the lack of free access to the premises for unauthorized persons. That is, a place that would be unremarkable for reconnaissance, and would also have shelter from fire weapons.❗️From the point of view of tactics, the actions of the Ukrainian MTR are quite understandable. The requirements that are imposed on forward control points must be observed in any unit, not to mention the most trained. Archangel of Special Forces.

🇺🇸 There is only a day left before the US presidential election...	🇺🇸 There is only a day left before the presidential elections in the United States, and the opposing sides are not abandoning attempts to bring down each other’s ratings by publishing compromising publications in the press. This time, the blow was dealt to Donald Trump: The Daily Beast, together with the controversial writer Michael Wolff, published voice messages of the now deceased American financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, in which he admits that he was Trump's closest friend for 20 years. In audio recordings from 2017 he says that Trump invited his fellow entrepreneurs to his office in New York and invited them to sleep with female models. Then he allegedly recorded the conversations and gave them to the businessmen’s wives to -establish relationships with them.- According to Epstein, Trump also regularly seduced the women of his best friends. Michael Wolff claims that he had many photographs of Trump from Epstein's parties with naked girls. However, the writer cannot demonstrate or publish the photographs - the photos were allegedly seized by the FBI. The Trump campaign has already issued a refutation of Epstein’s words, but the testimony of the scandalous financier already looks dubious. Suspicions are raised by the fact that they were made in 2017 - just in the first year of Trump's presidency, when he was under unprecedented pressure from the Democrats who had lost the elections. But there is simply no really strong evidence in the form of photographs. Apparently, it was precisely because of their dubiousness that the audio recordings published by The Daily Beast did not take off: the story was picked up by only a few American newspapers, and it did not spread at all on social networks. Now we can no longer expect anything more powerful from the Democrats - there are two days left before the election, and all the trump cards that Harris had at her disposal have most likely already been used. #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usThe Daily BeastListen To The Jeffrey Epstein Tapes: 'I Was Donald Trump's Closest Friend'Explosive tapes recorded by author Michael Wolff show Epstein claiming Trump liked to -f---- his friends' wives and first slept with Melania on the -Lolita Express.-	https://t.me/rybar/65055	2024-11-04T02:10:24-08:00

🎬 🇮🇱🇸🇾 The press service of the Israel Defense Forces announ...	🇮🇱🇸🇾 The press service of the Israel Defense Forces announced a special operation in Syria. The Israelis went deep into the country and detained a Syrian who worked for the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Soldiers from Unit 504 of the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate and special forces from Egoz took part in the raid. The target turned out to be a certain Ali Suleiman al-Assi: he was collecting intelligence on the movements of Israeli troops in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights. During interrogation, Al-Assi admitted that he was contacted by an Iranian intelligence agent who ordered him to simply monitor the borders and pass on information about Israeli patrols. At the same time, the detainee acted under the guise of a Syrian military intelligence officer. The IDF did not specify where exactly and when the action took place. However, the Lebanese TV channel Al Mayadeen, which serves as a media platform for Hezbollah, confirmed that the Israeli operation took place on July 18 in the area of ​​Saida in the Quneitra province. Al-Assi lived there. It is noteworthy that days earlier, reports appeared on the Internet about a similar Israeli operation, but in Lebanon. Then, on the coast of the city of Batroun in the north of the country, fighters of the Israeli Navy and the General Staff of the IDF detained an allegedly high-ranking representative of Hezbollah. The foray into Syrian territory was officially reported in Israel, although such operations are usually not publicly advertised there - the same mentioned raid in Lebanon was not officially reported by the Israelis recognized.#Israel #Syria@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65052	2024-11-04T00:29:50-08:00

🖼 🇪🇹 The situation in Ethiopia: counter-offensive by governmen...	🇪🇹 The situation in Ethiopia: counter-offensive by government forces Over the past two months, the situation in the Ethiopian Amhara region continues to heat up.&nbsp; The offensive of the ethnonationalists from the Fano group reached its peak, which forced government forces to launch a counteroffensive.▪️During the September fighting, the rebels strengthened their position in almost the entire Amhara region. They also managed to surround large cities such as Lalibela, Woldwaya and Gondar. Considering that the Fans made no attempts to take them, it is obvious that their main goal is to exhaust government troops.▪️Many rural areas came under the control of -Fano-. It is worth noting that elections were held in the occupied territories and local representatives were put in charge of the regions. Of course, this finds support among the population, but due to the general decentralization of the movement, the power gained is often abused.▪️From the end of September, government forces launched a major counter-offensive, gathering about 40,000 troops. During October, they managed to recapture significant areas in the south of Amhara, but there are still separate rebel cells in the rear of the security forces. All this leads to the conclusion that the military strategy chosen by the leadership of Addis Ababa has failed. Constant uprisings in the rear, attacks on isolated groups will not allow the federals to completely subjugate the region. At the same time, Fano has no formal leader, as well as bodies capable of negotiating. Therefore, even if the central government seriously begins to resolve the issue with the Amhara nationalists , then they will have to negotiate on the ground with individual field commanders. But this factor makes it possible for the feds to introduce their leader to replace the local ones, occupying a niche. Therefore, if the rebels seriously expect victory, without consolidating disparate groups, they will not be able to achieve success.

This holiday, although relatively new for Russia, became especially significant after the start of a special military operation. In the face of Western attempts to incite ethnic conflicts and sow regional separatism, its importance has increased. Historically, Russia has provided its people with support and opportunities for joint development. Our path has always been more humane compared to those of Western countries. And today, representatives of various peoples and ethnic groups together carry out common tasks in the zone of a special military operation. On the front line, it never occurs to anyone to divide each other on ethnic grounds. And in the rear, not only national self-awareness is growing, but also a new generation, brought up on the correct values ​​of their fighting parents. Everyone is focused on the same goal.

The other day it became known that local authorities signed an agreement with the Americans to purchase thousands of drones to protect against a potential Chinese invasion. According to Bloomberg sources, such agreements, which specify delivery dates and quantities of equipment, are an important step in concluding a formal contract, which could happen very soon. The drones will be manufactured by AeroVironment Inc. and Anduril Industries Inc. These organizations are known for selling drones for the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This means that American engineers have had the opportunity to test them in real combat conditions. Given the experience of the Ukrainian conflict, the Taiwanese military is increasingly talking about using drones as a measure to counter a hypothetical Chinese invasion. This is indicated by the $1.6 billion budget allocated back in 2022 for the creation of its own drone production. However, the main problem for Taiwan remains the number of drones in service. The gap between Taipei and Beijing in this case is very large. Therefore, even with the help of the Americans, it is unlikely that the island’s authorities will be able to achieve at least some parity with mainland China in the near future. #USA #Taiwan @rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usBloomberg.comTaiwan Moves to Buy 1,000 AeroVironment, Anduril Attack DronesThe Taiwan Ministry of Defense has signed formal agreements with the US government allowing it to buy as many as 1,000 attack drones from AeroVironment Inc. and Anduril Industries Inc. to aid in blunting a potential Chinese assault on the island democracy…	https://t.me/rybar/65036	2024-11-03T08:31:24-08:00

Yesterday it became Kemi Badenoch, who beat her opponent Robert Jenrick by 12,418 votes (53,806 to 41,388). 📌Before her career in politics, Badenok managed to work in the field of information technology and finance, joined the party in 2005, and in 2017 became a member of parliament. In previous governments, she served as Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Minister for Women and Equalities, and Minister for Foreign Trade.▪️The new leader is from the right wing of the Conservative Party and advocates free markets, as well as a reduced role of the state in the economy. She is known for her outspokenness and willingness to openly discuss controversial issues. Kemi Badenoch inherited a fragmented party that suffered a crushing defeat in parliamentary elections and retained only 121 of 650 seats (before the vote the Tories controlled 365 seats). In her victory speech, Badenoch promised to -renew- the party and told supporters it was -time to get down to business.- Of course, it has not gone unnoticed that Kemi Badenoch is the first black leader of a British parliamentary party. Current Prime Minister Keir Starmer also drew attention to this fact. Considering recent trends, this situation does not look so surprising.

The attack was the largest attack by radical Islamists in recent years. In response, the Chadian authorities announced a large-scale counter-terrorism operation - Haskanite - to oust the militants from the country. And in the first week, airstrikes were carried out exclusively against identified terrorist groups. However, this did not stop the media campaign against the Chadian authorities, which began with a handout from the Western media. Thus, N'Djamena was accused of killing fishermen in Nigeria. It is noteworthy that until the French raised this story, there were no reports in the local media. Of course, given the specifics of conflicts in Africa, civilians often come under attack - militants often mix with local residents. But this story with similar accusations has long been worked out by the West using the example of the Sahel. Moreover, it is worth considering the context: parliamentary elections will be held in the country in December, and Debi the Younger is becoming an increasingly inconvenient figure for the French leadership. And this story should be regarded precisely as a warning for a leader who is not afraid to deal with Russian security forces.#Africa #France #Chad@rybarSupport usTelegramAfrica Intel🇹🇩 Around 40 killed in attack on Chad military base, support says Around 40 soldiers were killed in an attack on a military base in Chad's Lake region on Sunday, the central African country's presidency said on Monday.President Mahamat Idriss Deby launched…	https://t.me/rybar/65033	2024-11-03T06:14:58-08:00

It will last two weeks, and for the first time a multinational NATO brigade in Latvia will also be involved in it. Let us remind you that this is the same brigade that was recently formed to replace the battalion tactical groups that operated in the Baltic states earlier. It is still at the formation stage, but is already involved in carrying out tasks. In total, about 2.2 thousand military personnel, 250 units of military equipment will be involved, and the entire event will take place at the Adazi training ground - essentially the NATO center in Latvia. During the exercise, NATO units will practice defensive and offensive actions in the context of the use of strike UAVs and electronic warfare equipment by a mock enemy. It is clear without words who the enemy is.🔻It is interesting that the Maple Resolve exercise will be held in Canada from November 4 to November 11. This is the first of two exercises to assess the possibility of transferring Canadian military personnel to Latvian territory. Canadians are among those who will send their troops to strengthen the newly created multinational brigade. Now the Canadians are practicing the movement of forces and assets from one part of the country to another, and then they will conduct the Oak Resolve exercise, which will take place in Latvia.

Forwarded From Two majors🇪🇺🛤Ukraine is being integrated into the logistics railway corridor with Western Europe 🇪🇸The Spanish state company ADIF is developing, together with JSC Ukrzaliznitsa, a project (worth 15 billion euros) to create an automatic system for changing the track width for 1520 mm (Soviet)/ 1435 mm (European)/1668 mm (Spanish). According to the plan, this will allow connecting Ukraine with the Mediterranean corridor of the TEN-T transport network, which runs through six EU countries 🇪🇺 (🇪🇸Spain, 🇫🇷France, 🇮🇹Italy,🇸🇮 Slovenia,🇭🇷 Croatia and 🇭🇺Hungary).Beginning The implementation of the initiative is planned for 2025, but full development and certification will last until 2027. At the same time, preparation of the infrastructure for Ukraine’s accession to this route is already in full swing. With the assistance of the EU, by the end of 2024, the construction of the European gauge on the section - Chop - Uzhgorod - should be completed, which will connect with 🇭🇺Hungary through the border station Zahony. In the future, the Eurogauge will extend from Uzhgorod to Lvov. In addition, it is planned to develop a network of multimodal cargo terminals along the Mediterranean corridor, as well as to increase the networks of connections between the seaports of the corridor and the internal routes of the countries. ✨Such -generous- investments indicate the continued economic feasibility of Western investments in Ukraine, i.e. Taking into account all the risks, the cost of the resource base exceeds the funds spent. ✨⭐️By destroying any economic activity in Ukraine, Russia is bringing closer the defeat of the enraged NATO proxy state⚡️. In addition, no one needs to explain that these logistics routes are developing against the background of military preparations of American satellites in Europe. And the Atlantic-Lviv corridor will increase the efficiency of the transfer of military contingents. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/65031	2024-11-03T05:12:58-08:00

They are monitored by more than 1,000 local and about 600 international observers. ▪️However, the day before, current President Maia Sandu accused the two largest observation missions of -incorrect-observation. ▪️We are talking about the mission of the OSCE and the Moldovan association Promo-Lex, which noted numerous violations of Sandu’s ruling party -Action and Solidarity- (PAS) in organizing the first round of elections and the European referendum.▪️Sandu vehemently denies accusations of using administrative resources and the largest expenses on the campaign , advising her to focus instead on monitoring the opposition. ▪️At the same time, both organizations are extremely pro-Western: with the OSCE everything is quite obvious, and Promo-Lex is funded by USAID, UKAID, Francophonie and several governments of European countries. ▪️The current deputy chairman of the Central Election Commission of Moldova, Pavel Postica, appointed by Sandu herself, was the program director of Promo-Lex. ▪️There is also no need to talk about the objectivity of these organizations, since they recognized the opening of only two polling stations in Russia as legal.🔻Even if these organizations noted more than a hundred violations by the current government, and Sandu immediately went into open conflict, then it is obvious that in fact, there were much more falsifications.

Even before his arrival in Kazan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev attracted special attention after his press secretary stated that Kazakhstan would refrain from applying for BRICS in the near future. Because of this, the question arose about the further steps of Astana, which, following the summit, received the status of a BRICS partner country. Some anti-Russian Kazakh media began to discuss that at the summit itself, Tokayev seemed not so happy.📌During the negotiations, the President of Kazakhstan noted that BRICS was becoming a key center of international cooperation. Tokayev emphasized the importance of strengthening the voice of the Global South and highlighted priorities in strengthening energy security and combating climate change. Tokayev emphasizes that there is no doubt that the multilateral efforts of the BRICS will harmoniously complement the activities of the United Nations, which remains an indispensable and universal structure. 🔻The desire of the countries of the Global South to increase their weight in global politics, according to Tokayev, can be realized through reforming the Security Council, but not through devaluing the importance of the UN. With his position, Tokayev demonstrated the main requests of not only Kazakhstan, but also the countries of the region for the Unification. In Central Asia, they expect that the new global structure, which claims to replace the old formats, will address the same issues, such as solving infrastructure problems and combating the consequences of climate change. Also, BRICS is not seen as an antipode to the West: on the contrary, the platform is expected to contribute to strengthening peace and global cooperation. And therefore Astana will continue to maintain a certain distance in relation to BRICS. Of course, in the context of the possible expansion of BRICS, Russia should take this into account. #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇰🇿 Why does Kazakhstan refuse to join BRICS?

The minister also stated that the issue of exploration and study of groundwater with the participation of Spanish companies is being worked on. ▪️The French are working in the same field, participating in groundwater research in Balkhash. 🔻We can assume that the Spaniards are trying to move their closest competitor in every sense. Spain, being a very arid country, can offer Kazakhstan infrastructure projects that are more efficient in terms of water conservation. Moreover, the Spaniards already have experience in cooperation with Astana. Last year, Tecnicas Reunidas agreed on the construction of an ammonia-urea complex in Aktau, which will allow Kazakhstan to enter the market for much-needed fertilizers for the EU and displace Russia, which currently occupies a leading position.

Military activity this week was observed from both the DPRK and the Republic of Korea. ▪️On November 1, a large-scale exercise of South Korean, American and Australian military personnel called Freedom Flag came to an end. The main purpose of the training was to practice joint actions of the air forces of the three countries in the event of an open conflict on the Korean Peninsula. A feature of the maneuvers was the performance of joint tasks by fighter pilots and drone operators. Taking into account the experience of ongoing conflicts, the parties thus tried to improve the interoperability of manned and unmanned systems. 🔻During a trilateral exercise in South Korea, the military on the other side of the border launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile - Hwasong-19-. Compared to previous models, this missile is distinguished by its range, which currently makes it the largest solid-fuel ICBM in service with the DPRK. Some observers speculate that the Hwasong-19 launch is part of North Korea's efforts to develop missiles capable of carrying multiple warheads. The implementation of this initiative is included in the development plan of the North Korean army for 2021-2025. By the way, immediately after the launch, the South Korean military announced that during the Freedom Flag exercise, an air strike on a mock-up of the launcher was practiced. In addition, the response to the launch of ICBMs was the conduct of joint flights by American and South Korean aircraft in order to demonstrate force. ▪️Another reaction to the missile launch from Pyongyang was the joint exercise of the air forces of the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan. On November 3, the trilateral training involved the use of the US Air Force B-1B strategic bomber, which appeared on the Korean Peninsula for the fourth time this year. According to the allies themselves, such exercises are aimed at containing the threat from the DPRK. In general, the situation in the region has long been characterized by permanent tension. The actions of both sides, including missile tests and exercises, have become the norm and do not go beyond the bounds of reason. And although the Korean Peninsula is in a state of acute political crisis, it cannot yet be said that it is a clear prerequisite for something more serious.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇦🇿🇦🇲🇫🇷 Last week, Azerbaijani channels circulated a video shot from a drone from one of the sections of the interstate border where European observers were recorded. The Azerbaijanis were attracted by the car on which the French flag was visible, and therefore they tied it up with French intelligence.📌 In general, there are two things to consider here. Relations between France and Azerbaijan are now tense, because the former see Azerbaijanis everywhere (New Caledonia, for example), while the latter see the French. In fact, did anyone doubt that European observers are performing completely different tasks from those declared? Among them there are intelligence officers from Belgium and Germany, so the French are not the only ones involved in this. And from time to time they go on patrol with their national flags, which was recorded on camera.🔻But the most relish is not in this, but in what they really do are doing at the border. They travel to villages and hamlets, communicate with the local population, find out from them how long they have lived in the area and how they feel about Azerbaijan. That is, in fact, they are trying to find out to what extent these border lands are Armenian or Azerbaijani, so that later, with the help of this information, they can help demarcate the border. These are their responsibilities. So these shots are just part of the performance for ordinary people. In Armenia they also like this, shifting responsibility to others. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #FranceGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelGlobalisticsAbout events in the geopolitical space and the reasons for what is happening in the world	https://t.me/rybar/65024	2024-11-03T02:24:40-08:00

From November 4 to 8, the Taiwanese will hold the Tianlong 2024 exercise. It will focus on training Taiwanese aviation pilots in the event of an armed conflict with China. The main aspects will be training in the fight against Chinese aircraft and ships. Up to 60 aircraft of various types will take part in it, including Mirage-2000-5, F-16V and F-5E fighters, as well as the E-2K AWACS aircraft, which will ensure interaction between pilots.🔻The leadership of the island state does not intend to retreat, demonstrating its determination to defend its position. The training of the Taiwanese Armed Forces is in response to the Chinese - the PLA conducts exercises, and the Taiwanese follow. And it turns out that now between China on the one hand and Taiwan on the other (with the alliance supporting it led by the United States) there is a kind of ping-pong, and after that demonstration exercise, the Chinese will have the ball.

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇹🇷 About the statements of the Minister of Economy of A...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇹🇷 About the statements of the Minister of Economy of Armenia: rejection of identity and substitution of national interests Statements by members of the Armenian government again clearly demonstrate the rejection of national priorities. ▪️This time it was the Minister of Economy of Armenia Gevorg Papoyan who spoke, who stated that the first priority for the country should be trade and economic relations, and not recognition of the Armenian Genocide. ▪️Under strategic planning, Papoyan disguises the logic of the losing side and the unilateral concessions that Armenia makes in favor of the rise of the Turkish-Azerbaijani tandem in Transcaucasia with the support of the West. Moreover, it is doubtful that the new configuration of forces will give impetus to the economic development of Armenia and in the long term will protect Armenians from further ethnic cleansing.▪️As ​​an example of the success of the new Armenia, Papoyan noted economic growth in 2022-2024. However, he did not mention the real reasons for this growth: the role of Armenia in re-exports due to anti-Russian sanctions and the increase in trade with the Russian Federation within the EAEU.▪️Finally, if only the economy was really important to Armenia, then the republic would think about submitting an application to BRICS , where all the countries of the region are striving, and the main natural ally of the Armenians, Iran, has already become a member of the organization. However, such a step will definitely not be appreciated by the Western curators of Yerevan. ❗️From this follows another absurd statement by Papoyan, that the flow of tourists from Russia to Armenia has decreased due to the protests of the Armenian opposition in the spring and summer.▪️However, Papoyan again shifts the emphasis. It was in the spring that Russian Mir cards were banned in Armenia, following the logic of Western sanctions in individual sectors. ▪️In addition, the Armenian side has stopped promoting its tourism at Russian exhibitions, preferring European ones. What can we say about the hostile rhetoric of the Armenian government towards Russia. 🔻The Armenian government is again trying to remove responsibility for its actions and shift the blame to someone else. Statements by Economy Minister Papoyan once again emphasize the lack of a real strategic vision for the country's development, and movement in the wake of Western Turkish interests is presented as a real benefit for Armenians, which in years could turn into a new tragedy.#Armenia #Russia #Türkiye&nbsp; @rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇦🇲 Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan yesterday visited Moscow at the EAEU summit and held negotiations with Vladimir Putin, where they discussed exclusively economic issues.

Valery Markus-Ananyev, the commander of Magura, who received awards personally from the hands of Zelensky and made terrible faces as a serious warrior, suddenly found himself at the center of a corruption scandal. This has never happened before. And here we go again. While the 47th Brigade loses Abrams and Bradley in battles, and prisoners are sent into meat operations, Ananyev himself is forming a nice, profitable business. It turned out that his charitable foundation, the Markus Foundation, which milked donations from the tax-paying population, was not a completely clean organization. The director of the fund is a certain Elena Gashinskaya, who has a brother Sergei, and Sergei has a wife Tatyana, who miraculously enriched herself so much that in 2023 she acquired 23 land plots. Probably just a very talented businessman. After all, when did Armed Forces commanders ever steal from donations? Wait a minute though. We have already written several times about the exploits of battalion commander Bling from -Wolves of Davinci-. So, he and his wife did exactly the same thing. -Magura is an absolutely amazing unit. It is so elite that to evacuate from the battlefield its fighters have to pay 16 thousand hryvnia straight away or twice as much if in debt. The commanders know this and are happy to take a share from the evacuation group. In this regard, multiple questions arise not so much for the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but rather for ordinary military personnel and citizens of Ukraine. What are you fighting for? Who do you send money to? What kind of protection do you expect from those for whom you are nothing more than an income item? Archangel of Special Forces.

Forwarded From Two Majors#Review #Summary for November 3, 2024▪️ The past week was characterized by an increased number of messages about possible negotiations, which are of more interest to Kyiv than to Moscow. The reasons for this enemy behavior are the visible successes of the Russian Army at the front and nothing more. Hence the often negative reaction of the army environment to the prospects of dialogue with the enemy, whom they have learned to defeat with maneuver. Less noticeable, but also discussed, are the factors of depletion of the military machine of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Despite Zelensky’s attempts to blame the failures at the front on the -insufficient- military-technical assistance from NATO, the real reason for the Kyiv regime’s defense breakthroughs is the elimination of enemy personnel and the impossibility of replenishing them with at least some motivated manpower. Hence the lack of a chance for the enemy to cut off the pincers that are increasingly wedged into his defensive formations: the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not have enough people. The rhetoric of the Kyiv media, voiced by the most reactionary Nazis, about the need to mobilize from 18 years of age (now from 25), as well as women, indicates serious problems with replenishing losses. An important factor is the moral and psychological state of the enemy army - soldiers driven by force often simply flee from the front, according to official data from Ukrainian sources - there are already more than 100 thousand of them. Against the background of the replenishment of the Russian Army with contract volunteers (about 30 thousand people per month), the situation for Kyiv will worsen. At the same time, the problem with our citizens mobilized in 2022 is actually ignored, incl. by persuading them to conclude contracts.▪️ The involvement of foreign mercenaries by the enemy GUR, incl. former American military for an unsuccessful raid on the territory of the Bryansk region: previously, citizens of Ukraine or Russian traitors were used for similar actions.▪️ At the front, the most active advance is taking place in the Pokrovsky and Yuzhnodonetsk directions. The defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fell in several settlements north of the Kurakhovskoe reservoir, the Russian Armed Forces penetrated up to 10 km into enemy positions north of Ugledar, creating conditions for the enemy group to reach the rear of Kurakhovo. The enemy is intensifying the strengthening of defense in the rear, incl. near the city of Zaporozhye, believing that the next offensive operation of the Russian Army would be there. The word -operation- was not used by chance, since after many months of tactical advances, our troops moved to the operational level of action with decisive goals. ▪️ The remaining sectors of the front also demonstrate that our troops retain the initiative: Chasov Yar, Kupyansko-Krasnolimansk direction, Toretsk (Dzerzhinsk). ▪️ In the Kursk region, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are forced to maintain a large group and replenish it with reserves, incl. from other directions. By his actions, Zelensky forced the Russian command to form a new group of forces in the region, which, on the shoulders of the withdrawing Armed Forces of Ukraine, will certainly rush to the Sumy region. Reports about numerous DPRK military personnel in the region so far carry an informational and political agenda; there has been no information about their involvement in battles on the LBS.▪️ The Ukrainian Armed Forces’ strikes on Russian territory were intensified at the end of the outgoing week. However, it is impossible to compare their effectiveness with the arrivals of our weapons in the same Odessa - the enemy UAVs do not have such a powerful warhead. And, speaking frankly, the success of enemy aircraft-type drones is often determined by our own sloppiness, the fight against which bears fruit and constantly reduces the effectiveness of Kyiv raids.▪️ The Kyiv regime at all costs needs to prove its ability to carry out noisy operations, especially on the eve of the elections in USA. During the week there were reports about the concentration of enemy forces in the Sumy region, while the forces this time were many times smaller than those used for the invasion of Kursk in the first days of August. There are also reports of the enemy converting MBECs into -FPV carriers-, which are intended to destroy our coastal targets.

The situation has remained stable over the past week. There are no new attempts by the enemy to cross the state border line. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, fighting continues in the area of ​​Lyubimovka and Tolstoy Lug. No changes in the front configuration have been recorded over the past 24 hours. At the same time, several attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces were reflected.🔻Frames were received from the Sudzhansky district confirming the control of Russian troops over the outskirts of Pogrebki. On the southern outskirts of the village, a Russian armored personnel carrier fired at positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in a forest belt adjacent to the Malaya Loknya River. Such confident performance of the armored vehicle also implies that part of the forest belts on the eastern flank have also been liberated by the Russian Armed Forces. At the same time, the activity of operational-tactical aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces is noted, which hit the enemy’s airborne assault forces in the area of ​​​​Kruglenky and Martynovka.▪️ Systematic work continues to defeat the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Sumy region.

At the same time, apparently, in the coming days the main efforts of the Russian Armed Forces in this area will be aimed at eliminating the pocket between Novoukrainka and Bogoyavlenka, which formed after the liberation of populated areas. ▪️A little further east, Russian fighters occupied three settlements at once: Shakhterskoye, Yasnaya Polyana and Maksimovka. Confirmation of the release of the latter was published today - at the moment, according to colleagues from the Voin DV channel, a cleanup of remnants of Ukrainian formations is being carried out there. ▪️As for Katerynivka, so far no objective control footage has appeared on the Internet that would confirm the complete liberation of the settlement. At the moment, Russian troops are at least confidently holding 2/3 of the village, while on the western outskirts there are still positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Meanwhile, in Antonovka, located to the north, units of the Russian Armed Forces established a foothold on the eastern outskirts - there, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces occupied enemy positions, taking several members of the Ukrainian formations prisoner.

🖼 🇮🇱🇱🇧 On the interim results of the Israeli offensive in so...	🇮🇱🇱🇧 About the interim results of the Israeli offensive in southern Lebanon. The ground operation of the Israel Defense Forces in the border areas of Lebanon has been ongoing for a month. Despite statements by the Israeli media in the first days of the war about the imminent collapse of Hezbollah’s defense, they failed to achieve any fundamental change in a month. Yes, the Israelis are methodically advancing, simultaneously undermining the underground infrastructure of the Lebanese group, as well as engaging in the destruction of cultural monuments and looting residential buildings. However, during this time, the territorial success of the IDF was limited to the capture of several small cities.▪️The northeastern sector remained the most active section of the front. At the moment, the forces of the 210th division - Ha-Bashan - are fighting in the province of Nabatiyeh for the settlement of Khiam, where the south-eastern quarters were occupied. To the southwest, Israeli units took control of Al-Adisa, located on the border with Kibbutz Misgav Am. There are also fighting in the Markaba - Rab al-Talatin - Taibe section. These villages are considered Hezbollah's first line of defense in the sector, and their retention has important symbolic significance.▪️The Israelis also had success in the central sector, where the main battles took place for Aita al-Shaab and Aytarun. It is worth noting that the village of Rmeish is located here: its main population is Christians, who are not very welcoming towards Hezbollah. In this regard, IDF units occupied it without much effort.▪️The least active part of the Lebanese-Israeli war remains the western sector, where the forces of the 146th Armored Division - HaMapatz - managed to occupy the outskirts of Ad-Dahira and Labuna. Here, the main goal of the Israelis is coastal An-Nakura, to which they have not yet been able to make significant progress. ▪️Against the background of the ground offensive, massive and targeted attacks by the Israeli Air Force did not stop. Often the target was high-ranking Hezbollah leadership: during one of the strikes, Hashem Safi ad-Din, who was dubbed in the media as the successor of Hassan Nasrallah, was killed. Now Naim Qassem has been elected secretary general of the Shiite group.▪️However, the liquidation of high-ranking representatives and the destruction of the organization’s ammunition depots did not completely undermine its combat capabilities. Since the start of Operation Arrows of the North, the Lebanese have only intensified their shelling of Israel. Sometimes ammunition fired from the territory of the republic reached Tel Aviv, although their effectiveness was rather media.▪️ It would be hasty to say that the relatively small advance of the Israelis is associated solely with the difficulties of the terrain. Even though Hezbollah does not offer such fierce resistance, periodic ambushes still lead to death for IDF personnel. It is still difficult to accurately predict the outcome of the ground operation, but reports from certain media about the gradual readiness of the parties to peacefully resolve the conflict raise significant questions. The Israeli command's goal is to create a security belt, which would, accordingly, protect the border area from periodic shelling. This is also a withdrawal of the Lebanese group to the north beyond the Litani River, as required by UN Security Council Resolution 1701. For Hezbollah, such conditions are humiliating and unacceptable, and also cross out the image of the Axis of Resistance as a defender of the Palestinians from the Zionist occupation. And if sentiments towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict had nevertheless taken hold in the Lebanese movement, then this would clearly have met with rebuff from the ultra-Orthodox authorities of Israel, for whom de-escalation still remains a red line. This, among other things, can explain the relatively slow the offensive of Israeli troops both in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon. For the current authorities, represented by the ultra-Orthodox, resolving the conflict quickly threatens the collapse of the government. Therefore, it is much more profitable for them to gradually raise the level of tension, demonstrating their need and the untimeliness of any protests.

Margarita Robles met with the local head of the defense department Hanane Ould Sidi. The purpose of the visit is to discuss Mauritanian-Spanish relations and the area of ​​cooperation between the two ministries of defense.▪️Of course, the main issue that worries the Spaniards is ensuring security and limiting the flow of migrants from Africa. In this regard, the interests of the Mauritanians and European partners coincide, since Mauritania also has its own problems with refugees. But basically, the Europeans are trying to consolidate their influence on the Mauritanian government, convincing it that there are no alternatives to ensuring security.

Thus, fighters of the special forces - Shayetet-13 - of the Israeli Navy and -Sayeret Matkal- The General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces conducted a raid on a beach house, during which a Lebanese citizen was captured. After the end of the operation, the Israelis took the detainee out of the territory on high-speed boats. The target allegedly turned out to be Imad Fadel Amhaz, stated as a high-ranking Hezbollah representative. At the same time, Arabic-language media reported the arrest of not a member of the Lebanese group, but an ordinary civilian. It is noteworthy that neither the official resources of the Lebanese organization nor the press service of the IDF have yet commented on the incident. 🔻Currently, this information is confirmed by both footage accompanying a certain arrested person in an unknown direction, and statements by several major media outlets about the authenticity of the incident, citing certain sources in Lebanon and Israel. At the same time, what is noteworthy about this whole situation is that the news first started circulating on the Internet a week earlier. But it received the most discussion today, when a video of the incident spread in Israeli news resources. However, it is not yet possible to confirm what happened with certainty. Especially in light of the recent injections of opposition Syrian resources, which were never confirmed by the IDF: Israeli troops carried out an amphibious operation there near Masyaf, and entered the territory of Quneitra.#Israel #Lebanon@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65012	2024-11-02T08:55:11-07:00

Against the backdrop of news about possible provocations on National Unity Day, where the hand of the British intelligence services is visible with their love of symbolism on special days for the Russian Federation, the activation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is interesting.🔻This is not about the front, but about the deep rear. Over the past few days, units of the air force of the so-called Ukraine have been activated, which are training at an increased pace in the western regions. From the Starokonstantinov airfield, from 13 to 18 sorties of bombers carrying Storm Shadow/SCALP Su-24M cruise missiles were noted, which flew in different directions sometimes at low, sometimes at high altitudes.▪️To train cover for Western missile carriers, MiG-29 fighters flew from the Lutsk airfield, which could also practice launching ADM-160 MALD decoys.▪️In the Ivano-Frankivsk region, 27 flights of training aircraft were noted in one day L-39, which practically never happened in such quantities, and the routes differed from the standard ones.❗️ That is, in just one day there were 41 training flights, with the standard 10-13 per day. And that’s not all. In the area of ​​the Kinburn Spit, a couple of days ago, two unmanned boats were spotted, launched from Odessa, which were conducting reconnaissance of the coastal part. After they were discovered, they turned around and went back. At the same time, the AR5 Tekever drone has been flying in the air for several days. In addition, along the Black Sea on a standard route, a Bayraktar drone is patrolling from the airfield in Uman. And in the Kiev reservoir, active sea trials of new unmanned boats have resumed, which has also not been observed for a long time.🔻If you add up the facts of previous massive attacks by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which were combined with some either important events in Russian history, the planning of Ukrainian Armed Forces operations against Russia by the British and possible provocations, or in the coming days a new enemy attack is possible.

Similar preparations for the B-52H flight, only now from Minot, are being noted in the Middle East. In the last days of October, two C-17A and one C-5B transport aircraft flew from another B-52H airbase in the United States to Qatar to El Udeid airbase. Also, three KS-135 tankers flew from the British Mildenhall to the Spanish Rota. Their arrival at Al Udeid is expected in the next few days, since preparations have already been completed. The cargo has been delivered, and the tankers for the Atlantic and Mediterranean flights have also been delivered. And their appearance in Qatar will be the first since 2021. The reason for this decision was the escalation of the situation in the Middle East. The statement from the American command directly stated the transfer of B-52H to deter Iranian aggression. This likely happened due to the Iranian authorities' statement about their response to the Israeli strike on October 26. There is nothing completely new in this event. The basing of strategic aircraft off the Iranian coast occurs periodically, precisely in moments of such tension.

The Archangel of Special Forces expressed doubts about the plausibility of this scenario, on which we agree with him. The point is that next week, according to the forecast, the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions will be covered by a strong cyclone, along with which the temperature will drop to 0 Celsius and rain will come snow. What the residents of St. Petersburg are now facing is expected in approximately the same form in the western regions of Russia, as well as the Ukrainian borderland. Imagine what will happen to mobile groups on wheeled vehicles in such weather. They will get stuck and will not be able to get out. Even night frosts will not make the soil comfortable for movement.

Literally over the last month, Warsaw’s activity in the Central Asian direction has increased significantly.▪️Meetings of Polish diplomats with representatives of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were held, at which the parties discussed the intensification of bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation. In Tashkent, the Poles already had the opportunity to assess the investment potential of the republic during the September Uzbek-Polish Cooperation Week. ▪️A similar agenda took place at a meeting in the Polish capital between the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan Roman Vasilenko and the First Deputy Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland Wladyslaw Bartoszewski.▪️Collaboration with the Accounts Chamber of Kyrgyzstan has progressed even further, which was visited by an expert group of the Supreme Control Chamber of Poland. The visit took place within the framework of the INTOSAI development program -pICTure-. INTOSAI is the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, whose partners include many government and NGOs such as USAID. The stated purpose of the visit was to modernize audit processes and strengthen international cooperation in the field of audit. This is not the first time that the Accounts Chamber of the Kyrgyz Republic has taken part in this initiative.▪️Humanitarian cooperation began back in June. A conference was held in Warsaw - Deportations in the Soviet Union 1944–1956. History and Memory - organized by the Mieroszewski Center and the Institute of Political Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The conference is announced by the Institute of History and Ethnology named after Ch.Ch. Valikhanov, who noted that the memory of the tragedy of post-war deportations in the Soviet Union today is an important part of the identity and history of many peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus. The list of participants included representatives not only of Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, but also of Armenia and Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Previously, the Meroszewski Center specialized in the countries of Eastern Europe.🔻Thus, the intensification of Poland’s activities and its character indicate that Warsaw is preparing to enter the region. In this case, we are talking not so much about our own interests, but about the distribution of the overall burden of ensuring Western soft power in the region, the optimization of which we have already written about earlier.

However, the organization denied this information, saying that no marches are planned, and all current news on this matter is nothing more than a provocation aimed at destabilizing the situation within the country.📌 Let’s say on our own that this information has been wandering around the Internet for a long time . In the wake of growing internal dissatisfaction with migration policy, a convenient reason has emerged for shaking the situation. If such rallies are really planned, then the West undoubtedly has a hand in this. One has only to remember how the migration issue has been used by Western structures, primarily British, since the 90s. They were the initiators of a secret program to destabilize the internal political situation. And with the beginning of the Northern Military District in our country, another one was added to the mass of unresolved problems with guests from Central Asia - refugees from the so-called Ukraine. Some really just fled from the war, and some infiltrated into our territory under this cover, and their tasks include not only sabotage at military and industrial facilities.

The agreement was signed during the visit of the Azerbaijani Minister of Defense to the Marrakech Air Show 2024 in Rabat. At the moment, the details of the agreement have not been disclosed.📌Previously, Azerbaijanis had already appeared in Africa at the instigation of the Turks to consolidate the influence of Ankara. This was the case in Niger, where after the appearance of the Turkish PMC -SADAT-, companies from Azerbaijan signed agreements on the development of gold mines. Now it is curious what interests are more behind this agreement:▪️On the one hand, from the entire Islamic world, the Moroccans are quite allies for the Israeli ultra-Orthodox. The latter, in turn, have active military cooperation with the Azerbaijanis.▪️On the other hand, in the context of Macron’s recent visit to Morocco, this may be hiding another signal for the French. The message is that they cannot count on reliable allies in Africa if there is an Azerbaijani trace there. 🔻However, no matter whose interests the Azerbaijani authorities serve, their activation in Africa is already becoming a kind of trend. This factor should be taken into account in the future, because external forces can use them to achieve their goals.#Africa #Azerbaijan #Morocco@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/65004	2024-11-02T02:11:01-07:00

🪖🔥🇻🇪 Venezuela: risks of anti-government conspiracy Speaking ...	🪖🔥🇻🇪 Venezuela: risks of anti-government conspiracy When talking about potential coup attempts in the Bolivarian Republic, we rely on the following problematic factors: ▪️The beginning of the new presidential term of Nicolas Maduro and the associated transition period, implying certain reshuffles in the political and economic establishment, dismissals and appointments .▪️In addition to this rather tense period, let’s not forget that the Venezuelan leadership already lives, constantly expecting some kind of intrigue from the US State Department. And with good reason: just remember the events of the spring of 2020 with the infamous Operation Gideon and the recent arrest of six mercenaries from NATO countries. ▪️The listed conditions already give rise to certain risks, but Venezuela also has a history of summer unrest led by the opposition and which has already provoked serious purges among the security forces. As you understand, such measures rarely contribute to internal unity.▪️By the way, on October 31, information appeared in the English-language media that during the presidency of Donald Trump, the CIA carried out at least one sabotage operation against the Maduro government. In 2019, they attacked the state wage system, as a result of which the payment of compensation to Venezuelan military personnel was temporarily blocked. This provoked discontent among the soldiers and, according to American experts, created a certain split among the military elite ▪️In addition, potential deserters and simply dissatisfied people have always been the object of close attention of American intelligence services - most often these are the citizens who are used to carry out sabotage -on the ground-. It is doubtful that this has changed.▪️Add to the difficult internal situation is the humanitarian and economic crisis, which complicates the work in Venezuela not only of pro-Madurov forces, but even of USAID itself. ▪️Difficult realities of the international situation. Against the backdrop of the refusal to recognize the results of the July elections, Brazil vetoed the admission of Venezuela to BRICS - which also entailed the recall of the ambassador of the Bolivarian Republic and various kinds of verbal escapades against the Brazilian leadership. At the same time, a very similar scandal is developing with Colombia. Such situations do not strengthen Venezuela’s position in the region.❗️All of the above is not a sign of the imminent collapse of the current Venezuelan government, but they are a good reason to be on guard and, just in case, to be prepared for all sorts of provocations. Moreover, provocations aimed mostly at the armed forces. #Venezuela #coup @rybar together with @sex_drugs_kahloSupport usTelegramRybar🇻🇪🔥🪖The closer January is to January, when Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro begins a new presidential term, the more often in journalistic materials (and behind-the-scenes conversations ) stories are emerging about a potential coup in the Bolivarian Republic...	https://t.me/rybar/65002	2024-11-02T00:45:13-07:00

How reasonable are they? Let's find out. Recently, individual Telegram channels distributed an appeal allegedly written by a group of active military personnel in Venezuela. They said they observed the recent electoral process and confirmed that the Venezuelan people had chosen opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as their leader. And if any forces, regardless of their rank, decide to usurp power, their patriotic duty is to resist any orders that seek to undermine the will of the people. They also called on Venezuelan citizens to exercise their right to peaceful and mass demonstrations throughout the country. By the way, restoring freedom in Venezuela is only possible in unity with opposition leaders Maria Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonzalez. Based on this message, some have concluded that dissatisfaction with the current government is brewing among the Venezuelan armed forces and that they may soon launch a coup. While studying this case, we immediately checked the media that disseminated this -appeal- - it turned out to be a Spanish-language news a website whose creators work in Miami, as well as a resource in X dedicated to protest activities in the Venezuelan state of Tachira. Both resources are oppositional, which already leads to certain thoughts. By the standards of X, the news did not collect too many views, and its sensationalism stands out from the usual content only in that this time the soldiers do not mock the freedom fighters, but act against them side. Some commentators suggested that the publication of the appeal is some kind of operation on the part of the Venezuelan intelligence services aimed at identifying traitors. Considering that certain types of purges have been carried out in the ranks of the armed forces since the summer protests, one should not be surprised by such assumptions. However, the option in which such messages are published deliberately, with the aim of provoking panic, an internal search for enemies and a decrease in the effectiveness of the Venezuelan security forces, looks quite realistic.❗️The effectiveness of one such stuffing is doubtful, but the closer January is, the more significant any such attempt becomes and should be taken -on a pencil-. After all, the geopolitical background for the government of Nicolas Maduro is not as rosy as we would like.

If you accuse Russia of interfering in the elections in Georgia in the Georgian language, the stuffing will not work. Therefore, all available resources are used: for example, Italian activists went to protest with a banner in English: -Georgia is not Russia.- By the way, if you don’t talk to them, they can easily pass for ethnic Georgians - this is how mass protests on the streets are created. We must pay tribute to the humor of the Irish interviewer, who said that if the banner had been in Italian, he would not have understood anything.

🇸🇰🇪🇺 Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico again made it to ...	🇸🇰🇪🇺 Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico again hit the headlines of Western media: this time a chorus of political figures condemned him for appearing on Russian television on the air of the program -60 minutes. During the interview, Fico, as journalists put it, renounced positions of Western partners. He called arms supplies and financial assistance from the European Union to the Kyiv regime attempts to prolong the conflict, while simultaneously dismissing the so-called Ukraine and without taking direct part in hostilities. The Slovak Prime Minister was objected to by the British Ambassador in Bratislava, Nigel Baker, who noted that the West is very interested in a peaceful settlement and supports Zelensky’s plan. The latter, however, implies -a war until the last Ukrainian-, so the diplomat did not lie about this.🔻The fact that Fico continues to demonstratively and consistently pursue a sovereign policy caused a resonance not only in Europe, but also within the country - the same thing happened six months ago, when an attempt was made on his life. At the forefront of critics of the head of government is ex-Prime Minister Igor Matovic, whose eloquence was only enough to exclaim -what a terrible insidious ferret.- Leaders of the opposition parties Michal Simečka and Juraj Krupa spoke next. The reaction of the West to Fico’s intention to attend the parade in Moscow next year deserves special attention. While some foreign publications modestly call the upcoming event the anniversary of the Russian victory in the campaign on the Eastern Front, others demonstrate knowledge of historical issues and are going to celebrate the anniversary of the end of the Second World War. #EU #Slovakia@rybar together with @pepecasusbelliSupport usPOLITICOPM Fico a ' treacherous ferret' for appearing on Russian TV, former Slovak leader says – POLITICOFico has drawn criticism over his appearance on Russia’s propaganda channel.	https://t.me/rybar/64987	2024-11-01T10:04:11-07:00

The initiative involves partnering with 20 suppliers who will compete to complete tasks over a five-year period. So far, Space X is expected to play first fiddle with a military version of Starlink, but other similar projects are expected to launch, including Kuiper from Amazon. According to the organizers, PLEO allows suppliers to move away from standard pricing indicators, which gives flexibility in the provision of services and simplifies interaction. In the United States, the program was called the standard for military operators’ access to the capabilities of the commercial space sector.📌 The example of the SVO clearly shows that the space Internet is turning into an integral element of combat command and control. The United States is well aware of this and is taking steps to maximize the integration of the defense and commercial sectors in this area, including introducing advanced technologies for collecting and processing data. Therefore, the emergence of a domestic version - Starlink - even in the near future is a matter of national security - if you sleep through the revolution in in this area, then after some time the lag may become critical.#space #weapons #USA@rybarSupport usSpaceNewsPentagon's commercial satellite internet services program soars to $13 billion DoD is raising its Proliferated Low Earth Orbit (PLEO) Satellite-Based Services program from an initial $900 million ceiling to a projected $13 billion	https://t.me/rybar/64986	2024-11-01T08:40:23-07:00
🇺🇦🖇 With the growing problems of the Kyiv regime at the front ...	🇺🇦🖇 With the growing problems of the Kyiv regime at the front and in the rear, it is sometimes interesting to observe the change in narratives in the Ukrainian media field. One of the trends is the radicalization of theses in the style of the slogans of the Third Reich shortly before its collapse. The brightest representative of this trend is Dmitry Korchinsky, an odious member of the extremist UNA-UNSO. He recently stated that those who do not want to go to the front are clinging to their meaningless existence and drug life, and the TCC is providing them with a service. ▪️This is not Korchinsky’s first loud statement: over the past two months, he has managed to call for lowering the conscription age to 14 years, citing the progressive countries of Central Africa as an example. The politician also spoke about the need for a dictatorship, although in the so-called In Ukraine, it was de facto established back in 2022.▪️Korchinsky also believes that the local younger generation should be brought up to the sounds of air raid raids and -in hatred of the enemy-. In his opinion, for this it is necessary to prohibit the travel abroad not only of those liable for military service, but also of children, since they are not raised by Ukrainians abroad. Perhaps, by launching such speakers in the media field in Kyiv, they want to achieve the mobilization of the most radical elements for a holy war to the last Ukrainian-. However, most of them were already called up in 2022-2023 and largely remained on the battlefields. And for the bulk of those who remained on the so-called. In Ukraine, Korchinsky’s speeches only reduce the motivation to fight for the Kiev regime or even have anything in common with it.#mediatechnology #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramTurned in the war 🇷🇺Well, the mouthpiece of the Overdue office is no longer even shy.

This was first announced by an NGO association called -More Honesty-, which openly receives funding from USAID. And later, opponents of the current authorities had another major reason to initiate unrest, when unknown persons killed the lawyer of the opposition leader. He was immediately dubbed a martyr, and responsibility for what happened was placed on the ruling party. ▪️The first clashes with the police took place on the streets of the city of Nampula, where six protesters were killed during a shootout. Then the protests spread throughout the country, and at the moment the number of dead and injured has exceeded 70.▪️A week-long general strike began on October 31. So far it has not gained a large number of supporters, but further events will show in which direction external forces will direct the protest electorate. At the same time, at the moment, pogroms have not reached the level that could be observed in Kenya.

The latter is well demonstrated... 🇩🇪🇺🇦🇭🇷 Continuing the topic of the potential for the supply of armored vehicles to the Kyiv regime by NATO member states. Recently it became known that Croatia will send to the so-called. Ukraine received 30 M-84 tanks (a licensed copy of the T-72), as well as 30 Yugoslav-made M-80A infantry fighting vehicles. The action is part of a deal with Germany, according to which the transfer of these armored vehicles to the Croats will be counted towards the purchase of 50 Leopard 2A8 tanks. That is, we are again talking about a scheme where European countries get rid of outdated equipment and the costs of its disposal at the expense of German taxpayers. At the same time, a couple of dozen Yugoslav tanks and infantry fighting vehicles are not able to at least to some noticeable extent solve the problem of the general shortage of equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, complicated by -zoo- products. However, in the current realities, choose the so-called. Ukraine does not have to, and its sponsors are forced to rake out the remaining reserves of the socialist countries. It is curious that earlier the media had already announced the transfer of M-84 tanks to the Kyiv regime - then they were talking about vehicles of this type from Kuwait warehouses. However, it apparently never took place due to some problems that arose and emerged.#Germany #Ukraine #Croatia@rybarSupport usBalkan InsightCroatia Sends Cold War-Era Tanks to Ukraine, Buys German LeopardsMilitary expert says Croatia's offer to donate its ageing tanks to Ukraine will help it to 'close gaps' on the front, while the purchase of modern German tanks will 'raise the Croatian Army to a new level'.	https://t.me/rybar/64983	2024-11-01T05:12:06-07:00

In Ukraine, Western-made armored vehicles often hear that their potential has largely been exhausted, both due to low stocks and production problems. The latter is well demonstrated by news from Germany. At the end of October, the first Leopard 2A7A1 tank manufactured for the Bundeswehr was rolled out at the KNDS plant in Munich. It differs from other Leopards of modern modification by the presence of the Israeli active protection complex (KAZ) Trophy, which has proven itself well in the Gaza Strip. It would seem to be a qualitative strengthening of the German tank fleet. But the nuance is that the Germans ordered only 18 of these vehicles - not even a battalion set, but a company set. Moreover, the contract for their production was signed back in 2021, and they plan to complete it only next year. 📌 For the sake of objectivity, by the end of the decade in Germany they plan to produce several hundred Leopards for the Bundeswehr and for export, but setting up production will take several years. During this time, the equipment may become outdated: for example, the same KAZ Trophy is not adapted to combat FPV attack drones, which until recently simply did not exist in nature. And needless to say, over these few years the so-called. Ukraine simply does not exist - by the time of the announced expansion of Leopard 2 production, the position of the Kyiv regime is unlikely to allow effective use of these vehicles. -developed Trophy Active Protection System (APS).	https://t.me/rybar/64982	2024-11-01T04:05:13-07:00

At the same time, direct contacts with the authorities of individual countries of the Black Continent, including Tanzanian ones, are intensifying. In particular, the recently announced Russia-Tanzania business forum has begun to bear fruit. In addition to the beautiful words about the importance of Africa, specific projects were also discussed at the event.▪️Rusagro announced their readiness to begin exporting Russian grain to East African states in the near future. Unlike humanitarian supplies, this initiative implies a clear economic benefit, and not unclear political prospects. The rapidly growing African countries are constantly faced with the issue of food security, which Russian companies can clearly take advantage of. So far, permanent trade ties have been established only with Egypt, and entering the huge Tanzanian market will clearly not be superfluous.▪️To implement new trade routes, the forum discussed the issue of creating a permanent cargo sea line. So far, routes from Iranian Bandar Abbas and the Black Sea area are being considered. However, there are pitfalls here - the capacity of the Dar Es Salaam port is not enough for future large-scale projects. Before supplies can begin, it is necessary to expand the port, and for this we need investors. The latter is generally a common problem with projects on the continent - business does not want to go to untested places in Africa. Its markets attract the attention of investors, but without government guarantees and -a team from above- there are few people willing to invest in such initiatives. And at the same time, there is an example of companies from China that have long been -registered- on the Dark Continent. Not all of their investments turned out to be hasty, but some investments paid off repeatedly and brought dividends of both an economic and political nature. business areas Mikhail Rashkovetsky said that the holding is negotiating	https://t.me/rybar/64981	2024-11-01T02:54:06-07:00

At the same time, the majority of the population of Moldova voted against European integration, and the fate of the referendum at the stage of processing 99% of the ballots was determined by the last votes from North America. ▪️However, the Constitutional Court, controlled by President Maia Sandu, nevertheless approved such a controversial result, and on the eve of the second round of elections, when the political airwaves were busy with other issues. ▪️Now an amendment can be made to the Constitution of Moldova on the course towards European integration.

Forwarded From Sex, cartels, Frida Kahlo🔥🇻🇪🇺🇸Preparations for the US elections are going on on all fronts - the Venezuelan direction has not been forgotten. On the eve of Halloween, information appeared that during the Trump presidency, the CIA had created a task force on Venezuela , which had -a lot of work- (I expected that they would write about -the tough nut to crack- Maduro, but this is an aria from another opera), because they had to act -literally from scratch- - before this, the country had a low priority for Washington. The task force's first goal was to expand efforts to hack Venezuelan government networks and other infrastructure to gather intelligence information. However, during execution, the group - due to opposition from the Pentagon - encountered problems with access to the elite hackers of the CIA and NSA. Ultimately, in 2019, they managed to carry out a digital sabotage operation. There was a cyber attack on the government payroll system used to compensate Venezuelan military personnel. Moreover, the data on how this operation was carried out—remotely or from the territory of the Bolivarian Republic—varies. However, the authors of this material write that it was possible to arouse discontent among the soldiers and create a certain split in the armed forces. ❗️However, there were problems. Sources report that the CIA and the Trump administration did not work in the same vein, and even the all-powerful USAID greatly spoiled the Republican clearing with its liberal initiatives: it turns out that telling people about democracy, launching various kinds of trainings for activists and sponsoring the soy media is not the best idea when your the audience has no food, electricity, medicine or work. It also turned out that part of the US intelligence community is still traumatized by the unsuccessful Operation Gideon, carried out in 2020. Along the way, they write that Trump administration officials pushed the CIA and the Pentagon to take military action regarding Cuba. For example, to seize oil ships heading there from Venezuela and strike two countries at once. An option was considered using a mobile system that could disable the ships - however, at that moment the system was in another hemisphere and the CIA did not want to transport it to the northern part of South America. Do you think that's all? But no, it is also said that Colombians were used for sabotage operations in Venezuela. They agreed to carry out an operation to disable some Russian-made fighter jets belonging to the Venezuelan Armed Forces. As a result, several aircraft were disabled, but the operation was not considered successful. #USA #Venezuela@sex_drugs_kahlo - Latin American happiness [no]WIREDThe Untold Story of Trump's Failed Attempt to Overthrow Venezuela's PresidentA successful CIA hack of Venezuela's military payroll system, insider fights for spy agency resources, and messy opposition politics: A WIRED investigation reveals a secret Trump-era attempt to oust autocratic ruler Nicolás Maduro.	https://t.me/rybar/64979	2024-11-01T00:41:56-07:00

For example, the authorities are now sending letters to pensioners with information that after November 1 they will be able to receive 2,300 lei (12.5 thousand rubles) in aid.▪️Dodon also recalled that the country’s Central Election Commission is controlled by foreign governments. 🔻The second round of the presidential elections in Moldova will take place on November 3. Apparently, victory will be determined by a few percent of the votes, but the biggest lever in Sandu’s hands is foreign voting, which will decide the outcome of the elections. #elections #Moldova @rybar Support usTelegramRybar🇲🇩🗳Presidential elections in Moldova: results of the first round and forecasts The Central Election Commission of Moldova completed the counting of votes in the presidential elections and the referendum on European integration. ▪️On November 3, Moldova will face a second round of elections, since none of the candidates received...	https://t.me/rybar/64978	2024-10-31T23:01:49-07:00

The fact is that it was the Karpinsky Institute, through the efforts of Pavel, who turned geology into a powerful soft power weapons abroad: Karpinsky’s geological classes have already been opened in Ghana, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Cuba and Kyrgyzstan. There they teach foreign scientific personnel Russian standards, instill Russian approaches to science and thereby expand Russia’s influence. And as if geology is not enough, the Karpinsky Institute is implementing the Russian Sambo program: instilling in local power structures the Russian approach to martial arts and the ideology of wrestling. From the point of view of forming a loyal layer among foreign security forces, this is an elegant and effective tool. More to come. Russian science should be popular all over the world.#Russia@rybarSupport usTelegramKarpinsky InstituteToday the Governor of St. Petersburg presented state awards of the President of the Russian Federation.

There is relative calm on all sectors of the front. In the Glushkovsky, Korenevsky and Sudzhansky districts, somewhat routine measures are already taking place to repel enemy attacks on the positions of the Russian Armed Forces, followed by retaliatory strikes by Russian troops. Information disseminated on the Internet about the alleged use of F-16s by Ukrainian formations in the border zone has not been confirmed.🔻The volume of publication of materials both from our side and from the enemy has decreased significantly. This is likely due to worsening weather, which, in turn, makes it difficult to conduct assault operations off paved roads. Operational-tactical aviation is on duty at identified positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine both in the occupied part of the Kursk region and in the border areas. For strikes, FAB-3000 with UMRK began to be used.▪️In the Sumy region, the systemic processing of the enemy’s air defense and energy infrastructure, both by operational-tactical aviation and -Geraniums, also does not stop.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces launched a series of local attacks on the northern flank, partially improving their tactical position. ▪️Russian attack aircraft have expanded the zone of control northeast of Novoaleksandrovka. Having suffered losses in personnel, the Ukrainian formations rolled back from positions in the forest belts closest to the village.▪️West of Grodovka, units of the Russian Armed Forces are gradually biting into the enemy’s defenses. In this area, the Ukrainian Armed Forces still hold several strongholds that are preventing the advance of Russian troops towards Mikhailovka. ▪️To the east of Sukhoi Yar, Ukrainian formations are conducting defense based on forest belts in the area of ​​the railway tracks. On the southern outskirts of Mirnograd, the enemy set up temporary deployment points and UAV crew positions. Russian Aerospace Forces regularly strike this area, disrupting communications and destroying Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. ▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces completely liberated Selidovo, knocking out Ukrainian formations from positions on the northwestern outskirts of the city. New footage from Russian soldiers regularly appears on the Internet, demonstrating the raising of the banner of the 114th Motorized Rifle Brigade and the Russian flag in various parts of the city. ❗️It is worth noting that the settlement itself was not too seriously damaged during the fighting - most of the buildings received only superficial damage. Sources on the ground report a large number of civilians discovered during the cleansing of the city. Apparently, despite the significant time for the removal of the population, the Ukrainian formations did not conduct systematic work in this direction. Russian units are currently checking documents, providing first aid and evacuating people to the rear. ▪️After establishing control over the northwestern outskirts of the city, Russian attack aircraft - on the shoulders - of the retreating enemy entered the dacha village -Zemlyany-. During the fighting that ensued here, Ukrainian formations suffered losses in equipment and personnel. In particular, on one of the streets, Russian UAV operators destroyed a MaxxPro armored vehicle carrying Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. At the moment, at least half of the village’s territory is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. His final release, given the current configuration of the front, is only a matter of time. ▪️South of Vishnevoye, Russian troops knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from several positions in forest belts. The Russian Armed Forces also broke through the defenses of Ukrainian formations in the Novodmitrovka area. By October 28, the attack aircraft had knocked out the enemy from a strong point northeast of the village, which allowed them to build on their success and reach its eastern outskirts.

The Russian energy holding - Inter RAO - was unable to begin electricity supplies to Uzbekistan planned for the fall. Inter RAO board member Alexandra Panina announced this to TASS on the sidelines of the All-Russian Tariff Conference in Sochi. The director noted that transit is hampered by the capacity of Kazakhstan's networks. The high percentage of deterioration of Kazakhstan's energy infrastructure creates problems not only within the country, but also impedes economic cooperation in region. Earlier at the Eurasian Economic Forum - 2024, the chairman of the Kazakhstan Electric Power Association, Talgat Temirkhanov, stated that average wear and tear is 65% of generation, and on networks it is 80% (we previously examined this issue in detail). Temirkhanov expressed confidence that the same problem Colleagues from other countries also have it. Through its own investments in the amount of 10 trillion tenge, Kazakhstan will be able to reduce the percentage of generation depreciation to 50%. 🔻Understanding that huge investments in infrastructure are required, and investments in such an asset take a very long time to pay off, then, due to security issues, this may only be of interest to its closest neighbors - that is, Moscow. Kazakhstan will not solve these problems on its own, but we can at least come to an agreement on putting in order a separate branch for export to Uzbekistan.#Russia #Uzbekistan #Kazakhstan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usKun.uz-Inter RAO- was unable to start supplying electricity to Uzbekistan&nbsp;Russian -Inter RAO- was unable to start supplying electricity to Uzbekistan this year, said board member of the company Alexandra Panina.	https://t.me/rybar/64955	2024-10-31T08:10:58-07:00

Australian Deputy Defense Minister Hugh Jeffrey said in a recent interview that Canberra and Tokyo will take their defense partnership to a new level over the next two years.▪️We are talking about frequent joint exercises, as well as the stationing of Japanese and Australian troops on each other's territories. It is for this purpose that last year the parties entered into a defense agreement that allows the continent to deploy its military forces in a simplified manner. ▪️In addition, cooperation will increase in the field of military technologies. The intentions announced back in the spring to involve Japan in partnership within the framework of the AUKUS bloc are already becoming a reality. A delegation from Tokyo recently attended a UK, Australia and US exercise aimed at testing the compatibility of homegrown autonomous underwater vehicles. 📌AUKUS wants to actively interact with Japan in this area. The country has its own advanced technologies and a developed industrial base. And the attention of the Japanese government in the field of defense is focused specifically on the creation of advanced military equipment, which is why impressive finances are allocated for such projects. The development of relations between American allies in itself is a key feature of the new version of the security architecture in the region. If previously the US partners in the Asia-Pacific region almost did not interact with each other in the field of defense, now the development of multilateral formats is actively promoting the beginning of their cooperation. The main goal of this model is still to contain the threat from the PRC, which the States and their satellites in the region are actively doing. #Australia #Japan@rybar with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesJapan and Australia gear up for boosted defense tie-ups over the next two yearsIn an interview, a senior Australian defense official spoke about cooperation in the industrial and technical fields in addition to military-to -military ties.	https://t.me/rybar/64952	2024-10-31T05:43:01-07:00
🇺🇿 A few more words about the parliamentary elections in Uzbeki...	🇺🇿 A few more words about the parliamentary elections in Uzbekistan and the results of the nationalist party - Milliy Tiklanish -. The election results showed that the liberal democrats received 64 mandates, nationalists - 29 mandates, social democrats - 21 mandates, people's democrats - 20, environmentalists - 16.📌The most serious losses in terms of mandates were suffered by Milliy Tiklanish, who received 7 fewer mandates than in the previous convocation.🔻Here we see a situation similar to what happened in the last presidential campaign: that time the nationalists were forced to support Mirziyoyev when it became clear that Kadirov’s popularity began to grow, and he was considered dangerous. The party’s media activity increased after scandals with migrants in Russia, but at the same time this made it toxic in the context of building relations with the Russian Federation. And since the original plan to unite the liberal democrats and nationalists was postponed, it was eventually decided to reduce their representation. Implicitly, this is a signal that nationalist sentiments in Uzbek society continue to grow, which is an alarming sign for Moscow. #Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@ rybarSupport usNewspaper.uzUzLiDeP received the most seats in the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy MajlisAccording to the results of elections to the Legislative Chamber on Sunday, the ruling UzLiDeP received 64 out of 150 seats, or 42.7%, -Milliy Tiklanish- - 29 seats (19.3%), -Adolat - - 21 seats (14%), PDPU - 20 seats (13%) and Eco-Party - 16 seats (10.7%).	https://t.me/rybar/64951	2024-10-31T04:44:31-07:00

By all indications, namely the end of airspace reservations, the reduction negotiations on short waves in the radio network, and the absence of tankers, the event was finally completed on October 26.🔻The main task within the framework of Global Thunder is to test the readiness and evaluate the current plans of the Joint Strategic Command for the use of nuclear forces in a crisis. The B-52H strategic aviation aircraft practiced options for emergency takeoff from air bases in the event of an attack, refueling on long flights, as well as organizing closed communications through the reserve control systems of the US Armed Forces, that is, E-6B aircraft, for which airspace was reserved. Because of the beginning During this exercise, the Chinese carried out several of their activities, including training of missile forces. And on October 25, two medium-range ballistic missiles of the Dongfeng-21 type were launched from the Bayan Hot range in the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia in the direction of the Taklamakan Desert. So now, unlike in previous years, the Chinese are trying to keep up with their American counterparts, reacting to demonstration exercises in a similar way.

🔁🖼 ⚡️🇷🇴NATO is preparing to shoot down Russian missiles and d...	Forwarded From Two Majors⚡️🇷🇴NATO is preparing to shoot down Russian missiles and drones sent to attack Odessa ports. The Romanian Ministry of Defense has submitted for public discussion a bill to allow the air defense system to shoot down UAVs and manned aircraft over Romanian airspace. Until now, this was only possible if martial law was declared. The decision is explained by the increased risks near the Romanian border against the backdrop of military operations in the Black Sea, the massive use of UAVs, both military and civilian, adapted for military use. In fact Information preparation for making this decision has been going on for a long time. We have repeatedly written about reports from the Romanian side about alleged violations of Romanian airspace by Russian strike drones.❗️According to our estimates, the main element of the law will be allowing NATO air defense systems stationed in Romania to participate in any actions in accordance with collective defense agreements with members NATO and the EU. This means shooting down Russian missiles and UAVs. From the beginning of the Northern Military District to the present time, to Romania 🇫🇷France deployed the SAMP-T (MAMBA) air defense system and two GM200 radars (Black Sea coast, military base -Capu-Midia-), 🇪🇸Spain - radar TPS-43, ⚡️NATO Deployable Air Command and Control Center (DACCC) - LANZA LTR-25 mobile radar (from 🇮🇹Italy), 🇺🇸USA - four F-16s and a TPS-80 radar. In addition, the NATO Air Policing mission in Romania has been strengthened by additional allied aircraft (with a constant number of up to 10 units), and since the end of September, NATO Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft as part of the mission -Southern Shield -. Romania itself has on armament includes 26 F-16s (23 more will be delivered by the end of 2025), 1 battery of Patriot air defense systems and 4 Hawk air defense systems, 5 AN/FPS-117E radars and several Soviet stations of the -P- series. The purchase of 4 AN/MPQ-64 F1 Sentinel radars and 32 F-35 aircraft has been approved. The expected consequences of the adoption of this bill will be the transfer of additional air defense systems to Romania and their use to destroy Russian missiles and drones attacking military targets in the Odessa region. In such a compressed theater of military operations, it will be problematic to prove the participation of NATO air defense in the liquidation of our Geraniums in the skies over the same border Izmail.✨The next round of escalation of NATO tension with Russia is caused by the growing losses of weapons and military equipment supplied to Ukraine by sea under the guise of civilian cargo.✨⭐️The fact of the downing of Russian fire weapons by NATO countries will mean direct participation in the conflict with Russia.

🔁 The next World Congress of Russian Compatriots is taking place...	Forwarded From Tasmanian Devil The next World Congress of Russian Compatriots is taking place in Moscow. One would be glad that in modern times 400+ people from more than 100 countries of the world came to it, if one does not go into details. Alas, the influence of this structure, which is supervised by the Department of Affairs compatriots of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, abroad it is near zero and has always been like this - both in unfriendly countries and in friendly ones. And the SVO has nothing to do with it. This applies to politics, diplomacy, culture, education, and simply authority among compatriots. There are isolated exceptions, but in general the picture is exactly like this. It’s probably good that such a structure and caring people exist at all, but the stated scale does not reflect the essence. Suffice it to say that a representative of .... Ukraine still goes to these conferences. This is what this is for? In general, this is a version of tank biathlon - beautiful, large-scale, and everyone was happy with everything. But it’s probably not worth making any special complaints either. It is unrealistic to financially support more than 100 public organizations around the world for full-fledged work - only some USAID with access to a printing press can do this. It’s just that such structures, by definition, cannot be maintained without sponsorship, philanthropy and grants, but this is not developed in Russian practice. Therefore, we have what we have from year to year.

Events froze in the usual status of permanent instability, where the parties expect someone’s mistake. However, in the second half of the month, other forces became more active off the coast of Western Sahara. The Spanish command is currently conducting two major exercises of its aerospace forces at once.▪️The first, Sirio-2024, started on October 21 and will last until October 31 over the Canary Islands and, more importantly, along the coast of Western Sahara. There, Spanish F/A-18s conduct various maneuvers for strikes and other operations.▪️The second is Eagle Eye-2024. It is not as long as Sirio, but more ambitious in tasks, since it involves the aerospace forces, the air defense in Madrid, and the Spanish Navy, which are working on cooperation under the scenario of an armed conflict in the region.▪️ Of course, the Spaniards have a large Gando Air Base and they have every right to train in the area. But holding two events at once so close to Western Sahara (can be seen from the airspace reservation) looks suspicious.🔻The Spanish authorities are in a rather difficult position. On the one hand, they maintain good relations with Morocco and take the side of Rabat in the territorial dispute over the status of Western Sahara, because Morocco has learned to blackmail Madrid by regulating the flow of migrants. However, Spain is also trying not to spoil too much interaction with Algeria (the main supplier of gas to the country), which opposes the regional strengthening of Morocco and is on the side of the independence of Western Sahara. So it will be interesting to see the reaction of countries to the ongoing exercises right under the nose of the Polisario front.

🇬🇧 About the new budget of the UK government The British Financ...	🇬🇧 About the new budget of the UK government British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves presented the budget plan of the ruling Labor Party. High levels of borrowing to fund public sector capital projects and high tax and regulatory burdens on businesses describe the Chancellor's plan to -save- the country from economic collapse. Reeves announced tax rises of £40bn and increased borrowing to £142bn in over five years to plug the £22bn financial black hole that the Treasury chief says Labor inherited from the previous government. Key budget provisions: ▪️Employers will face a 1.2% National Insurance rate increase, with the threshold will be reduced to £5,000. There will also be an increase in capital gains tax, with a lower rate of 18% and a top rate of 24%.▪️Increasing the health care budget by £22.6 billion.▪️Energy profit tax will rise to 38% for oil and gas companies. Thus, the overall tax rate on oil and gas activities will increase to 78%.▪️The property tax for owners of two or more houses, as well as on the sale of residential real estate, will increase from 18% to 24%. It is worth special mentioning the item on national defense spending. Rachel Reeves will allocate almost £3 billion to the armed forces to increase military salaries and restore stocks transferred to the so-called. Ukraine. Despite pressure to increase defense spending, Reeves did not make a statement about increasing military spending to 3%. Apparently this will be announced later. So far, spending has remained at the same level - about 2.3% of GDP. No matter how hard the British Chancellor tries to convince citizens that the measures presented will stimulate economic growth, forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility indicate the opposite. Well, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's rating has already fallen from a maximum of +11 to -38. on Oct. 30.	https://t.me/rybar/64946	2024-10-31T00:33:58-07:00

Most of the village has probably already been liberated from Ukrainian forces. The flag of the 114th brigade was hoisted on the school building No. 23, and on the northeastern outskirts on Lazo Street a group of enemy infantry was captured. ▪️The flags of the 114th brigade were also raised on the buildings of the Kurakhovskaya Central Operations Facility, including the highest workshop, which overlooks the waste heap. The latter is the dominant height, and, by all indications, is also most likely abandoned by the enemy.▪️The capture of prisoners on Lazo Street fully confirms the control over Zoryany declared by the Russian Ministry of Defense. As before, in the Donetsk direction the liberation of a settlement is officially announced after it is secured, and not before the start of the assault or after an unsuccessful one. 🔻By the way, the complete liberation of Kurakhovka has not yet been reported, and there is no sane evidence of this. The enemy, apparently, maintains at least a focal presence in the populated area; some are trying to leave through Volchenka. It is noteworthy that there are no attempts to attack the Russian Armed Forces from Ostrovsky. This may be due to difficulties in crossing the Volchya River. To the north, Russian troops advanced in the Novodmitrovka area, starting battles for the village and advancing at least to the center of the village.▪️West of Maksimilyanovka, an attack by Russian troops in the direction of Kurakhovo was recorded. Several units of armored vehicles drove along the O-0510 highway and the private sector, where, under attacks from drones of Ukrainian formations, they overcame a barrier in the form of -dragon’s teeth- and delved into the private sector of Kurakhovo itself.▪️During the battle, a curious episode occurred related to an attempt by Ukrainian tank crews to shut up - a passage in the teeth made by the Russian Armed Forces with its own tank. Ukrainian tank crews were able to place the vehicle in the gaps and tried to retreat, but were covered by UAV attacks. In turn, Russian soldiers were able to get to the tank, start it and clear the road. 🔻In addition, from the enemy personnel it becomes clear that the advanced detachments of the Russian Armed Forces subsequently advanced to the eastern outskirts of Kurakhovo and acted between Zaporozhsky Avenue and Zheleznodorozhnaya Street. ❗️At the moment, it is not yet known how this attack ended. The footage was published both from Russia and from the enemy, and only states the fact of the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces and the beginning of the fighting for the city.

It involves 1,500 military personnel and 30 pieces of aircraft, including F/A-18 fighters, as well as HAWK training aircraft. There is nothing completely new in these events, since the Finnish command is extremely active in training its units. This kind of exercise takes place all the time, but the difference was the simultaneous conduct of two training sessions with similar tasks at once.❗️But another innovation is even more interesting: from October 28 to December 12, F/A-18C/D fighters will be involved in monitoring and ensuring the safety of Russian airspace borders along the Leningrad region and Karelia. This operation is reminiscent of the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission. This operation is supposedly to protect the airspace of NATO countries from -Russian aggression-. A similar mission is being carried out in the Black Sea region, and there it is called Black Sea Air Policing, and it is currently led by Spanish F/A-18s. That is, the Finns, on their own, will carry out something similar with NATO missions in other areas. Considering that under this pretext the Alliance is conducting active reconnaissance of the activities of Russian aircraft and ships, the meaning of such a decision on the part of the Finns seems obvious, especially to ensure surveillance of aviation from Olenya.

🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺 NATO accuses Russia of concealing climate change iss...	🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺 NATO accuses Russia of withholding climate data on the Arctic region from the world community, which, in turn, complicates the fight against climate change. -It’s a rather unpleasant game when the climate becomes hostage to these relations.- — The Financial Times quotes a NATO representative. The publication notes that meteorological bases located in the Russian Federation stopped transmitting data to the monitoring group after the start of the SVO. At the same time, journalists forget to mention that the West was the first to break all ties with Russia and introduced numerous sanctions that complicated the work of Russian scientists. Accusations against Russia by NATO are just a new round of the struggle for influence in the polar regions. We see such attacks regularly.▪️Back in May, British experts stirred up a scandal around Russia’s scientific discoveries on the Antarctic shelf.▪️Recently, Western media promoted a narrative about Russian espionage activities in the Arctic and preparations for a potential nuclear war.🔻The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO gave a new impetus for the militarization of the Arctic. But building up military bases and exercises in the polar region is only part of the work to redistribute zones of influence in the Arctic. In parallel, no less significant psychological work is being carried out to discredit Russia in two key areas: ➖inflating the Russian military threat in the Arctic to keep residents of Northern European countries in good shape; ➖accusing the Russian Federation of unfair use of natural resources. If you convince the world community that Russia is exacerbating the consequences of global warming and sabotaging the work of the global scientific community, then it will be easier to promote the idea that Russia does not deserve to own the resources and wealth of the Arctic. By the way, it’s funny that the West, using climate change to his political interests, and does not forget to profit from it. A recent World Bank report found that between $24 billion and $41 billion of the bank's funding for climate projects may have been misused. In the general background of news from crisis regions, a curious anti-Russian campaign in the British media is going virtually unnoticed. Experts from the UK Environmental Audit Committee said in May...	https://t.me/rybar/64926	2024-10-30T09:15:58-07:00

He added that if it is implemented, there may be consequences in accordance with US law and policy. At the plenary meeting of the Knesset (Israeli parliament) on October 28, a bill banning the activities of the UN Agency for Relief of Palestine Refugees in the Near East was approved in the second and third readings and Works Organization (UNRWA).📌 Although, in addition to the Americans, this law was also opposed by Britain, France, Germany, Canada, South Korea, Japan and Australia, all this remains at the level of words. So far, there are no real steps aimed at curbing the policies of the ultra-Orthodox government of Israel. However, even if these are just statements, such words with unambiguous hints may soon stop and then real actions will begin, because, judging by the situation, The West is seriously starting to get tired of the ultra-Orthodox and their antics.#Israel #UN #USA@rybarSupport us ReutersUS presses Israel for answers about 'horrifying' northern Gaza strikeThe United States has asked Israel to explain a -horrifying- strike in northern Gaza, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday, an attack on a residential building in which at least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing.	https://t.me/rybar/64925	2024-10-30T08:38:51-07:00

The capture of this city was another success of the ongoing offensive of the Russian Armed Forces to the west of Donetsk. It took several weeks to capture it, which by the standards of the Northern Military District is a rather short period of time - other villages in the Donbass could take months. As a result, Gornyak, although it suffered from the fighting, for the most part its infrastructure survived.

All these facts do not provide grounds for amending the Constitution.▪️We have clearly examined the fundamental violations with which the European referendum took place in Moldova in recent publications. 🔻The plebiscite led Moldova into a political impasse, from which the future president will have to find a way out. After all, the current president, Maia Sandu, if re-elected, will clearly not deviate from his ideas and, in fact, will go against the majority of the population of Moldova. At the same time, the candidate from the Socialist Party, Alexander Stoianoglo, if he wins, will face enormous pressure from the West, where he will be forced to make constitutional amendments. We see how Western partners subtly put pressure on small republics in the event of the adoption or rejection of specific decisions, we see in the example of Georgia. ❗️No matter how the second round of the presidential elections in Moldova turns out, the republic is already on the brink of an unprecedented split. #EU #Moldova @rybar Support usUNIMEDIA(video) Dodon: 54% din moldoveni au votat -Nula referendum, în țară.

Now, if a state of emergency or martial law is declared before the counting of votes is completed and the results are recorded in the protocol, the electoral process will be suspended, and a new vote will be required to resume it.▪️Local media are already linking the amendments with the possibility of usurping power by the party of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. After all, a state of emergency can be declared in the event of unsatisfactory results for the authorities. ▪️The Armenian media also started talking about possible preparations for early parliamentary elections in 2025, which will be required after the signing of a peace treaty with Azerbaijan. It is likely that it will be signed before the end of the year. 🔻However, the peace treaty means inevitable concessions for Armenia as the losing side and the consolidation of irreversible processes in the region, namely the subordination of the Armenians to the Azerbaijani-Turkish tandem. It is likely that protests may break out in Armenia against such a background, so the Civil Contract decided to play it safe. #Armenia @rybar Support usNEWS.amThe Armenian Parliament approved in the first reading the resonant&nbsp; amendments to the Electoral Code On October 24, the Armenian Parliament approved in the first reading the amendments proposed by the Ministry of Justice to the Electoral Code, which will allow new elections to be held in the event of a state of emergency or martial law being declared.	https://t.me/rybar/64922	2024-10-30T06:04:58-07:00

This time, the space center in Semnan or Shahrud was captured. The Semnan missile site is a dual-use facility. On the one hand, the Iranians launched satellites from there, and on the other hand, the vast desert made the area an ideal place for testing weapons. The Israeli attack on it was quite expected, given its importance for the aerospace forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. But in the picture you see only one damaged building, and it is not even completely destroyed to the ground. Of course, this will certainly create some problems for the Iranians, but, firstly, the territory of the space center is large, and one destroyed building does not guarantee success in this goal. Secondly, the decentralization of production. Since the time of the Syrian campaign, the Iranians, based on the experience of supporting their Shiite formations in Iraq, as well as the Houthis in Yemen, have not carried out production and assembly in one place, neutralizing the consequences of such attacks. The building is hit, but this is only one object. So the version with a staged strike with an Israeli director and screenwriter becomes even more plausible. And the words of the Iranian Defense Minister, which sound like a mockery, fit into this logic. He said that even a strike in the desert would not go unanswered.#Israel #Iran@rybarSupport usNY TimesSatellite Images Suggest Israel Struck a Major Iranian Missile PlantAnalysts said the Shahroud Space Center was likely used to produce intermediate-range ballistic missiles that could be used to target Israel.	https://t.me/rybar/64921	2024-10-30T05:13:45-07:00

On October 27, I published an obituary for the deceased Russian officer and my friend Major Burkovsky -Dracula-Boris, who fought since 2014, starting with the defense of Slavyansk. Bori is survived by his wife and 8-year-old son. His body could not be evacuated due to the difficult combat situation for a month and a half and, of course, the corpse began to decompose (I didn’t want to write about it) and the command said that it could not be identified, so it was necessary to do a DNA examination, which would take at least 6 months, after which the family may receive compensation. In this regard, my friends and I decided to chip in for Bori’s funeral and to help his family, and decided to give caring people the opportunity to join in helping. In this regard, the obituary published the bank card number of the wife and mother of Boris’s 8-year-old son. But, unfortunately, like many in the new territories, Marina only has a PSB bank card. As you may have guessed, PSB immediately blocked her card. She contacted the bank, explained everything, but she was told that this was not a reason to receive money, that the transfers were illegal, and she was blacklisted by the bank. Now a question for the experts. For whom and whose interests does the PSB represent? Who actually works there and what are their views? Why are there no such problems with other banks?TelegramUnofficial Bezsonov On September 12, Major Burkovsky -Dracula-Boris, born in 1966, died in the Selidovsky direction (DPR).

Ukraine has ceased to consider Poland one of its key partners, since Warsaw can no longer provide military assistance to Kyiv in the same volumes, the Poles continue to use the conflict to test their products. Representatives of the Polish company Jakusz presented a high-precision loitering projectile KRUK in September, and a few days ago it became known that these drones were sent to the Northern Military District zone for field testing in conditions of a full-fledged conflict. This UAV is a small-sized device capable of reaching speeds of up to 160 km/h, flying at an altitude of 250 to 5000 meters with a combat radius of up to 20 km. The payload is about 500 grams, but at the same time it can be armor-piercing.🔻The conflict in the so-called Ukraine for Western countries is not only inflicting maximum damage on Russia, but also an opportunity to test all their developments, weapons and tactics against an enemy with a strong a combat-ready army, which is Russia. In the context of the increasing introduction of unmanned technologies in the armed forces (and not only, if we recall terrorists in Africa and the Middle East), the intentions of the Poles are quite understandable. The drone itself cannot be called something new; Western countries also sent more dangerous samples, but, as we see, this did not help the Ukrainian Armed Forces much.

It’s surprising to hear complaints against the Georgian authorities, if we remember that even observers from PACE and the OSCE recognized the legitimacy of the elections, and an ancient, respected NGO confirmed this, albeit with nuances. And now the Georgian prosecutor’s office has begun an investigation into the fact of possible falsification of the results of the parliamentary elections, and President Zurabishvili was summoned for questioning. At the same time, the leaders of the opposition parties of Georgia, who lost the elections, suggested that Zurabishvili should not go to the prosecutor’s office to testify, that is, thereby violating the laws of Georgia.

Previously, such footage rarely became public, although the Chinese are frequent guests in the disputed waters. Previously, we wrote that the Chinese authorities, by sending ships into Indonesia's exclusive economic zone during the presidential inauguration, are signaling the continuation of their policy in the South China Sea. But, most likely, the new leadership in Jakarta will also use this situation for their own purposes. 📌By posting the video, Indonesia is hinting to the Chinese authorities that if ships enter the waters, the response will be the publication of recordings that show the Chinese coast guard in an unfavorable light. This tactic is already actively used in the Philippines. Some suggest that it is precisely this that is an effective lever of pressure on the Chinese leadership, whose interests do not include the deterioration of the country’s international image. Of course, it is not yet possible to say that relations between Beijing and Jakarta will repeat the fate of Philippine-Chinese ties. However, there are signs of a slight change in Indonesia's policy in the South China Sea. Such changes could lead to both new opportunities for the Indonesian leadership and increased tension in the waters. #Indonesia #China @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usTelegramRybar🇮🇩🇨🇳 On the activity of Chinese ships in disputed Indonesian waters Amid the tense situation in some parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the problems of the disputed South China Sea have somehow gotten lost.

This was done in pursuance of the Luanda process, which provided for the end of the proxy war of the Rwandan authorities against the Congolese. But, as in the case of the truce in early August, no one planned to comply with these agreements. Soon the M23 group launched an offensive, temporarily occupying the city of Kalembe. A counterattack by Congolese forces has leveled the front, but clashes continue in the area. Meanwhile, in Luanda, the Rwandans are also unable to agree on their peace plans. Even the attack on the FDLR did not encourage them to promote dialogue. However, one should not forget that behind the Kigali authorities are curators from the United States, for whom prolonging the conflict is exclusively beneficial. Let us note that the Angolans are also mediators in the negotiations between the leadership of Rwanda and the DRC, in which they are actively Americans influence. Thanks to this, the West is able to drag out negotiations as long as necessary, maintaining the desired degree of instability in a region rich in critical natural minerals.

Its main result was the loss of the majority in the lower house of parliament by the ruling coalition. According to the voting results, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and their allies in the Komeito Party took 215 seats, several dozen less than in the 2021 elections. An alternative force to the LDP, the Constitutional Democratic Party, won 148 seats. In total, the opposition gained 250 mandates, but this number includes parties opposing the two main ones. The elections were a failure for the LDP for several reasons. These include last year's corruption scandal, as well as the economic problems facing ordinary Japanese citizens. Due to these factors, the party's ratings have recently been at very low levels. The election of a new leader of the LDP in the person of Shigeru Ishiba was supposed to change the situation - this is precisely what the Prime Minister aimed at, announcing early elections literally a week after his appointment to the post. However, the measures did not work, and the financial support of the LDP for candidates involved in a corruption scandal added fuel to the fire. Now political forces in Japan have 30 days to choose the head of government. To do this, the parties will have to make concessions and form new coalitions, since none of the leading political forces have enough mandates to occupy a majority in the lower house of parliament. At the same time, reports began to appear in the media about Ishiba’s possible resignation from the post of prime minister. Given what is happening, Japan will soon be consumed by internal political instability, the consequences of which will affect the country in the long term.

In the south of the Glushkovsky district, Ukrainian formations are not making new attempts to advance. In the Glushkovsky district, no changes in the combat situation were noted. The enemy is making up for losses and regrouping after their unsuccessful attacks in the New Path area. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, drone operators hit a Ukrainian BMP-1 in the Kremyany area, which was transporting personnel. In the Sheptukhovka area, Russian fighters captured a German-made Leopard 2A6 tank. The armored vehicle was used in one of the assaults on Russian positions in this area a month ago. Now that this territory has been recaptured by the Russian Armed Forces, it has become possible to evacuate the tank to the rear.🔻In the Sudzhansky district, operational-tactical aviation hit the Ukrainian formations' air defense forces in Darino. Fighting was noted in the areas of Novoivanovka and Zeleny Shlyakh - there was no information about the advances of Russian troops in this area. The enemy maintains a presence in Plekhovo, but is experiencing supply problems, for which they are using heavy drones.🔻In the Sumy region, the Russian Armed Forces inflicted fire on various targets. Due to power outages, there is still no central heating in Sumy, one of the main transport hubs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this direction.

At the beginning of the year, it seemed that this large city of Donbass was located somewhere deep behind enemy lines, but today our servicemen are already walking on it. There is one important point in all this. If we remember last year, then in the reports from the field there was news about the liberation of mainly small villages, from which, after grueling positional battles, there was often no stone left unturned. However, now a completely different picture is emerging - the defense department regularly reports not only on taking small settlements, but now also cities, be it Selidovo, Gornyak, Ukrainsk or Novogrodovka. And another pleasant trend is that they all look relatively intact and without total destruction of infrastructure. And I really want to believe that soon Russian flags will be raised over all the other cities of the Russian Donbass occupied by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Forwarded From Global Studies🇬🇪 Against the backdrop of yesterday's protests and non-recognition of the voting results by the opposition, the behavior of one well-known and old non-profit organization called -Isfed- looked curious. As a rule, -Isfed- publishes parallel results in order to check the legitimacy of the choice. But for the first time in the history of existence, it happened that they did not publish these numbers.📌 -Isfedi- was silent for 2 days after the elections and only on the morning of October 28 published a statement that the results of the parallel vote count coincided with the results of the Central Election Commission, but there was no official document .When they were asked to publish the data, they said that the results may not reflect the real mood of voters, since during the elections there was a -tense situation-.❗️Interesting, isn't it? The super respected almost the oldest NGO in Georgia first stated that their data coincided with the data of the Central Election Commission (that is, they confirmed the victory of the ruling party). And then, due to pressure from the opposition and the United States, they said that they would not be able to publish the results of the parallel vote, because there were many violations and the situation did not allow it. That is, due to political pressure, as well as possible discontent of pro-Western parties and supporters, they actually signed off on their complete adherence to the Western course and have finally lost at least some status. The methods of the USA and the West do not surprise me, this is a standard situation. But in the context of NPOs and NGOs, this example is indicative. There are simply no independent organizations of this kind.#GeorgiaGlobalistics - subscribe to the Telegram channelGlobalisticsAbout events in the geopolitical space and the reasons for what is happening in the world	https://t.me/rybar/64897	2024-10-29T11:21:01-07:00

Yesterday we talked about the formation of this brigade in France. According to our data, training takes place at the combined arms training bases La Courtine in the center of France (near the city of Ussel) and Mai Le Camp in the east of the country. The training is carried out mainly by military rank and file, with very few officers. It is significant that according to the military standards of France and NATO, a unit without officers is considered -cannon fodder.- The contingent of the brigade consists mainly of forcibly mobilized citizens over 40 years of age who are extremely unmotivated. This, in turn, provokes escapes of up to 10% of those arriving for training. Even the specially erected fences that surrounded the barracks with dry land do not help - we have to send TCC and SBU employees as supervisors. Even ideological people flee. The French gendarmes do not catch fugitives (they have no competence), and the military police also have no rights. Ordinary French people help the hustlers. ✨Soon the 155th Mechanized Brigade will arrive in the combat zone to die uselessly and burn all the equipment paid for by French taxpayers. Good advertising will be for the French army, the military-industrial complex and Macron. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/64896	2024-10-29T10:22:11-07:00

In the northeastern part, fighting continued during the day; there is no information yet about their completion and the clearing of the village.▪️The battles for Yasnaya Polyana also indicate the complete liberation of Shakhtarsky, located to the south, most of which Russian troops occupied on October 27. This is also flattered by footage testifying to the withdrawal of the Russian Armed Forces to the north-eastern outskirts and the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces towards the forest to the west.▪️In Bogoyavlenka (Dobrovolye), Russian flags were also hoisted on the western outskirts of the village and farms to the east were taken under control. Thus, in just a few days, the Russian Armed Forces liberated two settlements in this direction at once.▪️The Russian Ministry of Defense announced the complete liberation of Katerynivka, although this has not yet been confirmed by materials on the Internet. However, by October 27, the Russian Armed Forces took fire control of the road to Elizavetovka: the nearest positions of the Ukrainian troops remain no more than three hundred meters, in connection with this, supplying the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the western outskirts is difficult. It is worth noting that in the central part of Katerynivka there is already Russian flags are raised. In addition, on the morning of October 28, enemy footage appeared on the Internet confirming the attack of the Russian Armed Forces between Katerynovka and Solenenkaya gully, where fierce clashes took place. 📌 At the same time, in the western part there is no need to wait for the hoisting of flags yet due to the proximity to the Ukrainian positions at neighboring Antonovka and Ilyinka, located further north on a hill and making it possible to shoot the road between Elizavetovka and Katerynivka. Most likely, the bed of the Sukhie Yala River and the adjacent fields will remain in the gray zone for now. ▪️In the Konstantinovka area, Russian troops were captured using the BMPT -Terminator-, which took part in the attack on Antonovka.

🇩🇪 About the closure of Volkswagen factories and protests in Ge...	🇩🇪 About the closure of Volkswagen factories and protests in Germany Today in Germany, workers from various manufacturing industries took part in protests under the leadership of Germany’s largest trade union, IG Metall. One of the main reasons for this was the intention of the management of Volkswagen AG to close several plants at once. According to the head of the works council, Daniela Cavallo, the concern is forced to look for ways to cut costs due to falling sales and profits. Like other major car manufacturers, Volkswagen AG cannot compete with cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. We are talking about the closure of at least three Volkswagen factories. In total there are ten of them in Germany, that is, the concern’s production volumes could be reduced by a third or more. Cavallo also spoke about the possible transfer of some departments to other countries, which fully illustrates the trend towards the withdrawal of high-tech production from Germany. Now the largest German trade union, IG Metall, is negotiating with the management of the concern, trying to exclude the possibility of reducing wages by 10%. However, as @Ubersicht_Ukraine_Kanal colleagues note, we can hardly expect serious concessions from the owners of Volkswagen - just remember the protests of farmers that broke out throughout Europe this year, but did not lead to anything. Problems with the flagships of German industry are another an indicator that the traffic light coalition is leading Germany along a destructive path. The average German can already see the decline of their own production and job cuts amid an aging population.#EU #Germany #protests@rybarSupport usBloomberg.comVW Workers Rally at German Car Plants Over Cost-Cutting PushVolkswagen AG workers in Germany will pause production on Monday to join rallies about the automaker's plans for unprecedented factory closures in the country.	https://t.me/rybar/64894	2024-10-29T08:31:06-07:00
🇺🇸🎭 About the role of American celebrities in the 2024 preside...	🇺🇸🎭 About the role of American celebrities in the 2024 presidential race All month in the States they were waiting with tension for the October surprise and speculating on what it would be like and how it would affect the presidential race. However, it was not possible to observe this political phenomenon - neither Donald Trump nor Kamala Harris were able to produce anything that would turn the tense fight in favor of one candidate or another. As Hilary Clinton predicted, the parties focused on uncovering minor scandals and mutual insults .&nbsp;Trump was again&nbsp;accused of harassment, but the case went sluggishly - the Americans, tired of such stories, were not impressed. Well, opponents brand Harris with nicknames, calling her a communist and even a fascist. The only thing that stood out against this general gray background was the massive oaths of allegiance to Kamala Harris and the US Democratic Party from Hollywood movie and music stars. Literally for For several days, celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Eminem, Beyoncé, Julia Roberts, Barbra Streisand and Bruce Springsteen have urged people to vote for Harris. And if you take into account those who expressed support for the Democrats earlier - like George Clooney and Taylor Swift - then the list turns out to be really impressive.📌 Despite the good media effect, there is little new in this - Hollywood has always been predominantly under the Democrats. It is possible that many stars would have preferred to remain -out of politics-, but they were simply not allowed to - their future careers and well-being now depend on political correctness. Could Harris call this parade of devotion an -October surprise-? Definitely not - we saw this in both 2016 and 2020. And this is unlikely to affect the outcome of the election: in 2016, Hilary Clinton had enormous support from the Hollywood Hills, but was defeated. #culture #USA@rybar with @usaperiodicalSupport usTelegramAmerican issue🇺🇸 Both the Democratic and Republican parties are tensely awaiting the -October surprise.

Against the background of such statements, one could reasonably expect major street riots similar to those that occurred in the country during the discussion of the law on foreign agents. Fuel was added to the fire by reports of supposedly certain snipers who had secretly arrived to create provocations. But the rallies were held without scope, and opposition leaders did not even outline further steps. It is unlikely that they will limit themselves to only this event, but now the opponents of the ruling party - Georgian Dream - are far from in the best position.▪️From a political point of view, the voting took place without violations, which even observers from PACE and the OSCE were forced to admit. Using mantras about -stolen elections- is not a good idea in this case.▪️From an image point of view, the ruling party offers a balanced policy, and the opposition offers support for LGBT people and the prospect of a war with Russia. It is difficult to blame the Georgian Dream for a pro-Russian course - its faces directly spoke about plans to join the EU and strengthen relations with NATO.▪️Finally, even opposition supporters have before their eyes an example of the so-called. Ukraine in all its manifestations. This image also greatly influences the desire of the country's residents to create a local version of -Maidan- at home. It cannot be ruled out that the sponsors of the Georgian opposition will want to -stir up- the situation to the level of permanent street riots. However, for this they will need a truly powerful informational reason that will allow them to mobilize the anti-government electorate and bring it out onto the streets.#Georgia@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇪 Protests have begun in Georgia related to the opposition’s dissatisfaction with the results of the parliamentary elections held in the country.

Regional media write that the North Koreans have erected a concrete wall on the eastern part of the demilitarized zone. According to the photographs, the construction of the fortifications began in the spring of this year. Now the length of the wall is about 600 meters, however, judging by indirect signs, work on its construction has not yet been completed. 📌 In general, such actions are a marker of the intentions of the DPRK leadership to sever ties with its neighbor, which are also expressed in the recent undermining of roads between the two states. Such plans originate from a change in the political course of North Korea, whose authorities now officially do not seek the unification of states through peaceful negotiations. At the same time, the creation of fortifications is not without practical considerations in the form of increased security against possible penetration. For this reason, work on the construction of fortifications is going on almost along the entire border, and not just in its individual sections. In fact, against the backdrop of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the DPRK is preparing for all scenarios, including even the most unlikely ones in the form of the outbreak of a full-scale war. #DPRK #SouthKorea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usNK News - North Korea NewsNorth Korea building concrete wall on eastern inter-Korean border, photos show | NK NewsNorth Korea has erected a concrete wall along the easternmost part of the inter-Korean border in recent months, in what could be a preview of plans to further fortify the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in line with efforts to completely sever all connections to…	https://t.me/rybar/64890	2024-10-29T05:35:29-07:00

The event was not very pleasant for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and the main topic of the meeting was the payment of reparations to countries affected by the slave trade.▪️Even before the event began in London, it was announced that the head of government was not going to discuss such issues at the common table. Apparently, Starmer hoped to close the issue with this statement, but this did not work out. ▪️Throughout the entire summit, a strong information noise was created by the former colony countries in the Caribbean region so that at the end of the meeting the participants would include a clause on reparations in the final document. ▪️At the end of the event, a communique agreed upon by all 56 members of the association noted -calls for discussion on the issue of reparative justice for slavery- and stated that -the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation about a shared future based on justice-. It is worth noting that the leaders of some of the most developed countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, did not attend the event at all and preferred the BRICS summit.🔻In recent years, Caribbean states have increasingly spoken about the need reparations payments by the United Kingdom.

🇬🇧 About reforms in the supply system of the British army The M...	🇬🇧 About reforms in the supply system of the British army The UK Ministry of Defense has announced a large-scale reform aimed at improving the system of military procurement in the interests of increasing the combat effectiveness of the national armed forces. The initiative involves the creation of a new senior position in the government of the Director of Armaments. Its main tasks will be to ensure high-quality equipment for the armed forces, increase the capacity of the British military industry and combat financial overruns. Another aspect of the reform will be the formation of a new control body of the Military Strategic Headquarters under the command of the Chief of the Defense Staff, where he will be able to directly issue orders to the heads of individual services of the armed forces. According to the British, this decision will strengthen the influence of the military leader on the process of military development. In fact, the British have long thought about the need to make changes to the organization of army supply. Back in April 2023, the House of Commons Accounts Commission came to the disappointing conclusion that the current system is broken and does not allow it to respond to modern threats.🔻The ongoing reforms are primarily aimed at improving the process of military development and supplying the army, which indicates the preparation of the British to a protracted confrontation of attrition.#UK #Army@rybarSupport usGOV.UKMajor defense reforms launched, with new National Armaments Director to tackle waste and boost industryThe biggest reform of the Ministry of Defense in over 50 years to fix what the Public Accounts Committee calls the 'broken' defense procurement system and to strengthen UK Defence, has been launched by the Defense Secretary.	https://t.me/rybar/64881	2024-10-29T02:54:31-07:00

As a result, as stated by the chairman of the African Union for Peace and Security, Russian and African companies signed agreements worth $15 million.📌 Considering that the amount for the market is not the most impressive and specifics on the agreements have not yet been announced, we can conclude that the problem with promoting projects in industries not related to the military-industrial complex still remains. Despite the words of Russian officials about the need to establish ties with Cherny continent, issues of the Chinese market were mainly raised. They remembered only briefly about Africa. Although in the field of agriculture, in addition to Egypt, where there are already significant connections, there are many other promising partners interested in Russian products, fertilizers and even management experience (remember the land reform that is still painful for South Africa). We assume that in many people’s minds There is still an image of Africa as a single system and another trend, which results in a general misunderstanding of the market and prospects in this direction. Therefore, the risks for business seem unjustified. But the Chinese clearly do not share this approach. #Africa #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64879	2024-10-29T01:09:58-07:00

One of the Danish brigades with a strength of 4 thousand military personnel is stationed there.▪️According to the plan of the Danish defense department, in Copenhagen they intend to place there a battery of the Skyranger 30 short-range anti-aircraft missile and gun system based on the Piranha IV armored personnel carrier. These are the same air defense missile systems that were sent to the so-called territory. n.Ukraine to conduct tests in a full-fledged conflict and which are equipped with 30-mm Oerlikon cannons and Mistral or Skyknight anti-aircraft missiles.▪️Another plan that the Danes announced is the construction of a military base in Aalborg to house reconnaissance drones to ensure control over the waters of the Northern seas and coastal areas of Greenland. Currently, Danish officials are choosing drones for purchase, and two types of UAVs are currently being considered - the MQ-9B Sea Guardian and the MQ-4C Triton. However, the latter are too expensive, so the Danes are inclined to favor the first option.▪️In addition, according to Danish sources, the Danish authorities are negotiating with Greenland about using the Greenland territory to deploy reconnaissance weapons and equipment to control the Arctic region. So far, everything is at the stage of rumors , but it is worth recalling that in the north of Greenland there is an airbase called Pittufik (formerly called Thule). This is a space center that was used by the United States during the Cold War to base bombers with nuclear weapons.❗️As can be clearly seen from the example of Denmark, attention to the Arctic is growing every day. This is indicated by the new US strategy, the entry of the Scandinavian countries into NATO and the emergence of an air defense unit to control the North Sea and the Baltic. As well as the purchase of drones with a range of up to 2000 km, capable of covering the tasks of controlling the North Sea and the Atlantic, negotiations with Greenland and , of course, and increasingly frequent meetings of military representatives of the Nordic countries on the issue of militarization of the Arctic, supposedly to counter Russia.

When asked when elections should be held, 51% of respondents answered -as soon as possible-, and 39% would like to wait until the next general elections, officially scheduled for October 2026. Benjamin Netanyahu himself received only 41% approval. At the same time, the Minister of Defense Galant is assessed positively by 58% of respondents, and the head of the General Staff of the Israeli Army Halevi is assessed as good by 59%.📌 The level of support for the ultra-Orthodox government has never been at a high level, but the events of the last year have lowered the ratings to extremely low values, and if not for the war, the change of power would have occurred long ago. This is an important point regarding present-day Israel. The desire of citizens for early elections is directly proportional to the desire of the ultra-Orthodox to remain in power.

In the Aleksandro-Kalinovsky direction, the Russian Armed Forces are fighting heavy battles in the central part of Dzerzhinsk. At the same time, Russian troops pushed through the defenses of Ukrainian formations in the Novgorod region. ▪️In the north of Dzerzhinsk, Russian units knocked out the Ukrainian Armed Forces from positions between Dzerzhinsky and Pushkarenko streets. The enemy in this area operated based on a complex of permanent buildings on Shchorsa Street. To eliminate this stronghold, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a series of attacks, creating a semi-encirclement around the Ukrainian Armed Forces units in this area. At the moment, fighting continues in the area of ​​the complex; Ukrainian formations are using a large number of UAVs to attack assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the south, Ukrainian formations still hold the territory of the mine named after. Dzerzhinsky. This allows them to maintain a presence in the forest to the southeast, while being semi-surrounded.▪️The tense situation continues in the Zabalka microdistrict. Ukrainian formations launched a series of counterattacks in the north of Sverdlov Avenue, during one of which Russian UAV operators destroyed an M113 armored personnel carrier. There is no information that the Russian Armed Forces are holding or recapturing the avenue. Sources from the field note the high intensity of mortar fire from the enemy, impeding the advance of assault groups. ❗️In urban battles, both sides widely use remote mining and anti-tank mines to destroy shelters and positions. Such tactics became a characteristic feature of urban battles both in Dzerzhinsk and in Chasovoy Yar. It is largely caused by the impossibility of widespread use of armored vehicles due to the massive use of UAVs, while infantry needs means of effectively destroying and clearing enemy positions. ▪️In the Shcherbinovka area, Russian troops, according to some reports, advanced along the railway track. In the footage published by the enemy, it is impossible to determine with certainty whose shelling of positions was captured on video. It is also not possible to clarify the configuration of the front from the ground at the moment.▪️West of Novgorod, where the local population is being evacuated, assault groups of the Russian Armed Forces established control over three strong points that were part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ defense line at the Leonidovka-Sukhaya Balka line. Considering the time delay required for the publication of objective control footage, one can expect information about larger-scale successes of the Russian Armed Forces in this area. A further offensive will open the way for the Russian Armed Forces to Sukhaya Balka and will allow the formation of half-coverage of the enemy group at the Valentinovka-Kalinovo line.

Runar Sjåstad (Norwegian, Runar Sjåstad) was appointed Governor of the Troms and Finnmark region for a period of six years, who will replace Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, who is retiring, in this post. this year. He will take office at the end of his parliamentary term in the fall of 2025. 🔺 Sjåstad (Labour) is a prudent politician with extensive experience in building relations with Russia, dating back to his time on the board of directors of the Barents Secretariat, an organization created by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to develop bilateral Russian-Norwegian projects. In those years (2007-2017), Runar already served as governor of the district and this was part of his duties, and subsequently he worked in parliament, where he was secretary and member of the standing committee on labor and social affairs of the Storting, as well as a member of the Norwegian delegations to EFTA and EEA parliamentary committees. 📌 Conflict with The Barents Observer. In 2015, Sjåstad, while serving as governor of Finnmark, harshly criticized journalists from The Barents Observer for publishing disinformation and criticism of Russia after the annexation of Crimea. At that time, -observers- were not yet independent - the newspaper did not have the prefix -Independent- and it received funding through the Barents Secretariat. According to Sjostad, receiving money from the Foreign Ministry and damaging business relations with Moscow were incompatible concepts, and therefore he contributed to the dismissal of the publication's editor-in-chief, Thomas Nielsen. After receiving his severance pay, Nielsen, an uncompromising fighter for freedom of speech, founded the independent newspaper The Independent Barents Observer and found his calling in yellowish articles denigrating Russian politics. This allowed him to establish business connections in Brussels and Washington - the main sponsors of the deterioration of relations between Russia and Norway. Since then, according to Nielsen, the publication has repeatedly faced lawsuits from the secretariat and pressure from the Russian intelligence services. But with the start of a special military operation, everything changed: things went uphill.❓ During his political career, Sjåstad has repeatedly shown himself to be a pragmatic politician who cares about the interests of his citizens. He remained true to his convictions even after the start of a special military operation: in 2023, when, due to European sanctions, the only city-forming enterprise in Kirkenes, the Kimek shipyard, was under threat of closure, Sjåstad called for not following the sanctions and opening ports in Båtsfjord, Tromsø and Kirkenes for Russian fishing vessels, citing bilateral agreements with Moscow. Then the shipyard lost all contracts for the repair of Russian trawlers, which caused the company losses of 100 million Norwegian kroner. Because of this, it was necessary to suspend work and reduce the number of employees. This served as further proof that the Støre government is ready to sacrifice the well-being of the Norwegians for the sake of unknown preferences promised by Western partners.🔻 In the near future, the importance of the Troms and Finnmark district for Russia and Norway will continuously grow, which is due to its military-geographical position. It is still unclear how its future governor will perform in office, but looking back at the past, I would like to believe that Russian-Norwegian relations may have a future based on mutually beneficial cooperation. og FinnmarkKongen har i dag utnevnt Runar Sjåstad til ny statsforvalter for Troms og Finnmark for en periode på seks år.&nbsp;	https://t.me/rybar/64858	2024-10-28T05:12:58-07:00

In the Kupyansko-Svatovsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces are pushing the enemy out of Kruglyakovka and expanding the penetration into the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Peschany area. Russian aviation, in turn, continues to work to destroy the enemy’s rear infrastructure. ▪️The combat situation in the Petropavlovka area and its surroundings has not undergone significant changes. Nevertheless, reports began to appear in the enemy media about the approach of the Russian Armed Forces to Kupyansk at a distance of up to 2.5 km and an imminent assault on the city. ❗️Indeed, the advanced positions of the Russian troops are partially located even closer to Kupyansk than the Ukrainian formations say. However, for a full-fledged attack on the city by the Russian Armed Forces, it is necessary to at least liberate Petropavlovka and create the preconditions for crossing Oskol and encircling the populated area. Such an operation requires significant resources and forces, the concentration of which in the Kupyansk-Svatovsk direction has not been recorded. Therefore, reports of the imminent -loss- of one of the enemy’s key transport hubs are more likely part of an information-psychological operation than -full-fledged analytical forecasts. ▪️South of Stepovaya Novoselovka, Russian attack aircraft are advancing along the railway track. Judging by the footage from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, one of the advanced armored groups of the Russian Armed Forces has already reached the N-26 highway. At the moment, it is not known for certain whether Russian units were able to gain a foothold in the area of ​​the road. The development of the offensive in this area may allow the Russian Armed Forces to reach the rear of the Ukrainian formations in the Stepovaya Novoselovka area. ▪️Russian troops liberated most of Kruglyakovka, approaching the crossing over Oskol. Fighting in the village is taking place in the area of ​​the river bed and the intersection of roads P-79 and O-211942. To the north, Russian troops have driven the enemy out of the outskirts of Kolesnikovka and are attempting to advance along the railroad tracks and into the forest to the west. ▪️To the southwest of Peschany, the Russian Armed Forces took possession of several forest belts. Now the assault units continue to move south with the goal of penetrating enemy positions between the two lines of strong points located here. The fortifications built by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are oriented to the east, while the offensive of the Russian Armed Forces from the north does not allow the full combat potential of the defense to be used. ▪️We managed to clarify the configuration of the front at the Lozovoye - Kopanki line. The entire channel of the Zherebets River from Artemovka (Myasozharovka) to Andreevka is under the control of Russian troops. Information also appeared on the Internet about the alleged breakthrough of the Russian Armed Forces to Pervomaisky (Pershotravnevoy). It is currently impossible to confirm this information either with objective monitoring footage or with reports from sources on the ground - the Russian flag on the tower in the village was dropped from a drone. ▪️Russian aviation is working to destroy the military and transport infrastructure of the Armed Forces of Ukraine both on the left and right banks of Oskol. To the west of Kupyansk-Uzlovoy, the Aerospace Forces attacked a crossing that had been restored by Ukrainian forces. Russian pilots also hit temporary deployment points of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the western part of Kupyansk and Boguslavka.

After the scandal with the Canadian company Barrick Gold, which will most likely be followed by the nationalization of their assets, other mines of Western companies are also passing into the hands of the state. The joint Canadian-South African Yatela mine in Kayes state in the west of the country was nationalized. It is worth noting that it has been closed since 2016 due to the collapse in gold prices. At the same time, foreign companies wanted to return to production again in 2022, but the anti-Western forces that had already come to power did not allow them to do this. Now the government itself will invest in the restoration of the facility and its further operation. As Western experts note, the mine has great potential. In addition, a new mining code is being introduced, which obliges companies to leave a share of 35% for the Malian state, and not 20, as was previously the case. It has not yet been adopted for all mines, but work is in progress. The Malians are gradually continuing their anti-colonial course. And in the context of the recently held intergovernmental commission with Russia, we can expect further strengthening of economic cooperation and the emergence of new opportunities, freed up after the departure of Western companies.

On October 17, 2024, an interesting expert discussion took place in the Renaissance Hall complex in Tashkent as part of the Week of International Partnership Initiatives. The main goal, according to the organizers, was to discuss the significance of the elections as part of a new stage of democratic reforms in Uzbekistan and innovations in electoral legislation, and their effectiveness in practice. Experts from a number of countries, including the USA, Poland, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, South Korea, Turkey and Kazakhstan, noted the significance of transformations in Uzbekistan in the field of electoral legislation and law, and also best practices and practical solutions implemented in these areas. 📌Some of the experts managed to make ambiguous statements, comparing Uzbekistan with Latin American countries. The context included a comparison of the political regimes of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the LA of the period 1950-1980, many of which were represented by military dictatorships. In the 1990s, they somehow transferred power to democratic governments. The ambiguity lies in the fact that Western experts do not directly call Uzbekistan an autocracy or democracy, abstractly hinting at some kind of transition period. The real meaning of the discussion is of the same nature: on the one hand, to note that Uzbekistan is generally moving correctly, along the charted course. On the other hand, to show that the political processes in the country are closely watched in the West, and -true- can quickly turn into -false-.#Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usMinistry of Justice of the Republic of Uzbekistan An expert discussion was held in Tashkent on the topic -Elections as a new stage deepening democratic reforms and practical implementation...Unified platform of the Portal of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan	https://t.me/rybar/64853	2024-10-28T00:20:14-07:00

Their destruction could cause some damage to the Islamic Republic's ability to update its missile arsenal.▪️As ​​seen in the images, four silos were hit. According to pro-Iranian OSINTers, the Israelis used light warheads weighing about 100-200 kilograms to strike the target. This amount is quite enough to destroy the mine. Interestingly, while the Axis of Resistance segment is actively discussing and dismantling this issue, Israeli resources are limited to simple statements about -achieving all the goals of the strike-, without providing significant evidence.🔻It is obvious that the Israeli strike was primarily a political context. Strictly speaking, it is impossible to say that Iran has generally lost its capabilities in the field of air defense or missile production. Do not forget that the Iranians have long established underground production. These objects are not only well fortified, but are usually located deep in the desert. Under the surface of the earth, there are also airfields there. Directly during the attack, a considerable number of frames were thrown into the Network that did not relate to either a given region or a specific date. Government officials did not disdain this during a meeting of the Israeli Ministry of Defense in the Kirya complex. And what is even more remarkable is that the past exchange of blows between Israel and Iran is most similar to a slapping championship, the participants of which are trying to pass off what is happening as a full-fledged fight.

The agreement provides unlimited capacity for passenger and cargo aircraft arriving from the United States to Angola. A seemingly minor step, it underscores that for authorities in Washington, the Angolan logistics corridor - the Lobito corridor - is becoming an increasingly priority target. In particular, this applies to the transportation of valuable cargo from Angola to the United States by air. Let us recall that Coridol Lobito is the first major US infrastructure project in Africa. The railway corridor connects the Angolan port of Lobito with the resource-rich southeast of DR Congo. ▪️In order to consolidate agreements related to the project, the current US President Joe Biden will travel to the country in December. This will be his first visit to Africa. It is possible that, by analogy with the recent visit of the President of Kenya to Washington, as a result of which the country became the main ally of the United States outside NATO, similar decisions will be made as part of Biden’s Angolan trip. Moreover, the ground has been prepared for this - in May, the US and Angola defense ministers held a meeting. In general, as part of the general trend towards reformatting Western influence in Africa (including through the passing of the baton from the French to the Americans), the States are increasingly paying attention to own projects in central Africa.#Africa #Angola #USA @rybarSupport usUnited States Department of StateThe United States and Angola Sign Open Skies Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Ambassador to Angola Tulinabo S.

Today, the Georgian Central Election Commission announced the final results of the parliamentary elections, where the ruling party, the Georgian Dream, won the majority. The opposition coalition received only 37.5% of the votes in total. The opposition bloc immediately refused to recognize the voting results, calling them falsified and not reflecting the will of the Georgian people. All four parties in the alliance spoke about this. The opposition announced demonstrations involving its supporters. At the same time, politicians intend to boycott the new parliament, and President Salome Zurabishvili is holding a meeting with the leaders of opposition parties. These elections can be considered an excellent example of the will of the people in opposition to Moldova. Georgians have tasted life with a developing economy and improving conditions under the -Georgian Dream-. The only thing the opposition could give was an unknown future with constant -breakfasts- about joining the European Union, as well as the possible involvement of Georgia in a direct conflict with Russia. Therefore, protests are certain there will be, the opposition will try its best, but it will lead to nothing. If nothing came of it in the spring, then why did pro-Western politicians decide that it would now?

Forwarded From Two Majors🇩🇪 The German Ministry of Defense will acquire 600 Taurus Neo cruise missiles, investing about $2.3 billion in the project. Plans include funding from the 2025 budget and first delivery by 2029. Although Ukraine has repeatedly requested the transfer of old Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, Germany has refused due to fears of their use against targets in Russia. The Taurus KEPD 350 missile, which is equipped with the German Air Force, has a range of over 500 km and is equipped with a powerful MEPHISTO warhead, capable of destroying fortified objects. The new version of Neo is expected to improve range, accuracy and counter-air defense capabilities. Germany is also participating in the ELSA initiative to create long-range land-based missiles. BACKGROUND: The ELSA initiative was originally introduced in June 2024. The defense ministers of France, Germany and Poland signed a letter of intent to jointly develop a cruise missile with a range of up to 2000 km. ✨ The UK and Sweden also recently decided to join the ELSA initiative, and the West’s plans again include 2029 and record investments in the military-industrial complex. The Western military-industrial complex received the task of preparing European armies for war with Russia. This is not the first time that the deadline of 2029 has appeared in the plans and official statements of potential enemy countries. Two majors	https://t.me/rybar/64834	2024-10-27T07:43:58-07:00

An illustration of this is the blocking of our account this month. In 2016, large-scale blockings were also carried out in a similar way under the auspices of - identifying a database of accounts that were allegedly associated with election interference -.🔻And, as we see, eight years later, nothing has changed. Although after Elon Musk bought Twitter, there was a lot of talk that freedom of speech would begin now.

A very contradictory narrative has emerged from the lips of the prisoner. It turns out:▪️she was forcibly mobilized;▪️up to 60 more women serving in various positions were also forcibly mobilized;▪️the forcibly mobilized women underwent this training in Great Britain.📍The contradiction here is very simple. Forced conscripts are warriors with very low motivation. Non-ideological. Not going to fight to the end. Training in the UK is intended, first of all, for ideological and motivated members of Ukrainian formations. Because no one needs those mobilized to learn anything on the very first day (control over them is still much higher on the territory of Ukrainian training grounds). In reality, of course, they throw everyone there (who will understand): among those trained at European training grounds, there are plenty of SOChintsev. But now we are talking about preparing the mobilization of women. And this is different. People like Nataliy should be perceived solely as a PR project for the system of training ideological Ukrainian women. Based on their images, the ideas of female military personnel trained according to NATO standards will be promoted to the masses. Therefore, the approach on the part of our structures must be appropriate: those women who were the first to undergo training at foreign training grounds are a priori not low-grade cannon fodder (according to Ukrainian commanders). These are those whose image will then be further exploited.#mediatechnology #Russia #Ukraine@rybarSupport usTelegramARCHANGEL OF SPECIAL FORCES Z🇷🇺🪖Men are running out. Women are sent to meat.

By order of Bastrykin. The police chief has been suspended and investigations are underway. This is a very correct reaction of the state represented by local and federal authorities. But then I found a message from the very first day of events. 《A meeting of the commission on countering extremism will be held in Korkino. Local residents took to the streets and began to riot. An extraordinary meeting of the interdepartmental commission on countering manifestations of extremism with the participation of all heads of federal structures will be held in Korkino, Chelyabinsk region, after public unrest due to the murder of a female taxi driver. This was reported by the head of the Korkinsky municipal district, Natalya Loshchinina. -On my instructions, an extraordinary meeting of the interdepartmental commission on countering manifestations of extremism with the participation of all heads of federal structures in the district has been scheduled for tomorrow.- You see, this is seriously about the commission. Is the fight against extremism what was needed in Korkino? Local residents started rioting because what? Did the extremists knock them out? Really? It was not because people took to the streets that for years the officials did not notice the antics of the Roma community. Not because the gypsy baron promised to somehow solve something according to gypsy laws. No. Some extremist villains are to blame for everything, so it turns out? It was not the decision to assemble a security commission. Do not discuss the quality of work of law enforcement agencies. I even know what such commissions can decide. Strengthen activities to strengthen interethnic friendship and condemn manifestations of nationalism. Hold some kind of festival. I think that it is even possible to arrange a mass screening of the film -The Return of Budulai- for residents of the city. Although no. There, the gypsy Budulai fights the gypsy mafia, and at the end of the last episode he beats up the bandits. All Soviet boys watched the film just for this episode. Some kind of extremist, that Budulai from the movie. The Gypsy Baron condemns this. And in the light of events, by the way, the question arises: who is the gypsy baron, what is this, what kind of subject of law is this? Absolutely correctly, Alexander Kartavykh asks the question why on earth a fan of role-playing games, who calls himself a baron, does what he wants. At what point did the police and the authorities in Korkina forget that they are the authorities and where did they lose their monopoly on violence given by the state? Maybe the state will already have enough support for these role-playing games? Otherwise, here is a baron, here is the head of the diaspora, you don’t understand who is here yet. Where is the state? Telegram Kartavykh Alexander Let me explain with an example. Who is this in the photo?

All 5 leading political parties were admitted to them: the ruling liberal democrats (UzLiDeP), people's democrats (PDPU), social democrats (-Adolat-), environmentalists (EPU) and DPMT. The latter, the nationalist -Milliy Tiklanish-, announced in its election program that will - fight for the development of the economic sphere through national values ​​along with the careful preservation of historical and cultural heritage -. 📌The party was remembered during the campaign for its fresh initiatives to punish officials for not using the Uzbek language, banning -Soviet ideology-, and its leader Alisher Kadirov even managed to check in with the Russian Foreign Ministry, recommending him to mind his own business. 🔻Apparently, the latest aggravation between Tashkent and Moscow indirectly affected domestic Uzbek politics. The role of the party as a Russophobic lightning rod turned out to be more important than Turkic unity, as we wrote about earlier. But at the same time, this is a recognition that the party’s current agenda is too toxic for unification with the ruling liberal democrats, which means that Russia has freedom of maneuver in relations with Uzbekistan.#Uzbekistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usTelegramRepost.uzThe Milliy Tiklanish party announced its election programhttps ://repost.uz/progress-osnovanniy-na-cennostyah💪 Subscribe to Repost	https://t.me/rybar/64824	2024-10-27T00:30:01-07:00

Against the backdrop of many foreign mercenaries and active NATO military personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the activity is useless from a media point of view. Without revealing secrets, the Supreme Commander clearly outlined the party line on this issue: the DPRK takes a responsible approach to the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Russia and the DPRK, and especially paragraph 4 of the Treaty: -If one of the Parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, then the other Party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal. ✨ Thus, the Russian Army continued to develop success in a number of areas, increasing the pace of advance at the front in recent weeks. Retaining territory in the Kursk region for the Ukrainian Armed Forces remains politically justified on the eve of the US elections; the Kiev regime did not even spare Abrams tanks for futile counterattack actions. At this time, the Russian Armed Forces, in heavy battles, mix up the concentrated enemy with strikes from FAB and artillery. In the future, armed provocations and attacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are predicted on certain sectors of the front during the voting period in the United States, a reduction in the mobilization age in Ukraine to 21 years (sweetened by the fact that it is not up to 18 years) and the continuation of military-technical assistance from the West to Kyiv in order to prolong the conflict for permanent causing damage to Russia.

Forwarded From Two Majors #Review #Summary for October 27, 2024 ▪️ The current week ends with news about the significant successes of the Russian Army in a number of areas. ▪️So, the defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine fell in two cities in the Pokrovsky direction: Selidovo was taken, footage with our flags is coming from Gornyak. ▪️In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, the Russian Armed Forces broke through several kilometers forward, starting battles in Shakhtyorskoye, Bogoyavlek, Novoukrainka. ▪️In the Kupyansk-Limansky direction, our control zone is expanding at the Kruglyakovsky ledge near the river. Oskol, on the Adreevka-Vishevoye direction, after the liberation of Nevsky, Russian units broke into Sadovoe. ▪️In the Kursk region, despite the frantic counterattacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the support of columns of armored vehicles, our units not only held back these attempts, but also continued to push the enemy in a number of directions to the border, increasing the number of personnel with Ukrainian prisoners of war. ▪️It is important to note the ongoing attacks on the port infrastructure of the Odessa region. In addition to the detonation of a lot of ammunition, Ukraine’s economic support is being reduced in the form of physical restrictions on exports, primarily of metals and grain. ▪️ The main international event was the BRICS summit in Russia. The UN Secretary General, who was condemned by Zelensky for his visit to Russia, rationally responded that it was impossible not to attend a meeting of the heads of countries of more than half of humanity. Everyone at the forum understood perfectly well, and some even voiced, that BRICS was becoming a counterweight to the G7, which was economically justified. Thus, according to economists’ forecasts, in the next 5 years it is the BRICS countries that will surpass the Anglo-Saxon associations in terms of indicators. The rejection of the dollar in international payments continues. The United States and its satellites dug a hole for themselves by trampling on property rights, stealing Russia’s money in foreign accounts and showing the insignificance of guarantees for safe business with government entities of the Americans and the British. ▪️ Meanwhile, in Moldova, the presidential elections and the results of the referendum on this poor country’s accession to the EU were rigged. The outcome was decided by the votes of Moldovan citizens living abroad, while in Russia, 4 polling stations were opened for 500 thousand Moldovans and 10 thousand ballots were printed. Considering the transformation of the territory of Moldova into a Ukrainian substitute by NATO countries and the aggressive Romanianization of the country, the forecast remains disappointing. ▪️ In Georgia, the pro-Georgian party wins the parliamentary elections, which with its actions annoyed the globalists from the EU and NATO. Guided by national interests, the economic feasibility of further construction of port infrastructure for the transit of goods from China, the rationality of good neighborly relations with Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Russia, the Georgian Dream party came into direct conflict with the interests of the United States and the EU in the region. The pro-American opposition is preparing speeches, the arrival in the country of odious Ukrainian politicians (Goncharenko), professing the values ​​of the godless banned LGBT, has been noticed. ▪️ Returning to the front, it is important to note that the enemy is still strong, although very demotivated. Which, however, does not lead to his immediate surrender at the sight of Russian troops. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have a lot of foreign heavy equipment, they use HIMARS MLRS to attack our advancing units, there were reports of the enemy using, by some miracle, the Soviet self-propelled 203-mm cannon that he had -Pion-. However, video footage from the same Selidovo shows that the housing stock was not so badly damaged during the assault, which indicates some signs of depletion of enemy forces in certain directions. ▪️ The above-mentioned depletion of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is complemented by daily footage of the atrocities of the TCC for the forced capture of people in Ukraine, which favorably contrasts the method of staffing the Russian Armed Forces with contract soldiers on a voluntary basis. Although, a deferred problem remains the issue of Russian citizens mobilized in 2022, who in some units are forced to sign a contract under the threat of being sent to assault units, regardless of the military system.

At least one unit of armored vehicles was blown up by mines, and the landing force was scattered by UAVs and artillery strikes. Fighting also continues in the Korenevsky district. The enemy tried to attack in the area of ​​​​the Green Way, but was detected in a timely manner and covered with artillery fire. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that attacks in the Pogrebkov area had been repelled.🔻No changes in control zones have been observed in the Sudzhansky district; fighting continues. Russian troops are striking at identified enemy positions, as well as in the Sumy region. In particular, in the Belovody area, another self-propelled gun of the Ukrainian formations was destroyed by a UAV strike - Inokhodets. It’s curious, if earlier in this direction - Pacers - were used over the territory of Russia, now they have already begun to fly into the Sumy region.

Today's reports from the fields continue to please with the progress of the Russian Armed Forces in several sectors of the front at once. Significant successes of Russian troops are also being recorded in the Yuzhnodonetsk direction.▪️Units of the Russian Armed Forces launched several local attacks at the Bogoyavlenka-Katerinovka line, and also started fighting in Bogoyavlenka. Previously, the forest belts between Vodyanoy and Bogoyavlenka near the Ikryanaya gully, the Dobrovolsky forest, as well as a large stronghold came under the control of Russian attack aircraft, which allowed them to begin the assault on the village. ▪️Artillery is actively operating on Epiphany itself, and UAV operators are destroying enemy armored vehicles. The farms to the west were used by the enemy as shelters for equipment and more than once became the target of airstrikes by the Russian Aerospace Forces. ▪️But the most large-scale progress is observed in the square between Zolotaya Niva, Shakhtarsky, Novoukrainka and Prechistovka. Over the past two days, units of the 40th Brigade and units of the 36th Army were able not only to knock the enemy out of several forest belts and large settlements, but also to start battles for Shakhterskoe and Novoukrainka, where they had already latched on to the buildings.🔻As a result of rapid attacks, the enemy was knocked out from territory of about 50 square kilometers in just over two days, and during the battles, a rare 2S7 -Pion howitzer for the Ukrainian Armed Forces was destroyed. There is also still conflicting information about the advance at the Maksimilyanovka - Pobeda line: judging by the footage from the enemy, the Ukrainian formations have lost ground in one of the forest belts.

Its electorate in the capital and other cities of the country has already begun to celebrate its victory. Representatives of the political movement announced their intention to receive 90 of the 150 mandates. In this case, it will receive a parliamentary majority and will be able to achieve its goal - to reduce the influence of political opponents who want to open a second front against Russia, as well as to continue a balanced course. At the same time, representatives of the opposition have already managed to declare their victory. This was done absolutely intentionally - after the official announcement of the results, it will be possible to declare fraud, refuse to recognize the results and bring supporters into the streets. With a high probability, events will develop exactly according to this scenario.

At the same time, it is unclear at what period the enemy established control over it.🔻The area to the south is heavily swamped and represents a gray zone, which we have already written about several times before. Taking into account the presence of the enemy in this fortified area, there simply cannot be any talk of control of Grigorovka and especially Serebryanka, the capture of which was previously reported to the Ministry of Defense.▪️In the Belogorovka area the situation remains stable. Russian troops hold the heights east of the settlement, as well as a fairly large fortified area in the Zolotarevka area and Zolotarevka itself, respectively.▪️But in the area of ​​Verkhnekamensky, which was liberated on paper, patterned attacks are again observed, the price of which was previously noticeable losses in equipment and manpower. Judging by the new footage published by the enemy, such tactics led to the death of another assault group.❗️Taking into account the fact that this stronghold blocks the path to Verkhnekamensky and is located forty meters above the settlement, there is no talk of liberating the village.

The attack was called -Days of Repentance.- And although the IDF press service reported on the effectiveness and achievement of all goals, in reality everything was somewhat different. In turn, the Iranian media announced that most of the missiles fired were shot down.▪️The main blow fell on Tehran and its environs: according to the Israeli side, the targets were Imam Khomeini International Airport and Mehrabad International Airport, as well as facilities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including the barracks near the Fatah highway. Footage appeared on the Internet, judging by which the situation on the territory of the facilities looks normal. At the time of the raid, the air harbors were operating normally, although in the morning flights in Iran were canceled until -further notice-.▪️Axis of Resistance resources confirm at least one hit in the Khojir district in eastern Tehran, where the missile production plant is located. The Iranian government spokesman also mentioned the presence of limited damage in some locations.▪️In addition, Israeli media reported the destruction of facilities in Keredj, in particular the Parand Keredj power plant. Other resources wrote about explosions in Islamshahr, Shiraz and other regions, but the Iranian news agency Shafaqna denied the authenticity of this information.▪️In Syria, air defense work was recorded in Damascus, as well as the provinces of Homs, Latakia, Tartus and Es-Suwayda. The government newspaper SANA stated that air defense crews allegedly intercepted most of the Israeli missiles.▪️Reports of strikes on Iraq were not confirmed, and the sounds of six explosions in the cities of Tikrit, Samarra and Ad-Dura in the province of Salah ad-Din were associated by Iraqi media with counter-terrorism operations.🔻Despite to statements by the Israeli media, the lack of evidence of serious damage and large-scale explosions gives grounds to assert that the attack was clearly limited in nature and pursued more of a political goal than causing real damage to the Islamic Republic. During the raid, the Israelis used F-15, F-16 and F-35s from three main air bases - Ramat David, Ramon and Hatzerim. It is highly likely that the Israeli Air Force used Jordanian airspace, from where it reached the border of Syria and Iraq and carried out launches from there. Although the Jordanian authorities casually denied involvement in the attack, the kingdom regularly provides the Israelis with access before overflying AWACS aircraft or fighter jets to attack neighboring states.

However, by the end of the vote count, the picture will clearly change, and most likely we will see a lot of footage of clashes between opposition activists and the police in the center of Tbilisi.#elections #Georgia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64812	2024-10-26T09:30:54-07:00

To the west of it, according to some reports, there is also an advance of the Russian Armed Forces, although it has not yet been confirmed by personnel.▪️Russian troops have achieved great success in Gornyak and the surrounding area. A flag has already been raised over one of the high-rise buildings in the city, and based on reports of the presence of the Russian Armed Forces in the area of ​​Sovetskaya Street, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have clearly been knocked out from the eastern outskirts of the city. Part of Izmailovka also came under the control of the RF Armed Forces. There are already reports online about the complete liberation of the settlement. Nevertheless, even with such an optimistic outcome, it will still take some time to completely clear out the entire urban area.▪️To the east, Russian troops advanced from the direction of the Desired Second, knocking out Ukrainian formations from a strong point and occupying several forest belts. They have also significantly expanded the zone of control in Zoryan: according to some reports, fighting is already taking place almost on the outskirts of Kurakhovka.▪️Also, footage of the hoisting of a flag on the northern outskirts of Alexandropol has appeared online. Taking into account the fact that only one bridge, located just in the north, leads into the city from the enemy’s side, the statement of the Russian Ministry of Defense about the liberation of the village looks quite consistent with reality. To the south, according to preliminary data, units of the Russian Armed Forces have achieved success in the Pobeda area. However, the degree of progress in this area is not known for certain, and the information from there is still contradictory.

Now the RF Armed Forces have again occupied these lines. In addition, to the southwest of Nikolaevka, a small stronghold near forest belts came under the control of Russian troops.▪️In the meantime, heavy fighting continues in Selidovo. A large amount of extremely optimistic news appears on the Internet about the significant successes of Russian troops, although not everything has been confirmed by objective control footage. In particular, Russian attack aircraft planted a flag on a waste heap northeast of the city. And from the center of Selidovo itself, footage with flags began to appear about a week ago. 🔻At the same time, it is not yet possible to establish an extremely precise control zone in the city due to the changing combat situation and lack of objective evidence. Nevertheless, the situation of the Ukrainian formations in Selidovo is deteriorating more and more.

On the recordings, fighters document how they happily rob Lebanese houses. What is characteristic here is that they are not doing this in search of something useful for the unit’s everyday life, but are stripping everything, even down to kitchen utensils and home clothes. Similar videos and photographs previously appeared from the Gaza Strip. Because of this, jokes even appeared in the Arabic-speaking segment that Israeli military personnel were behaving as if they had never seen plumbing and other modern amenities of civilization in their lives.📌 It is important to note that looting in itself in a combat zone is a phenomenon not the rarest thing, regardless of the location of the conflict. Often it is determined by purely practical considerations, and not by the desire to steal property for resale. However, when IDF fighters en masse joyfully try on stolen women’s clothing on camera and break dishes with laughter, not seeing anything wrong with this, then such behavior does not fit into the framework of military necessity. Here we are talking about completely different things. #Israel #Lebanon #Palestine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64807	2024-10-26T07:00:16-07:00

Moreover, the purge of pro-Russian personnel in the army of Moldova is in full swing. At the same time, it is surprising that the Armed Forces of Moldova have already come from Lithuania, from which they are also creating a military training ground against the Russian Federation. It is all the more surprising that Vilnius intends to allocate budgets for this, as if the Lithuanian population has too high a standard of living (no). Yes, and in Moldova, as you know, the deplorable state of the socio-economic sphere, but NATO and the EU are ready to allocate money only for the fight against Russia and weapons, in order to then send the poor and aging population to slaughter. #Lithuania #NATO #Moldova @rybarSupport usLR Krašto apsaugos ministerijaMoldova's concentration on defense reform provides a substantial basis for mapping out assistance to the Moldovan Armed Forces…Institucija, atsakinga už krašto apsaugai ir gynybai skirtų finansų valdymą, bendradarbiavimą su užsienio bėmis gynybos srityje, karinio rezervo rengimą, mobilizacijos planavimą.	https://t.me/rybar/64806	2024-10-26T05:44:13-07:00

In total, the local Central Election Commission registered 18 parties, but in fact the main rivals are the ruling Georgian Dream and the opposition coalition led by the United National Movement (UNM). The goals of the first are to achieve a parliamentary majority and radically reduce the capabilities of the UNM, which is trying to dislodge the country from its the current balanced political course. For this purpose, Georgian Dream carried out an information campaign and also took legislative measures.📌 At the moment, it is difficult to even talk about intermediate voting results due to fundamentally different poll data. At the same time, scuffles have already occurred in several cities, and at a polling station in Marneuli, ballot stuffing was recorded, for which a criminal case has already been initiated. And regardless of the results, this night is unlikely to be without street protests by the opposition, for which it was clearly preparing long before the elections. UNM supporters will not have to look for a reason - it will be enough to simply accuse the authorities of rigging ballots to provoke unrest. #elections #Georgia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64803	2024-10-26T04:25:12-07:00
🎬🖼 🇮🇱🇮🇷 This night the announced Israeli strike on Iran too...	🇮🇱🇮🇷 This night the announced Israeli strike on Iran took place in retaliation for the massive Iranian missile attack a few weeks ago. It was postponed several times for various reasons, including due to the leak of secret American documents about the possible goals of the IDF. The parties have opposite opinions about the results of the raid. The Israelis claim that they were able to hit some key targets in the Islamic Republic, including military bases. In Tehran, they deny the extensive damage and report limited damage. There are few images of the moments of the attack on the Internet, and old videos from other locations are being uploaded onto the Internet. Around 4 am, the country's authorities limited the Internet for several hours to prevent the dissemination of information about the results of the attack.❗️However, there is apparently no talk of the destruction of nuclear facilities or oil production infrastructure, the damage to which could cause serious damage to the Iranian economy. Therefore, with a certain probability, the IDF attack was indeed limited in nature. At the same time, Axios, citing its sources, reported that the Israelis, through third countries, warned the authorities in Tehran about the attack and even outlined a list of targets that they plan to hit . In the message, they also warned Iran against retaliating by threatening a more massive raid.#Israel #Iran@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64799	2024-10-26T03:05:20-07:00

And what are the Chinese doing? In October, the command of the People's Liberation Army of China decided to amaze everyone with the scale of its training, since this month the Chinese are holding three major exercises at once. ▪️The first began on October 13, and the PLA Air Force was involved in it. Before the start of the event, fighters and bombers were deployed to four air bases in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The main emphasis in this exercise is on the withdrawal of aviation from attack, as well as the use of the aviation component from remote air bases in the event of an armed conflict.▪️The second exercise is strategic nuclear forces of the PLA missile forces, which started on October 21. Ground units are involved in it - units that are armed with medium-range ballistic missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles. In total, 107 launchers of various types are involved in this training. According to the plan, the Chinese are also practicing an armed conflict in which the strategic component of the PLA will be involved.▪️The third exercise began on October 22 in the South China Sea. Chinese sailors are participating in it as part of an aircraft carrier strike group led by the Liaoning aircraft carrier and escort ships. The main emphasis in Beijing was on demonstrating its presence in the disputed zone of the Spratly Islands, the rights to which are claimed by the Philippines. The actions of the PLA are actively monitored by American planes and drones. The Chinese have taken seriously the training of the armed forces, conducting exercises one after another, which was not observed in past years. Now all this is taking place against the background of the exercise of US strategic forces Global Thunder 25. It is worth adding that Chinese reconnaissance UAVs and aircraft are also tirelessly monitoring the Russian border, but for what purpose it is unclear.

And here it is. And, of course, now is the time to go to forums and other events held by the British. But what we should learn from the British adversary is consistency. Istanbul has been a nest of British intelligence since the 18th century. Either the Circassians or the Poles were welcomed there, after both uprisings.

🇨🇳🇺🇸 The United States seems to be planning to expand the rol...	🇨🇳🇺🇸 The United States appears to be planning to expand the role of the country's coast guard in the Asia-Pacific region. Vice Admiral Andrew Tiongson recently stated that the BCHR intends to intensify work with regional partners. In particular, such cooperation will be expressed in joint activities. We are talking about multilateral patrols, as well as participation in new training with allied countries. 🔻In addition, it became known that Tiongson was on a visit to Japan last month. One of his main goals is to find locations from which the US Coast Guard can conduct operations in the region on a regular basis. However, the American side has not yet provided specific details of the trip. By the way, in the Asia-Pacific region there is a trend towards increasingly frequent deployment of the coast guard to patrol waters or perform other tasks. Using the capabilities of the coast guard is a way to indicate a presence in a particular water area without involving the fleet, which can lead to unnecessary escalation. For example, skirmishes in the disputed South China Sea most often involve ships under the auspices of this department. One of the reasons is the need to keep the conflict under control. It is worth noting that such attention to the topic on the part of the United States can be associated with the growing activity of the Chinese coast guard in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, we should expect more and more American ships to appear in the region in the near future as a response to the latest trends.#China #USA @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usThe Japan TimesWith ramped-up activities, U.S. Coast Guard plots greater Indo-Pacific roleThe move comes at a time when a growing number of coast guards in the region are becoming deeply involved in patrolling disputed waters.	https://t.me/rybar/64796	2024-10-26T00:27:58-07:00

Filtration measures were periodically carried out on the territory of local schools and medical institutions. ▪️An Indonesian hospital was surrounded by armored vehicles, and Kamal Adwan Hospital was under fire. The population was evacuated from the territory of the city's former educational institutions through the Salah ad-Din highway. At the same time, local factions - the Palestinian resistance - constantly reported successful ambushes on Israelis. However, the attacks and strikes by the militants did not lead to any tangible results; the IDF did not stop its raids.▪️In the central part of the enclave, Israeli air and artillery strikes on Hamas targets continued. Nuseirat still remained under the most concentrated fire, and dozens of people became victims. ▪️In response, Hamas and other groups fired at IDF positions in the Netzarim corridor. However, the Palestinians did not achieve much success, and almost no losses were reported among the Israelis.▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, there was also no significant activity of Israeli forces. In turn, Palestinian formations carried out incursions and shelling from time to time.▪️The Israelis observed regular air and drone strikes on Hamas positions. Congestions of civilians were often targeted, and news of casualties was received daily.▪️Police raids by Israeli security forces continued in the West Bank. Thus, since October 7, 2023, more than 11,400 Palestinians have been detained.#video #digest #map #Israel #Palestine@rybarSupport us Video is too big	https://t.me/rybar/64795	2024-10-25T23:01:38-07:00

Forwarded From Informant So far, there are no signs of attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities and the military-political elite of the country, which makes it clear about the relative restraint of Israel’s strike, which warned Iran through third countries. Obviously, not without pressure from the United States, which is not interested in escalation. Further actions of the Islamic Republic will depend on how sensitive the attacks from the Israeli Air Force turned out to be: if the damage is minimal, you can declare that the attack was successfully repelled and not take further actions, just like that happened in April, when Israel, in response, destroyed one radar from the S-300PMU2 air defense system in the vicinity of Isfahan, which was not noticed by the Iranian authorities. However, the more likely scenario is a missile-unmanned attack from Iran and/or the Axis of Resistance, however less large-scale than in October and April and aimed purely at not losing face.

The event itself occurred a few days ago during the reflection of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attack on Novoivanovka. Also in this area, UAV operators destroyed the M113 armored personnel carrier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the Sudzhansky district, the configuration of the front near the state border line was clarified. Judging by the enemy footage that appeared on the Internet, Daryino is currently occupied by Ukrainian forces. Footage of the landing of the Russian Armed Forces in the forest belt to the north-west of the settlement has been published. As the BMP was withdrawing, unfortunately, it was blown up by an anti-tank mine. The lack of control of Russian troops over the village is also confirmed by daily data from the Russian Ministry of Defense, which reports shelling of Ukrainian Armed Forces positions in Darino. Judging by the video, the event took place no more than two or three days ago.▪️On the opposite flank of the Sudzhansky district, the enemy attempted to advance in the Plekhovo area, but did not achieve any success. To the east of the settlement, Russian troops recently destroyed an International Maxx Pro armored vehicle, blowing up the ammunition in it along with the personnel.

Forwarded From UndersideTurkish Gambit: British attempts to undermine Russia continueThe Underside editors learned that the lesson with the expulsion of British diplomats from Moscow did not teach the Foreign Office and the British intelligence services anything. The Englishwoman continues to shit. Now in the vastness of Turkey. Now in Istanbul, well-known to our readers, ELN is holding a forum - Eurasian Futures: Russia in a Multipolarizing World - at the Turkish Global Relations Forum (GRF). Under the control of MI6, the European Leadership Network invites Russian political scientists, lawyers, economists, civil servants to research projects, to seminars and forums, and then elicits from them insider information of a strategic nature about the Russian Federation. The list of servants of the British crown includes: the favorite of the Royal Family Igor Yurgens, Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences and President of IMEMO RAS Alexander Dynkin, ex-head of the RIAC Andrei Kortunov, Kommersant journalist Elena Chernenko and a long list of names that can be refreshed in memory. Let us remind you that ELN is currently working on a project to study possible scenarios for the development of the future of Russia, which they are doing on behalf of the Foreign Office and MI6 employee Christopher Joyce. In January 2024, he allocated 668 thousand pounds (more than 75 million rubles). Over the course of a year, ELN has been collecting information on the basis of which British intelligence will develop new subversive operations against our country. ELN and the Turkish GFR are long-time partners. The Forum's Board of Directors makes high-profile visits to London, Turkish experts write materials for ELN (for example, in support of Turkey in NATO). Since 2019, ELN on the GRF platform with the participation of RIAC has been holding events in Istanbul, the topics of which range from areas of international cooperation to new military technologies. The main topic of the meeting of leaders this year was migration trends in Central Asia and Russia. It is not surprising, since migration is a key area of ​​work for the Foreign Office and MI6 in Russia and in the countries of the post-Soviet space. Even in the first investigation, we mentioned Svetlana Gannushkina, who signed a grant agreement with the Foreign Office, and her supervisor was Jessica Davenport, an employee of the British Embassy expelled from Russia. One of the areas of Mrs. Gannushkina’s work as president of the Civic Assistance Committee was migration policy. And the grant agreement included more than 76 projects and a total budget of about 2 billion rubles, including organizations seriously involved in the problem of migration in Russia. Another expelled British spy, Blake Patel, specialized in working with Russian Muslims. The UK not only rocked the situation in Russia from the inside, but was also involved in the import of illegal migrants from Central Asian countries, using UN structures. Underside is checking the participants. But it is already known that Vadim Kozyulin, a professor at the Academy of Military Sciences of the Russian Federation and the head of the Center for Global Studies and International Relations of the Diplomatic Academy, and the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine -Company- Anna Oreshkina came to the meeting of agents from Russia. How London will use the information received from Russian experts is not difficult to guess .Forewarned is forearmed.	https://t.me/rybar/64775	2024-10-25T10:08:02-07:00

I walked through the workshops of Uralvagonzavod, which works around the clock, in two 12-hour shifts. No days off. The rear is the face of the front.✔️Here, civilian factory workers, military veterans, and those who are waiting for their relatives from the front work hard without days off. Here, for example, Yulia has a non-feminine set of professions - a revolver turner, a blacksmith, a chipper... She stamps bolts for tanks - such heavy dumbbells that need to be heated on a fire with tongs, put under a press and thrown into a box of finished products.

Before that, he served in the army, fought in Chechnya, and worked in the riot police. And with the beginning of the Northern Military District, he went to the front as a volunteer.

The problem of the influx of migrants to the UK is quite acute. The tension in society provoked by the current situation is eloquently reflected in the August anti-migrant protests. ▪️The previous government tried to solve this issue by intimidating migrants. However, this tactic cannot be called successful. In early October, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper admitted that the new ruling party was having significant difficulties in delivering on its promise to close refugee hotels. The bill for each asylum seeker has risen from £17,000 to £41,000 in four years. 2023-2024 financial year. This significant increase in costs is due to the lack of cheap, available accommodation accommodation such as hostels, council flats or housing association properties.🔻The number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels continues to rise due to a major increase in the number of people arriving by boat via La Manche. The current situation creates a significant burden on the social support system and causes widespread public criticism. It is possible that the government will announce new measures aimed at solving the problem as part of the autumn budget.#Great Britain@rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇬🇧 To continue the conversation about the unrest in Great BritainThe story of the massacre at a children's dance school has not left many people indifferent.

🖼 🇮🇩🇨🇳 On the activity of Chinese ships in disputed Indonesi...	🇮🇩🇨🇳 On the activity of Chinese ships in disputed Indonesian waters Amid the tense situation in some parts of the Asia-Pacific region, the problems of the disputed South China Sea have somehow gotten lost. But this week there have already been two incidents involving the Chinese and Indonesians. On October 21 and 24, the Indonesian coast guard, with the support of the country's armed forces, expelled a Chinese law enforcement ship from its exclusive economic zone. The Chinese, according to Indonesian authorities, tried to interfere with the work of a research vessel in the water area. 📌Indonesia is not often mentioned in the context of a territorial dispute in the waters. The fact is that Jakarta is not directly involved in it, since the authorities do not lay claim to the islands in the South China Sea. However, China’s territorial claims intersect with the border of Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone, which creates tension in bilateral relations.❗️By the way, this particular part of the water area is filled with gas and oil fields. A Chinese coast guard ship tried to interfere with the reconnaissance of one of them this week. There is clear dissatisfaction on the part of the PRC here, since Beijing considers these resources to be theirs. It is important to note that on October 20, that is, while the Chinese ship was in the exclusive economic zone of Indonesia, the inauguration of the country's new leader Prabowo Subianto as president took place in Jakarta . Of course, such a coincidence may be just a coincidence. However, this can be seen as a signal that the Chinese authorities are sending to the new Indonesian leadership. Despite the fairly high level of relations with Indonesia, the Chinese side indicates the continuation of its policy of asserting claims to the water area.

On October 24, North Koreans launched balloons towards the Republic of Korea for the 30th time since May of this year, to which local authorities responded with another call to stop such activities. However, unlike previous launches, the balloons did not carry garbage, but propaganda leaflets, mostly criticizing the current government in South Korea. There were also calls for South Koreans to emigrate due to high suicide rates and the level of the minimum wage. Note that the North Koreans launched propaganda leaflets for the first time in several years. Since May of this year, when the DPRK began to respond to the activities of South Korean activists, it was garbage balloons that were flying into the Republic of Korea. By the way, just two weeks ago, the North Korean authorities announced that South Korean drones were flying over Pyongyang. The drones scattered propaganda materials over the capital of the DPRK, which is why North Korea put artillery units near the border on alert. The North Korean leadership clearly perceived the drone flight as raising the stakes in the psychological war with South Korea that has been dragging on since May. Therefore, the launch of propaganda leaflets is likely a mirror response to the neighbor’s recent provocative actions. #DPRK #South Korea@rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usYonhap News Agency(2nd LD) N.

In order to discuss further actions, a Defense Council was recently held at the Elysee Palace.▪️In addition to the Ivorian Port Boué, the Camp de Gaulle in Gabon and the Ouacame base in Senegal will soon be abandoned. It is likely that the French will remain exclusively as instructors at joint military facilities. And at the highest level, emphasis will be placed on joint exercises based on the American model. ▪️In fact, the latter is already being fulfilled: since the beginning of October, the French have conducted joint exercises with Cameroonian, Gabonese, Ivorian and Senegalese military personnel.📌The benefit for the French authorities in this is obvious - a reduction in bloated defense budgets, a switch to economic projects, as well as an attempt to create the image of an ally, and not a colonialist for Africans. And if something happens, there will always be an opportunity for the transit of forces through joint bases. But once again we note that the fact that French soldiers are leaving Africa does not mean the disappearance of Western influence on the countries. On the contrary, Washington is trying to seize the initiative, locking in cooperation with some African countries.

The authorities have accelerated this issue due to the withdrawal of 19 existing MiG-29s from the 601 and 602 squadrons due to poor condition and lack of spare parts for them. According to media reports, management is considering three options for replacement: the American F-16, the South Korean FA-50 and the French Rafale F4, and the latter are on the list of favorites. The cost of modernizing the fleet is included in the budget of the Peruvian Armed Forces for the next year, and it is planned to purchase a total of 10 single-seat modifications per squadron and 4 two-seat training variants.🔻And the key question in the context of the air defense system is where the decommissioned MiG-29 will go.

Moreover, the CSTO, since the beginning of the Northern Military District, and especially after Zelensky’s Kursk adventure, has found itself in an ambivalent position.

🇺🇸💰How crypto will help solve the US $35 trillion debt problem...	🇺🇸💰How crypto will help solve the US $35 trillion debt problem. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump is increasingly demonstrating support for Bitcoin and crypto. Recently, when asked about the future of digital currencies, Trump suggested they could play a role in paying off the US government debt. It is clear that Republicans are eager to attract the attention of the growing base of cryptocurrency supporters. Trump also promised to make the United States the crypto capital of the world if he is re-elected. Trump recently became the first US president to make a transaction in Bitcoin. Kamala Harris also addressed the topic of digital assets during a fundraiser in New York. She promised to encourage innovative technologies such as AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors. Although she did not directly mention Bitcoin or crypto, her comments indicate that the US Democratic Party is also seeking to attract voters from the world of crypto. This is a noticeable change compared to her previous silence on this topic. We predicted this development of events back in March 2022, when, under the cover of military operations in the so-called. In Ukraine, the authorities of the USA, Britain and the EU very quickly introduced laws aimed at regulating the sphere of crypto-assets, monitoring user activity and tracking transactions. In two and a half years, it was possible to create acceptable conditions for the integration of the classical financial system and the world of crypto, on the terms of the SEC and the CIA, while respecting the interests of large investment funds BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. Now the issuing model of the United States, as the largest financial center in the world, is in a strategic position dead end. The development of the country's economy directly depends on emissions, but the risks of inflation and prohibitive overheating of stock markets, especially in the high-tech sector, are extremely high. Therefore, the only solution to the situation today is crypto. In the new format of the digital economy, it is possible to dissolve not only the current US national debt of $35 trillion, but also additional emission volumes. Let us recall that representatives of the US Congressional Budget Office approved a plan to increase the US national debt to $95 trillion by 2050. 🔻In such conditions, the creation of a financial system independent from the United States and Britain seems critical. We saw the next steps in this direction at the BRICS summit in Kazan. This allows us to look into the digital future with cautious optimism.#USA #economy@rybarSupport usNasdaqDonald Trump Says Crypto Could Help Pay Off $35 Trillion U.S. DebtDonald Trump floated using crypto to pay off the US' $35 trillion debt, part of his embrace of Bitcoin amid the 2024 race.

🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the possible purchase of lands in Moldova by globa...	🇲🇩🇺🇸 About the possible purchase of land in Moldova by globalists from BlackRock According to some information, the Moldovan government has begun negotiations with the American investment company BlackRock on the sale of 600 hectares of land in the north of the republic. There are no official statements yet, especially since elections are currently being discussed in Moldova. However, if the news is confirmed, then this event fits well into the logic of the already ongoing process. Let us recall that the largest investment company Blackrock and the TNCs controlled by it (Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont) are actively capturing the European agricultural market, destroying national agricultural sectors for this. Thus, companies controlled by Blackrock have already seized 52% of the so-called arable land. Ukraine, simultaneously selling off its seed fund. ▪️Since 2022, protests have erupted in Moldova by local farmers who are going bankrupt en masse due to the uncontrolled export of cheap Ukrainian grain through the territory of the republic. ▪️The authorities, represented by President Maia Sandu, pointedly ignored farmers’ demands for financial support and a moratorium on the bankruptcy procedure for loans. Moldovan farmers already stated that the lands of bankrupt farmers would be sold to global corporations. ▪️The recent statement by EU Ambassador Janis Mazeiks that the republic needs to approve the sale of its lands to foreigners also caused a great resonance in Moldova. Sandu herself and her prime minister then called such statements -misinformation.- 🔻The absorption of the fertile lands of Moldova by globalists from BlackRock is only a matter of time given the policies that Sandu is pursuing. Moreover, Mrs. President herself is a product of global structures. And endless loans and grants from the US and EU do not pass without leaving a trace for any country. BlackRock is already actively involved in managing the so-called economy. Ukraine, which is precisely due to colossal tranches to support the Kyiv regime. The ultimate goal of such TNCs, of course, has nothing to do with the development of Eastern European countries, but rather with the exploitation and extraction of profit from them. #globalism #Moldova #USA@rybarSupport usnews.byBlackRock starts preparations for the purchase of land in northern MoldovaThe largest investment company in the world, the American BlackRock, has started preparations for the purchase of land in the north of Moldova	https://t.me/rybar/64752	2024-10-25T02:05:12-07:00
🇷🇺🌓 About the anti-Gypsy pogroms in Korkino and further prospe...	🇷🇺🌓&nbsp; About the anti-Gypsy pogroms in Korkino and further prospects for the development of the situation On October 23, the body of 40-year-old Elena Sarafanova was found near Korkino in the Chelyabinsk region. According to the Investigative Committee, the woman was stabbed to death. Later, information about Elena’s killers appeared on social networks with photos of 17-year-old Manuel and 19-year-old Marcel. They turned out to be residents of one of the houses where representatives of the Roma diaspora live. Local residents claim that Manuil and Marcel stabbed Elena and stole the car, but were not promptly detained. Yesterday, residents of Korkino came out to gather because of the murder of a female taxi driver. They blamed two minor Roma for this. Locals came to the houses of the diaspora due to the inaction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. After this, people surrounded the house where Marcel and Manuil lived, and the gypsies opened fire on them with small arms, after which the residents began to throw stones at the houses. The house was cordoned off by riot police and special forces, the dissatisfied people were detained, and the security forces entered the building. Later, information appeared in the Chelyabinsk media that all the detainees were released after drawing up reports of petty hooliganism. And the shooter at the locals was detained, and, according to unconfirmed information, a criminal case was opened against him. At the same time, where those accused of murdering the taxi driver are is unclear.📌 So, in addition to migrant problems, it’s time to talk about the Gypsy topic.▪️Gypsies are the most asocial element of any society. They do not work, are exempt from military service, do not pay taxes, do not recognize the state as such, but consider their camp to be the center of their lives. At the same time, they receive all kinds of benefits for children from the state - surreal, isn’t it? However, the main way of earning money for gypsies is crime. 99.9% of all gypsies are bandits who are dangerous to any neighbors.▪️Such incidents with them are far from new, they just usually turned a blind eye to it. And from the behavior of local authorities and security forces in Korkino now you can see how this happened. The administration's reaction is as follows: - Oh, how did this happen? - They sent riot police there. They, without thinking twice, began to arrest everyone. The media talk about 43 detainees, but without indicating a specific number of local residents and Roma. So we won’t be surprised if there are practically no gypsies there.❗️From the point of view of the current situation, the only positive point in all of this is that the head of the Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, has taken the matter under personal control, but even this does not mean that the local authorities will do anything do. In fact, they can arrest those involved in the murder of a woman, bring them to trial, and expel the rest of the representatives of the gypsy camp from the city somewhere to a remote place of compact residence, but based on the examples of past years, we doubt this. For the Korkino authorities, the benefit is that in order to slow down the situation, since the gypsies will pay off what happened with large sums, and the most notorious residents, in the opinion of the administration, who caused the riots, will be imprisoned and the case will be closed. We don’t know how everything will really turn out. We won't assume, we'll just observe. But we very much doubt that even such a resonance will somehow affect the situation of the Roma in Russia.#multinationalism #Russia@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64749	2024-10-25T00:16:01-07:00

One of the reasons for repeated postponements is fears that the census threatens to reveal an unsightly situation with the real size of the country's population and its socio-economic situation. Now, according to the Statistics Agency under the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the permanent population in the country is 37.4 million people, which makes the republic the largest in Central Asia. In addition, the World Bank has allocated a soft loan to Tashkent in the amount of $50 million for the modernization of the national statistics system back in 2022 year, and there are suspicions that the funds have long been spent on other purposes. Also, the census may again agitate Uzbekistan in terms of ethnicity, in particular in Karakalpakstan, where Uzbeks, according to some data, are already a relative majority. 🔻In total, Uzbekistan has been living without a census for 35 years, and government agencies should have long ago adapted to the available statistics; there is reason to believe that the census will be postponed this time too. Unless the Western partners, who are actively developing the economy of the republic, insist otherwise. in Uzbekistan finally received a new date. According to the draft presidential decree, the general census of the country's citizens will be held from July 15 to August 21, 2026. It was originally planned to conduct the census in 2022...	https://t.me/rybar/64748	2024-10-25T00:02:01-07:00

However, it is not required, since the West has such a vision in the person of the USA and the EU, which definitely do not need to take into account Russia’s interests in the region.#Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia@rybarSupport usRIA NovostiPashinyan called participation in the BRICS summit important for ArmeniaPrime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan stated that his participation in the BRICS summit in Kazan is important for Armenia, since the agenda of the summit directly concerns the republic.

Forwarded From Two MajorsThe Supreme, commenting on today's BRICS summit, said an extremely interesting thing:▪️Russia, through Turkey, received proposals from Ukraine for negotiations, which it agreed to, but the next day the leaders of the Kyiv regime refused.✨At the same time, the story was separated from the Istanbul story - 2022, which means it wasn’t that long ago. Surely, the reason for Kiev’s withdrawal of its proposal was due to retaliation from the United States and Great Britain - the true masters of Kiev. The Supreme’s mockery of Zelensky is indicative: -president - the overdue one is no longer called - the leader of the regime -. Well, Turkey’s gratitude for mediation was also expressed by the Supreme Commander in the format: -thank you, but you will sort it out with your clients there.- Zelensky understands that peace on any terms is the path to the loss of his power. And its Western curators continue to solve the problem of causing military and economic damage to our country. We do not take into account the half-hearted comments of our speakers with hints at the complete and unconditional surrender of Ukraine; here the executors of the manuals have taken the theses to the point of absurdity, as always. The BRICS summit is simply a wonderful event , which really entails titanic shifts in world politics. But would it have been so successful if things weren’t going so well for the Russian Army? We are sure not. So, looking into the inevitably bright future brought closer by television, we urge you not to forget who forges political victories as well.

First, there were unclear demonstrations by pro-Western supporters, and yesterday by supporters of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Citizens from all over Georgia gathered in Tbilisi in support of the current authorities. According to monitoring resources, the number of rally participants exceeded 100 thousand people.📌 Against this background, seeing the support received by the current leadership, the opposition became worried about a possible defeat in the upcoming parliamentary elections and are trying to consolidate efforts. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili stated that it would be advisable The move would be a transition to coalition rule as it would end more than 30 years of single-party rule. She emphasized that four pro-Western parties will have to effectively govern the country and they are responsible for the implementation of the Georgian Charter - a plan for rapid accession to the EU, previously proposed by Zurabishvili to unite the opposition.🔻The plan of pro-Western politicians and structures is very clear. Their desire is victory over the Georgian Dream, and they see their only chance in unification. But, speaking about this charter as a key, Zurabishvili is lying, since only a few of the 17 signatories have any support. In this case, quantity does not equal quality, since the level of support for the ruling authorities is high due to the implementation of balanced policies aimed at the good of Georgian people. And this alone reduces the chances of the opposition, which acts for the benefit of the West.# Georgia@rybar support usformulaws.ge პრეზიდენტი კოალიციურ მმართველობაზე მმართველობაზე უდიდესი წინსვლა იქნება იქნება იქნება დავემშვიდობებით ერთპარტიულობასტელეკომპანია ფორმულას ოფიციალური ვებგვერდი ვებგვერდი ვებგვერდი ვებგვერდი. საინტერესო და გადამოწმებული ამბები ერთ სივრც ეში.	https://t.me/rybar/64732	2024-10-24T12:19:01-07:00

The key point was negotiations with the CEO of Baykar Defense, Haluk Bayraktar. The parties agreed to develop a roadmap for localizing the production of UAVs and loitering ammunition for them in Kazakhstan.📌 Military-technical cooperation between Turkey and Kazakhstan is developing by leaps and bounds. In 2023, it became known that the Kazakh military-industrial complex will build a plant for the assembly of drones -Anka- from TAI, which were purchased from Turkey in the amount of 18 units, but only three have been delivered so far. Now the Baykar company, known for its UAVs, is talking about a similar enterprise. Bayraktar- and -Akyndzhi-. So far, a road map has been presented, but given the intensity of contacts between the countries, we think that it will not take much time before an official agreement. From the point of view of building the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan, the choice is relatively cheap and effective against armies without their own air defense or for border control, which is what they want in Kazakhstan , let's explain. But from the point of view of the expansion of Turkish companies in Central Asia, the situation is getting worse.❗️Turkey has contracts with all countries of Central Asia, except Tajikistan. The Tajik authorities also considered the purchase of Bayraktarov. In the absence of an alternative, the Turks have captured the market for unmanned products, which strengthens their position in the region. If we recall the Organization of Turkic States, which is expanding its partnership with the republics of the region in military terms, the picture looks even more deplorable, where CSTO ally Russia has less and less places.#Kazakhstan #Turkey@rybarSupport uswww.gov.kzThe Minister of Defense of Kazakhstan visited the international exhibition SAHA EXPO-2024 in TurkeyIn Istanbul, a delegation led by the Minister of Defense Colonel General Ruslan Zhaksylykov took part in the opening ceremony of the IV International Exhibition of Defense and Aerospace Industry SAHA EXPO- 2024.The event allows you to get acquainted with the achievements…	https://t.me/rybar/64731	2024-10-24T11:45:11-07:00

The Limansk direction, which had remained static for a long time, began to move. Russian troops have liberated Novosadovoe, control of which allows them to launch a new offensive against the enemy’s bridgehead on the left bank of the Stallion. ▪️In the Makeevka area, the Russian Armed Forces advanced to the west, knocking out the Armed Forces of Ukraine from positions in forest belts. Russian units are gradually expanding their bridgehead on the right bank of the river and are trying to gain a foothold in nearby forests. To the north and south of the village, the Russian Armed Forces aligned the front line along the Zherebets riverbed, eliminating the bridgehead that had previously formed here. In this area, the enemy, according to some reports, is using reserve units from the 4th Presidential Brigade. ▪️In addition, Russian units squeezed Ukrainian formations out of the southern and northern parts of Nevsky, which created the preconditions for a further attack on the Terny-Yampolovka bridgehead. The enemy launched several counterattacks, all of which were repulsed. ▪️The other day it became known that by October 23, after several days of fighting, Russian troops completely liberated Novosadovoe. The attacks of the armored groups of the Russian Armed Forces were carried out along two beams to the northeast of the settlement, providing cover for the equipment. The footage of objective control published today allows us to say that the Ukrainian formations were driven out from the entire territory of the village and retreated to Terny. The positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the latter are regularly attacked by Russian aircraft. ▪️To the east of Torskoye, Russian units are attempting to overcome the defensive lines of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

🇨🇲 On the brink of life and death: Cameroonian President Paul B...	🇨🇲 On the brink of life and death: Cameroonian President Paul Biya Since early October, rumors began to circulate online about the death of 91-year-old Cameroonian President Paul Biya. This was due to the fact that he did not appear in public and was not present at any event.▪️Then the government did not find anything better than to announce his presence in Switzerland and prohibit conversations about his health. All this had the opposite effect, only creating more doubt about whether the President was alive. Of course, it later turned out that he was alive and well when he arrived in Yaounde. But unrest in Francophone Africa continued, as in France. 🔻And this is due to the fact that Paul Biya has been the guarantor of French influence in Cameroon for half a century. In addition, the elderly politician has no successor and, as we mentioned earlier, he is also planning to run in next year’s elections. A stable pro-French position is even reflected in the reluctance to cooperate with the Americans and enter into dialogue with the Angolophone separatists of Ambazonia in the north-west of the country . Therefore, the excitement about the probable death of the French protege is not accidental - the French are afraid of losing their last pawn in the French African system. And they are already supporting his son as -heir to the throne-.#Africa #Cameroon@rybarSupport usBBC News AfriqueLe président camerounais réapparaît enfin en publicLe président camerounais Paul Biya, âgé de 91 ans, a été vu en public pour la première fois depuis six semaines, sur fond de speculations concernant son état de santé.	https://t.me/rybar/64721	2024-10-24T07:24:01-07:00

A little later, the Israelis again attacked the territory of a neighboring state. This time the target was a bridge in the vicinity of El-Quseir in Homs province. Apparently, the facility was used to transfer weapons to Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. According to the SAR Ministry of Defense, the strikes were carried out both from the occupied Golan Heights and from the airspace over northern Lebanon. SAR Armed Forces Lieutenant Sharaf Marez Mazhar Khalil was killed and seven more people were injured. In recent years, the Israelis have repeatedly struck targets in various regions of Syria.

Since Finland joined NATO, Finnish units have been the most active in military training. Currently, three combat training events are taking place nearby in the south of the country. ▪️From October 20 to 25, a training exercise for ground units to assess readiness in the event of an armed conflict is taking place at the Pohyankangas military training ground. About 1.5 thousand military personnel and 250 units of military equipment are involved in it.▪️Since October 21, a search and rescue exercise has been taking place in the Upinniemi area and the adjacent waters of the Gulf of Finland, in which the forces of the coast guard brigade are involved. And the training seems to be harmless, but the Finns sent out warnings about firing along the coast on these dates.▪️On the same day, at the same training ground - Pohyankangas - they organized artillery firing of units of the high-readiness Jaeger brigade - Pori - and an armored brigade. Residents of nearby settlements reported shots and explosions. 🔻The activity of the Finnish armed forces cannot but please the North Atlantic Alliance.

This night after the terrorist attack, the Turkish command carried out a complex operation to defeat positions and objects used by the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Kurdistan Workers' Party or in one way or another with them related. The operation, authorized immediately after the PKK’s involvement in the terrorist attack was revealed, involved F-16C/D fighters, Akinci, Bayraktar, Anka drones and artillery units of the Turkish army. The targets of the Turkish attack were underground bunkers , places of deployment of Kurdish forces, oil depots and airfields, which are used in the interests of the Kurds. All night long, the north of Syria and Iraq was roaring with incessant explosions. The way we saw the complex operation, it all looks very much like fire preparations before an offensive. It is unknown whether the Turks will finally decide to begin the ground phase of the operation this time. They had been threatening this all year, but the terrorist attack itself looked ambiguous. Rumors have circulated in recent weeks about the PKK's readiness to negotiate. The day before, a nephew, Omer Ocalan, was admitted to the prison on Imrali Island, where PKK leader Ocalan is imprisoned. Before this, no one had spoken to the creator of the PKK for more than 40 months. And immediately after this, a strange attack on the plant occurs, which crosses out all agreements. At the same time, Erdogan flew from Kazan to Turkey, which may be connected with the upcoming National Security Council - it made decisions on the start of previous operations against the Kurds.❗️Another interesting fact is that a week before the terrorist attack and already during negotiations with the PKK The Turks increased the intensity of attacks on the Iraqi border. As a rule, the artillery is practically inactive or fires a few shells and that’s it. But this week more than 20 shots were recorded in just one section of the border. Add to this aviation training and the unanimous condemnation by the collective West of the actions of the PKK yesterday, and we get a complete picture in which the activation of the Turkish Armed Forces may be just around the corner, and the terrorist attack itself happened more than ever at the right time.

Special forces brigades and regiments have been operating in the Northern Military District zone since the very first days of hostilities. Although spetsnaz is broadly associated with assault, the profile of these special forces units lies elsewhere: for example, capturing prisoners, operating behind enemy lines, or conducting targeted destruction of targets. And such work is being carried out even now, albeit not on the scale of all troops. Therefore, when special forces are given the opportunity to carry out tasks in their direct profile, the result is visible to the naked eye. In particular, according to the enemy’s reports of increasing losses from ambushes, liquidations and other actions in his own rear.

🇰🇷🇺🇸🇰🇿☢️ How Americans control the Korean nuclear industry ...	🇰🇷🇺🇸🇰🇿☢️ How Americans control the Korean nuclear industry and what does Kazakhstan have to do with it The other day, the President of the Czech Republic conveyed, through Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky, an official invitation to the President of Kazakhstan to visit the country. One of the likely topics that the authorities of the two countries are discussing is cooperation in the field of nuclear energy with the participation of Czech and Korean companies. Indeed, quite recently, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, following a referendum, expressed a desire for an international consortium to build a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. ▪️ Something similar was recently started in the Czech Republic, where the South Korean company Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power won the tender for the construction of new power units. KHNP was also included in the short list of contractors for the construction of nuclear power plants in Kazakhstan, along with the French EDF, the Chinese CNNC and the Russian Rosatom. ▪️However, the American company Westinghouse appealed the Czech victory of KHNP to the Office for the Protection of Competition. The French EDF also entered the same fight by filing a complaint with the European Commission: KHNP's proposal is proposed to be checked for compliance with fundamental principles, laws and norms of European law. KHNP is the main contractor for the construction of nuclear power plants using Korean equipment. However, due to the fact that the nuclear reactor, primary circuit equipment and fuel are sold using a large number of American patents, a legal conflict arises when constructing a nuclear power plant in a third country. It is necessary to request permission from the country that owns the nuclear technology - the United States - and enter into an appropriate agreement -1-2-3-. This was the case with the Barakah nuclear power plant in the UAE. 🔻Now the South Korean company in the international market is completely controlled by the United States, but if it gains access to other technologies, the balance of interests may change. That is why KHNP is interested in cooperation with the Czech Republic and Skoda. The latter actively participated in the construction of nuclear power units, was engaged in the production of almost all nuclear equipment and still holds licenses for the production of everything necessary for VVER-440 reactors and most of the equipment for VVER-1000. The tender for the Temelin NPP for KHNP and Skoda is an excellent occasion for consolidating a strategic partnership that is very beneficial to both parties:▪️ Skoda gets the opportunity to resume production of equipment for nuclear power plants and nuclear power plants, and in the future become KHNP’s constant companion in new nuclear power plant projects around the world;▪️ KHNP gains access to technologies free from American patent manipulation .🔻Further, such an alliance is capable of coming up with completely new nuclear power plant and even nuclear power plant projects, which will be based on technologies of Soviet origin, but with an abundance of developments from the two partner countries. The emergence of a competitor in the nuclear power plant construction market is clearly not part of the plans of the United States and France, so they are presenting a united front against the new initiative. In this regard, attempts to drag multi-vector Kazakhstan into the unfolding battle look very interesting. #USA #Czech Republic #Kazakhstan #energy @rybarSupport uswww.interfax.kzThe President of Kazakhstan is expected on an official visit in the Czech RepublicAstana.

In an interview with the Associated Press, the commander of the Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division of the US Armed Forces said it was extremely important to station such equipment on the territory of the island nation. According to him, this will allow Typhon to be tested in the climatic conditions typical of the Philippines. Also, such a step will supposedly provide an understanding of how these medium-range missile launchers can be integrated and make adjustments to the American and Philippine deployment plans. 🔻And although the arguments given by Evans sound convincing, the importance of Typhon’s arrival in the region is justified by another, more significant factor. The Vel missile system creates a useful lever of pressure for the Americans, working both on the Philippine authorities and on the Chinese leadership. ▪️On the one hand, the deployment of a missile system can deter China from escalation in the region. At the same time, the American contingent does not even have to intervene directly, as required by the agreement between the authorities in Washington and Manila on mutual defense. ▪️On the other hand, the lack of clear guarantees for the permanent deployment of Typhon may deter the Philippines from unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea. Otherwise, the decisions of the Philippine authorities could drag the United States into a large-scale confrontation with China. Thus, the indefinite deployment of Typhon in the Philippines gives the Americans a significant tool to influence the tense situation in the region. Testing the operation of equipment in other climatic conditions is an important factor, but after statements about the absence of plans to withdraw the missile system, it began to play a secondary role. #China #USA #Philippines @rybar together with @awaken_dragonSupport usAP NewsUS missile deployment to Philippines 'incredibly important' for combat readiness, US general saysA US Army general says the deployment by the US military of a mid-range missile system in the northern Philippines was -incredibly important- and allowed American and Filipino forces to jointly train for the potential usage of such heavy weaponry in conditions…	https://t.me/rybar/64710	2024-10-24T00:22:33-07:00

The enemy is mining the area, especially access roads, using FPV drones and Baba Yaga. To n.p. Pokrovskoye are operating FPVs with the goal of destroying equipment on the distant approaches to Bakhmut. Despite this, units of the 98th Airborne Division, DK, 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade and 4th Motorized Rifle Brigade continue to work beyond the Seversky Donets-Donbass canal, expanding the bridgehead. During the recent surge The 331st RPD, acting suddenly, was able to capture the school on the move and significantly advance through the private sector to the west. On the left flank of the 217th RPD occupied a kindergarten and also occupied the entire private sector adjacent to the forest. Stupki-Golubovskie-2. The enemy is still holding the area of ​​multi-storey buildings and the Refractory Plant. But taking into account the advance of the 4th Motorized Rifle Brigade in the south, and the DK and 200th Motorized Rifle Brigade in the north, there is a threat of enveloping this garrison. This fact makes the Ukrainian Armed Forces nervous and launch counterattacks using tanks. The enemy has very few roads left to supply the garrison at Chasov Yar. The mud is coming, and it is already clear that even for light armored fighting vehicles the dirt roads are difficult to overcome, not to mention ordinary passenger vehicles. In the near future, these dirt roads will become impassable, and there will be only one road left, which is under the fire control of the RF Armed Forces. The battles for Chasov Yar are complex, determined by the terrain. But, despite everything, our units are pushing through the defense. It is too early to talk about the rapid fall of the city. Our troops also have enough problems. Everything will depend on a number of factors that, alas, we cannot disclose. Therefore, it may be that the city will fall within a month, or maybe within 3-4 months. This is the forecast taking into account the development of the situation. - Re-posted with an update - Archangel of Special Forces. Subscribe.	https://t.me/rybar/64694	2024-10-23T11:30:41-07:00

We talked about them in detail several weeks ago, but as the start date approaches, new interesting details have been revealed. ▪️In particular, American and Japanese military personnel will use Osprey convertiplanes for the first time on the territory of Yonaguni Island, located close to Taiwan. Aviation equipment will be used to practice the tasks of evacuating the civilian population. ▪️The United States will also deploy the HIMARS MLRS for the first time on Ishigaki, another remote Japanese island that is also located relatively close to Taiwan. Recently, the installation was delivered there through a civilian airport. By the way, the very fact of the deployment of such equipment caused indignation among some local residents. As a result, a group of activists staged a small protest near the air main, holding posters with the words -No to war.- No HIMARS-. 📌If you do not take into account the geographical location of the islands, there is nothing special about using such equipment in new areas of the exercises. However, the proximity of the territories to Taiwan signals that the Japanese and Americans continue to prepare for a potential military conflict in the region. These exercises actually practice the use of civilian airports for military purposes, the deployment of forces on remote Japanese islands and the evacuation of local residents from these territories. These skills are especially necessary in the event of a hypothetical Chinese invasion of Taiwan, scenarios for which the parties work through during training.

And often we have observed situations when working out an anti-crisis for the enemy is more important than helping our own wounded. Read about one of these stories in our new issue. Synopsis: The offensive of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region encountered fierce resistance from military personnel of the Russian Federation. Losses are growing, and the enemy group needs constant reinforcement. To do this, more and more enemy equipment, ammunition and soldiers are being sent to Russian territory. The Ukrainian Armed Forces do not hesitate to use civilian infrastructure for the safe storage and transportation of ammunition, and also try to move military equipment and personnel under the cover of civilians. In the event of an attack, everything will be done to accuse Russia of threatening civilians and create the desired media picture. At the same time, to maintain the offensive, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have to move large forces. And here a lot depends on intelligence, data transmission speed and coordination of actions of different units of the RF Armed Forces. However, whatever the result, what will be shown in the local media may be completely unexpected, and for all participants.📌 You can download the comic using the links: RU | EN | AR | CN#Russia #Ukraine @rybarWe hope you liked the comic from our artists.

🇺🇸 About the American Deep Sensing and Targeting system One of ...	🇺🇸 About the American Deep Sensing and Targeting system One of the main directions in the development of Western military thought today is the improvement of control, including through the creation of advanced data exchange tools to ensure continuous large-scale collection of information and its operational distribution. One of such developments is the Deep Sensing and Targeting system Targeting (DSAT) from the military-industrial giant Northrop Grumman, which is a data processing center based on a transport aircraft. It was first tested during the recent two-week US Vanguard 24 exercise. In simple terms, DSAT receives information from numerous sensors, especially commercial and military satellite constellations, and then processes and transmits it over radio by an operator on the ground. And the use of an air point allows you to avoid the limitations of ground stations. According to Northrop Grumman, the use of DSAT will allow you to quickly receive data on the location of targets and issue coordinates for targeting missile systems and artillery in a dynamically changing combat situation. In fact, we are talking about further reducing the time between detection and fire defeat, as well as the formation of a single information field, where the crew of the OTRK or howitzer can almost directly receive target designation from satellites, and in a short time.❗️The US attention to the topic is understandable: the introduction of such systems, where combat units can be controlled in real-time literally like -units- in games, will be a breakthrough that will provide technological superiority and will help neutralize the advantages of even experienced armies with significant firepower.#USA #weapons@rybarSupport UsDefenseScoopNorthrop puts its airborne intelligence node to the testNorthrop Grumman's Deep-Sensing and Targeting (DSaT) system provides intelligence capabilities for beyond line of sight and over-the-horizon collection to aid long-range fires.	https://t.me/rybar/64691	2024-10-23T09:09:48-07:00

The company specializes in the production of components for aircraft, including helicopters, F-16 fighters and Anka drones. According to some reports, the attackers were able to break into the facility and even take hostages. Video from the scene shows several explosions and bursts of automatic weapons fire. Previously, three people have already become victims of the attack, and exchanges of fire in the area of ​​​​the terrorist attack continue. No one has yet taken responsibility for what happened - both ISIS cells and Kurds from the Kurdistan Workers' Party could be behind this. The latter is supported by footage showing a woman among the attackers. However, it cannot be ruled out that the country’s authorities will see here the trace of the FETO organization, whose leader Fethullah Gülen recently died in the United States. In any case, what happened is a slap in the face to the Turkish government and security forces. Therefore, Ankara is clearly using a terrorist attack to -tighten the screws- or for any activity on the external circuit, including operations in northern Syria or Iraq.#terrorism #Turkey@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/64685	2024-10-23T07:29:10-07:00

Forwarded From Revenge of Good Will Not only military personnel from the Ministry of Defense turn to us, since in modern realities electronic warfare systems have become commonplace in the troops of the Russian Guard. And here an old problem comes up, about which the central apparatus of the Russian Guard was repeatedly warned at the level of ministries, but they just brushed it off - This is not our concern! - And the name of this problem is that in the Russian Guard there is no electronic warfare department (or service, department), and the task wanders to different departments have replaced several heads over several years. At the same time, we understand that there are objective reasons related to the peculiarities of the tasks and structure of the Russian Guard. Thus, its main functions include maintaining public order, combating terrorism, protecting important facilities and ensuring security at public events. Electronic warfare, as a rule, belongs to the tasks of the Armed Forces and is usually actively conducted in military conflicts. The Russian Guard is focused on solving internal problems, where physical protection, patrolling and conducting anti-terrorist operations play a key role. The creation of an electronic warfare department requires significant financial investments and training of specialists, and has always faded into the background in conditions of limited resources. There are military men - let them do it. It sounds logical, exactly until drones fly at you and your subordinates. We are confident that, taking into account modern threats, the active use of drones for terrorist purposes and attacks on critical infrastructure (which are guarded by units of the Russian Guard), the availability of electronic warfare equipment would allow the Russian Guard to respond more effectively to potential threats. For example, countering unmanned aerial vehicles is becoming an important task in the protection of public events and strategically important objects. And although the creation of a separate electronic warfare service is not among the priorities of the Russian Guard in the context of the growing use of radio technologies in criminal and terrorist activities, it dictates the need to reconsider approaches to this issue. We still have a lot of arguments on this issue, but they are already tempting to discredit. We hope for positive changes on this issue.

In addition to the previously announced provisions, the document implies the following joint initiatives:▪️Starting next year, base patrol aircraft of the German Navy will begin tracking Russian submarines off the coast of Scotland - back in 2023, the UK was concerned about the lack of forces and means to carry out these tasks.▪️German defense Rheinmetall will open a plant in the UK for the production of artillery barrels, which, according to plans, will create more than 400 jobs. ▪️Specialists from the two countries will work together to create new long-range cruise missiles, the tactical and technical characteristics of which should surpass the Anglo-French-made Storm Shadow. ▪️Berlin and London also plan to implement a joint project to monitor underwater threats in order to protect critical infrastructure at the bottom of the North Sea. When looking at this agreement, recent high-profile news regarding the -revival of the Entente- is immediately recalled. Whether this is some kind of global project or a fluff pursuing very specific British goals is a rhetorical question. #Great Britain #Germany@rybarSupport usGOV.UKUK-Germany Trinity House Agreement on Defense - Joint CommuniqueA commitment to improve and enhance bilateral defense co-operation between the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.	https://t.me/rybar/64683	2024-10-23T06:31:02-07:00
🇮🇱 In the context of the massive use of attack drones on the ba...	🇮🇱 In the context of the massive use of attack drones on the battlefield in the Northern Military District zone, large global military-industrial concerns have become concerned about creating means of combating this threat. Not long ago, the Israeli company Rafael presented a modified active protection system (KAZ) -Trofi- (-Meil Ruach-). According to the developers, the new version will not only provide all-round protection of equipment, but also intercept missiles and drones launched into the upper hemisphere of an armored vehicle . This will be achieved allegedly by updating the system software. During the battles in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli KAZ mounted on Merkava tanks demonstrated high efficiency and confidently ensured the interception of RPG missiles. However, the ability of -Trophy- to fight drones after the announced minor improvements raises doubts.📌 Like all similar existing systems, the operating principle of -Trophy- is based on detecting targets flying towards equipment using radars. If the parameters of their movement correspond to the speed and trajectory of an ATGM or RPG shot, then a command is given to intercept it. However, if anti-tank missiles have these characteristics quite typical, then the same cannot be said about the same FPV drones - they approach the target with different and dynamically changing speeds with trajectories.

Previously, Warsaw even created a special commission on the issue of receiving compensation from its western neighbor. The point is not that Poland suddenly became filled with special feelings for the Germans or finally realized that they could only get paid in kind. In fact, everything is much simpler: contrary to the statements made, reparations were not refused there. Sikorsky literally stated that the Warsaw authorities needed a visible sign that Germany felt moral responsibility for what they had done. According to him, the German authorities could take care of the still living witnesses of the Nazi occupation and build a memorial in Berlin in memory of the events. Well, so that the Germans do not forget how the Poles humiliated them. Moreover, politicians in Poland decided to be so magnanimous in this regard that they threw the ball to the German side: they say, let Germany independently offer such a creative solution that would convince the Poles that , that they actually regret. Thus, the hyena of Europe, with a persistence worthy of better use, continues to systematically humiliate the German authorities, and at the same time spur internal revanchist sentiments. And no changes occurred in the issue of reparations, as in principle in German-Polish relations. #Germany #Poland @rybar together with @pl_syrenkaSupport usTelegramBelarusian security officer 🇧🇾It’s funny, but Poland eventually abandoned the demand for reparations from Germany for the damage caused during the Second World War World War damage.

Western countries and organizations play a decisive role in maintaining the functionality of the Ukrainian railway infrastructure, whose investments made it possible to bring railway container transportation to the highest level in 7 years by 2024 (197, 8 thousand TEU for 9 months of 2024). Of these, 62% were exported. On September 25, Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ) and the European Railway Agency (ERA) signed a memorandum of cooperation involving the implementation of European safety and interoperability standards (TSI) and the European Rail Transport Management System (ERTMS), as well as cooperation in the field of rolling stock , including certification, maintenance and mutual access to infrastructure. UZ subsidiary UZ Cargo Poland entered into an agreement with Rail Cargo Hungaria Zrt. to increase railway transportation between Ukraine and Hungary🇭🇺 through the crossings -🇺🇦Batevo - Eperjeske🇭🇺- and -🇭🇺Zahony - 🇺🇦Chop-, which involves optimizing the use of cars of European (1435 mm) and Soviet (1520 mm) standards in international transport, joint work on tariffs. In 2025, it is planned to build a route with Eurogauge - Krakow (Poland🇵🇱) - Lviv (Ukraine🇺🇦) - Chernivtsi (Ukraine) - Suceava (Romania🇷🇴) - Ungheni (Moldova🇲🇩) -, which is 50% sponsored by EU funds. By the end of 2024, the construction of the Eurogauge section - Chop - Uzhgorod - will be completed (3.5 km out of 8.3 km have been laid). Starting next year, France plans to supply 🇫🇷 19 thousand tons of railway rails to renew 150 km of tracks. In addition, in the interests of developing routes for the delivery of Ukrainian cargo through Moldova, on October 17, 2,422 tons of rails were delivered to the port of Giurgiulesti as part of the project for the reconstruction of the Bendery-Basarabeasca-Etulia-Giurgiulesti railway section (233 km). The work is carried out 🇰🇿 by a Kazakh company - Temirzhol Zhondeu -. Earlier, Romania approved a decision to acquire the Moldovan port of Giurgiulesti. In the short term, the commissioning of 120 new grain carriers of the 19-8005-U model, which have the ability to rearrange wheel sets for 1435 mm gauge, will contribute to an increase in the volume of Ukrainian cargo transportation. Also, the Ukrainian Agency for Tracing and Management of Assets (ARMA) transferred 434 Russian carriages, which have not been used since 2023, to the illegal management of LLC -Financial-Industrial Company -RESURSGRUP. At the stage of identifying management companies, there are more than 17 thousand freight cars of Russian companies illegally held by Ukraine.✨Despite periodic missile attacks on infrastructure and arson of relay cabinets, the Ukrainian railway transportation sector continues to function, develop and bring money to the budget of our enemy.✨⭐️In addition Moreover, this same infrastructure will be used in the future to deliver military cargo and NATO personnel to the Russian borders.

The head of the Kyrgyz government, Akylbek Japarov, held a number of important meetings with representatives of leading American companies and organizations. Delegates from Apple Inc., Franklin University, Pfizer and the American-Kyrgyz Business Council took part in the negotiations. The main topic of discussion was the prospects for the development of bilateral cooperation in various fields. One of the key items on the agenda was the discussion of the possibility of opening a branch of Franklin University in Kyrgyzstan. Representatives of an American educational institution made a proposal to create bachelor's, master's and doctoral programs in the areas of Medicine, Cybersecurity and Information Technology. The West has long been interested not only in the natural resources, but also in the labor resources of Central Asia: training specialists in poor countries cheaper than in the USA, not to mention the fact that it is a classic tool of -soft power- (one of the recent examples).🔻But what does Apple have to do with it? The company is interested in rare earth metals, the national project for the extraction of which Kyrgyzstan adopted this year. In addition, Apple may offer Bishkek to locate its energy-intensive data centers in the republic, under which the Kyrgyz will be able to request money from the Americans for a long-standing problem: the construction and repair of hydropower facilities. And Pfizer is opening up the possibility of clinical trials and experiments that would simply be prohibited in the United States. In addition, company representatives can find arguments to stop the bill -On Biosafety of the Kyrgyz Republic-, which began to be actively discussed in September of this year.#Kyrgyzstan #USA #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usCentral Asian NewsKyrgyzstan intends to strengthen cooperation with the companies -Apple- and -Pfizer- - News from Central AsiaThe head of the government of Kyrgyzstan, Akylbek Japarov, held a number of important meetings with representatives of leading American companies and organizations.

Unfortunately, such situations have happened, and subsequently these same traitors - defectors - entered the service of the Russians from the PR unit - Russian Volunteer Corps - (by the way, where are they?).🔻The Ukrainian special services tried to pull off one of these attempts with a serviceman in the Kherson direction, luring him to the left bank Dnieper. The Russian fighter, without thinking twice, reported this to the appropriate authorities. And from that moment the game began for the RDK, whose members for a long time tried to convince our serviceman to cross the Dnieper on his own, to which they received a fair question: what about security? In the end it was a solution was reached in which the Ukrainian units were to meet two people on a stolen boat on the left bank at a designated place under the supervision of a drone. But thanks to a well-played plan, the Russians from the RDK got something else. At the place where the enemy was gathering, waiting on the left bank, a package from the MLRS -Uragan- was released, and the drone carried out guidance and adjustments ❗️What happened to the RDK units on the left bank is not so important. The important thing is that any such secret operation becomes a reality in any case, and any recruitment ends in such a simple but effective way.
