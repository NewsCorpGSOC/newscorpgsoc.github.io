To the south of the village, part of the plantings came under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. ▪️To the southwest, Russian assault groups are advancing in the Krasny Yar area and are fighting for Krutoy Yar. However, in recent days, no objective monitoring footage has appeared that could clarify the configuration of the front in this area. At the same time, the liberation of these settlements will open the way for the RF Armed Forces both to mine No. 3 - Novogrodovskaya - located on a hill, and to the western outskirts of Grodovka. ▪️At the Orlovka-Nikolaevka line, Russian troops launched an offensive towards Novogrodovka and successfully reached the south-eastern outskirts of the city. Evidence of the presence of Russian troops near the first houses in the east of Parkovaya Street appeared on the Internet. At the same time, the Ukrainian media are already reporting that the Russian Armed Forces have established control over the Kishlak and Shanghai neighborhoods. And south of Novogrodovka, fighting continues unabated on the approaches to the Mikhailovka railway station, to the west of which the Kotlyarevskaya mine is located.▪️On the southern flank, units of the Russian Armed Forces liberated Ptichye and started fighting on the outskirts of Kalinovo - while unconfirmed information was published on the Internet about the occupation of the settlement by Russian troops . At the same time, control over Kalinovo will allow attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces to launch an offensive on enemy positions west of the Karlovsky Reservoir.▪️ At the same time, in the Pokrovsky district, the chaotic evacuation of the local population continues, and enterprises are closing. In Selidovo, ATMs are being dismantled, shops are closing, and the distribution of humanitarian aid is being stopped. In Pokrovsk itself, the Ministry of Internal Affairs center was closed - the nearest one is now located in Kramatorsk. 🔻The operational crisis of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is clearly demonstrated by both the lack of organized resistance in populated areas and the speed of Russian troops occupying large strongholds. And all this against the backdrop of the enemy’s lack of a sufficient number of infantry and support equipment in the direction, as well as the low moral and psychological state of the units. Nevertheless, in the near future, Russian troops will have to take Novogrodovka and Selidovo by storm - settlements with relatively dense urban development and the presence industrial zones, to which Ukrainian formations will cling with all their might in an attempt to hold back the onslaught of attack aircraft of the Russian Armed Forces.

Russian troops attacked enemy targets in several regions of the so-called. Ukraine, using drones of the -Geran- family. Explosions also occurred in the Kharkov, Cherkasy and Odessa regions. Ukrainian drones attacked six Russian regions. The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where the Marinovka airfield came under fire. Later, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched a missile at the port of Kavkaz: a ferry carrying fuel tanks was hit there. In the Kursk region, Ukrainian formations launched a series of attacks east and south of Korenevo - in this area the Ukrainian Armed Forces reached Komarovka, but the regional center remains firmly under the control of the Russian Armed Forces . The activity of UAVs and enemy aircraft in the Glushkovsky district is also recorded. In the Pokrovsky direction, the operational crisis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces continues to worsen: Russian troops are conducting an offensive in the area of ​​Grodovka, Novogrodovka and Kalinovo, actively using drones to destroy enemy armored vehicles. In the Yuzhnodonetsk direction, units of the Russian Armed Forces are fighting in Konstantinovka, as well as east of the O0532 highway, where an expansion of the zone of control of Russian troops was recorded. The enemy is launching counterattacks, but they do not end in success.🔻A detailed analytical report on the events in the Special Military Operation zone is available on our closed channel @rybar_plus_bot High-resolution maps: Situation in the Special Military Operation zone (ru; en) Kursk direction (ru; en) #Belgorod #Gorlovka #digest #Dzerzhinsk #report #map #Kursk #Pokrovsk #Russia #Rostov #Sumy #Ternopil #Ukraine@rybarSupport us	https://t.me/rybar/62980	2024-08-22T13:28:32-07:00

Apparently, in the near future there will be at least attempts at an offensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in this area. This is also evidenced by reports of increasing UAV strikes against various targets in the region. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, the battle for Krasnooktyabrskoye continues, where the enemy entered in the first days of the offensive, but was unable to gain a foothold. At the same time, the scale of attacks by Ukrainian formations in the vicinity of Snagost is becoming clearer. As we expected, the enemy passed Apanasovka and occupied the 10th October tract for at least some time. In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the destruction of an enemy group on two armored fighting vehicles in the Skrylyevka area. No large concentrations of ASU were observed in this area. Mechanized groups were recorded in the Zhuravli area, but practically no information appeared about the battles in the Durovka - Obshchiy Kolodez - Kalinov triangle. 🔻There are clashes in the Sudzhansky district, but there are no messages about the liberation of settlements on the Internet. In the area of ​​Russian Konopelka and the populated area itself, a large group of the enemy was destroyed. Based on the footage that appeared on the network, during the successful ambush and subsequent drone strikes, the enemy lost several units of armored vehicles and a large number of infantry. However, there is no information whether there was a clearing in the village. In any case, the Ukrainian formations suffered heavy losses as a result of the relatively short-lived battle.

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Missile attack on the port of Kavkaz A couple of hour...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Missile attack on the port of Kavkaz A couple of hours ago, residents of Kerch in Crimea and Taman on the opposite bank of the Kerch Strait observed a missile attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the port of Kavkaz. Photos and videos of enemy hits can be found on the Internet from various angles. There is no need to talk about why time after time everyone sees the detailed results of Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes in the public domain. We and many of our colleagues are already tired of complaining about this.📌 It’s better to dwell on the attack in more detail. According to preliminary data, the enemy used two anti-ship missiles -Neptune-. The exact launch area is still unknown, but with a high probability the launch was carried out from the Zaporozhye region (the use of anti-ship missiles for ground targets is no longer news). At the same time, the option of departure from the Odessa region should not be discarded either. At the beginning of this year, the Ukrainian media reported on the modernization of missiles at a range of up to 500 km by reducing the warhead of Neptune. As a result, one of the missiles was shot down, and the second still reached its target, flying across the Sea of ​​​​Azov at a low altitude. And a ferry transporting fuel tanks came under attack. It is difficult to say why it was not possible to shoot down the Neptune, given that their characteristics have long been known, especially to the Crimean units. It is likely that a combination of reasons played a role, including surprise, a new route and a small number of missiles fired. 🔻However, the invisible consequences of the attack are more important: In addition to the loss of fuel tanks, ferry traffic has been suspended, which will affect fuel supplies to the peninsula, as well as the functioning of the port itself. Of course, these are solvable problems and they are temporary in essence, but in general they fit into the West’s plan to defeat the energy infrastructure of Russia (the sharply increased fuel prices in the south of Russia are proof of this) and cut off communications with Crimea. We must not forget that the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their curators did not forget about their main goal in the form of the destruction of the Crimean Bridge. Moreover, the attack in the Kursk region, the attacks on the Tendra spit - all this is closely connected with the enemy’s further plans in the Crimean direction.❗️Given today’s strike, in the coming days it is quite possible that drones will be launched on the peninsula in order to force the Russian Armed Forces to expend ammunition, and then, while there are problems with supply, strike with something more serious, including the bridge.

He entered the Ukrainian troops in July 2024 from the Dnepropetrovsk pre-trial detention center. Then, in total, about 300 prisoners were taken from this institution to the war. He says he didn’t want to sit, didn’t want to fight, he joined the Ukrainian troops to come over to our side. The task of his unit was to capture the village of Guevo (Kursk region). Important: his commander with the call sign -Artist- ordered the shooting of civilians and looting. Such orders to former prisoners are not uncommon. The Artist took everything valuable for himself and left only food for his subordinates. In the village of Guevo, while patrolling the streets, Kononenko observed foreign military personnel who communicated in a language he did not understand.

It has become known that an international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan at the end of August. The event is dedicated to the fight against mudflows - one of the consequences of the melting of the ice sheet. The Swiss government provides financial support to the organizers. One of them will be the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), a structural unit of the Aga Khan Development Organization (AKDN).📌The Aga Khan is the hereditary imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims. In Tajikistan, Ismailis live in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where AKDN structures have been operating since 1992. The activities of the Organization regularly encounter opposition from the authorities of the republic. At the same time, the Aga Khan is a member of the British ruling circles, and AKDN partners are such structures as USAID, the US State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and many others, which makes it possible to overcome this resistance. But for what? We have already written about USAID’s work to establish control over water resources in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. However, this work will be ineffective without including Tajikistan, which ranks second among the countries of the former USSR in terms of water resources. The fact is that rivers flow through its territory, which are fed by glaciers and are tributaries of the main water arteries of the region: for example, the Amu Darya originates from the confluence of Pyanj and Vakhsh. Therefore, by establishing monitoring of the condition of glaciers in Tajikistan under the plausible pretext of combating mudflows, the West will take a significant step towards establishing control over the water resources of the region as a whole.#Tajikistan #CentralAsia@rybarSupport usASIA-PlusThe first international conference on glacier monitoring will be held in Tajikistan at the end of AugustFirst The international conference - Monitoring of glaciers and glacial lakes - hazard management - will be held in Tajikistan from August 26 to 31.	https://t.me/rybar/62975	2024-08-22T08:28:59-07:00

🇦🇲🇷🇺🇦🇿 About the reaction of the Armenian media to the meet...	🇦🇲🇷🇺🇦🇿 On the reaction of the Armenian media to the meeting of Vladimir Putin and Ilham Aliyev Emotions in the Armenian media space do not subside after Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to Baku. During the meeting, mainly economic issues were discussed. ▪️However, the Russian President also noted that the stability of the South Caucasus now depends on relations between Azerbaijan and Russia.▪️Many Armenian commentators have received another great reason to accuse Russia of betraying Armenian interests. Such a reaction once again confirms the complete loss of guidelines and cause-and-effect relationships in the Armenian society. ▪️After all, the Armenian authorities have actually withdrawn themselves from dialogue with Russia, limiting themselves only to anti-Russian statements. Thus, Nikol Pashinyan’s government has only once again shown itself to be an extremely unreliable and intractable partner, which has demonstrably rushed into the arms of the West. True, the latter, in essence, does not give anything constructive to the republic.▪️A sensitive issue is also the unblocking of communications in the region, especially in the Syunik region of Armenia, which in Azerbaijan is called the Zangezur corridor. ▪️Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently announced that the Armenian side was sabotaging the process of opening communications in the region.▪️For example, in 2020 there was an agreement that communications would be controlled by border guards of the FSB of the Russian Federation. However, the Armenian authorities changed their minds and are already speaking hostilely about Russian border guards: they have already been taken out of Zvartnots airport, and Pashinyan furiously declared that the Russians do not have a mandate to ensure security in Syunik. Now there are observers from the EU there who are engaged in active PR on social networks against the backdrop of the destruction of the regional security system. It is not surprising that with such introductions, Armenia continues to lose political sovereignty: as we previously wrote, Yerevan’s position on international issues is no longer taken into account by anyone. While Western players, through the decisions of Pashinyan’s team, are increasingly entering the region, it is more than logical for the Russian side to stop taking into account the opinion of the authorities in Yerevan, which in no way corresponds to the interests of Armenia itself. #Azerbaijan #Armenia #Russia @rybarSupport usTelegramRybar🇷🇺🇦🇿 Statements by the Presidents of Russia and Azerbaijan after the meeting🔻 Statements by Vladimir Putin: ▪️Russia attaches great importance to the development of multifaceted and friendly relations with Azerbaijan. ▪️During the negotiations, a wide range of...	https://t.me/rybar/62971	2024-08-22T05:59:28-07:00

🖼 🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokr...	🇷🇺🇺🇦 Strengthening the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Pokrovsky direction: how an operational crisis neutralizes the advantages of the defensive lines of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - Rybar Analysis The rapid offensive of Russian troops in the Pokrovsky direction often meets fierce resistance from the enemy, who has equipped hundreds of kilometers of fortifications in the occupied part of the DPR. Most of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ fortifications are platoon and company strongholds with a developed firing and camouflage system, which turns each assault on such a fortification into a separate operation. Sometimes Russian units encounter fortifications that are truly monstrous in size, playing the role of key defense centers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. ▪️A striking example of this is a large stronghold east of Zhelanny First, taken by the Russian Armed Forces during the fighting in this area in July. This defensive unit began to be built by the enemy, presumably shortly before the retreat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Avdeevka, and was supposed to become an impassable obstacle for Russian units due to its location and size. A large system of trenches and equipped firing points, located in an open field and covered by UAVs and artillery is indeed capable of stopping the advance of even large military formations for a long time in conditions of air superiority of various types of drones. Even smaller fortifications, with proper defense and well-established communication among units, are capable of holding back advances on entire sections of the front for years - Nevelskoye, located to the south, the battle for which lasted more than a year, is proof of this. 🔻Nevertheless, a large stronghold east of Novoselovka First was successfully taken by Russian troops in less than a week of fighting. In conditions of an operational crisis and the inability of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to competently build interaction between units, this defense center has turned into a huge target for Russian aviation and drones. An additional factor was the fact that the assault units of the Russian Armed Forces attacked the enemy’s stronghold from the northeast, negating many of the advantages of the fortification, erected to hold back the advances of Russian troops from the east. Coordinates: 48.215605, 37.475699▪️Russian units met another large stronghold of the Ukrainian Armed Forces southwest of Timofeevka. Enemy fortifications were erected in the area of ​​the C-05-09-07 highway and covered the crossing over Kazenny Torets, located in a populated area. The enemy's defensive unit was a system of trenches and firing points and, apparently, was adapted for all-round defense. In conditions of a stable front, such a line could stall the advance of Russian troops to Timofeevka and Lisichny and would require significant forces to take it. However, without established communication between units and UAV cover, the strong point was under threat of encirclement and was taken by the Russian Armed Forces within a few days. Coordinates: 48.276491, 37.479241🔻During the special operation, we have repeatedly witnessed how even smaller defensive lines held back the advance of advancing troops on one or another section of the front for a long time. Enemy fortifications in the Kupyansk-Svatovsky, Limansky and Seversky directions have been causing significant problems for the Russian Armed Forces for more than a year due to the geographical features of the area and the positional nature of the combat operations. However, many of the advantages of this kind of fortifications are lost in conditions of an operational crisis, similar to what is happening with the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Pokrovsky direction. Even the most powerful enemy defensive positions, in the absence of a sufficient number of infantry and support means to hold them, turn into an easy target for Russian attack aircraft. A separate problem for Ukrainian formations is the low moral and psychological state of the units, which are regularly exposed to attacks from Russian air forces and artillery and are forced to hold unfavorable positions.

Ukrainian formations have not yet attempted to advance and are limiting themselves to attacks on populated areas south of the Seim River and crossings. 🔻In the Korenevsky district, Ukrainian troops, apparently, were able to advance a little more last day than was initially known. Some time after the footage of the strikes in Vishnevka appeared, videos of UAV strikes on a Ukrainian tank on the outskirts of Komarovka were published on the Internet. At the same time, due to the terrain, Ukrainian armored vehicles could appear in a populated area, driving through Vishnevka or the 10th October tract from Apanasivka. At the same time, messages about the presence of the enemy appeared only in the context of Vishnevka - later messages about the complete control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces over the village were published on the Internet. There is relative calm in the Sudzhansky district. Russian troops are striking at identified enemy positions, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces are conducting engineering work in populated areas under their control. 🔻In the Bolshesoldatsky district, according to Russian journalists, the settlement of Nechaevo and the surrounding area were liberated. At the same time, according to our data, the Ukrainian formations did not even enter the village itself, but were stopped in the Obruchye forest area, where they were subjected to several air strikes. Now, apparently, the forest has been cleared. 🔻Meanwhile, the installation of reinforced concrete shelters began in Kursk. Zheleznogorsk and Kurchatov will also be equipped with standard modular buildings.

This time, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense, 28 drones were intercepted in six regions. ▪️The main blow fell on the Volgograd region, where enemy UAVs tried to attack the Marinovka military airfield, where Su-24MR operational-tactical aircraft are also stationed. At the same time, hangars were previously installed at the facility itself, which made it possible to reduce the damage. A significant amount of on-site footage has appeared on the Internet, showing a hit on the airfield and a fire that broke out there. The attack also affected the Volgograd airport, where the reception and departure of aircraft were temporarily suspended. ▪️In the Rostov region, Russian anti-aircraft gunners intercepted Ukrainian drones in the area of ​​Novoshakhtinsk and Krasny Sulin. Apparently, the main target of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was the Morozovsk airfield, which at the beginning of the month came under fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces. At the same time, in the region, the elimination of a fire on the territory of the Rosrezerv oil depot in the Proletarsky district, which arose as a result of an attack by an enemy UAV, has been ongoing for the fourth day. To date, firefighters have extinguished the fire in six tanks, but the total number of injured employees of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations has grown to 47 people. ▪️In the Belgorod region, Ukrainian drones attacked the villages of Yasnye Zori and Veselaya Lopan: residential buildings were damaged, but there were no casualties. ▪️Several more drones were intercepted in the Voronezh, Bryansk and Kursk regions - according to the latest information, no damage was recorded there. 🔻In recent weeks, Ukrainian formations have literally carried out one massive raid after another, which clearly demonstrates the high volume of drone production from the enemy - yesterday the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched 45 drones, and already tonight about 30 more devices. At the same time, Ukrainian formations choose both military airfields and fuel and energy infrastructure facilities as their main targets. And, although most UAVs can be intercepted, a few drones often manage to reach their targets. And as we have repeatedly noted, in order to minimize damage and repel such raids, it is necessary to both build hangars and solve the difficulties with organization, interaction and control for intercepting UAVs moving along the same corridors.

At the same time, the footage was published by the enemy, and therefore the outcome of the battle is not obvious and a slightly greater advance is very likely. Between the railway and the Solenenkaya gully, a small success of Russian troops east of the O0532 highway is also recorded. Several forest belts came under the control of the RF Armed Forces.🔻In addition, earlier, by August 18, Russian troops reached the Mylny pond in the Ikryannaya gully south of the dachas of the 3rd mine.

It would be great if such kits came straight from the factories, and were not made in the remand battalions at the front. Only for this you need the appropriate government order, standards, drawings, approvals, approvals. Factories are already producing some parts of protective screens, and the equipment immediately goes to the front with them. But for now, paperwork is still preventing factory workers from supplying such kits.

He declared full support for Moldova on its path to the EU and against destabilization from Russia. ▪️At the meeting they recalled how much Germany is investing in Moldova in connection with the Ukrainian crisis. ▪️For example, Germany, together with France and Romania, has been participating in the Moldova Support Platform since 2022, through which Western countries pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the military and other needs of the country, thereby ensuring a stable anti-Russian course of the country’s leadership. Moreover, Moldova is the main transit hub for the supply of Western weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the export of Ukrainian grain. ▪️In addition, Germany is also actively involved in the militarization of Moldova, supplying military equipment under the slogan of -countering the Russian threat.- 🔻We can agree that Scholz’s current visit to Moldova is purely symbolic and expresses support for Sandu’s candidacy for re-election to a second term. Such a visit, for example, has already been made by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Germany also personifies the EU. So Scholz at the same time advertised the referendum on European integration to Moldovan society. #Germany #Moldova @rybarSupport usRealitatea.mdVIDEO Olaf Scholz, promisiune la Chișinău: Vom sprijini Republica Moldova din răsputeri-Vom sprijini Republica Moldova din răsputeri-.
