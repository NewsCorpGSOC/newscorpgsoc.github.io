US Congress Warns of Rising Costs and Challenges in US Navy's 2025 Shipbuilding Plan	According to information published by the US Gov on January 6, 2025, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released its analysis of the U.S. Navy’s ambitious 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, highlighting significant increases in costs and challenges in execution. The plan envisions a modernized fleet to address evolving maritime threats, but the financial and logistical demands underscore the scale of the undertaking.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Virginia-class submarine USS Texas at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. (Picture source: US DoD) The Navy aims to expand its current fleet of 295 battle force ships to 390 by 2054, while also integrating 134 unmanned surface and undersea vessels. However, the fleet is expected to shrink in the near term, dropping to 283 ships by 2027 due to planned retirements before rebounding in subsequent years. This strategy aligns with the Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations concept, which emphasizes spreading offensive and defensive capabilities across a larger number of platforms. The costs of implementing the 2025 plan are projected to average $40.1 billion annually, adjusted for inflation, over the next three decades. This represents a 46 percent increase compared to the Navy’s recent funding levels. The CBO’s projections are significantly higher than the Navy’s estimates, reflecting differing assumptions about labor, materials, and inflation trends in shipbuilding. For example, the CBO estimates the cost of Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers will be billions more than the Navy projects. Challenges within the shipbuilding industrial base compound the difficulties of meeting the Navy’s goals. Shipyard production rates have slowed dramatically, with construction times for destroyers and submarines extending to nearly a decade. Labor shortages and an aging supplier base further complicate efforts, particularly as shipyards face increasing demands for complex vessels like nuclear-powered submarines. To address these issues, the Navy has committed $10 billion to improve the submarine industrial base, including investments in workforce development and infrastructure. The plan also emphasizes the construction of six Ford-class carriers to replace aging Nimitz-class vessels, a continued investment in attack submarines, and the development of next-generation destroyers and smaller combatants. However, delays in new ship classes and cost overruns could impact the Navy’s ability to meet its long-term objectives. For example, the introduction of the next-generation attack submarine has been postponed to 2040, while production rates for the Virginia-class submarines have not yet met planned targets. While the Navy’s focus on unmanned systems signals a strategic pivot toward future warfare, these platforms remain largely in the development phase, with unclear costs and capabilities. The integration of unmanned vessels into the fleet will be critical to achieving the Navy’s vision of a hybrid force, but questions remain about the technological readiness and operational role of these systems. The CBO’s analysis serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges inherent in such an ambitious plan. The envisioned fleet reflects the Navy’s response to growing geopolitical threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, but the realization of this vision will require careful navigation of fiscal constraints, industrial limitations, and strategic priorities. As Congress reviews the 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, the balance between ambition and feasibility will be a focal point. The decisions made in the coming years will shape the future of the U.S. Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-congress-warns-of-rising-costs-and-challenges-in-us-navys-2025-shipbuilding-plan	2025-01-09T01:58:31-08:00	
UAE could transfer up to 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets to Morocco with France’s consent	On January 8, 2025, LeDesk reported that discussions are progressing on a possible transfer of 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Morocco, contingent upon France’s agreement. According to Emirati sources, Abu Dhabi could cede half of its Mirage 2000-9E fleet to the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) once the UAE begins receiving deliveries of Rafale F4 jets from Paris, scheduled for 2027.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. (Picture source: Army Recognition) This prospect was initially deemed unlikely four years ago, but it has gained momentum following the visit of Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita to France in April 2024, along with reports mentioning King Mohammed VI’s private stay in Abu Dhabi. A three-year suspension initially delayed the Mirage sale, mostly because the original 1998 contract stipulates that any transfer of these aircraft requires French consent for re-export. The potential transfer of Emirati Mirage 2000-9 aircraft to Morocco gained additional attention when the French government reportedly explored the option of buying back some UAE Mirages to provide them to Ukraine. This requirement complicated the transaction, but the UAE’s preference leaned toward selling part of its fleet, with 30 Mirage 2000-9s intended for Morocco and a portion for Egypt. While an agreement in principle appears to exist, no official statements have confirmed the final steps, delivery schedule, or upgrade packages. Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April of the previous year but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. Abu Dhabi signed a significant contract with France in December 2021 for 80 Rafale F4 jets and 12 military helicopters, valued at about $18 billion, marking the largest international order for Rafale fighters since their introduction in 2004. With the UAE set to retire some Mirage 2000-9s in favor of the Rafale F4, several countries, including Iraq, Greece, Egypt, and Morocco, have been mentioned in discussions about receiving secondhand Mirage 2000s. On the Moroccan side, the RMAF currently operates around two-dozen upgraded Mirage F-1MF2000 aircraft, about two-dozen F-5s, and approximately two-dozen F-16C/D Block 52+ fighters. Morocco has also ordered an additional 25 F-16C/D Block 72 jets for delivery between late 2025 and 2027 and has been mentioned as potentially becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire the F-35 Lightning II from the United States. As reported on January 8, 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense may finalize a deal for 32 F-35 fighters for Morocco, with an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, including procurement and maintenance. If concluded, this acquisition would introduce fifth-generation capabilities to the RMAF, which analysts believe is motivated by Morocco’s rivalry with Algeria, especially concerning Western Sahara. Algeria has reportedly signed a contract for 14 Russian Su-57 fighters, complementing Su-30MKA and Su-35 jets in its inventory. This purchase is part of a broader effort in Algiers to maintain what it perceives as a necessary regional balance. Diplomatic friction persists between Morocco and Algeria, particularly following the 2021 severing of ties and ongoing disagreements over Western Sahara and the Polisario Front. Originally designed to offer an upgrade over the Mirage 2000-5, the 2000-9 includes a digital autopilot, advanced electronic warfare systems, and a cockpit arrangement similar in some respects to that of the Rafale. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Meanwhile, the presence of Emirati Mirage 2000-9s in different theaters has drawn scrutiny from various governments. On July 24, 2024, at least seven Emirati Mirage 2000-9DAD/EAD fighter-bombers were deployed to a People’s Liberation Army Air Force base in Xinjiang province, China, for the Falcon Shield 2024 exercise. Supported by C-17A Globemaster III transports and an A330 MRTT tanker, the UAE contingent cooperated with Chinese forces for the second consecutive edition of these drills. Analysts in the United States expressed concern that Beijing could gain insights into Western aviation technology through such interactions. UAE-China defense cooperation has already produced tensions, with the suspension in 2021 of negotiations to sell 50 F-35 Lightning II fighters to Abu Dhabi, reportedly due to disagreements over technical requirements, cost issues, and concerns about Chinese involvement in UAE military affairs. The UAE Air Force, which also operates over 70 F-16 Block 60 fighters of American origin, has thus diversified its fleet with Western and Chinese systems, including Hongdu L-15 trainers and Wing Loong drones. The Mirage 2000-9 is based on Dassault’s Mirage 2000 design, featuring an advanced modular avionics architecture, a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan engine, and a delta-wing configuration. Its technical enhancements include the RDY-2 or RBY-2 radar, integration of MICA air-to-air missiles, and capacity for precision-guided munitions such as the Shehan (or Shehab) laser-designation pod, guided bombs, and the Black Shaheen cruise missile, which is the export version of the SCALP-EG. Originally designed to offer an upgrade over the Mirage 2000-5, the 2000-9 includes a digital autopilot, advanced electronic warfare systems, and a cockpit arrangement similar in some respects to that of the Rafale. Historical records indicate that 62 Mirage 2000-9s were ordered new or upgraded from older Mirage 2000 airframes in the UAE’s previous contracts. Enhanced maintenance and modernization work have been carried out since 2019, through deals signed by Dassault Aviation, Thales, and MBDA, extending the service life of these aircraft into the 2030s. The Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 920 knots, a wingspan of 9.1 meters, a height of 5.2 meters, a length of 14.4 meters, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. The aircraft is powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner. Its RDY-2 radar allows both air-to-air and air-to-surface operations, with maximum detection ranges cited at more than 140 kilometers. The model’s armament options include MICA EM and IR missiles, up to 2,000-liter drop tanks, the Black Shaheen cruise missile, laser-guided bombs such as the BGL-1000, and other guided weapons, often linked to Thales or MBDA systems for targeting and electronic warfare. Maintenance and upgrade programs have involved not only Dassault but also engine manufacturer Snecma (now Safran) and electronics firms such as Thales, Smiths, Elettronica, and others. Powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner, the Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 1,700 km/h, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Dassault Mirage 2000 itself was developed in the 1970s to replace older Mirage III fighters in French service. The single-engine, delta-wing Mirage 2000 first flew in March 1978, eventually evolving into multiple variants, including the Mirage 2000C, the nuclear-oriented Mirage 2000N, and the Mirage 2000D specialized in conventional strikes. The 2000-5 introduced enhancements for multirole operations, while the 2000-9 for the UAE included more sophisticated avionics, radar upgrades, and an expanded suite of weapons. Dassault’s official literature also highlighted the aircraft’s modular avionics design, improved digital flight controls, high maneuverability, and multiple weapons integrations. Over 600 Mirage 2000s of all variants were produced, entering service in countries such as France, the UAE, India, Greece, Taiwan, Egypt, Peru, Qatar, and Brazil. Some have been retired in favor of newer platforms like the Rafale or F-16, but others remain in active service with regular upgrades. The Dassault Mirage 2000’s historical backdrop includes extensive use by the French Air Force in NATO missions and various operations. The type served in the Gulf War, the Bosnian conflict, and over Kosovo. It was also deployed in Afghanistan, with the Mirage 2000D variant performing precision strikes in conjunction with Allied forces. France continues to operate the Mirage 2000-5 and Mirage 2000D, though it has gradually introduced the Rafale to replace older models. In 2011, French Mirage 2000s participated in operations over Libya. More recently, France committed aircraft to combat the Islamic State group, though some have been replaced by newer Rafales. Discussions arose in 2024 regarding Mirage 2000s and the possibility of sending them to Ukraine, but no official confirmation came from France’s Ministry of Defense despite inquiries. In other nations, including India, the Mirage 2000 saw notable use in the 1999 Kargil conflict and ongoing modernization. India’s fleet is designated the Vajra and has undergone an upgrade to near-2000-5 levels, with new radars, weapons, and electronic warfare suites. Other operators such as Greece, Taiwan, Qatar, Egypt, and Peru either still deploy the Mirage 2000 or have done so in recent decades, occasionally pursuing local upgrades or additional weapon integrations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/uae-could-transfer-up-to-30-mirage-2000-9e-fighter-jets-to-morocco-with-frances-consent	2025-01-09T01:49:23-08:00

These tests demonstrate the X-59's capability to operate at supersonic speeds while maintaining a relatively low sonic boom, a key goal of the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. Lockheed Martin, in collaboration with NASA, is developing the X-59 as part of an effort to break through the barriers that currently prevent commercial supersonic flight over land due to noise concerns.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Lockheed Martin X-59 aircraft undergoes afterburner testing, marking a pivotal moment in its development as part of the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. (Picture source Lockheed Martin) The afterburner test phase is a crucial component of the X-59's broader performance evaluation, as it assesses the aircraft's ability to accelerate to supersonic speeds with minimal environmental impact. The afterburner itself is a key technology used in supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, adding fuel to the exhaust stream after combustion to generate additional thrust, often resulting in higher speeds. The X-59’s design, however, incorporates advanced modifications to its afterburner system aimed at minimizing the loud sonic boom typically associated with supersonic flight. This test is a critical step toward Lockheed Martin’s and NASA’s goal of achieving a breakthrough in supersonic travel that could lead to a future where commercial airlines are capable of flying faster than the speed of sound without producing the disruptive sonic booms that have historically been a deterrent for passengers and communities on the ground. The X-59, as part of the QueSST program, has been designed with a sleek, long fuselage and a unique tail configuration that allow it to cut through the air more efficiently, reducing shockwaves that normally result in the loud 'boom' heard when conventional supersonic aircraft break the sound barrier. As part of the ongoing testing process, the X-59 has been undergoing a series of engine runs, structural tests, and evaluations of its aerodynamics and acoustic emissions. The aircraft's design features, including its elongated nose and specialized engine nacelles, are specifically optimized to reduce the intensity of the sonic boom to a mere 'sonic thump' that would be barely noticeable to people on the ground. Lockheed Martin’s video provides a glimpse into the rigorous testing process that has been conducted, including capturing the afterburner ignition and the aircraft’s ability to maintain supersonic speeds while producing significantly lower noise levels. The successful completion of the afterburner tests is seen as a major leap forward for the X-59 program, bringing the aircraft closer to its next phase of testing, which will involve flight tests at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center. There, engineers and researchers will conduct supersonic flight tests over a series of designated test sites, collecting data on the aircraft's acoustic emissions and evaluating the community’s reaction to the reduced sonic boom. If these tests prove successful, the X-59 could pave the way for commercial supersonic flights over land in the near future. The development of the X-59 is particularly timely as the global aviation industry has been exploring ways to reduce travel times and improve efficiency in air travel, with supersonic transport offering the potential for significantly faster journeys. The aircraft’s success could ultimately lead to a new generation of supersonic jets capable of operating within the confines of modern noise regulations, potentially revolutionizing air travel. Lockheed Martin has expressed its commitment to continuing the testing phase in close collaboration with NASA, with the ultimate goal of certifying the X-59 for commercial use. Should the project succeed, it could open the door for future supersonic transport aircraft that are quieter, more efficient, and capable of dramatically shortening flight times on long-haul routes. Beyond its commercial prospects, the X-59's innovative design and advanced technologies also hold significant potential for military applications. The aircraft's ability to fly at supersonic speeds while minimizing the sonic boom could be a game-changer for military operations, especially in reconnaissance, strike missions, and rapid response scenarios. Traditional supersonic military aircraft, such as the Concorde-based supersonic bombers or fighter jets, generate substantial noise when breaking the sound barrier, often alerting adversaries to their presence. The X-59's reduced sonic signature would enable military forces to conduct high-speed operations without the usual warning signs, offering enhanced stealth and surprise. Furthermore, its ability to maintain supersonic speeds over long distances without compromising operational efficiency could make it an ideal platform for rapid strategic deployment, long-range reconnaissance, or even covert strikes. These capabilities, combined with its potential to reduce flight time across vast areas, could transform modern military operations, providing forces with a significant edge in both conventional and asymmetric warfare environments. This latest development highlights the increasing strides being made in the field of supersonic aviation, as aerospace companies work toward creating faster, quieter, and more sustainable aircraft to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving aviation market. With the afterburner tests now completed, the X-59 is one step closer to changing the way the world travels by air, while also expanding its potential for military operations on a global scale.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-us-lockheed-martins-x-59-achieves-key-afterburner-test-milestone-in-quiet-supersonic-aviation-revolution	2025-01-09T01:39:51-08:00

Analysis: Why Donald Trump wants Greenland for US missile defense and rare earth supplies	On January 8, 2025, the BBC reported that Donald Trump reaffirmed his intention for the United States to acquire Greenland, emphasizing its importance for national security and economic interests. Trump did not rule out using military or economic measures to pursue this objective, highlighting Greenland's strategic significance for Arctic defense and resource extraction. Greenland’s leadership, supported by Denmark, strongly rejected the proposal, reiterating that the territory is not for sale and emphasizing the principle of self-determination.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The M1A2 SEP V3 Abrams tank integrates advanced systems that require rare earth elements for components like electronics, sensors, and communication systems, though the specific rare earths involved are not publicly detailed. (Picture source: US DoD) Donald Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland is driven by its strategic military significance and abundant natural resources. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. Additionally, the island's vast reserves of minerals, including rare earth elements, present substantial economic opportunities. Trump views acquiring Greenland as essential for countering geopolitical rivals like Russia and China, who are increasing their presence in the Arctic region. The United States has shown interest in Greenland since 1867, when Secretary of State William H. Seward explored purchasing both Greenland and Iceland, though Congress opposed the idea. After World War II, in 1946, the U.S. offered Denmark $100 million in gold bars for Greenland, citing military necessity, but Denmark declined. During the Cold War, the U.S. established the Thule Air Base in Greenland, underscoring the island's strategic importance. Trump's recent proposals echo these historical attempts, emphasizing both security and economic factors. Reactions to Trump's proposal have been predominantly negative. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dismissed the idea as unrealistic, stating that Greenland is not for sale. Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede reiterated that the island is not on the market, emphasizing Greenland's autonomy and the importance of self-determination. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also rejected the notion, stressing the need to respect allies' sovereignty. These responses reflect a consensus that Greenland's future should be determined by its inhabitants, rather than external actors. The discussion surrounding Greenland is tied to the importance of critical raw materials (CRMs), including rare earth elements. These materials are essential for manufacturing technologies such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems, as well as defense systems. CRMs are categorized by their economic value and their unique properties, which are often irreplaceable in high-tech applications, coupled with their limited availability and the complexities associated with their extraction and processing. For instance, the European Union identified 34 such materials in its latest 2024 Critical Raw Materials Act. More importantly, such materials are vital for the production of most modern military vehicles, which require specific CRMs for structural, electronic, and propulsion components. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. (Picture source: US DoD) For example, critical raw materials (CRMs) are essential to producing tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, such as the Swedish-made CV90. Infantry fighting vehicles heavily rely on aluminum for structural components and graphite for electronic systems, ensuring functionality under diverse operational conditions. Beryllium is used in connectors and onboard electronics due to its lightweight and conductive properties. Titanium and iron/steel are employed for armor and propulsion systems, with the latter providing durability and structural strength. Copper supports communication systems, while tungsten enhances precision-guided mechanisms and armament effectiveness. Fighter aircraft, like the American F-16 and F-35, require a broad array of CRMs due to their high-performance demands. Aluminum and graphite are key for airframes, including the body, wings, and tail, due to their lightweight and strength. Titanium is widely used in propulsion systems, including turbines and nozzles, for its heat resistance and strength. Copper is applied in electro-optical and control systems, while nickel is used in airframes and propulsion systems for heat resistance. Rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium enable advanced avionics and control systems. Borates and gallium are crucial for radar, sensors, and electronic warfare systems, highlighting the reliance on materials with specific electromagnetic properties. Warships depend on a narrower but critical set of materials. Aluminum is used for decks, superstructures, and propulsion shafts, while titanium and iron/steel form the hulls and structural reinforcements for their corrosion resistance and strength. Copper supports propulsion systems and onboard electrical components. Lithium and silver are utilized in battery technologies for submarines and torpedoes, enabling energy storage and propulsion. Nickel and cobalt are integral to electronic systems, navigation radars, and sonar, providing reliability in marine environments. These materials collectively ensure the vessels' operational effectiveness in various naval scenarios. China leads the global production of rare earth elements, accounting for 69% of output in 2023, with a mine production of approximately 240,000 metric tons. The United States produced 43,000 metric tons (12.3% of global production), followed by Myanmar (38,000 metric tons), Australia (18,000 metric tons), Thailand, India, and Russia in smaller quantities. China also dominates refining and processing capabilities, which are critical for transforming raw materials into usable components for high-tech and defense industries. In December 2023, China imposed an export ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies, citing national security concerns. The ban aimed to preserve China's technological edge and limit other nations' ability to achieve independence in this sector. Additional measures in 2024 included production and export quotas aimed at preserving domestic supplies for priority industries. China has declared rare earth resources state-owned and has used export restrictions in trade negotiations and geopolitical disputes, solidifying its influence over global supply chains. The U.S. defense industry heavily relies on Chinese rare earth materials, which constitute approximately 80% of the supply used in defense systems. The embargo affects the production of technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, which require rare earth magnets, creating risks of supply chain disruptions, delays in manufacturing, and increased costs. To address this, the U.S. is exploring alternative sources and increasing domestic investment in rare earth production to reduce dependency and strengthen supply chain resilience. Donald Trump's latest announcements on Greenland, while seemingly extreme, may therefore seem logical from a purely strategic point of view.

Originally developed in Switzerland by Oerlikon, Skynex is now built at Rheinmetall Italia, circumventing Swiss restrictions on direct exports of completed war materials while adhering to regulations permitting the transfer of technological know-how. This approach facilitated deployment to Ukraine under a contract financed by the German government. By the end of 2023, two Skynex systems, financed by the German government and valued at 183 million Swiss francs, were delivered to Ukrainian forces. Germany subsequently placed orders for three more units, bringing the total value to around 500 million euros. Some systems even arrived ahead of schedule via the Polish logistics hub in Rzeszow. Following the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, Rheinmetall announced shorter delivery times for Skynex due to investments in personnel and infrastructure, reducing the timeline from two years to approximately one year. Rheinmetall Italia invested €100 million in 2023 and an additional €20 million in 2024 to expedite production and address increased demand. Personnel numbers are expected to grow from 450 to about 550 by early 2025, and the supplier roster expanded from 467 in 2022 to 762 in 2024.

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Italy’s decision to invest in four systems follows NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s visit to Rheinmetall Italia’s Rome headquarters on November 5, 2024. This visit coincided with his meetings with President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and focused on reviewing new air defense technologies, such as Skynex, which Germany financed and donated to Ukraine. Rheinmetall AG is also collaborating with Leonardo to produce the Panther tank and Lynx tracked vehicle for the Italian Army, a partnership valued at over €23 billion over fifteen years. This cooperation aims to develop new heavy tanks, known as Main Battle Tanks, and address future European requirements under the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program. The Rome plant now plays a pivotal role in Rheinmetall’s global operations, overseeing major radar and cannon production. The company’s turnover in Italy exceeds one billion euros, with six plants nationwide. The Skynex air defense system includes several modular components designed for short-range and very short-range operations. It features four Revolver Gun Mk3 cannons, each capable of firing 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of up to 4 kilometers. The system utilizes programmable 35 mm Ahead ammunition, resistant to electronic countermeasures, for precise target engagement. Its CN-1 command module enables centralized control, while the X-TAR3D X-band radar ensures 360-degree target acquisition, classification, and tracking. Mobility is supported by HX trucks, and the modular design allows the integration of additional sensors and effectors, such as the SkyKnight missile, which extends the engagement range to 10 kilometers. The distributed component design reduces the risk of significant damage from single strikes. The Skynex system can address various aerial threats, including rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), NATO-class I drones, and loitering munitions. Its radar provides continuous 360-degree coverage, enabling tracking and classification in diverse environmental and electronic conditions. The programmable 35 mm ammunition creates a dense projectile pattern, ensuring an effective engagement of small, fast-moving targets. Rheinmetall Italia cited the success of Germany’s Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun in Ukraine as validation of cannon-based short-range defense systems. The company emphasizes the lower cost of 35 mm munitions compared to missiles and the rounds’ resistance to electronic interference. The modular architecture supports adaptability to mission-specific needs, allowing the integration of effectors like high-energy lasers or missiles to counter saturation attacks. These features make Skynex suitable for protecting critical infrastructure and deployed forces, enabling a robust response to evolving threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/italy-purchases-four-skynex-35mm-air-defense-systems-to-counter-low-altitude-and-short-range-threats	2025-01-08T04:09:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukrainian F-16 Fighter Jet Pilot Sets Historic Record by Destroying Six Missiles in a Single Mission	According to a report published on January 7, 2025, by the Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, a Ukrainian pilot flying an F-16 Fighting Falcon has achieved a remarkable feat by destroying six enemy cruise missiles in a single combat mission. This historic achievement occurred during a massive missile and drone attack in December 2024, marking a milestone in the F-16’s capability to engage and eliminate high-speed missile threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image: A Ukrainian pilot in front of an F-16 Fighting Falcon donated by Ukraine's international allies. (Picture source: Social Network) The Ukrainian pilot successfully intercepted and destroyed four cruise missiles using the F-16’s air-to-air missiles (AAMs) and then proceeded to eliminate two more missiles using the M61 Vulcan cannon. The F-16’s radar systems, including the AN/APG-68 radar, proved crucial in tracking the fast-moving missile targets, even those equipped with electronic countermeasures (REBs). This made the mission not only historically significant but also a testament to the high skill of the Ukrainian pilot and the versatile nature of the F-16 as a missile defense platform. While the Ukrainian F-16 pilot’s success is unprecedented, other F-16 pilots have also engaged in missile interception missions in previous combat scenarios, offering valuable insight into the aircraft’s ability to neutralize aerial threats. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, F-16s were used to intercept and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles, though their success in directly destroying these missiles was limited. F-16s were primarily tasked with striking missile launchers and air defense systems, but they also worked in tandem with Patriot missile defense systems to counter ballistic missile threats. The AIM-7 Sparrow missiles and radar systems on the F-16 allowed for some interception capabilities against the low-flying Scud missiles. This mission highlighted the F-16’s adaptability in missile defense operations, even in high-risk scenarios. Similarly, during Operation Allied Force in 1999, F-16s were integral in the broader NATO missile defense strategy, which involved targeting and neutralizing Serbian missile launchers and air defense sites. While the F-16 was not directly involved in intercepting incoming missiles, it provided essential offensive strikes against missile launch sites that posed significant threats to NATO aircraft. F-16 pilots contributed to air superiority by eliminating missile systems and supporting the overall missile defense efforts. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has extensive experience in missile defense operations, including using the F-16 to engage airborne missile threats. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Israeli F-16s were involved in countering Katyusha rockets and other short-range missiles fired by Hezbollah. Though the F-16 did not directly intercept these rockets with its cannon or air-to-air missiles, it played a critical role in eliminating missile launch sites and providing surveillance, which allowed other defense systems like the Iron Dome to neutralize the threats. The F-16’s precision strikes and close air support proved to be vital in controlling the airspace and eliminating missile launch points. In Turkey, during the Syrian Civil War, Turkey’s F-16s were actively used in countering ballistic missile threats from Syria. While Patriot missile systems served as the primary missile defense, F-16s were tasked with surveillance and offensive strikes against missile launchers and ground-based missile systems. These missions further demonstrated the F-16’s versatility in dealing with missile threats, often working in conjunction with other air defense systems to provide comprehensive protection. The M61 Vulcan cannon mounted on the F-16 is a 6-barrel, 20mm rotary cannon capable of firing at 6,000 rounds per minute. While it is commonly used in close-range dogfights and against aerial targets like enemy aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), its application against missiles is extremely rare and highly challenging. The cannon’s high rate of fire and short-range effectiveness make it a difficult tool to use against fast-moving missiles, which often require precise tracking and engagement at very close distances—typically under 500 meters. In the case of the Ukrainian pilot’s mission, the M61 Vulcan was used against two incoming cruise missiles, which required the pilot to close the distance and engage the target with great precision. While the primary method of missile interception in the F-16 is through air-to-air missiles (AAMs) like the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the cannon proved useful in situations where close-range engagement was necessary, especially in scenarios where the aircraft's missiles had already been expended or the threat was in the final stages of approach. The historic achievement by the Ukrainian F-16 pilot in destroying six missiles in one mission is a significant moment in the evolution of missile defense using F-16s. The aircraft’s radar systems, air-to-air missiles, and M61 Vulcan cannon allow for a range of interception options against high-speed aerial threats, from cruise missiles to ballistic projectiles. The experiences of other F-16 pilots in past combat situations, including the U.S., Israel, and Turkey, further highlight the fighter's versatility in missile defense roles, whether in directly destroying missiles or supporting broader air defense strategies. The success of the Ukrainian F-16 pilot underscores the growing capabilities of the F-16 Fighting Falcon in modern warfare, particularly in high-intensity conflicts where missile threats are increasingly sophisticated. With continued training, technology upgrades, and combat experience, the F-16 is proving to be a formidable weapon in the global fight against missile proliferation and aerial threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-jet-pilot-sets-historic-record-by-destroying-six-missiles-in-a-single-mission	2025-01-08T03:11:10-08:00	
Development of Combat UAVs in Japan Through Strategic Partnership with Boeing	Boeing Japan, a subsidiary of the American aerospace multinational Boeing, secured a contract on December 10, 2024, with Japan's Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency (ATLA) to conduct research and simulation testing on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) designed to operate alongside manned aircraft. This initiative aligns with Japan's strategy to develop advanced technologies aimed at enhancing its military capabilities in autonomous systems and collaborative combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XQ-58A Valkyrie is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle designed by Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions for the U.S. Air Force's unmanned combat air vehicle program (Picture source: US DoD) Signed on October 18, 2024, for an amount of 155,177,000 JPY, approximately 1 million USD, this contract represents a significant step in Japan’s efforts to integrate UAVs into its military operations. ATLA explained that Boeing Japan was uniquely positioned to carry out this project due to its exclusive access to the required simulation software, along with the necessary technical resources and expertise. Japan's interest in combat UAVs is not a recent development. As early as December 2022, the Ministry of Defense (JMOD) announced plans to develop 'combat support UAVs' capable of collaborating with manned aircraft. These efforts are also part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a joint initiative between Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft. In December 2023, JMOD also signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct research on artificial intelligence for UAVs to ensure seamless integration with Japan's future fighter jets. The concept of collaborative UAVs, often referred to as 'loyal wingman' or 'collaborative combat aircraft' (CCA), aims to create autonomous drones capable of supporting manned aircraft in a range of missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and combat operations. One prominent example is Boeing Australia's MQ-28 Ghost Bat, a multi-role UAV developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. Designed as a 'force multiplier,' the Ghost Bat features advanced artificial intelligence and a modular nose section that can be customized to meet specific operational requirements. In July 2024, it was announced that Australia’s Ghost Bats would prioritize ISR capabilities over weapon systems, partially due to Boeing's unsuccessful bid for an autonomous combat jet program in the United States. Nevertheless, the Ghost Bat remains a viable candidate for Japan’s combat support UAV program, given its adaptability and role in multi-domain missions. Japan is also pursuing additional UAV development independently. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is working on two collaborative UAV concepts: one focused on tactical combat and another aimed at supporting manned aircraft operations. Both are being designed to integrate with the GCAP next-generation fighter, underscoring Japan’s commitment to incorporating cutting-edge technologies into its defense systems. In parallel with Boeing Japan's research, ATLA continues to explore other initiatives to advance autonomous capabilities. This month, the agency issued public bids for the development of stealth UAVs for aerial refueling and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) designed for explosive handling and mine countermeasures. The outcomes of Boeing Japan's simulation tests will play a crucial role in shaping ATLA and JMOD’s decisions on selecting UAVs that best align with Japan's defense requirements. These efforts reflect the country’s focus on modernizing its military through international partnerships and autonomous technological advancements. This contract between Boeing Japan and ATLA highlights a pivotal moment in Japan’s development of autonomous military capabilities. As the country invests in collaborative technologies for its future aircraft, partnerships with nations like the United States emphasize the importance of a strategic approach to addressing evolving defense challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/development-of-combat-uavs-in-japan-through-strategic-partnership-with-boeing	2025-01-08T02:30:36-08:00	
Lithuania Strengthens Its Drone Capabilities with New UAV Acquisitions from United States	Lithuania continues its commitment to enhancing its defense capabilities with recent acquisitions from the United States, including advanced manpack radios and small uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV). These agreements, signed by the Defence Materiel Agency (DMA) under the Ministry of National Defence, represent an investment in modernizing the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration photo issued by the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense. (Picture source: Lithuanian MoD) One of the key acquisitions involves a set of L3Harris manpack radios, valued at approximately 25 million dollars. These advanced communication systems will be integrated into Lithuania’s Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) and Vilkas Infantry Fighting Vehicles, providing enhanced communication capabilities for troops in the field. L3Harris radios are considered among the most advanced in their category, ensuring that the Lithuanian forces will have reliable and efficient communication technology. In addition to the radios, Lithuania secured a contract for the acquisition of a small UAS from the U.S. manufacturer AeroVironment Inc., a leader in uncrewed aerial systems. Worth 7.8 million dollars, this deal focuses on vertical take-off drones designed for fire control and adjustment tasks. These systems will be integrated with the Switchblade 600 combat drones, also acquired from the U.S. government. The UAS is scheduled for delivery by the end of 2025, with plans for future supplementation to further strengthen Lithuania's drone capabilities. AeroVironment offers several UAS (uncrewed aerial systems) models that could match the description given in the release, particularly vertical take-off drones for fire control and adjustment tasks. Here are some of the AeroVironment UAS models that could potentially be part of this acquisition. The Wasp AE is a tactical medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone designed to offer surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and it is capable of vertical takeoff using a launch ramp. Although it is larger than smaller UAS, it could be suitable for fire control tasks due to its surveillance capabilities and endurance. The Puma 3 AE is a small drone designed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is capable of vertical takeoff and landing and is used for tactical missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This model could be a good candidate for fire control and adjustment tasks, although it is lighter and designed for shorter missions.

This model is particularly useful for hard-to-access areas, which could make it an interesting option for fire control support missions. Lithuania’s growing acquisitions from the United States reflect its strengthening defense posture in the Baltic region. With a mid-term procurement plan valued at 1.3 billion dollars, the country has become the largest purchaser of U.S. weaponry among the Baltic states, accounting for approximately 20% of its military acquisitions. Among the systems acquired are Javelin anti-tank missiles, JLTV vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, HINARS, AMRAAM for medium-range NASAMS, and Switchblade drones, all contributing to the modernization of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. These acquisitions are part of Lithuania's broader defense strategy to improve its operational capabilities and strengthen regional security in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lithuania-strengthens-its-drone-capabilities-with-new-uav-acquisitions-from-united-states	2025-01-08T02:29:24-08:00	
Morocco could soon become the first Arab nation to acquire US-made F-35 stealth fighter jets	According to Identité Juive on November 22, 2024, Morocco is reportedly progressing toward becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States. The U.S. Department of Defense is expected to finalize an agreement for the delivery of 32 F-35 Lightning IIs, at an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, covering both procurement and maintenance. If confirmed, this acquisition would expand the Royal Moroccan Air Force’s inventory, which is currently centered on fourth-generation F-16 aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, the Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. (Picture source: US DoD) To date, Arab African nations show mixed outcomes regarding the acquisition of F-35 fighter jets. Türkiye ordered 30 F-35As, with plans for up to 100, but purchases were halted in 2020 due to U.S. sanctions over Türkiye’s procurement of the Russian S-400 missile system. Four jets were delivered but remain withheld at Luke Air Force Base, and the U.S. stated in February 2024 that Türkiye could be readmitted to the F-35 program if it resolves the S-400 issue. The United Arab Emirates signed a deal in January 2021 for 50 F-35s as part of a $23 billion arms package, but in December 2021, the UAE unilaterally suspended the agreement, citing technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost concerns. A senior UAE official indicated in September 2024 that discussions with the U.S. over the F-35 are not expected to resume. Qatar expressed interest in the F-35 in 2020, but U.S. policy to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge has prevented progress. Saudi Arabia has shown interest in the F-35 since 2012 but has not advanced toward an agreement, with obstacles including U.S. concerns about regional stability, human rights issues, and Israel’s military edge, leading to the potential acquisition of 100 Turkish KAAN fighters. Regarding Morocco, negotiations for the deal reportedly took place between 2020 and 2022, with Morocco seeking Israel’s assistance to facilitate discussions with U.S. authorities. A meeting in November 2021 between Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Moroccan Defense Minister Abdellatif Loudiyi is cited as instrumental in advancing these negotiations. Rising tensions with Algeria—particularly regarding the Western Sahara conflict and Algeria’s support for the Polisario Front—are considered major factors driving Morocco’s interest in these aircraft. Algeria’s acquisition of Russian Su-57 stealth fighters has also reportedly influenced Morocco's decision. Algeria is reported to have signed a contract for the acquisition of 14 Su-57 fighter jets from Russia as part of a broader military agreement that includes Su-34 and Su-35 aircraft. The Su-57, designated as a fifth-generation stealth fighter, incorporates features such as reduced radar cross-section, advanced avionics, and enhanced maneuverability. This reported procurement would add to Algeria's existing fleet of Su-30MKA and Su-35 aircraft, reflecting its effort to modernize its air force. If the agreement is implemented, Algeria could become the first country outside Russia to receive the Su-57. This acquisition aligns with Algeria’s strategy to maintain a regional military balance with Morocco amid ongoing tensions over Western Sahara. Algeria’s potential acquisition of the Su-57 is considered a significant factor influencing Morocco’s decision to modernize its forces with a comparable or superior fifth-generation stealth fighter, such as the F-35. (Picture source: Russian social media) Since Morocco annexed the region in 1975, Algeria has supported the Polisario Front, which advocates for Western Sahara’s independence, by providing political backing and hosting Sahrawi refugees. Algeria frames this support as consistent with its regional policies and anti-colonial stance. Morocco claims Western Sahara as part of its territory and has proposed limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Diplomatic relations between the two countries worsened in August 2021, when Algeria severed ties with Morocco, citing what it called 'hostile actions' related to the conflict. Morocco’s interest in the F-35 is therefore part of a broader effort to strengthen its defense capabilities in collaboration with Western allies, including the United States and Israel. This effort also includes acquisitions such as AH-64E Apache helicopters, M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, Bradley armored vehicles, and MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. The F-35 was prominently featured at the 7th Marrakech Air Show, held from October 30 to November 2, 2024, under the High Patronage of King Mohammed VI and with the support of the Royal Moroccan Air Force. The event showcased over 300 exhibitors and hosted 100 international delegations. Morocco also displayed its first Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopter at the event, part of an order for 24 units currently in production. In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, several factors would determine the outcome. The Su-57 is a fifth-generation stealth aircraft designed by Russia, capable of achieving speeds over Mach 2 and equipped with thrust-vectoring engines for enhanced maneuverability. The F-35, developed by the United States, prioritizes stealth and advanced avionics, with a low radar cross-section and integrated sensor fusion for improved situational awareness. The Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. This balance suggests that the F-35 could hold an advantage in beyond-visual-range scenarios, depending on the operational context and pilot expertise. The potential acquisition of Su-57 fighter jets by Algeria and F-35 aircraft by Morocco could shift the military balance in North Africa. Algeria's interest in the Su-57 appears aimed at countering Morocco's existing fleet of F-16s and its potential procurement of F-35s, raising the likelihood of a regional arms race. This development might prompt neighboring countries, such as Spain, to reassess their defense strategies, including the possible acquisition of F-35s to maintain strategic balance. The introduction of these advanced aircraft could impact the military equilibrium, increase tensions, and influence diplomatic relations within the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/morocco-could-soon-become-the-first-arab-nation-to-acquire-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-jets	2025-01-08T02:05:30-08:00	
Rafale Fighter Jets and Barracuda Submarines Propel French Arms Sales in 2024	After a year marked by a decline in orders in 2023, France’s defense industrial and technological base (BITD) achieved significant growth in 2024, with exports reaching €18 billion. This performance underscores the strategic importance of arms exports for the French economy and national sovereignty, while also highlighting the inherent volatility of the sector. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands (Picture source: Naval Group) In 2023, orders amounted to €8.2 billion, a modest figure compared to the €27 billion recorded in 2022. Although this decline was disappointing, the Ministry of the Armed Forces emphasized that annual fluctuations are largely influenced by the signing of major contracts. Notably, the global context remained favorable, with military expenditures reaching a record $2.443 trillion, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In 2024, the French defense industry rebounded strongly, with exports exceeding €18 billion. During a speech delivered at the Invalides courtyard on January 7, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu described 2024 as the 'second-best year in our history,' surpassing the €14 billion achieved in 2016. These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands. Despite these achievements, the minister emphasized the need to sustain efforts, pointing to promising prospects for 2025. Among them, he confirmed the sale of 14 Caracal helicopters to Iraq, though this figure raises questions. In September, Baghdad had announced a contract for 12 H225M Caracals, suggesting a potential additional order, though no further details have been provided. Looking ahead, Lecornu outlined priorities that include surface ships, particularly defense and intervention frigates, submarines, radars, artillery systems, helicopters, and Rafale jets. He also highlighted the strategic importance of the next-generation SAMP/T medium-range ground-based air defense system, designed to counter increasing ballistic threats, particularly from Iran and Russia. The minister reiterated that arms exports are critical for the BITD. Beyond supporting the trade balance and generating employment across France, they ensure national sovereignty by sustaining an industrial model developed in the 1960s. The results achieved in 2024 reflect the resilience and adaptability of the French defense industry. However, maintaining this momentum requires continued vigilance, particularly in a global context of evolving military expenditures and strategic challenges. With major opportunities already emerging, 2025 has the potential to further consolidate France’s position as a global leader in arms exports.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rafale-fighter-jets-and-barracuda-submarines-propel-french-arms-sales-in-2024	2025-01-08T01:53:54-08:00

This move also represents the country’s efforts to strengthen its defense autonomy and its complex geopolitical position, balancing its relations with both Eastern and Western powers. Türkiye's acquisition of the S-400 system, finalized in 2017 after a failed attempt to obtain the U.S. Patriot system, has long been a point of friction in its relations with the United States and NATO. The $2.5 billion deal was partly motivated by Turkey’s desire for technology transfer and local production capabilities, which were not included in the U.S. Patriot offer. In contrast, the Russian offer allowed Turkey to access both the system and the possibility of locally producing similar technologies. Despite international opposition, including Türkiye's exclusion from the F-35 program and subsequent sanctions, the acquisition of the S-400 is seen by Ankara as essential to strengthening national defense. Türkiye's deployment of four S-400 batteries in strategic locations, including the southern border with Syria, is designed to protect critical infrastructure and strengthen air defense against regional aerial threats. As Türkiye continues to integrate the S-400 into its defense framework, it also signals a broader shift in its relations with NATO. The visit of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to TUSAŞ, the Turkish aerospace company responsible for the development of the KAAN fighter jet, underscores the growing cooperation between Türkiye and the alliance. The integration of advanced defense technologies, such as the S-400, strengthens Turkey's position within NATO while contributing to the alliance's collective defense capabilities. Looking ahead, the S-400 system is expected to become a key element of Türkiye's air defense strategy, providing the country with a robust capability to counter a wide range of aerial threats. Its range of up to 400 kilometers makes it an indispensable tool for defending the geographically complex region Turkey occupies. The ongoing development of Turkey's multi-layered defense network, which includes the S-400, the SIPER system, and other technologies, will enhance its deterrence capabilities and solidify its defense posture in the face of evolving threats. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar summed up Türkiye's position by stating: 'Türkiye will continue investing in advanced technologies and protecting its national security, regardless of external pressures.' This commitment to strengthening its defense infrastructure through the integration of systems like the S-400 reinforces Türkiye's position as a key player in the international defense landscape. The integration of the S-400 into Türkiye's air defense network is not just a technical achievement but a strategic step toward enhancing national security. With its advanced capabilities and strategic deployment, the S-400 system will play a vital role in securing Türkiye’s airspace and shaping its defense policy in the years to come. The changing dynamics between Türkiye and NATO, along with increasing cooperation in technological innovation, suggest that the S-400 will be a crucial element in Türkiye's future defense policy and its broader geopolitical strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/tuerkiye-integrated-russian-s-400-into-air-defense-framework-amids-tensions-with-us	2025-01-08T01:33:41-08:00

While these upgrades represent a technological improvement, some concerns have been raised regarding the weight of the new tanks and their effectiveness in preventing a potential Chinese amphibious landing. Troops arrived in armored personnel carriers, supported by Apache and S-70 helicopters providing reconnaissance and covering fire. Army Captain Chuang Yuan-cheng, of the 542nd Armored Brigade, explained that current capabilities allow a communication officer to coordinate aerial attacks from the ground. This ensures synchronization between ground and airborne firepower, reflecting efforts to enhance the interoperability of Taiwan's forces. The drills will continue on Wednesday with a demonstration of the Patriot III missile defense system, designed to counter Chinese ballistic missile threats. They will conclude on Thursday with anti-submarine exercises near Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest port. This strategically important area is considered a potential target for Chinese forces seeking to establish a supply foothold in the event of a conflict. Held annually ahead of the Lunar New Year, these exercises aim to reassure the Taiwanese public about the military's defensive capabilities while also supporting recruitment efforts. Concurrently, Taiwan is pursuing an ambitious military modernization program, including pending U.S. arms orders worth approximately $20 billion, upgrades to its F-16 fighter jets, and the development of domestically-produced submarines. Additionally, mandatory military service has recently been extended to one year to bolster troop numbers. However, a legislative proposal from the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, in cooperation with the Taiwan People's Party, threatens to reduce the defense budget by 28%. By altering the distribution of funds between the central and local governments, this measure could undermine Taiwan's ability to sustain its defense efforts. National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu has warned that such reductions might also weaken the willingness of allies like the United States, Japan, and the Philippines to assist Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China. Currently, Taiwan allocates approximately 2.4% of its GDP—around $20 billion—annually to defense spending. This investment regularly draws criticism from Beijing, which views U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as provocative. Although China has issued repeated warnings, calling these sales a 'dangerous game,' its responses have so far been limited to targeted economic sanctions on involved companies and frequent military displays near Taiwan. Despite this pressure, most Taiwanese continue to support the current state of de facto independence. In conclusion, these military drills take place in a context of rising internal and external tensions. While Taiwan strengthens its defensive capabilities to counter potential threats from China, uncertainties surrounding defense funding raise questions about the sustainability of its military posture in the long term.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-conducts-military-drills-amid-concerns-over-defense-budget-cuts	2025-01-07T06:12:57-08:00

The program’s progress depends on overcoming current challenges, particularly in engine certification and integration, which will determine the aircraft’s viability for both military and civilian applications.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/russia-begins-testing-uts-800-turboprop-aircraft-to-lower-training-aircraft-expenses	2025-01-07T05:19:41-08:00	
Yemen Conflict: US Navy Dismantles Houthi Weapon Sites With Tomahawks	According to information published by the US DoD on January 3, 2025, U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyers from the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, operating in the Red Sea, launched a series of Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) against key Houthi infrastructure in Yemen. The strikes targeted command and control centers, weapon production facilities, and storage sites linked to the Iranian-backed Houthi movement.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyers from the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group launch precision Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles targeting Iranian-backed Houthi facilities in Yemen. (Picture source: US DoD) The TLAM is a cornerstone of U.S. naval power, known for its long range, precision, and versatility. With a range exceeding 1,000 miles, these subsonic cruise missiles can strike deep into hostile territory while maintaining the safety of their launch platforms. The Tomahawk's navigation systems, which integrate GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain contour matching technologies, enable exceptional accuracy. This capability is critical for engaging high-value, fixed targets like fortified command centers and weapons depots, ensuring effective neutralization of threats with minimal collateral damage. The destroyers used in this operation are part of the Arleigh Burke-class, which are equipped with the Aegis Combat System and vertical launch systems (VLS). These destroyers offer a robust combination of firepower, situational awareness, and survivability. The use of VLS allowed for rapid and simultaneous missile launches, enabling a coordinated strike on multiple targets. Operating from the Red Sea, the destroyers exploited the long range of the TLAMs to engage targets in Yemen while remaining outside the immediate reach of hostile forces. The targeted Houthi facilities played a key role in the group’s military capabilities. Striking command centers disrupted their ability to coordinate operations, while destroying weapon production sites and storage depots reduced their capacity to manufacture and deploy advanced weapons. Many of these facilities were likely tied to Iranian support, as evidenced by the Houthis’ use of sophisticated drones and missiles in previous attacks. By targeting these assets, the operation aimed to degrade Houthi operational effectiveness and mitigate threats to regional stability. The choice of TLAMs reflects their strategic advantages in modern warfare. These missiles provide a combination of precision, range, and scalability, allowing commanders to engage multiple, dispersed targets simultaneously. Their ability to receive in-flight retargeting data further enhances flexibility, enabling adjustments based on real-time intelligence. While their cost is significant, estimated at $1.5 million per missile, their effectiveness in neutralizing critical infrastructure justifies their use against high-value targets. Conducting such an operation in the Red Sea presents its own challenges, given the area’s strategic importance as a major maritime route and its proximity to potential adversaries. The Houthis, supported by Iran, have previously targeted commercial shipping and military assets in the region using drones, mines, and anti-ship missiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/yemen-conflict-us-navy-dismantles-houthi-weapon-sites-with-tomahawks	2025-01-07T05:04:25-08:00	
Taiwan's Communication Cable Damaged: Chinese Vessel Suspected in Sabotage	According to information published by Renminbao on January 6, 2025, a submarine communication cable off the northeastern coast of Taiwan was damaged last week, with suspicions pointing to a Chinese vessel dragging its anchor. The incident has sparked heightened concerns over potential gray-zone tactics employed by Beijing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan investigates damage to a key submarine communication cable, with suspicions pointing to a Chinese-linked cargo vessel, highlighting growing concerns over gray-zone tactics. (Picture source: Taiwanese Coast Guard) In the early hours of January 3, damage was reported to a four-core international submarine cable near Taiwan's northeastern waters, off Keelung. Taiwan's Coast Guard identified a Cameroon-flagged cargo ship, Shunxing 39, as a possible culprit. The vessel had been navigating irregularly in the area and reportedly dragged its anchor at the exact location of the cable damage. Despite its foreign flag, the ship is registered to a Hong Kong-based company, Jie Yang Trading Co., whose sole listed owner is Guo Wenjie. The vessel, which attempted to leave the area due to poor sea conditions, is now en route to Busan, South Korea. Taiwan has sought South Korean assistance in investigating the ship and its activities. Chunghwa Telecom, the operator of the damaged cable, activated emergency backup systems to reroute communication traffic, successfully restoring service for affected customers in a short time. While no severe disruptions occurred, the incident underscores Taiwan’s vulnerability in safeguarding its communication infrastructure. The Taiwan Coast Guard dispatched vessels to investigate, requesting the Shunxing 39 to return to the site for inspection. However, adverse weather conditions hindered further actions, and the vessel proceeded toward its original destination in Busan. Taiwanese officials view the incident as part of a worrying global trend of submarine cable sabotage. A senior national security officer highlighted that many involved ships are often in poor condition and engaged in non-commercial activities, drawing comparisons to Russia's shadow fleet implicated in similar cases. Beijing has not officially responded to the incident, but Taiwanese lawmakers believe it is part of an escalating gray-zone strategy—using unconventional means to undermine Taiwan's security without direct conflict. Legislators have called for reinforced measures, including stricter cable protection zones, faster interception protocols, and the ability to detain suspected vessels. This is not the first time Taiwan’s submarine cables have been damaged. Over the past five years, cables connecting Taiwan’s main island to the Matsu Islands have been reportedly damaged nearly 30 times by Chinese vessels. Globally, submarine cables have become a focus of geopolitical tensions. In November 2024, Finland and Germany reported damage to the C-Lion1 cable, with a Chinese cargo ship, Yi Peng 3, flagged as a suspect. Similarly, the Newnew Polar Bear, a Chinese vessel, was linked to the October 2023 damage of a natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. Russian vessels have also been implicated in incidents, such as the Eagle S, suspected of damaging the Estlink 2 cable between Finland and Estonia last month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/taiwans-communication-cable-damaged-chinese-vessel-suspected-in-sabotage	2025-01-07T03:24:56-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ASCALON gun was in action during recent tests. (Picture source: KNDS) The MGCS project, initially launched in 2017, was delayed after reaching the SADS Part 1 study phase. However, it was revived in April 2024 through a protocol agreement signed by French Minister of Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, and his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius. This agreement allowed the focus to shift back to military needs, prioritizing operational requirements over industrial demands, drawing inspiration from the successful collaboration of the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) between France, Germany, and Spain. As part of the MGCS initiative, KNDS is developing a 'family of systems' that includes next-generation tanks, drones, robots, and other components, all interconnected via a combat cloud. The project is organized into eight main capability pillars: platform, turrets and guns, secondary armament, communication and command systems, simulation, sensors, drone defense, and logistics. Additionally, the creation of a joint project company involving KNDS France, Thales, KNDS Deutschland, and Rheinmetall was planned, but it has faced delays, with the Bundestag yet to approve the next phase of the project. A major point of contention in the MGCS project is the choice of main armament for the future combat vehicle. Rheinmetall has proposed its 130mm gun, while KNDS France has advocated for its ASCALON system, which uses telescoped ammunition stored in an autoloading turret and capable of being 'programmed beyond the line of sight.' The primary advantage of the ASCALON lies in its minimal barrel wear and flexibility in terms of ammunition selection. At the 2024 EuroSatory exhibition, KNDS France demonstrated the versatility of the ASCALON, with the system capable of being equipped with 120mm to 140mm guns, with caliber changes completed in under an hour. The company emphasized that this innovative concept offers significant growth potential, enabling performance levels that current technologies cannot match. The next phase of testing will involve firing the ASCALON gun integrated into a combat vehicle turret, scheduled for later this year. This test will evaluate the system’s capabilities and its potential integration into the MGCS. In the meantime, KNDS France has launched a media campaign to highlight ASCALON’s performance. Recent images shared on social media showcased the system’s ability to quickly change calibers and its precision with newly developed armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, such as the 120mm 'Shard.' These rounds successfully pierced two reinforced concrete slabs, several meters apart, with remarkable accuracy.

Analysis: North Korea’s Hypersonic Missile Test Escalates Regional and Global Security Threats	On Monday, January 6, 2025, North Korea conducted a test launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) tipped with a hypersonic warhead, a move that has sharply elevated security concerns in the region and beyond. The missile, reportedly traveling 1,500 kilometers at a velocity of Mach 12—12 times the speed of sound—represents a significant escalation in Pyongyang’s missile technology. The test, personally supervised by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was described by state media as a pivotal step in bolstering the country’s defensive capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korea test-fires a hypersonic missile on January 6, 2025, escalating regional and global security threats (Picture source: North Korea press agency) According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the hypersonic missile is designed to 'reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state.' The South Korean military, which detected the launch, confirmed the missile’s trajectory from the Pyongyang area and noted it flew approximately 1,100 kilometers before landing in the East Sea (Sea of Japan). This marked North Korea’s first missile test of 2025 and underscored its intent to continue advancing its weapons programs despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts. The test’s strategic implications are profound, particularly due to the hypersonic technology employed. Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5, but their defining feature is their ability to maneuver unpredictably during flight. This combination of speed and agility makes them exceptionally difficult to detect, track, and intercept using existing missile defense systems. North Korea’s reported success in achieving a speed of Mach 12 amplifies these challenges, as regional defense systems, such as the U.S.-deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea or Japan’s Aegis-equipped destroyers, would have little time to respond. The missile’s range of 1,500 kilometers also underscores its potential to strike critical U.S. military installations in the Pacific, including those in Guam. These bases serve as key hubs for U.S. operations in the Indo-Pacific, providing logistical and strategic support to regional allies. A credible hypersonic missile capability targeting these installations fundamentally shifts the balance of power in the region, directly challenging U.S. military supremacy and deterrence. For South Korea, the proximity to North Korea amplifies the threat. Hypersonic missiles reduce detection and response times to such an extent that key South Korean cities, military installations, and infrastructure are left highly vulnerable. South Korea’s current political instability further complicates the situation. Following a failed attempt to impose martial law, President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached, leaving the nation’s leadership in disarray. This internal crisis has weakened South Korea’s ability to respond cohesively to North Korea’s provocations, exposing significant gaps in its national security. The test also sends a strong message to the United States, which is in a transitional political phase as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20, 2025. Analysts suggest the timing of the test was deliberate, aimed at leveraging the period of U.S. political uncertainty to demonstrate North Korea’s growing military prowess. By showcasing its hypersonic capability, Pyongyang is signaling its readiness to challenge the new U.S. administration while positioning itself for future negotiations. The test’s implications for Japan are equally alarming. The missile’s flight path into the East Sea (Sea of Japan) highlights Japan’s vulnerability to North Korea’s missile arsenal. As a close U.S. ally and a key regional security player, Japan will likely face intensified pressure to upgrade its missile defense systems to counter the hypersonic threat. This could trigger a broader arms race in the Indo-Pacific as nations seek to develop advanced defensive and offensive capabilities in response to North Korea’s actions. On a broader scale, North Korea’s successful hypersonic missile test threatens to destabilize the regional security environment. Hypersonic weapons pose unique challenges to the existing global security architecture, as their speed and maneuverability undermine traditional missile defense systems. This development could accelerate the proliferation of hypersonic technologies, with other nations racing to match or counter North Korea’s advancements. The international community, particularly through the United Nations Security Council, faces the difficult task of addressing this latest provocation. However, longstanding divisions among major powers such as China, Russia, and the United States complicate the prospect of unified action. Meanwhile, regional allies like South Korea and Japan will need to invest heavily in next-generation missile defense systems, including space-based sensors and counter-hypersonic technologies, to address this emerging threat. The risks of miscalculation are also rising. The combination of North Korea’s provocative actions, South Korea’s political turmoil, and the U.S. leadership transition creates a volatile environment where even minor incidents could spiral into more significant conflicts. Monday’s hypersonic missile test marks a turning point in North Korea’s weapons program, signaling its growing capability to threaten regional stability and global security. As Pyongyang continues to refine its hypersonic technology, the urgency for a coordinated response by the United States, its allies, and the broader international community has never been greater. Without decisive action, North Korea’s advancements risk emboldening the regime and heightening tensions in an already precarious Indo-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-north-koreas-hypersonic-missile-test-escalates-regional-and-global-security-threats	2025-01-07T01:00:27-08:00

North Korea Launches Its First Missile of 2025 During Antony Blinken's Visit to Seoul	North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile launch of the year, escalating tensions in the region as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on an official visit to Seoul. According to Japan's Ministry of Defense, the intermediate-range missile was launched from the Pyongyang area and traveled approximately 1,100 kilometers before falling into the sea off the east coast. This marks North Korea's first missile test since November when several short-range ballistic missiles were launched. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The exact nature of the missile remains unclear, but analysts speculate it could be a hypersonic missile, an advanced version of those tested in January and April 2024 (Picture source: KCNA) Japanese and South Korean authorities quickly confirmed the incident, with Japan's defense ministry reporting the object’s impact in the sea shortly after launch. This missile test coincided with Blinken's meetings with South Korean counterparts to strengthen the strategic alliance between Seoul and Washington amid political instability in South Korea. South Korea is currently navigating a period of uncertainty following last month’s declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk-yeol. This controversial move led to his arrest, leaving interim governance to Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok. Blinken commended South Korea’s democratic resilience while reaffirming the United States' commitment to supporting its ally during this challenging period. The exact nature of the missile remains unclear, but analysts speculate it could be a hypersonic missile, an advanced version of those tested in January and April 2024. If this hypothesis is correct, the launch would signal an effort to bolster North Korea’s military capabilities while delivering a strategic message to the international community. North Korea has significantly expanded its ballistic missile capabilities in recent years, developing an arsenal ranging from short-range missiles like the KN-23 and KN-25 to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. In 2024, North Korea intensified its missile activities, including the launch of the advanced Hwasong-19 ICBM and the deployment of Hwasong-11D launchers near the southern border, each armed with short-range missiles. These actions align with a strategy aimed at reinforcing nuclear deterrence and asserting its presence on the global stage. The timing of this launch raises questions about its political motives. Some analysts suggest it might be an attempt to draw the attention of President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, and potentially restart stalled nuclear disarmament talks. However, Pyongyang appears cautious about resuming negotiations despite Trump’s interest in re-engaging. Geopolitically, reports suggest Russia might be providing satellite technologies to North Korea in exchange for military support in Ukraine. This potential cooperation has heightened international concerns, with Blinken emphasizing the importance of strengthened collaboration between Seoul and Tokyo to address threats from Pyongyang and China’s growing regional influence. In response to the launch, South Korea fired missiles into the sea as a show of deterrence. This underscores Seoul's resolve to counter any provocations, despite its domestic political challenges. Meanwhile, South Korean and U.S. forces remain on high alert, prepared to respond decisively to further escalations. As 2025 begins with renewed tensions, this event highlights the enduring security challenges on the Korean Peninsula. The region faces critical months ahead, both militarily and diplomatically.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/north-korea-launches-its-first-missile-of-2025-during-antony-blinkens-visit-to-seoul	2025-01-06T07:32:26-08:00

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) now fields over 3,000 ballistic missiles, including 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the DF-5, DF-31, and DF-41, which have ranges exceeding 12,000 kilometers. The PLARF also operates 900 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), 1,300 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), 500 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), and 400 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs). These systems include dual-use missiles like the DF-26, the DF-17 equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle, and the CJ-100, with a range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers. The Qingtian missile, with its range of approximately 2,000 kilometers, can target strategic locations within mainland China. Reports indicate that its reach extends to areas north of Beijing, including Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. This range covers significant political and military centers, including Beijing and other urban and industrial hubs. The deployment of the Qingtian provides Taiwan with the capability to address critical areas within northern China, strengthening its overall defense strategy. Hypersonic missiles, including the Qingtian, challenge existing defense systems due to their speed, maneuverability, and low-altitude flight paths. Traveling at speeds exceeding Mach 5, they reduce response times for interception. Unlike ballistic missiles that follow predictable trajectories, hypersonic systems perform evasive maneuvers, complicating detection and tracking. Their low-altitude profiles further evade radar detection, necessitating advanced interception technologies to counter their threat.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-deploys-new-qingtian-hypersonic-missile-to-counter-chinas-growing-missile-capabilities	2025-01-06T01:33:42-08:00

Iran to Enter Russian Su-35 Fighter Jets into Service by 2025 Strengthening Air Power	Based on a report from the Iran Observer X account on January 4, 2025, Iran is preparing to integrate Russia's cutting-edge Su-35 fighter jets into its air force by 2025. The Sukhoi Su-35, a multirole 4.5-generation fighter, will bolster Iran's aging fleet, significantly enhancing its aerial capabilities. This move follows a growing military partnership between Iran and Russia, especially in light of their close cooperation during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Su-35 fighter jet will enter service with the Iranian Air Force by 2025, enhancing Iran's air power amid growing military cooperation with Russia. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The Russian Su-35 fighter jets deal, which has been in the works for several years, is a key milestone in the evolving defense relations between Iran and Russia. The announcement of this delivery follows earlier reports that Russia would supply these advanced fighter jets to Iran in exchange for Tehran's support in the form of military supplies, notably drones. Satellite imagery has confirmed the construction of special shelters at Iran's 3rd Tactical Air Base near Hamadan, designed to accommodate the Su-35s.While Iranian officials have not confirmed the exact number of Su-35s to be delivered, various reports suggest the first batch could consist of around 24 aircraft. The jets are expected to be in service by 2025, with the potential for further acquisitions in the future. This acquisition marks a substantial upgrade for the Iranian Air Force, which has long struggled with outdated fighter jets. The Su-35, often referred to as the 'Flanker-E,' is one of Russia's most advanced fighter jets. It is a multirole, twin-engine, air superiority aircraft capable of engaging in both aerial combat and ground attack missions. The Su-35 is equipped with a powerful Irbis-E radar, advanced avionics, and the ability to carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. This gives it a significant edge over many of Iran's current aircraft, such as the aging F-4 Phantom and MiG-29 fighters. The Su-35's thrust vectoring engines allow for superior maneuverability in combat, while its long-range radar and ability to engage multiple targets at once make it a formidable opponent. Its advanced electronic warfare capabilities and data fusion systems will also enhance Iran's overall air defense network. Currently, the Iranian Air Force operates a mixed fleet of mostly older jets, many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s. The F-14A Tomcat, acquired before the 1979 revolution, is still a core component of Iran's air force, though it has suffered from technical issues and limited operational readiness. In addition to the F-14s, Iran flies F-4 Phantom IIs, MiG-29s, and Soviet-era Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, all of which are nearing the end of their operational life. Iran's reliance on these older aircraft has made air superiority a challenge, especially in the face of modern, western-supplied aircraft in neighboring countries. The arrival of the Su-35s will provide a much-needed boost to Iran’s air capabilities and help it assert greater control over its airspace. The delivery of Su-35s to Iran is part of a broader shift in military cooperation between the two countries. Iran has been supplying Russia with advanced drones for use in the Ukraine conflict, and in return, Russia has provided Iran with significant military technology. The Su-35 deal is a further sign of the growing strategic alignment between Tehran and Moscow, driven in part by their mutual interests in countering Western influence in the Middle East and the broader region. This partnership comes at a time when Russia is increasingly isolated on the global stage due to its actions in Ukraine, and Iran, too, has faced extensive sanctions. Both nations are turning to each other for defense supplies, with Russia also providing Iran with sophisticated air defense systems like the S-400 and the Tor-M2. Integrating Su-35s into the Iranian Air Force marks a new phase in the country's military modernization. While the acquisition will undoubtedly enhance Iran’s combat capabilities, experts note that the number of Su-35s may still be insufficient to fully rival regional adversaries' air power. However, the strategic value of the jets, combined with Iran’s increasing drone capabilities, suggests that Tehran will be better equipped to deter potential threats and assert its regional ambitions. As Iran continues to strengthen its air capabilities, the implications for regional security will be profound, with neighboring countries likely reassessing their defense postures in light of these developments. The deeper military ties between Iran and Russia may also lead to further arms deals, creating a new dynamic in the Middle East's volatile security environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/iran-to-enter-russian-su-35-fighter-jets-into-service-by-2025-strengthening-air-power	2025-01-05T07:57:46-08:00	
BREAKING NEWS: France to Deliver First Mirage 2000-5F Fighter Jets to Ukraine by March 2025	The first batch of Mirage 2000-5F fighter jets, donated by France to Ukraine, is expected to arrive by the end of February or the beginning of March 2025. Defense analyst Xavier Tytelman reported this information on his X account on January 5, 2025. The arrival of these advanced French combat aircraft represents a major enhancement of Ukraine's air combat capabilities, further strengthening its defense as it faces Russian air superiority.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Mirage 2000-5F is a French multirole fighter with advanced radar and weapon systems. France is delivering up to 12 of these aircraft to Ukraine to enhance its air capabilities in the ongoing conflict with Russia. (Picture source: Wikimedia) French President Emmanuel Macron officially announced the donation of the French-made Mirage 2000-5F fighter jets in the summer of 2024 as part of a broader package of military aid to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russia's ongoing invasion. France has committed to delivering up to 12 Mirage 2000-5F aircraft to Ukraine, with the first units expected to arrive by the end of February or the beginning of March 2025. This move follows a growing trend of Western nations providing advanced air assets to Ukraine, including fighter jets from other NATO allies. According to Tytelman, Ukrainian crews and maintenance technicians have completed an extensive training program in preparation for operating the Mirage 2000-5F. This training, which began in mid-2024, was essential to ensuring that Ukrainian personnel are fully equipped to operate, maintain, and repair the French fighter jets. Simultaneously, the deployment of the necessary maintenance infrastructure for the Mirage 2000-5F has already begun, ensuring that the new fighters will be sustained effectively in Ukraine’s current operational environment. The Mirage 2000-5F starkly contrasts the Soviet-era fighter aircraft currently in service with Ukraine, such as the MiG-29 and Su-27. In terms of advanced capabilities, the Mirage 2000-5F is equipped with the Thales RDI (Radar Doppler à Impulsion) radar, a multi-mode radar system that is far more advanced than the Soviet-era radars found in MiG-29s and Su-27s. This radar offers superior long-range detection capabilities and can track multiple targets simultaneously, providing a crucial advantage in modern aerial combat against Russian aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles. In terms of weapon systems, the Mirage 2000-5F is capable of carrying a wider range of modern Western air-to-air missiles, including the MBDA Mica missile, which offers advanced radar and infrared guidance systems. This gives the Mirage 2000-5F a distinct edge in beyond-visual-range combat, a capability that Soviet-era aircraft like the MiG-29 and Su-27 are less equipped to handle. Another significant advantage the Mirage 2000-5F offers over its Soviet-made counterparts is enhanced situational awareness. With a modern digital cockpit and advanced avionics, Mirage 2000-5F pilots are able to process more information in real time, making faster, better-informed decisions during high-pressure combat situations. This enhanced situational awareness will be invaluable for Ukrainian pilots as they engage in fast-moving, high-stakes battles in Ukraine’s contested airspace, where countering Russian fighter jets and air defense systems is critical. The Mirage 2000-5F is also known for its exceptional agility and performance. Lighter and more maneuverable than the heavier MiG-29 and Su-27, the Mirage 2000-5F offers Ukrainian pilots greater precision and flexibility in close combat situations. This advantage will prove vital as they face Russia's fast-moving fighter jets and complex air defense systems. Additionally, the Mirage 2000-5F has an extended operational range, allowing it to conduct deeper strikes into Russian-held territory or provide extended air cover for Ukrainian ground forces, making it more effective in various operational contexts than the MiG-29 and Su-27, which have more limited ranges. The introduction of the Mirage 2000-5F into Ukraine’s air force is not only a boost to its aerial combat capability but also a significant shift in the balance of air power in the region. With its advanced radar, missile systems, and overall performance, the Mirage 2000-5F will give Ukraine a strategic tool to challenge Russia’s aerial dominance in the ongoing conflict. While Ukraine has already received various Western-supplied aircraft, including French-designed Mirages will further complement existing systems and improve interoperability with NATO forces, whose equipment and tactics Ukraine is increasingly adopting. The final delivery of the Mirage 2000-5F is expected to mark another step in the growing military cooperation between France and Ukraine, cementing France's role as a key supporter of Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty.

(Picture source: Israeli Defense Forces) The video, released by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), provided exclusive footage and insights into the complexity and success of this high-stakes operation. The target, known as 'Deep Layer,' was a key site in the development and production of precision-guided munitions used by Iranian-backed forces and supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The operation was conducted by an elite Israeli special forces unit, the Shaldag Unit, in coordination with the Israeli Air Force (IAF) and the Israeli Navy. The Shaldag Unit is part of Israel’s air force and specializes in special operations, including counter-terrorism, intelligence gathering, and sabotage missions behind enemy lines. Their role in this mission was vital, as the operation required highly skilled soldiers capable of conducting high-risk covert operations. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The operation, which has now been disclosed to the public, was a joint effort by multiple Israeli military branches, including the elite Shaldag Unit of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), as well as the IAF and Israeli Navy. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The Israeli commandos, numbering approximately 120 soldiers, included a substantial contingent from the Shaldag Unit, an elite air force special operations unit, as well as members from Unit 669, an expert combat search-and-rescue force. The mission’s objective was to destroy the 'Deep Layer' facility, a subterranean complex that had been a critical hub for Iran’s missile production activities in Syria. In the evening hours of September 8, 2024, Israeli forces initiated their covert operation. The target site was located more than 200 kilometers from the Israeli border, deep within Syrian territory and around 45 kilometers from the Syrian coast. The team, comprising 100 Shaldag soldiers and 20 Unit 669 operators, embarked on the mission aboard four large transport helicopters. The operation’s execution was as complex as it was daring. The transport helicopters, along with two additional helicopters providing close air support, made their way across the Mediterranean Sea, skirting Lebanon’s coastline before crossing into Syria. To provide maximum support, the IDF mobilized 21 fighter jets, five drones, and 14 reconnaissance aircraft. The latter, along with additional Israeli aircraft kept in reserve, provided surveillance, air cover, and immediate response capabilities in case the operation encountered unexpected resistance. As the helicopters approached the Syrian coastline, the IDF forces maintained a low altitude flight to avoid detection by Syrian radar and anti-aircraft defenses. The 18-minute flight from the Lebanese coast to the target area was executed under complete secrecy, with additional bombing operations carried out by the IAF and the Israeli Navy to create distractions and mask the movements of the special forces. Upon reaching the facility, the commandos swiftly infiltrated the underground complex and planted explosives to neutralize the target. The mission was executed with precision, and the explosives were detonated in a massive blast that was felt by some soldiers like a 'mini-earthquake.' The entire operation lasted approximately two and a half hours, and it was reported that at least 30 Syrian soldiers guarding the facility were killed during the attack. Remarkably, the operation resulted in no casualties on the Israeli side. None of the Shaldag Special Forces or Unit 669 personnel were injured during the mission, despite the dangerous and high-risk environment they were operating in. The precision of the assault, coupled with the overwhelming air and ground support provided by the Israeli military, ensured that the special forces completed their task without facing significant resistance. The Israeli military confirmed that, following the operation, the 'Deep Layer' facility was rendered non-operational and that Iran had completely withdrawn from Syria after the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The site, once a critical asset in Iran's efforts to supply advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, was no longer in use, marking a significant strategic victory for Israel in its ongoing efforts to counter Iranian influence in the region. 'Operation Many Ways' represents a major achievement for the Israeli military, underscoring the effectiveness of Israel's Special Forces and its ability to carry out highly sophisticated operations deep behind enemy lines.

Russian Warships Monitored Near UK by HMS Somerset Over Holidays	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 1, 2025, the Royal Navy maintained a vigilant watch over a Russian naval task group passing the British Isles during the Christmas holidays. HMS Somerset, a Type 23 frigate, was mobilized on December 27 after the corvette RFS Soobrazitelny and its support vessels, MV Sparta II and MV General Skobelev, were detected in the North Sea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's HMS Somerset monitors the movements of the Russian corvette RFS Soobrazitelny. (Picture source: UK MoD) The crew of HMS Somerset, recalled from their Christmas leave, swiftly prepared for deployment, leaving Devonport Naval Base to intercept and shadow the Russian vessels. Despite challenging foggy conditions, the ship relied on its advanced sensor suite to track the group’s movements for over 500 miles as they traversed the Dover Strait and entered the English Channel. A Merlin helicopter from 814 Naval Air Squadron, stationed at RNAS Culdrose, provided aerial support during the mission. When weather conditions allowed, the helicopter conducted surveillance and captured imagery of both the Russian ships and HMS Somerset’s operations. Context The Russian shadow fleet represents a covert network of vessels employed by Russia to bypass international sanctions, particularly targeting its oil exports. This fleet has grown substantially following the imposition of sanctions in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, now comprising over 1,100 vessels, including many aging tankers acquired to sustain oil transportation. Operating under flags of convenience from countries with lax maritime regulations and employing opaque ownership structures, the fleet uses deceptive practices such as disabling Automatic Identification Systems, conducting ship-to-ship transfers in remote waters, and falsifying cargo documentation. These activities enable the fleet to obscure the origins and destinations of shipments. The shadow fleet poses significant risks across various domains. Environmentally, its reliance on old and poorly maintained vessels raises the potential for spills and other ecological disasters, as seen in incidents like the December 2024 oil spill in the Black Sea. From a maritime safety perspective, the clandestine nature of its operations, including AIS blackouts, increases the likelihood of collisions and accidents, threatening maritime traffic and coastal communities. There is also a security dimension, as the fleet could be leveraged for military purposes, such as transporting equipment or personnel, heightening concerns among NATO members and other global powers. Efforts to counter the shadow fleet include initiatives by Western nations to disrupt its operations and enforce sanctions more rigorously. However, despite these measures, the fleet continues to operate.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-warships-monitored-near-uk-by-hms-somerset-over-holidays	2025-01-03T06:18:18-08:00

Leaked Document Unveils Russia’s Plans for Targeting Key Sites in Japan and South Korea	Recently leaked Russian military documents have unveiled detailed plans for potential attacks on Japan and South Korea, targeting strategic civilian infrastructure, including nuclear power plants. These files, dated from 2013-2014 and obtained by the Financial Times through Western sources, highlight Moscow’s concerns about the vulnerability of its eastern flank in the event of a conflict with NATO and its Asian allies. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The cache of 29 secret documents reveals how Russia, wary of a coordinated attack by U.S. forces stationed in Japan and South Korea, identified a list of 160 priority targets. These include military facilities such as airbases and naval installations, as well as critical civilian infrastructure like tunnels, bridges, energy complexes, and industrial sites. The documents reflect Moscow’s strategic apprehension over the perceived threat posed by Asia-Pacific allies of the West. In the event of a conflict in Europe, Russia anticipates a 'horizontal escalation,' extending hostilities to Asia to counter or neutralize adversaries potentially supporting a Western offensive. The plans highlight the use of the Kh-101 cruise missile as a key weapon among the scenarios described. This system, designed for precision strikes, was proposed to neutralize key installations in Japan and South Korea. One scenario includes a simulated attack on a Japanese radar base at Okushiritou, featuring detailed assessments of target structures and expected damage. Of the 160 identified targets, 82 are military, such as command centers and radar installations. The remaining targets include critical civilian infrastructure, such as Japan’s Kanmon tunnel and nuclear energy complexes. In South Korea, strategic bridges and major industrial sites, including the Pohang steelworks, were also designated as priorities. The meticulous planning is evident in the precise calculations for damaging heavily fortified facilities in South Korea. These details underscore the depth of Russian preparations for a potential conflict in the region. This revelation emerges at a time when Asia plays a significant role in President Vladimir Putin’s broader strategy. Russia has recently deepened its ties with North Korea, deploying 12,000 North Korean troops to assist its operations in Ukraine and offering economic and military support to Pyongyang. This dynamic underscores Moscow’s view of an intrinsic link between European and Asian theaters of conflict. Experts argue that the plans confirm the interconnected nature of conflicts in Europe and Asia. William Alberque, a former NATO arms control official, emphasized that these documents illustrate the impossibility of Asia remaining unaffected by a European conflict and vice versa. Despite Russia’s confidence in the Kh-101 missiles, their performance during the Ukraine conflict has revealed limitations. Experts note the missiles' lack of stealth against layered air defenses and insufficient accuracy for precision strikes, which is a significant drawback for low-yield munitions reliant on pinpoint targeting. For Japan, these plans present a unique challenge, as the Russian threat is often perceived as secondary by the general public, despite consistent monitoring by the Japanese military. A rapid escalation originating in Europe would leave Tokyo with limited warning time, complicating its defense strategy. The strained relationship between Russia and Japan, further exacerbated by unresolved territorial disputes over the Kuril Islands, adds complexity. While then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed commitment to negotiations on the matter, Russian statements have signaled an uncompromising stance. In South Korea, the documents highlight the vulnerability of critical civilian and industrial infrastructure, such as refineries and chemical plants in Busan, underlining the strategic importance of these targets in a conflict scenario. In addition to attack plans, the documents include reports on Russian bomber flights intended to test the air defenses of the region. One report details a February 2014 mission during the annexation of Crimea, where Tu-95 bombers conducted flights near South Korea and Japan, documenting responses from local air forces. Similar maneuvers, such as Tu-142 flights in 2024, reflect Moscow’s continued efforts to assess and potentially exploit regional vulnerabilities. While these plans from 2013-2014 appear strategically plausible, their feasibility is questionable. The Kh-101 missiles, central to the scenarios, have demonstrated technical limitations, and the evolving geopolitical landscape presents further challenges. There is no public information confirming the modernization of these plans, although Russia's actions, including military flights near Japan, indicate sustained interest in the Asia-Pacific region. In conclusion, the leaked documents offer a rare glimpse into the depth of Russian military planning for potential conflicts in Asia. They highlight Moscow’s concerns over the vulnerability of its eastern borders and the interconnected nature of global conflict theaters. While some capabilities may have been overstated, the revelations underscore the complexity of contemporary geopolitical dynamics and the challenges faced by Japan and South Korea in ensuring their security against multifaceted threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/leaked-document-unveils-russias-plans-for-targeting-key-sites-in-japan-and-south-korea	2025-01-02T05:26:52-08:00

(Picture source GA-ASI) Evasion and Detection Mitigation: One of the most potent advantages of unmanned systems like the Gambit is their ability to evade detection and operate in high-threat environments without risking human lives. Gambit aircraft, such as the Gambit 4, are designed with advanced low-observable technologies, ensuring that they can operate in contested airspaces, gathering critical information or striking high-value targets, while remaining undetected. By flying in close formation with manned aircraft or operating autonomously, these drones can reduce human pilots' exposure to enemy radar or missile systems, essentially acting as decoys or providing countermeasures. Autonomous Action and Collaboration: The Gambit series is not just about surveillance or force augmentation; these systems can take autonomous action when required. For instance, the Gambit 2 model can engage adversary aircraft in air-to-air combat, acting independently or in concert with other unmanned systems. These aircraft are equipped with AI-driven systems that enable them to make real-time decisions, from evading incoming threats to engaging in offensive actions. When integrated with manned systems, they provide actionable intelligence and can execute predefined combat missions while operating collaboratively and synchronously with human pilots. This autonomy reduces the cognitive load on human pilots, allowing them to focus on the most critical aspects of the mission while knowing that their unmanned teammates are handling key tasks. Whether it's intercepting enemy aircraft, neutralizing surface-to-air threats, or carrying out intelligence collection, Gambit platforms act as an autonomous extension of the pilot’s capabilities, ready to execute orders or respond to changing combat conditions without direct human input. Fulfilling the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) Concept: The Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) concept that GA-ASI and the U.S. Air Force are pushing toward envisions a highly collaborative and scalable force architecture, where human-piloted fighters, such as the F-35 Lightning II, are complemented by large numbers of autonomous unmanned aircraft—like the Gambit series. These unmanned aircraft are designed to work seamlessly with human pilots, forming a collaborative network that dynamically adapts to evolving battlefield conditions. By allowing unmanned aircraft to take on some of the most hazardous and mundane tasks, human pilots are freed up to focus on higher-value operations, knowing their 'teammates' are performing complementary functions. A key advantage of the Gambit series is its cost-effectiveness, allowing the deployment of large numbers of unmanned systems without the prohibitive costs typically associated with fighter jets. This scalability is crucial as future air forces will need to overcome the economic and logistical challenges of maintaining a high number of advanced aircraft, especially given the increasing complexity and expense of cutting-edge fighters like the F-35 and NGAD systems. The Gambit 4 is a combat reconnaissance variant featuring a tail-less design and swept wings. It is optimized for long-endurance, specialized missions, incorporating low-observable technologies and advanced systems to evade enemy detection. (Picture source GA-ASI) By leveraging shared components across the different Gambit models, GA-ASI is able to streamline production and reduce costs, making it feasible to field large numbers of autonomous aircraft that can augment the capabilities of human pilots at a fraction of the cost of a manned fighter. This approach also allows air forces to field a diverse mix of capabilities, ranging from ISR platforms to combat drones, all tailored to specific mission sets, and all operating in concert with human crews. The Gambit family includes a series of variants, each optimized for specific roles in this integrated, collaborative air combat environment. These variants range from Gambit 1, designed primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, to Gambit 2, which is configured for combat and offensive actions. The Gambit 3 is a platform primarily aimed at training, simulating both unmanned and manned systems in realistic air combat scenarios. Finally, the Gambit 4 is the most advanced model, integrating cutting-edge stealth and hybrid-electric propulsion for long-endurance missions and specialized low-observable capabilities. Each model in the Gambit series works in harmony with the others, providing a comprehensive, scalable solution for modern air forces. The Gambit series represents the strategic shift that is already underway in air combat—moving away from the reliance on a few high-end fighters and toward a distributed, collaborative force where both manned and unmanned systems operate in synergy. By pairing human-crewed fighters with autonomous unmanned aircraft, the future air force will achieve new levels of operational flexibility, speed, and effectiveness. This transformation is essential as potential adversaries, like China and Russia, continue to develop advanced air defense systems and aerial platforms. The Gambit series’ ability to operate autonomously in contested environments, while providing human pilots with the necessary support to achieve air dominance, ensures that the U.S. and its allies can maintain an edge in the rapidly changing landscape of aerial warfare. The Gambit series is not just about technology—it’s about rethinking air combat in a way that maximizes the combined power of human decision-making and autonomous systems. With its focus on collaboration, cost-effectiveness, and mission adaptability, the Gambit is poised to be a cornerstone of the future air force, where human pilots work alongside large numbers of unmanned systems to maintain supremacy in the skies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-based-ga-asi-develops-gambit-new-unmanned-aircraft-to-support-f-35-next-gen-fighter-operations	2024-12-31T06:49:28-08:00

The combination of these weapons makes the J-50 a flexible and lethal platform in a variety of combat scenarios, from establishing air dominance to engaging naval targets. The unveiling of the J-50 invites inevitable comparisons to the U.S. Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. NGAD represents the U.S. Air Force’s sixth-generation fighter development initiative, aiming to replace the aging F-22 Raptor in the 2030s. Unlike the J-50, NGAD is envisioned as a system of systems, integrating a manned sixth-generation stealth fighter with autonomous Loyal Wingman drones, advanced AI capabilities, and adaptive engines. These engines are expected to reconfigure dynamically for optimal performance in speed, range, and fuel efficiency, a feature that may outmatch the J-50’s ACE engines. Stealth is a core component of both the NGAD and the J-50, but their approaches differ. The J-50’s twin-engine configuration, swept-back wings, and fully adjustable tail fins enhance agility and maneuverability but slightly compromise stealth compared to the tailless, delta-wing design speculated for NGAD. Moreover, NGAD is expected to rely heavily on AI-driven mission management, which reduces pilot workload and enables faster decision-making in combat. By contrast, while the J-50 is rumored to feature advanced avionics and network-centric capabilities, its AI integration may not yet rival NGAD's. The U.S. F-35 Lightning II and China’s newly unveiled Shenyang J-50, highlighting their distinct design philosophies, with the F-35 emphasizing advanced systems integration and network-centric warfare, while the J-50 focuses on extended range, payload capacity, and stealth for contested environments.

While both aircraft share a focus on stealth and multirole capabilities, their design philosophies differ significantly. The J-50 is larger, with a longer wingspan and greater emphasis on long-range missions, evident in its 2,200-kilometer combat radius compared to the F-35’s approximate 1,200-kilometer combat radius. The J-50's twin-engine configuration offers greater thrust and operational redundancy compared to the F-35’s single-engine design, potentially giving the J-50 an edge in survivability during engine failure scenarios. However, the F-35’s Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine is widely regarded as one of the most advanced turbofan engines globally, offering superior fuel efficiency and thrust-to-weight ratio. Technologically, the F-35 outpaces the J-50 in sensor fusion and network-centric warfare capabilities, allowing it to act as an airborne command center by sharing real-time data with other platforms. The F-35 also features the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and advanced radar systems, such as the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, providing unmatched situational awareness and precision targeting. In contrast, while the J-50 is equipped with advanced avionics and a robust payload of long-range missiles like the PL-15 and PL-17, it may lack the level of integration and data-sharing capabilities that define the F-35. Additionally, the F-35 benefits from a mature production and logistics ecosystem, allowing for mass production and sustained operational support among allied nations, which China’s J-50 has yet to achieve. Despite these differences, the J-50’s superior range and heavy payload capacity make it better suited for extended operations in vast and contested regions like the Indo-Pacific, where aerial dominance and long-range strike capabilities are critical. However, the F-35’s advanced systems and proven track record in joint operations position it as a more technologically integrated and reliable platform in modern air combat. The J-50 also invites comparisons to the recently revealed B-21 Raider, the U.S.'s next-generation stealth bomber. While the J-50 is primarily designed for air-to-air combat and tactical strikes, the B-21 is a strategic bomber specializing in deep-strike missions (DSM) over heavily contested airspace. The B-21’s intercontinental range far exceeds the J-50’s 2,200-kilometer combat radius, allowing it to deliver payloads anywhere in the world without relying on forward bases. However, the J-50’s focus on agility and speed makes it more suitable for dynamic combat roles, complementing China’s growing inventory of advanced unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) like the CH-7 (Cai Hong-7). The unveiling of the J-50 demonstrates China’s commitment to expanding its regional influence and challenging U.S. air dominance in the Indo-Pacific. As part of a broader strategy, the J-50 is designed to operate alongside China’s J-20 Mighty Dragon fifth-generation stealth fighter and advanced drones like the CH-7. This multi-layered approach to air combat allows China to field a combination of highly advanced systems that can overwhelm adversaries through sheer numbers, even if certain technological gaps remain. However, the J-50 also highlights some ongoing challenges for China. While it has made significant advancements in stealth materials and avionics, areas like engine technology and AI integration still lag behind those of the U.S. platforms. The U.S., through programs like NGAD and the B-21 Raider, continues to maintain an edge in systems integration, adaptive propulsion, and the use of Loyal Wingman drones, which collectively enable a more cohesive and autonomous battlefield presence. The Shenyang J-50 represents a significant milestone in China’s military aviation capabilities, offering a versatile and powerful platform for both air superiority and precision strike missions. While it may not yet rival the technological sophistication of U.S. programs like NGAD or the B-21 Raider, the J-50’s combination of stealth, speed, and armament makes it a formidable competitor. Its ability to be produced in large numbers further enhances its strategic value, potentially offsetting its technological disadvantages through sheer scale. As China and the U.S. continue to develop next-generation aircraft, the race for aerial superiority will remain a defining feature of 21st-century military competition, shaping the future of global security in contested regions like the Indo-Pacific.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/exclusive-report-secrets-technology-and-design-of-new-chinas-shenyang-j-50-stealth-fighter-revealed	2024-12-30T06:34:27-08:00

The Cheng-6’s trijet configuration may enhance performance in high-speed and high-altitude operations, while the Shen-6 employs diverterless supersonic intakes to optimize stealth and aerodynamic efficiency. The prototypes are understood to be in early stages of flight testing, with no high-resolution imagery confirming internal weapon bays. Analysts view the Chengdu and Shenyang prototypes as complementary rather than competitive, with the Chengdu prototype’s design considered consistent with characteristics attributed to the JH-XX tactical fighter-bomber concept, while the Shenyang prototype introduces features aimed at enhancing operational flexibility. Both aircraft align with principles associated with sixth-generation fighter designs, including advanced stealth, integration with unmanned systems, and networked combat capabilities. The Shen-6 could be equipped with foldable full-movable vertical stabilizers. These stabilizers lay flat during cruising, forming a tailless design to enhance stealth and lift-drag efficiency, and rise during maneuvers to create a V-tail configuration for better control.

These aircraft typically integrate high-performance propulsion systems, such as variable-cycle engines, to enable sustained high-speed cruising and extended range. They are expected to operate optionally manned, with capabilities to function within a networked 'system of systems,' including artificial intelligence, advanced sensors, and data-sharing technologies. Modular payload configurations are anticipated to allow flexibility across roles, including air superiority, ground attack, and electronic warfare. These characteristics aim to address evolving air combat requirements, including survivability and adaptability in contested environments. In June 2024, China also conducted a test flight for a new aviation concept involving a stealth aircraft integrated with two detachable drones. This flight, held at an airport near the Mu Us Desert in Ningxia, showcased a blended wing-body design with delta wings. During the flight, sections of the main aircraft's wings detached, transforming into drones powered by electric ducted fans. The separation process caused shifts in the aircraft's center of gravity and wing area, momentarily affecting stability. However, the aircraft and drones regained stable flight due to the implementation of advanced aerodynamic designs and automated control algorithms. This test flight was characterized as a demonstration of a new approach to integrating manned and unmanned systems for coordinated operations. The system, developed by the Aerospace Technology Institute of the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC), employs a rear-edge docking layout, enabling drones to separate from the trailing edge of the main aircraft's wings. According to CARDC engineer Du Xin, this configuration addresses challenges such as speed mismatches and range limitations between crewed aircraft and drones. The system utilizes the FCC-100 flight control computer from Northwestern Polytechnical University, designed to manage complex calculations and ensure flight stability. The team also employed advanced control algorithms and high-performance components to maintain precision during separation. This design is intended to explore new modes of combat operations, reflecting China's ongoing testing of new next-generation features. Globally, the development of sixth-generation aircraft continues among other major powers. The United States is advancing its sixth-generation fighter development through the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program for the Air Force and the F/A-XX program for the Navy. These projects prioritize advanced stealth features, integration with unmanned systems, and improvements in propulsion technologies. Despite these efforts, budget constraints and evolving priorities have led to discussions about adjusting the scale or timelines of these programs. Europe, meanwhile, is pursuing two collaborative initiatives: the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a partnership between the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan aimed at delivering a next-generation fighter by 2035, and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), a joint effort among France, Germany, and Spain. Both programs focus on integrating advanced technologies such as supersonic performance, virtual reality cockpits, and networked operational capabilities. Russia is in the early stages of conceptualizing its sixth-generation fighter, with a prototype expected by 2050. Efforts are currently directed toward understanding the requirements of future conflicts and technological advancements to inform the design. Sweden's Saab is independently exploring concepts for both manned and unmanned sixth-generation fighters as part of efforts to develop next-generation platforms for its armed forces. In India, the primary focus remains the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a fifth-generation project, though there is interest in exploring sixth-generation technologies. At this stage, no official sixth-generation program has been announced in India. These programs collectively reflect global efforts to address future air combat needs through advanced fighter technologies. China's recent test flights of two new sixth-generation stealth fighter jets, the Cheng-6 and Shen-6, show that Chinese programs are much more advanced than previously thought. In a potential conflict with the United States, likely for Taiwan, China could potentially deploy these advanced stealth aircraft designed to evade known detection systems and challenge traditional U.S. air superiority. This fact may prompt the United States to reevaluate its strategic priorities by continuing to develop fighter jets, even though some say they are outdated, to maintain a competitive edge. The Shen-6's general design could be influenced by these earlier fighter designs from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre.

Defense Investigation: What is the Possible Cause Behind Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 Crash Near Aktau?	Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243, which tragically crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on December 25, 2024, may have been struck by a missile fired from a Russian air defense system, according to preliminary findings from aviation investigators. Although the exact details of the missile’s origin are still under investigation, information from multiple sources, including government and military experts, suggest the involvement of a surface-to-air missile, possibly launched from a Pantsir-S1 air defense missiles/cannons system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from video footage showing the moment of the crash of Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on December 25, 2024. (Video footage Social Network Screenshot) The incident occurred when Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 was operating a scheduled commercial flight from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny, Russia, with a stopover in Aktau, Kazakhstan. The Boeing 737-800, carrying 122 passengers and crew members, departed from Baku at 03:55 UTC. Everything appeared normal until the flight lost contact at 04:25 UTC, shortly after entering Kazakh airspace. At 04:37 UTC, some erroneous data was transmitted from the aircraft before contact was entirely lost. The wreckage was later found about 50 kilometers south of Aktau, near the Caspian Sea. Sadly, all on board perished in the crash. Initial analysis of the aircraft’s flight data, particularly the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data, provides important clues regarding the crash. The flight took off from Baku on schedule and transmitted valid ADS-B data until 04:25 UTC, indicating that the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and speed. However, after this time, significant GPS interference was detected, leading to a temporary loss of positional data. Between 04:25 and 04:37 UTC, the aircraft ceased transmitting positional data altogether, a highly unusual occurrence. During this period, it is believed that the aircraft may have suffered external damage, likely due to a missile strike, which could have compromised its ability to transmit accurate position information. Following this gap in data transmission, between 04:37 and 04:40 UTC, the aircraft transmitted likely erroneous ADS-B data. The information sent during this period was inconsistent, with fluctuating altitude and ground speed figures, which suggests that the aircraft was struggling with severe control issues. After a 36-minute gap, ADS-B data resumed at 05:13 UTC, revealing highly irregular flight characteristics. The data indicated variable altitude fluctuations of ±2,438 meters (approximately ±8,000 feet) and erratic ground speeds and vertical rate values. These irregularities point to catastrophic damage to the aircraft, likely caused by the missile strike, which caused the aircraft to lose control. The missile that struck Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 is believed to have been a Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile, a Russian-made air defense system. Although the exact missile used remains under investigation, multiple sources point to the involvement of Russian military assets in the region. According to AnewZ, an international news outlet based in Baku, Azerbaijani government sources have suggested that the missile was fired from a Pantsir-S1 air defense missiles/cannons system, which is known to be in operation by Russian military forces. While this information has not been independently confirmed, the Pantsir-S system is widely used by Russia for its advanced anti-aircraft capabilities, and it would be capable of striking targets at the altitude and speed at which the Boeing 737-800 was flying. Forensic analysis of the wreckage has revealed damage patterns consistent with a missile strike. The tail section and wing of the aircraft suffered significant damage, which matches the impact characteristics of a high-velocity missile. Additionally, missile fragments recovered from the crash site appear to resemble components from a Pantsir-S missile system. Satellite imagery and radar tracking from international agencies have confirmed the presence of Russian air defense systems near the Caspian coast around the time of the incident. The missile’s trajectory and launch point remain under investigation, but it is widely suspected that the strike originated from Russian-controlled territory or a nearby military base. Local witnesses along the coast of Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea reported seeing a bright flash in the sky and hearing an explosion shortly before the aircraft’s descent. These reports align with the likely timing of the missile impact, further corroborating the missile strike theory. The post-impact ADS-B data showing oscillating altitude, variable ground speed, and vertical rate values suggests that the aircraft experienced severe structural damage or control system failures consistent with a missile strike. These abnormalities further support the idea that an external force—such as a missile—caused the aircraft to lose control. The ongoing investigation is exploring several theories about the origins of the missile strike. One plausible explanation is that the missile was launched during a routine Russian military exercise in the region, potentially as a result of a mistake or misidentification. The proximity of the crash site to Russian-controlled areas raises the possibility that the aircraft was mistakenly identified as a military target. Given the high level of military activity in the region and Russia’s heightened state of readiness, there is a possibility that the aircraft was misidentified as a hostile target. If the missile was fired as a defensive measure against a perceived threat, this would be an error in judgment, likely exacerbated by the complex geopolitical environment. While less likely, there remains a possibility that the missile strike was not an accident but a deliberate action, perhaps linked to broader regional tensions. Russia and Azerbaijan have had some political differences in recent years, though this theory remains speculative and would require more concrete evidence. As is often the case with high-profile incidents, the Azerbaijan Airlines crash has been accompanied by a wave of speculation, some of which has strayed far from the facts. Reports suggesting that third-party actors or local militants were responsible for the missile strike have been debunked, as no credible evidence has been presented to support these claims. Given the complex nature of this tragedy and the sensitive political implications, it is important to rely on verified information from credible sources. Speculation or misinformation can hinder the investigation and distract from the critical task of determining the exact cause of the crash. While the preliminary findings point to a Russian-made missile, likely launched from a Pantsir-S air defense system, the investigation is far from complete. Additional forensic analysis, further satellite data, and expert reviews of the flight’s black boxes will be essential to confirm the exact missile system involved and to piece together the events leading up to the crash. As the investigation progresses, international authorities—including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia—will need to cooperate closely to ensure transparency and accountability. The final findings will likely have significant implications for both aviation safety and regional geopolitics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/defense-investigation-what-is-the-possible-cause-behind-azerbaijan-airlines-flight-j28243-crash-near-aktau	2024-12-26T08:02:17-08:00
