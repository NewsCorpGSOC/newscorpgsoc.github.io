Following the arrival of this unit, another J-10CE arrived, identified by serial number 9001 and carrying only the AVIC (Aviation Industry Corporation of China) emblem, is widely anticipated to join the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) after the exhibition. This J-10CE model includes various upgrades, such as a staggered dual missile pylon system that accommodates two short-range missiles, six beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles, and external drop tanks, expanding its payload and operational range.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Positioned on the aircraft’s nose, the AESA radar reportedly offers an approximately 50-kilometer detection range advantage over the F-16C Block 52 radar system, potentially allowing the J-10CE to engage targets from a greater distance. (Picture source: Weibo) Since 2019, China has promoted the J-10CE, produced by Chengdu Aerospace Corporation, as an export-specific version of the J-10C, a single-engine, single-seat, all-weather multirole fighter. The J-10CE integrates the KLJ-10 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which aims to improve detection and targeting in environments with significant electromagnetic interference. Positioned on the aircraft’s nose, the AESA radar reportedly offers an approximately 50-kilometer detection range advantage over the F-16C Block 52 radar system, potentially allowing the J-10CE to engage targets from a greater distance. Its BVR capability is supported by PL-15 missiles, with an engagement range of up to 200 kilometers, facilitating long-range target engagements. The J-10 series has undergone development since the J-10A's initial deployment in 2004, which included a modern cockpit, targeting systems, and a canard-delta wing for enhanced maneuverability. This was followed by the J-10B in 2008, which added a Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar, missile-approach warning system (MAWS), and a divertless supersonic intake (DSI) design. The J-10C, entering service in 2015, introduced the AESA radar, improved radar warning receivers, satellite communications, and datalinks for greater situational awareness. Comparisons place the J-10C on a similar level to other single-engine fighters, such as the F-16 and Gripen, in terms of situational awareness and detection capacity. In 2022, Pakistan acquired an initial batch of six J-10CEs, which were subsequently displayed in the National Day military parade. Pakistani officials and pilots, including Squadron Leader Obar, evaluated the aircraft’s performance in BVR and close-range scenarios. Obar noted the J-10CE’s situational awareness, range, and maneuverability, which allowed it to engage targets at distances beyond the radar capabilities of F-16Cs. The AESA radar, paired with the PL-15 missile, reportedly provided detection and engagement range advantages, potentially enhancing Pakistan’s air defense in BVR contexts. Obar outlined certain limitations, particularly the J-10CE’s external mounting capacity, which he indicated was less than that of Western fighters like the F-16C. However, the recent exhibition of a J-10 variant with composite pylons may indicate efforts to address these limitations and increase missile load capacity. Additionally, while the J-10CE’s canard configuration enables agile maneuvering, it may face challenges in sustained close combat if the opposing aircraft holds a higher energy reserve. Obar also highlighted the domestically developed turbofan 10B engine, which supports the fighter’s vertical maneuver capabilities. The J-10CE’s cost structure has been positioned as a key component in its export appeal. Chinese manufacturers have marketed it as a viable alternative to Western-made jets, aimed at countries seeking advanced capabilities without Western political conditions. Since its introduction at the 2019 Dubai Air Show, the J-10CE has been promoted as an option for countries looking to balance technological capabilities with financial constraints. Its AESA radar, compatibility with long-range missiles, and updated cockpit features align with China’s defense export strategy. Participation of the J-10CE in the Zhuhai Air Show reflects its role in China’s military export initiatives. As a technologically updated and comparatively affordable aircraft, the J-10CE offers an option for countries seeking to upgrade their fleets and access advanced air defense systems within budgetary limits. While the J-10CE’s canard configuration enables agile maneuvering, it may face challenges in sustained close combat if the opposing aircraft holds a higher energy reserve.

South Korea Responds to North Korean Provocations with Hyunmoo-II Ballistic Missile Launch	In response to North Korea’s recent missile launches, South Korea fired a Hyunmoo-II ballistic missile toward the Yellow Sea, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) announced on November 8, 2024. This live-fire exercise took place the previous day in the coastal region of Taean, 108 kilometers southwest of Seoul, following a series of North Korean short-range ballistic missile launches on Tuesday and a recent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test of the Hwasong-18 last week. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launch of the Hyunmoo-II missile in South Korea on November 7, 2024 (Picture source: JCS) The exercise simulated a scenario in which North Korea launched a ballistic missile, prompting a South Korean missile unit to respond by firing a Hyunmoo-II short-range ballistic missile at a sea target designed to represent the origin of the North Korean missile launch. The Hyunmoo-2A is a South Korean short-range ballistic missile powered by solid fuel and developed to counter North Korean threats. Integrated into South Korea’s 'Kill Chain' preemptive strike and 'Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation' (KMPR) retaliatory strategies, it is capable of precisely targeting strategic sites within North Korean territory. Measuring over 12 meters and weighing 5,400 kg, the Hyunmoo-2A has a maximum range of 300 km and can carry a payload of nearly one ton. The two-stage solid propulsion gives the Hyunmoo-2A high stability and swift responsiveness. Developed by South Korea’s Agency for Defense Development (ADD), the missile shares some design features with the Russian Iskander-M, though this is likely due to similar capability requirements rather than a direct technological exchange. With a circular error probable (CEP) of 30 meters, it provides effective precision for targeted strikes, bolstering South Korea’s deterrence against potential threats from North Korea. Operational since 2008, the Hyunmoo-2A has been deployed in military exercises responding to North Korean missile tests, such as in 2017 when it simulated strikes on strategic sites in North Korea. Although the exact number of Hyunmoo-2A missiles South Korea possesses is classified, the missile and its variants play a crucial role in national defense strategy, enabling precise retaliatory strikes and forming a core component of South Korea's counter-provocation measures in response to escalating military actions from the North. This exercise aimed to demonstrate South Korea's ability to respond accurately and assert its resolve to counter any provocation from Pyongyang. The JCS noted that this was a clear display of the South Korean military's capacity to conduct precise strikes on strategic targets. In cooperation with the United States, South Korea continues to closely monitor North Korea’s military activities, maintaining a state of readiness for an 'overwhelming' response to any new provocation. Last Tuesday, North Korea launched a salvo of short-range missiles into the East Sea, mere hours before the U.S. presidential election. These launches appeared to involve North Korea's 600 mm multiple rocket launcher system, known as the KN-25 by allied forces, a system that Pyongyang has claimed can be equipped with tactical nuclear warheads since October 2022. This round of short-range missile launches followed a test of the Hwasong-19, a new-generation solid-fuel ICBM that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un touted as having 'unmatched strategic nuclear strike capability.' In response, the United States, South Korea, and Japan conducted a joint air drill, mobilizing a U.S. B-1B bomber and fighter jets from all three nations over waters east of South Korea's Jeju Island. Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un’s influential sister, later condemned this drill in North Korean state media, describing it as 'indisputable proof of the need and urgency to strengthen nuclear forces.' South Korea continues to expand its ballistic arsenal, recently unveiling the Hyunmoo-5, a 'bunker buster' ballistic missile capable of carrying an eight-ton warhead. This missile forms part of Seoul’s 'three-axis strategy,' which includes preemptive strikes under the 'Kill Chain' system, air and missile defense systems, and measures to incapacitate North Korea’s leadership in the event of an imminent attack. At a recent air show in Sacheon, South Korea also presented a supersonic air-to-ground missile, designed for deployment on the FA-50 light attack fighter as well as the next-generation KF-21 aircraft. Intended for both export and strengthen South Korea’s air capabilities, this missile underscores Seoul’s growing military posture in response to the increasing threat from its northern neighbor.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-responds-to-north-korean-provocations-with-hyunmoo-ii-ballistic-missile-launch	2024-11-08T01:07:39-08:00

Czech Republic to Strengthen Armored Power with Modern Leopard 2A8 Tanks	In early November 2024, the Czech Ministry of Defense announced the formation of four companies (one battalion) equipped with Leopard 2A8 tanks, as part of a contract for 77 units approved in June for €2.1 billion. Expected to be finalized by the end of the year, this contract will significantly enhance the operational capabilities of the Czech armed forces with one of the most advanced tanks in Europe, addressing security concerns in Central Europe in the context of the war in Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link KMW Leopard 2 Main Battle Tank (Picture source: Krauss-Maffei Wegmann) In the Czech Republic, tank units are part of the 7th Mechanized Brigade, also known as the 'Duke of Bohemia Brigade.' This brigade includes the 73rd Tank Battalion, which is the main unit operating combat tanks. Tank companies within this battalion are designated by numbers, such as the 1st Tank Company, 2nd Tank Company, and so on. These numerical designations are commonly used to identify the various companies within the battalion. For years, contemporary doctrines have favored mobility and asymmetric operations, gradually moving away from the use of heavy tanks. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underscored the importance of heavy armor to support breakthroughs and hold defensive lines, restoring their central role in high-intensity conflicts. In this context, the Czech Republic has, by drawing on the lessons learned in Ukraine, structured a modern fleet of armored vehicles to enhance its security. Since 2023, the Czech government has intensified its efforts to modernize its armored fleet by turning to Germany and its Leopard 2 tanks. As early as May 2023, the Czech Republic expressed its intention to acquire approximately 70 Leopard 2A8 tanks. This commitment materialized in June 2024 with the approval of a contract for 77 Leopard 2A8s, with an estimated value of €2.1 billion. This contract, set to be finalized by the end of 2024, will allow the Czech armed forces to field one of the most advanced tank models in Europe, integrating the latest technological advancements in protection, mobility, and firepower, significantly boosting their operational capabilities. In parallel with the acquisition of these Leopard 2A8s, the Czech Republic has also enhanced its reserve capabilities with Leopard 2A4s. As part of Germany’s 'Ringtausch' initiative, aimed at supporting European partners in exchange for their military assistance to Ukraine, the Czech Republic received 14 Leopard 2A4s in 2022, replacing T-72s that were sent to the Ukrainian army. A new agreement in August 2024 brought the total to 28 Leopard 2A4 units. Although older, these tanks will play a strategic role for the Czech Republic by providing a solid foundation for the active reserve company, 'Czechoslovak Legions,' which can mobilize them if necessary. To maximize the effectiveness of this fleet of Leopards, Czech forces have structured their armored organization to address various security scenarios. The Leopard 2A8s will be distributed across three to four frontline companies, with the exact number depending on available funding and the potential to create an additional professional company if the budget permits. These units will represent the main striking force and be ready for rapid deployment. The Leopard 2A4s, in turn, will act as reinforcements for the active reserve company. The Ministry of Defense also plans to store the excess Leopard 2A4s, as well as the remaining T-72M4CZ tanks, for emergency situations, providing strategic flexibility and additional capacity in the event of prolonged mobilization. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the importance of heavy tanks in modern conflicts. Recent European doctrines had progressively moved away from these vehicles in favor of lighter, more mobile units.

Chinese Navy increases anti-submarine warfare with its new Y-8Q aircraft	On November 7, the Chinese Navy’s Y-8Q anti-submarine patrol aircraft arrived in Zhuhai for a static display at the 15th China Airshow, as reported by official Chinese media. The Y-8Q, also known as Gaoxin-6, GX-6, Yun-8Q or Kongqian-200, represents China’s first generation of fixed-wing anti-submarine patrol aircraft. Developed by Shaanxi Aircraft Corporation, this aircraft is based on the Y-8F-600 platform, also designated as Y-9, and powered by four WJ-6C turboprop engines, each featuring six-bladed JL-4 composite propellers. Since its induction in 2015, the Chinese PLANAF (People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force) has acquired over 50 units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Y-8Q performs a range of anti-submarine roles, including patrol, inspection, on-call deployment, and target indication, thanks to a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) extending from the tail. (Picture source: Weibo) The Y-8Q performs a range of anti-submarine roles, including patrol, inspection, on-call deployment, and target indication. It is equipped with various specialized systems for these missions, including a spherical radar dome at the nose, a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) extending from the tail, and a forward fuselage electro-optical turret that houses a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera, CCD/TV camera, and laser rangefinder. Openings on the aircraft allow for sonobuoy deployment (including SQ-4 and SQ-5 models), and a weapons bay can carry anti-submarine grenades, torpedoes, and depth charges. Reports from military sources provide context for the Y-8Q’s capabilities relative to other models. The Y-8Q surpasses previous Chinese anti-submarine aircraft like the Be-6 and Shuihong-5 in its range, hovering time, and speed but has limitations in comparison to other international models. With a patrol range of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 kilometers and a maximum speed of around 700 km/h, the Y-8Q is somewhat constrained compared to the U.S. P-8A Poseidon’s 8,300-kilometer range and 910 km/h speed. Furthermore, while the P-8A is equipped with under-wing anti-ship missile capabilities, no evidence suggests that the Y-8Q currently has similar capacity. Recent information from Chinese military media also confirms the Y-8Q’s anti-submarine weaponry, which includes self-guided aerial depth charges with sonar guidance. These depth charges, similar to Russia’s Zagon-2, are designed to be cost-effective, weighing around 120 kg with a 35 kg warhead. They incorporate a sonar-guided system and deploy a parachute for descent, enabling them to engage submarines at depths up to 600 meters. These charges provide a less expensive alternative to anti-submarine torpedoes and can be deployed in larger numbers, creating a pattern along a submarine’s anticipated route to restrict movement. The Y-8Q’s arrival at Zhuhai for the airshow provides a broader view of China’s anti-submarine strategy and the role of the Y-8Q within it. Previously, the Chinese Navy had limited fixed-wing anti-submarine capabilities, relying on helicopters like the Z-9C, Ka-28, and Z-18. Although the Y-8Q operates on a transport-based platform, which restricts its performance, it fills a key role in shore-based anti-submarine operations with the benefit of increased patrol range and payload capacity compared to these helicopters. In recent years, PLAN has distributed the Y-8Q across its three major fleets—the East China Sea, South China Sea, and North Sea Fleets—to strengthen their shore-based anti-submarine capacities. China’s military reports suggest a target deployment of between 100 and 200 Y-8Q units across its fleets. The development of a more advanced aircraft remains a long-term objective, with potential advancements to be drawn from domestic airframes such as the C919. Such an aircraft would aim to address current limitations by improving the Y-8Q’s patrol range, payload, and overall capability in anti-submarine operations. In addition to its core anti-submarine functions, the Y-8Q has demonstrated secondary capabilities in recent military exercises, where it deployed depth charges against surface targets. This capability aligns with PLAN’s strategy to develop versatile, lower-cost systems to support its various maritime defense needs. Observers note that the Y-8Q may serve in this capacity until more advanced platforms become available, providing PLAN with continued coverage for shore-based anti-submarine patrols and operational flexibility in its current state. Although the Y-8Q operates on a transport-based platform, which restricts its performance, it fills a key role in shore-based anti-submarine operations with the benefit of increased patrol range and payload capacity compared to military helicopters.

Lockheed Martin’s X-59 QueSST experimental aircraft reaches key step toward first supersonic flight	On November 6, 2024, the NASA announced that Lockheed Martin’s X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology (X-59 QueSST) experimental aircraft reached a critical development milestone with its first engine run at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. This milestone marks the beginning of engine-run tests, which commenced on October 30, 2024, allowing the X-59 team to confirm that the aircraft’s systems function effectively when powered by its own engine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Lockheed Martin X-59 QueSST’s engine, a modified F414-GE-100, generates 98 kN of thrust and is positioned atop the aircraft to reduce noise impact. (Picture source: NASA) During earlier stages, the team used external power sources to conduct preliminary tests. These tests are integral to NASA’s X-59 QueSST mission, aimed at reducing the noise impact of supersonic flight over land, potentially informing future regulations for commercial supersonic travel as well as leading to improvements in stealth aircraft. Engine-run tests are being conducted in phases. In the initial phase, the X-59’s engine was rotated at a low speed without ignition to detect any leaks and confirm that systems were synchronized and operating correctly. Subsequently, the team fueled the aircraft and conducted low-power engine tests, ensuring that the engine, along with hydraulic, electrical, and environmental control systems, operated without malfunctions or leaks when powered directly by the engine. Jay Brandon, NASA's X-59 chief engineer, described this stage as preliminary verification to ensure that all systems were operational before advancing to full engine operation. Designed to mitigate sonic booms, the X-59 is intended to produce a quieter sonic effect, which NASA describes as a 'thump,' even at supersonic speeds. This feature is central to the X-59 QueSST mission’s goal of assessing public perception of reduced noise, with data that could eventually help regulators review current restrictions on supersonic flight over land. The X-59’s engine, a modified F414-GE-100, generates 98 kN of thrust and is positioned atop the aircraft to reduce noise impact. This design enables the X-59 to reach Mach 1.4, or roughly 1,488 kilometers per hour, at an altitude of approximately 16,764 meters. The engine’s placement and thrust facilitate meeting mission objectives by enabling supersonic flight with reduced noise impact at ground level. These tests are part of a series of ground evaluations required for the aircraft’s safe progression toward flight. Following initial engine tests, the team will proceed with more rigorous evaluations, including high-power tests, rapid throttle changes, and flight condition simulations. This phase will lead to aluminum bird testing, during which the aircraft’s systems are monitored under various operating scenarios, including normal and failure conditions. The team will conduct taxi tests, during which the X-59 will move on the ground to verify its handling capabilities. Designed to mitigate sonic booms, the X-59 is intended to produce a quieter sonic effect, which NASA describes as a 'thump,' even at supersonic speeds. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The X-59, measuring approximately 30.4 meters in length with a wingspan of 9 meters, has been in development since NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a preliminary design contract in 2016. Although initially projected to begin flight tests in 2021, the schedule has been adjusted, with the first flight now expected in early 2025. The X-59’s design includes an enhanced flight vision system (EVS) with an external vision system (XVS) that provides a forward view to compensate for the limited visibility due to the aircraft’s extended nose. Supplied by Collins Aerospace, this visibility technology integrates multispectral imaging systems to enhance situational awareness, particularly during landing. With a target cruising speed of Mach 1.42 (around 1,510 kilometers per hour), the X-59 aims to reach a ground noise level of 75 effective perceived noise decibels (EPNdB), comparable to the sound of a car door closing. This would be significantly quieter than the Concorde’s supersonic boom, estimated between 105 and 110 EPNdB. By using a long, narrow airframe and a top-mounted engine intake, the X-59’s design is intended to reduce the intensity of the sonic boom experienced on the ground. In addition to its primary noise reduction features, the aircraft is equipped with components such as a cockpit, canopy, and ejection seat from a Northrop T-38, and landing gear from an F-16. The X-59 QueSST mission’s testing phase will include community evaluations across U.S. cities from 2023 to 2025. These tests will collect feedback on noise perception from residents, contributing data that will be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by 2027. These findings could inform regulatory discussions regarding commercial supersonic flight over land, potentially opening new supersonic travel routes by 2028. The X-59 development has comprised multiple stages, including wind tunnel testing, structural assembly, and system integration conducted over recent years. With its 98 kN of thrust, the aircraft is projected to reach a maximum speed of Mach 1.5 or 1,593 kilometers per hour, with a cruise speed of Mach 1.42 or 1,510 kilometers per hour at 16,764 meters. Further evaluations will proceed as NASA continues toward the planned first flight, currently targeted for early 2025. Curiously, the engine-run tests of the X-59 are taking place at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, a site also linked to the development of another high-profile and highly classified project: the SR-72 hypersonic aircraft. The X-59, which seeks to achieve quieter supersonic flight, involves advanced noise-reduction technologies, a modified engine configuration, and complex system integrations—features that are also pertinent to hypersonic and high-speed aircraft design. As the SR-72 aims to reach speeds of up to Mach 6, insights into high-speed aerodynamics, minimizing ground-level impact, and integrating advanced propulsion systems will be crucial. Observations from the X-59’s testing could support approaches to challenges anticipated in the SR-72 program, such as maintaining structural integrity at high speeds and managing the thermal and acoustic effects associated with hypersonic flight. The X-59’s tests, therefore, may contribute valuable data and engineering insights for the SR-72’s development trajectory. With a target cruising speed of Mach 1.42 (around 1,510 kilometers per hour), the X-59 aims to reach a ground noise level of 75 effective perceived noise decibels (EPNdB), comparable to the sound of a car door closing.

Lockheed Martin’s unmanned stealth tanker concept signals new era for US Air Force	As reported by The War Zone on November 6, 2024, Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division has introduced a conceptual design for a stealthy, pilot-optional aerial refueling tanker. This design aligns with the U.S. Air Force’s Next Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) plans, which are part of the broader Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) ecosystem aimed at addressing evolving operational needs as the Air Force refines requirements for a 'system of systems.' However, budget constraints are challenging the fulfillment of modernization goals, including this new refueling capability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The NGAS is expected to include traditional tankers like the KC-46 and KC-135, with the possible addition of refueling drones to allow uncrewed tankers to operate closer to contested areas, reducing risk to human crews. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin Skunk Works) The tanker concept features a swept-wing configuration with canted vertical stabilizers and stealth-enhancing elements, such as a chine line wrapping around the fuselage and saw-tooth paneling. A shrouded exhaust with serrated edges is positioned at the rear, which may help reduce radar and infrared detectability. In the rendering released by Lockheed Martin, the tanker is shown refueling two F-35A Joint Strike Fighters using refueling booms mounted near the wingtips. Although the Air Force primarily uses the boom method for refueling, it remains uncertain whether this tanker concept could also support the Navy and Marine Corps’ probe-and-drogue method. A retractable boom could enhance radar stealth but might compromise the boom’s structural integrity, posing potential operational challenges. The design’s pilot-optional configuration offers flexibility, with provisions for both crewed and uncrewed operations. This adaptability reflects a broader trend, as Skunk Works has previously proposed advanced tanker concepts, including blended-wing body designs. A Lockheed Martin representative confirmed that Skunk Works is exploring configurations intended to balance survivability, affordability, and autonomy in refueling capabilities. The NGAS is expected to include traditional tankers like the KC-46 and KC-135, with the possible addition of refueling drones for a networked approach. This model would allow uncrewed tankers to operate closer to contested areas, reducing risk to human crews. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has noted the need for stealthy tankers capable of operating near anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) zones, potentially extending the range of Air Force missions without compromising tanker safety. Skunk Works’ design is depicted as capable of mid-air refueling itself, a feature that could extend its operational range. Alongside Skunk Works’ concept, Boeing has proposed a land-based variant of its MQ-25 Stingray drone, initially developed for the U.S. Navy, as a potential NGAS solution. The Air Force is also exploring 'buddy store' refueling pods, which could enable other aircraft to function as small tankers within the refueling ecosystem. Incorporating stealth tankers with uncrewed platforms and NGAD systems could help sustain operations near forward zones, providing flexibility in high-threat environments. Kendall has emphasized the need for stealthy refueling assets, especially in regions like the Pacific, where the long operational distances may place current tanker fleets at risk. At the recent ATA symposium, Kendall discussed the financial pressures facing NGAS and NGAD initiatives, noting how these costs intersect with other priorities, such as the planned sixth-generation stealth fighter and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. The Air Force is reassessing the NGAD program, including whether the fighter should be crewed or uncrewed, in response to budget concerns. Kendall indicated that the Air Force expects to finalize NGAS requirements by the end of the year and has issued a request for information from industry on refueling and mission systems to support a competitive vendor pool. Skunk Works, known for its history of rapid prototyping, has developed aircraft like the P-80, U-2, and F-117 Nighthawk using a process focused on quickly achieving prototype status. This approach has facilitated projects such as the X-55A and the P-175 Polecat drone. However, transitioning these concepts from prototype to operational production has often been challenging, as demonstrated by the F-35 program. Production-phase issues highlighted concerns about 'concurrency,' in which problems identified during development were addressed simultaneously on production units, leading to delays and increased costs. The Air Force is also exploring other refueling methods, including Agile Combat Employment, to reduce reliance on aerial refueling when possible. Gen. Kevin Schneider of Pacific Air Forces noted that, while ground-based refueling is being considered, aerial refueling remains a priority to support dispersed operations. As the Air Force advances its NGAS initiative, the focus on adaptable and survivable refueling solutions will remain central to its strategy. Skunk Works’ latest tanker concept, along with the Air Force’s exploration of innovative refueling systems and integration of stealth and autonomous capabilities, underscores ongoing efforts to maintain effective aerial refueling support in high-threat scenarios.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/lockheed-martins-unmanned-stealth-tanker-concept-signals-new-era-for-us-air-force	2024-11-07T00:44:58-08:00

Breaking News: Trump Elected President Signals Shift in US Military Strategy and Ukraine Aid	Donald Trump's return to the White House is set to bring significant changes to U.S. military and foreign policy, with major implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly questioned the scale and focus of American support for Ukraine, suggesting he would reduce or reevaluate aid to Kyiv. His previous administration had a complex relationship with Russia and NATO, leading to uncertainty among allies about America’s long-term commitments. Now, his re-election suggests a shift towards a more isolationist approach that prioritizes U.S. interests over international military engagements.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Ukraine Defense Contact Group attendees are welcomed at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, on March 19, 2024, with Ukrainian and U.S. flags symbolizing the strong international support for Ukraine's defense efforts. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has become Kyiv's leading military supporter, committing over $54 billion in security assistance to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russian forces. This support includes sophisticated systems such as Patriot missile batteries, HIMARS rocket artillery, Abrams tanks, and a range of air defense and anti-tank weapons essential for countering Russian advancements. The aid has been crucial in strengthening Ukraine's defensive capabilities on multiple fronts, allowing it to push back against Russian troops and protect vital urban areas. Despite bipartisan support in Congress for Ukraine funding, Trump’s return to office signals a potential reevaluation of this strategy, with the former president indicating that he would convert some aid to loans and possibly reduce overall funding, a move that has drawn both support and criticism from NATO allies and within U.S. political circles concerned about maintaining Ukraine’s resilience. Trump has pledged to bring a quick end to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, asserting he could negotiate a peace settlement 'within 24 hours' of taking office. However, the details of this strategy still need to be clarified. His stated approach involves high-stakes negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, potentially including cuts to U.S. military assistance as a means to pressure both sides toward an agreement. While this aligns with the preferences of some of Trump’s voter base—many of whom support reducing aid to Ukraine—critics warn that such a move could embolden Russian ambitions and potentially destabilize the region further if it compromises Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty. Trump’s stance on foreign aid comes amid a broader reorientation of U.S. defense priorities, with the fiscal year 2024 defense budget projected to be a record $842 billion. This budget reflects a shift toward modernization and high-priority technologies to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. For example, significant funding has been allocated to nuclear arsenal upgrades, advanced cyber capabilities, and expanding U.S. military presence in Asia. Under Trump, this trend may accelerate, potentially reducing the American military footprint in Europe while focusing on domestic and Indo-Pacific security interests. NATO allies, already preparing for a potential reduction in U.S. support for Ukraine, are exploring mechanisms to ensure continuity in assistance independent of American aid to maintain Ukraine’s defenses in the face of these potential shifts. Trump’s re-election has spurred NATO and European allies to prepare for potential shifts in the U.S.-led support structure. During his previous term, Trump urged NATO members to increase their defense contributions, and he is expected to renew those demands. Recently, NATO has been working to assume a more direct role in coordinating military aid for Ukraine, a step seen as a means of maintaining consistent support even if U.S. contributions are curtailed. European allies, including Germany and France, have expressed a commitment to uphold assistance for Ukraine’s defense, regardless of the U.S.’s level of engagement. However, Trump’s approach may strain transatlantic relations, as allies brace for possible adjustments in U.S. defense strategy. As Trump’s administration prepares to reenter the global stage with new policies, Ukraine’s allies are weighing how these changes might impact Kyiv’s ongoing fight against Russian aggression. European governments are poised to fill potential gaps in military aid, and NATO is adjusting its strategy to ensure continuity in Ukraine’s defense. Meanwhile, Ukrainian leaders brace for potentially significant shifts in the diplomatic relationship with Washington, anticipating that the coming months may bring both challenges and new avenues in their efforts to secure peace.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-trump-elected-president-signals-shift-in-us-military-strategy-and-ukraine-aid	2024-11-06T02:31:01-08:00

France Positions to Equip Cyprus with Leclerc Tanks and Mistral Missiles in Response to Turkish Ambitions	In the context of strengthening the military arsenal of the Republic of Cyprus in response to Turkish ambitions, France is working to maintain a significant influence within the Cypriot National Guard, as reported by the Cypriot daily Kathimerini on October 13, 2024. Competing directly with Germany, Paris is promoting several advanced weapon systems for Cyprus, including Leclerc tanks and Mistral missiles. Now reaching the end of its operational cycle within the Cypriot forces, the latter system could be removed from the island's arsenal and redirected to Ukraine, thereby allowing partial renewal with more modern French equipment. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France is also urging Cyprus to consider acquiring Leclerc tanks, competing directly with Germany’s military industry for a potential €250 million contract (Picture source: French MoD) Among the French equipment already supplied to Cyprus are attack helicopters, marking an initial step in military cooperation between the two nations. France now also targets the market for Cypriot battle tanks, aiming to replace the T-80U of Russian origin. This market is particularly competitive, with Germany offering its Leopard tanks. To reinforce its position, France has extended a broader offer that includes additional military systems. A key element of the negotiation revolves around Mistral missiles, acquired forty years ago and primarily used for training. Paris has proposed reclaiming these now-obsolete missiles to reallocate them to Ukraine, where they could see a second operational life. Currently, the National Guard possesses between 150 and 170 of these short-range anti-aircraft systems, which have reached the end of their operational life. In exchange, France would offer Cyprus financial benefits, such as discounts on new Mistral missiles or other French-made equipment. Although this offer appears attractive, Cypriot officials have expressed their intention to negotiate better terms, particularly in terms of compensation, before making a final decision. Beyond the Mistral systems, France is also urging Cyprus to consider acquiring Leclerc tanks, competing directly with Germany’s military industry for a potential €250 million contract. The exact nature of the proposed Leclerc tanks, whether new or used, remains unclear, but France may consider providing second-hand units from a lot previously sold to the United Arab Emirates. Drawing on its past support during the U.S. arms embargo on Cyprus, when France was one of the few countries supplying modern weapons, Paris hopes to leverage this privileged relationship to secure a position in this market. France and Cyprus have a longstanding military cooperation, with several French systems holding an important place within the National Guard's arsenal. Over the past decade, Cyprus has invested approximately €310 million in French military equipment. Recent acquisitions include upgraded Mistral and Exocet systems, along with anti-tank missiles and French armored vehicles. The range of French systems, including attack helicopters, rocket systems, tanks, and self-propelled guns, underscores France's commitment to securing long-term defense contracts with Nicosia. The competition to renew Cypriot military equipment is intensifying as Germany, with its Leopard tanks, competes with Paris for strategic contracts. However, France relies on its historic support during the U.S. embargo, hoping to persuade Nicosia to choose French equipment for its next acquisitions. These proposals, submitted before last summer, have not yet received a formal response. However, they could enable Cyprus to continue modernizing its forces in response to Turkey's growing ambitions in the region, marked by frequent military exercises and regular reinforcement of Turkish forces on the island. Beyond simply providing armaments, France views this military cooperation as an opportunity to affirm its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean, where strategic interests are increasingly contested.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-positions-to-equip-cyprus-with-leclerc-tanks-and-mistral-missiles-in-response-to-turkish-ambitions	2024-11-06T01:36:29-08:00

(Picture source: Weibo/CCTV News) The development of the J-35A traces back to the J-31/FC-31 Gyrfalcon, a project initiated by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) as a self-funded, export-oriented model. The J-31 prototype first appeared in 2012, generating considerable interest. Over time, the J-31 underwent multiple design changes, including forward-swept intake ramps, DSI bumps, and oblique vertical stabilizers, aiming to create a competitive fighter for the global market. Initially targeted for export, the model eventually attracted attention from the PLA, particularly the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which evaluated a carrier-capable version under the designation J-35. The naval variant completed its maiden flight on October 29, 2021, featuring modifications like a launch bar and folding wings for carrier operations. Significant changes between the earlier FC-31 demonstrator and the J-35A, a land-based variant of the J-35 naval fighter, include a new radome without a pitot tube, an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), updated nose and main landing gear bay doors, a modified Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI), and a redesigned canopy. The airframe now includes a gun pod, a wide-area heads-up display, and a Luneburg lens to assist with radar signature management. Observations indicate that the fighter’s twin vertical stabilizers and twin-engine configuration include a serrated nozzle, which could be powered by either the WS-13 or the RD-33-derived WS-21 engines, both of which offer similar performance levels. Alongside the domestic J-35A variant, an export version, the J-35E, has been developed. However, the carrier-based J-35 variant currently lacks an international market, as few nations possess the extensive resources required for naval operations. The naval J-35 version could provide carrier-based capabilities, though this would be feasible mainly for nations with catapult launch systems, thus narrowing its potential market. Military analyst Li Li, quoted by China Central Television News, states that the J-35A’s induction marks an expansion in the PLAAF’s stealth capabilities, positioning it alongside the J-20. This step could align PLAAF’s capabilities with the U.S. Air Force, which operates the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. Within the PLAAF, the J-35A joins an informal fleet lineup known as the 'Four Musketeers,' comprising the J-10C, J-16, J-20, and the new J-35A. Notably, this reveal coincides with the 75th-anniversary celebrations of the PLAAF, during which the air force will feature 36 different types of equipment through flight demonstrations and static displays. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. Images depict the J-35A positioned in a shelter typically used by the PLAAF, emphasizing its role as a land-based model. However, the new J-35A could potentially serve as a main carrier aircraft in a naval variant, which would align with China’s expanding capabilities in both aerial and maritime domains. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. (Picture source: US DoD and CCTV News) Reports over the years have noted speculation that the J-31’s development, which led to the J-35A, may have drawn on data from the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program, which led to the F-35, though these claims remain unverified. Some Russian aviation experts have asserted that the J-31 is a domestic design, independent of existing Western aircraft. The design's evolution, including stealth capabilities and multi-role features, indicates a continued focus by China on producing advanced fifth-generation fighters. The F-35 and J-35A display clear visual distinctions that suggest differences in design priorities and potential roles. The F-35 has a rounded, gently sloped nose, while the J-35A's nose is sharper with a more defined chine line. This difference is also evident in the canopy shape: the F-35 features a single-piece, bubble-style canopy with a smooth curve, whereas the J-35A’s canopy is slightly more angular and has a flatter profile. In terms of engine exhaust nozzles, the F-35 uses a polygonal design intended to enhance certain performance characteristics, while the J-35A, typically seen with a rounder exhaust, reflects a different approach in nozzle configuration. The intake designs also vary, with the F-35 featuring larger, straight-sided intakes positioned close to the fuselage, and the J-35A’s narrower intakes angled slightly outward, giving it a distinctive shape. The wing shapes and positions add further contrast between the two aircraft. The F-35’s trapezoidal wings integrate with the fuselage in one configuration, while the J-35A’s trapezoidal wings are larger and have a different placement, possibly reflecting considerations for carrier-based operations. The tail fin design diverges as well: the F-35’s vertical stabilizers are shorter and blend closely into the fuselage, while the J-35A’s stabilizers are taller and angled outward, resembling other designs in China's stealth aircraft lineup, such as the J-20. Finally, the landing gear differs in structure and placement. The F-35 has thicker landing gear, positioned in alignment with its structural design, while the J-35A’s landing gear may be adapted for carrier operations, following certain design conventions observed in other Chinese aircraft. These distinctions suggest each aircraft's design reflects specific operational requirements and design philosophies, with the F-35 and J-35A each incorporating elements that align with their respective priorities and roles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-to-know-about-chinas-new-j-35a-stealth-fighter-as-a-potential-us-f-35-competitor	2024-11-05T02:45:23-08:00

Additionally, the modernization of its radar and electronic warfare systems, in partnership with Northrop Grumman, bolsters its capability to operate in highly contested environments. These attributes make the B-52H a central element in U.S. strategic strike capabilities, with global reach supported by aerial refueling. This deployment is part of a broader strategy recently outlined by the Pentagon, which includes the addition of fighter aircraft, tankers, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers equipped with Aegis ballistic missile defense systems. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder stated that this increased military presence aims to deter Iran and its allies from any hostile actions against U.S. personnel or interests, with the assurance that any attacks would prompt a decisive response. The Middle East has seen several notable incidents this year, including repeated strikes between Iran and Israel. In April, an Iranian attack followed an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, and in October, further actions purportedly in retaliation for targeted eliminations of Iranian-aligned leaders raised concerns over potential escalation. In response, the U.S. aims to strengthen its deterrent posture in the region, with the B-52s playing a central role due to their long-range strike capacity. The presence of B-52 bombers underscores the strategic flexibility of the U.S., as these aircraft can deliver both conventional and nuclear payloads and perform a variety of missions such as strategic attack, close air support, air interdiction, and maritime operations. This heightened military presence comes at a time of increased regional tensions, with Israel recently deploying approximately 100 fighter jets, including F-35s, in strikes targeting Iranian bases, and Iran responding in October with a substantial missile strike against Israel, claiming it as retaliation for attacks on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. The deployments are expected to continue over the coming months, even as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, stationed in the region since August, is set to depart. Meanwhile, the U.S. has bolstered Israel's missile defense capabilities with the deployment of a THAAD system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, and accompanied by 100 U.S. service members for operation support. The B-52 is not the only strategic bomber currently mobilized. In parallel, the U.S. deployed the B-1B Lancer to the Korean Peninsula, conducting trilateral exercises with South Korean and Japanese fighters in response to North Korea's recent intercontinental ballistic missile test. This deployment alongside Asian allies also emphasizes a shared commitment to counter North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. The increased presence of strategic bombers in both regions demonstrates the U.S.'s rapid deployment capability to deter adversaries in sensitive global areas, including Iran, North Korea, and China. In June 2024, B-52s were deployed to Guam for a live-fire test involving the AGM-183 hypersonic weapon, highlighting their strategic role in the Pacific. In summary, the deployment of B-52 bombers to the Middle East reflects the U.S.'s commitment to maintaining regional stability amid persistent threats from Iran and its allies. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s message remains clear: any attack on U.S. interests will be met with prompt and proportionate defensive measures. These actions underscore the U.S.'s resolve to protect its interests and support its partners during a period of heightened regional tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-air-force-strengthens-its-presence-in-middle-east-with-deployment-of-new-b-52h-bombers-amid-tensions-with-iran	2024-11-05T01:52:06-08:00

Exclusive: Israeli Army Explores Formation of Anti-Tank Units with Seized Hezbollah Kornet and Almas Missiles	In a report published on November 4, 2024, by Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, the Israeli army is reportedly examining the potential to create specialized anti-tank units equipped with seized Hezbollah anti-tank weaponry, including thousands of Russian-made Kornet and Iranian-made Almas anti-tank missiles. This move would be part of a broader Israeli defense strategy aimed at leveraging captured enemy equipment to enhance tactical flexibility and reduce acquisition costs for advanced armament.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During a Golani Brigade operation in the Western Sector of Lebanon, Israeli forces uncovered weaponry, a tunnel system, and underground bunkers that were used by the terror organization Hezbollah. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) The use of captured enemy equipment by the Israeli armed forces is not a new tactic. Since the country’s founding, Israel has seized and integrated various types of enemy material, dating back to conflicts such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1967 Six-Day War. Captured Arab armor and artillery were commonly refurbished and used to supplement Israel’s limited military resources. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, for example, Israel captured Soviet-origin T-54 and T-55 tanks from Syrian and Egyptian forces. These tanks were later refurbished and repurposed, providing Israel with additional armor strength during critical periods of regional conflict. Similarly, in the 1980s, Israel repurposed Soviet-made weaponry captured from various adversaries, particularly during the Lebanon conflict. Captured equipment is often studied intensively to understand its capabilities and limitations, enabling the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to develop effective countermeasures and, if feasible, repurpose this hardware for their own operational needs. The Kornet and Almas anti-tank missiles, seized in recent operations against Hezbollah, represent potent assets in Israel’s anti-tank arsenal. Initially developed by Russia, the Kornet (ATGM 9M133) is a laser-guided anti-tank missile system known for its range, armor-penetrating capability, and precision. With a maximum effective range of up to 5,500 meters, the Kornet can penetrate up to 1,200 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) with its tandem-warhead design, making it a serious threat to modern armored vehicles and even fortified positions. Hezbollah’s use of the Kornet missile in previous conflicts with Israel demonstrated its ability to penetrate even Israel’s Merkava main battle tanks, a lesson the IDF has not forgotten. The Iranian-made Almas missile, another advanced anti-tank weapon, has similar capabilities to the Kornet, boasting high penetration power and a range that allows for significant standoff engagement. Reports indicate that the Almas missile was designed as an indigenous Iranian effort to replicate and even surpass some of the Kornet's capabilities, with a range of up to 8 kilometers in its most recent configurations. The acquisition of these missiles allows the IDF to significantly enhance its ground unit capabilities without procuring similar systems externally. If the IDF formalizes the creation of anti-tank units armed with Kornet and Almas missiles, it could represent a strategic shift in how Israel conducts anti-armor operations. These missiles would allow Israeli forces to engage armored threats at greater distances and in diverse terrains, an asset particularly useful in the hilly and urbanized areas where conflicts with Hezbollah frequently take place. Establishing these units would enable Israel to maximize the efficiency of seized weapons, making them a cost-effective means of bolstering national defense. Moreover, deploying such units could potentially reduce Israel's dependence on more expensive, domestically produced anti-tank systems, such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems' Spike family of missiles. Integrating Kornet and Almas missiles would also provide a tactical advantage in scenarios where these systems are already familiar to enemy forces but are now used against them by IDF personnel. The IDF’s consideration of using captured Kornet and Almas missiles aligns with a long-standing practice of repurposing enemy weapons, which allows Israel to turn adversarial capabilities against their original owners effectively. With tensions high in the region, particularly with Hezbollah in Lebanon, this development underscores the IDF’s commitment to adapting its resources and strategies to emerging threats. By potentially fielding anti-tank units using seized equipment, Israel not only strengthens its own defenses but also leverages an innovative approach that could serve as a model for other nations facing similar strategic challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-israeli-army-explores-formation-of-anti-tank-units-with-seized-hezbollah-kornet-and-almas-missiles	2024-11-04T06:50:46-08:00

French German Railgun Reaches Hypersonic Speeds A New Era of Defense	According to information published by Opex360 on November 3, 2024, the French Navy is set to unveil its new electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at speeds reaching Mach 8.7. This innovation, led by the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) under the Defense Innovation Agency (AID) represents a groundbreaking shift in naval weaponry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unveiling the Future of Naval Artillery: The electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at Mach 8.7, promises unprecedented speed, range, and precision in maritime defense. (Picture source: ISL) Other nations, however, have continued exploring the EMRG’s potential. China, for instance, reportedly tested a railgun from its amphibious assault ship Haiyang Shan, though these claims remain unverified. Japan has also joined the race, with its Ministry of Defense’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA) achieving a first successful test in October 2023, firing a 40 mm projectile at Mach 6.5 with a 5-megajoule railgun. Europe, recognizing the strategic advantages of EMRG technology, has pursued joint projects to bolster its defense capabilities. The European Union tasked the ISL with coordinating the PILUM project (Projectiles for Increased Long-range Effects Using Electromagnetic Railgun), which successfully demonstrated the potential for long-range, high-precision projectile launches over several hundred kilometers. The project’s success led to the establishment of the THEMA (Technology for Electro-Magnetic Artillery) program in June 2023, funded by a €15 million grant from the European Defense Fund (EDF). In a recent move to accelerate development, Japan entered a partnership with France and Germany, signing a Terms of Reference (TOR) agreement. This partnership paves the way for collaboration between Japan’s ATLA and the ISL, aiming to advance electromagnetic weapons technology across borders. The French General Directorate for Armament (DGA) has initiated an ambitious program to develop an electromagnetic railgun for the French Navy, known as the RAILGUN project. This project aims to strengthen the Navy's capabilities against evolving maritime threats, particularly hypersonic and saturation attacks. Leveraging electromagnetic energy to propel projectiles at extreme velocities, the railgun is designed for high precision over extended distances, with a reported range exceeding 200 kilometers. This impressive range, coupled with the railgun’s reduced projectile flight times, provides distinct advantages in defensive operations, especially in intercepting fast-moving aerial threats. As detailed by AID (Agence de l'Innovation de Défense), the RAILGUN system is set to bring notable advancements to French naval warfare. Positioned on a vessel's bow, the system would maximize anti-air efficacy by decreasing engagement times and allowing for rapid, high-velocity impacts that increase the likelihood of neutralizing incoming threats. Additionally, since railgun technology eliminates the need for conventional explosive propellants, it can reduce space requirements for ammunition storage on board, enabling vessels to carry more rounds and potentially reduce resupply needs. ISL, for its part, confirmed that the railgun presented at Euronaval can accelerate projectiles to 3,000 meters per second – equivalent to 10,800 km/h or Mach 8.7. Given that speeds above Mach 5 qualify as hypersonic, this weapon stands as a formidable advancement in naval defense technology. The mechanics of an electromagnetic railgun involve creating a magnetic field between two conductive rails through a high-intensity electric current. This field accelerates the projectile, itself a conductor, via the Lorentz force. However, achieving such extreme velocities presents significant challenges. The materials used must withstand intense mechanical stress, and the system requires an immense energy source capable of instantaneous release.

Comments The U.S. Navy’s decision to extend the service life of 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers is indicative of broader financial challenges affecting its fleet readiness and modernization. This strategy of prolonging existing ships' lifespans over investing in new vessels reveals a budgetary restraint that has raised concerns, especially amid heightened global security tensions. While extending these vessels offers a short-term fix to maintain a robust fleet presence, it underscores a potential compromise in the Navy’s ability to keep pace with technological advancements and fleet expansion needs. The current fiscal approach limits the Navy's shipbuilding budget, impacting programs critical for fleet growth. For example, shipbuilding projects are already experiencing underfunding, with cuts affecting the production of key vessels, such as the Virginia-class submarines and Constellation-class frigates. This budgetary constraint not only slows the introduction of advanced vessels but could also erode long-term fleet capacity and readiness. By focusing on immediate, cost-saving measures like service extensions, the Navy may fall behind on investments in next-generation capabilities that are essential for countering threats in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Additionally, the push to maintain older ships might hinder innovation, particularly in the context of U.S.-China competition. The Navy's modernization budget prioritizes essential research and technology development, but reduced funding in areas like Science and Technology Research (cut by 30% this year) risks stifling growth in critical domains such as cybersecurity, information warfare, and next-gen shipbuilding. In an era where technological dominance plays a pivotal role in strategic deterrence, these reductions raise questions about the sustainability of the Navy's long-term defense posture. Experts caution that it could weaken the Navy’s future operational effectiveness and innovation pipeline, leaving it potentially underprepared against rapidly advancing global powers like China and Russia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/in-response-to-china-us-navy-extends-arleigh-burke-class-destroyers-lifespan	2024-10-31T08:09:32-07:00

A Landing Craft Utility (LCU) is an amphibious vessel designed to transport troops, vehicles, and equipment directly from ship to shore, playing a crucial role in operations where traditional ports are unavailable or in contested areas. With a flat-bottomed design, LCUs are built for beach landings and feature a large, open cargo area equipped with a front ramp to facilitate quick unloading of vehicles and personnel. Capable of carrying significant loads, LCUs transport everything from troops to heavy equipment like tanks and trucks, making them indispensable in amphibious assault and logistics missions. Although not the fastest vessels, their steady range and durability allow them to operate continuously between ships and shorelines, ensuring a reliable flow of resources. In addition to combat scenarios, LCUs are versatile assets used in humanitarian missions and disaster relief, delivering aid and emergency teams to areas with limited infrastructure. Often deployed alongside larger amphibious ships, such as Landing Platform Docks (LPDs) and Landing Helicopter Docks (LHDs), LCUs are integral to naval fleets for their ability to rapidly support large-scale landing operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/lcu-nihonbare-joins-japans-defense-fleet-in-naikai-shipbuilding-launch	2024-10-30T06:48:16-07:00	
China Draws Inspiration from Russian War Tactics in Ukraine via Belarus	The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has shown growing interest in the military strategies implemented by Russian forces in Ukraine, observing these developments through a unique intermediary: the Belarusian armed forces. In October, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) highlighted the ongoing military cooperation between China and Belarus, suggesting that Beijing may be examining operational lessons learned by the Belarusian army in connection with the conflict in Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This growing partnership shows China, like other Central Asian nations, seeking to leverage Belarusian expertise in essential hybrid warfare tactics, such as drone use, trench clearing, and urban assaults (Picture source: China Military) According to Major General Vadim Denisenko, Commander of Belarusian Special Operations Forces, China has recently increased its military exchanges with Belarus. Denisenko stated that Chinese military representatives, along with delegations from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, have participated in military exercises in Belarus over the past three to four months. This growing military partnership indicates that China, like other Central Asian nations, aims to benefit from Belarusian experiences in hybrid warfare, including the use of drones, trench clearing, and urban assault techniques, all of which have become essential in contemporary conflict. China’s interest in these competencies points to a strategy of observing and assimilating Russian methods of warfare. It is likely that Beijing, despite not being directly involved in the Ukrainian conflict, views this approach as an opportunity to refine its understanding of hybrid warfare and military response capabilities. Russian influence in Belarus, historically strong, has intensified with the war in Ukraine, making Belarus a pivotal actor in disseminating Russian military techniques, especially to non-Western allies like China. Meanwhile, on October 28, related developments indicated that NATO continues to monitor the region closely. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte disclosed that South Korean intelligence had revealed the presence of North Korean units in Russia’s Kursk region, potentially signaling additional military support for the Kremlin. This Sino-Belarusian military cooperation could be seen as part of a broader network of shared military knowledge that extends beyond the Russia-Belarus alliance, incorporating a group of Asian allies and strategic observers aiming to capitalize on Russian military expertise. Recent events have also underscored an escalation in operations within Ukraine. On the night of October 27-28, Ukrainian forces launched a series of drone attacks targeting Russian infrastructure, including distilleries, to weaken Russian air capabilities. Furthermore, Russian leader Vladimir Putin briefly acknowledged his country’s labor challenges, though he sought to reassure the public by emphasizing Russia’s low unemployment rate and asserted that the national economy could sustain a prolonged war effort. On the international front, support for Ukraine remains steady, marked by close cooperation among Western allies and ongoing diplomatic initiatives. In another development, Moldova’s Constitutional Court is set to review the results of the October 20 referendum on October 31, highlighting the conflict's role in expanding democratic interests within neighboring states. Meanwhile, Georgia is experiencing civil and political challenges to the results of its 2024 parliamentary elections, reflecting the growing tensions in Russia’s periphery.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-draws-inspiration-from-russian-war-tactics-in-ukraine-via-belarus	2024-10-30T06:21:59-07:00

Additionally, the Scorpion helmet-mounted display provides augmented situational awareness to pilots, while the SPECTRA self-protection system ensures greater operational freedom and defense against threats. In March 2017, Bangladesh initiated a tender for eight new multi-role combat aircraft, with an option for four additional units, to strengthen national air defense. The Rafale has been competing against the Eurofighter Typhoon for this contract, valued at nearly €2.5 billion. Prime Minister Yunus's administration appears more receptive to the French offer, potentially influenced by French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Dhaka in September 2023, the first by a French head of state in 33 years. Although no official response was given during this visit, France’s interest in this strategic market remains strong. In this competitive context, defense suppliers are highlighting their products' strengths while addressing perceived weaknesses in competitors' offerings. One argument raised against the Rafale is its presence within the Indian military, raising concerns in Bangladesh about reliance on the same suppliers as its neighboring country. Some contend that using the same fighter as India could put Bangladesh at a tactical disadvantage in potential conflicts, as India has a detailed understanding of Rafale's capabilities and limitations. BAF’s specifications for new combat aircraft are particularly stringent. Requirements include twin engines with a minimum dry thrust of 5,500 kg and over 8,000 kg with afterburner, at least eight hardpoints, and a payload capacity of at least 5,000 kg. Avionics must feature electronically scanned array radar with a range of 150 km for air-to-air missions and 50 km for air-to-ground. An integrated electronic warfare suite, infrared search and track system with a 50 km range, helmet-mounted display, and modern glass cockpit are also mandatory. The envisioned contract would encompass maintenance, training, and a set of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, with deliveries in two phases: an initial batch of four jets, followed by another within 18-24 months. Despite no official confirmation, Bangladesh's interest in 'Western' defense equipment is longstanding. The country previously considered acquiring helicopters from Bell Helicopter but later withdrew. Under its 'Force Goal 2030' program, BAF was also approached by Airbus Defence for the Eurofighter Typhoon, although Rafale remained a favored candidate. In 2021, Russia offered a batch of Mikoyan MiG-35 fighters, which Bangladesh quickly declined, signaling a gradual move away from Russian aerospace offerings.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/france-in-pursuit-of-a-strategic-agreement-to-sell-rafale-fighters-to-bangladesh	2024-10-30T04:13:18-07:00

South Korea Warns of Looming North Korean Nuclear Test Before US Election	On October 30, 2024, South Korea’s Ministry of Defense informed lawmakers that North Korea appears ready for a seventh nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, potentially timed with the U.S. presidential election on November 5. Intelligence obtained during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggye-ri site, with specific equipment and launch units in place, likely for an ICBM launch designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target (Picture source: KCNA) The session, conducted by representatives of South Korean military intelligence, also revealed signs of North Korean troops mobilized in Russia. Some units are reported to have joined the frontlines in the Kursk region, where Russian forces face Ukrainian counteroffensives. This deployment, observers note, underscores the strengthened strategic alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict, a factor North Korea appears to be leveraging to intensify its military activities. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been ramping up displays of power in recent months, accelerating missile tests and revealing a secret military-grade uranium production facility in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely a 12-axle model recently shown in state media, for an ICBM launch potentially reaching U.S. territory. This move aligns with warnings from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that Pyongyang may orchestrate significant military provocations around U.S. elections to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target. While previous North Korean ICBM tests were conducted at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid neighboring territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advancement in North Korea’s missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea’s capability to target distant locations, including the U.S. mainland. The escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programs under reduced international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from South Korean authorities leave little doubt regarding Kim Jong Un’s intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with powers outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has pursued nuclear capabilities to bolster its deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric armament strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in nuclear warhead miniaturization and ICBM development, such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of targeting the U.S., thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea strategically positions itself, the U.S. and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. The possibility of a nuclear test and an ICBM launch around the U.S. election period introduces an air of uncertainty, underscoring the importance of maintaining international vigilance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-warns-of-looming-north-korean-nuclear-test-before-us-election	2024-10-30T03:23:55-07:00

The Trophy Active Protection System (APS), developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is a vehicle-mounted defense system designed to protect against various anti-tank threats, including rockets and guided missiles. Operational in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since 2011, it uses multiple radar panels to detect incoming projectiles and neutralizes them by firing countermeasures, intercepting the threat before it reaches the vehicle. This system has been integrated into key Israeli platforms, such as the Merkava tank and Namer APC, and has attracted significant interest from other countries, including the U.S., which has equipped the M1 Abrams with Trophy, and Germany, which has fitted it to the Leopard 2. Despite successful interception, passive armor remains necessary, as fragments of neutralized projectiles may still impact the tank. Each launcher provides more than 180 degrees of coverage, ensuring 360-degree protection. The system operates autonomously, with the tank commander controlling only whether it is active or not. The Trophy's combat-proven capabilities have demonstrated a high interception rate, especially during operations involving the Israeli Defense Forces. It has also been successfully tested by European armies. In addition to protection, the system provides situational awareness through its Fire Source Location (FSL) capability, allowing vehicles to locate and respond to enemy fire effectively. As of 2023, the system has been fielded on more than 1,000 vehicles worldwide, underscoring its role as a critical component in modern armored warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-equips-leopard-2a7a1-tank-with-trophy-aps-to-enhance-protection-against-missiles	2024-10-30T03:09:57-07:00

Military doctors conducted emergency procedures and life-support drills. Piracy Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters has seen fluctuating trends in 2024, marked by a resurgence of high-severity incidents. Despite a global decrease in piracy rates, piracy remains persistent in this region, largely due to geopolitical instability and economic incentives for Somali pirate groups. Notably, Somali pirates have recently resumed hijackings, employing fishing vessels as 'mother ships' to launch skiff-based attacks on passing merchant ships, especially those less protected by armed security or defensive measures. Pirate tactics in the Gulf of Aden often include kidnapping crews for ransom, with recent months witnessing heightened violence against captured individuals. While many attacks are thwarted by security teams and vessel hardening measures, pirates continue to exploit vessels lacking rigorous defenses. Reports highlight cases where pirates intercept vessels using false distress calls or approach vessels under the guise of local fishermen, increasing the risk of misunderstandings and violence. The ongoing regional conflict, particularly involving Houthi attacks and Iranian-backed groups, has also destabilized the Gulf of Aden, further threatening commercial shipping. The recent uptick in anti-ship missile and drone attacks, some targeting vessels linked to Western interests, underscores the rising regional complexity. Consequently, international naval task forces such as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s Operation Aspides have expanded their protective scope to secure critical shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinese-navy-conducts-advanced-anti-piracy-drills-in-gulf-of-aden	2024-10-30T02:54:08-07:00

Pentagon Faces Shortage of Air-Defense Missiles Amid Rising Demand	The United States is experiencing a reduction in its stockpile of air-defense missiles, raising concerns about the Pentagon's readiness to respond to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, as well as potential conflicts in the Pacific. These concerns, highlighted in a recent The Wall Street Journal article on October 29, 2024, focus on interceptors that are essential for countering missile and drone threats in the region. Demand for these munitions has surged as U.S. allies, notably Israel, confront escalating attacks orchestrated by Iran and affiliated militias. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An SM-3 Block 1B interceptor is launched from the USS Lake Erie during an MDA test (Picture source: US DoD) Since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, the United States has deployed over 100 Standard Missiles—interceptors typically launched from ships, crucial for countering Iranian threats and Houthi attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea. This rapid consumption, further accelerated by recent Israeli strikes against Iran, has heightened concerns about the U.S.'s ability to meet growing demands for these munitions, particularly should a conflict arise in the Pacific. The term Standard Missile in this context refers to a series of air-defense missiles developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies) for the U.S. Navy, including models such as the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), and Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). These ship-launched missiles are critical for countering a variety of threats, from ballistic missiles to cruise missiles and aircraft, and are integrated into naval defense systems to protect U.S. forces and allies like Israel. The SM-2 primarily serves medium-range anti-aircraft defense, while the SM-3 and SM-6 add extended capabilities for intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles. The SM-2 is designed for medium-range air defense, capable of intercepting aircraft and cruise missiles within a range of approximately 170 kilometers at speeds of up to Mach 3. The SM-3, with greater range, is intended to neutralize ballistic missiles during their exo-atmospheric phase with a kinetic warhead, reaching targets up to 500 kilometers away. The SM-6 combines both anti-aircraft and anti-missile functions with a range of around 240 kilometers, excelling at intercepting low-altitude cruise missiles and high-speed aerial threats with multi-mode guidance. Pentagon officials, while keeping stockpile data classified to prevent strategic leverage by Iran and its allies, have acknowledged heightened pressure on resources. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh indicated that the Department of Defense is adjusting its posture to protect U.S. forces and support Israel, while maintaining focus on readiness and stockpiles. The high rate of interceptor use by the Pentagon raises challenges for responding to unexpected demands in both the Middle East and Europe. Additional concerns involve the responsiveness of the defense industry, which is often constrained by the need to expand production lines, facilities, and qualified personnel. Elias Yousif, Deputy Director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, noted that the U.S. has not developed a defense industrial base suited to prolonged attritional conflict, which complicates the current situation. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has advocated for increased production of Standard Missiles, though he acknowledged the challenges associated with producing such sophisticated munitions. The Pentagon is exploring alternative solutions, including soliciting new companies to help boost production of air-defense missiles. Despite recent stockpile increases, the launch rate observed in recent months has exceeded production capacity, according to defense analysts and officials. RTX, the manufacturer of Standard Missiles, produces a few hundred annually, though these munitions are also supplied to over 14 U.S. allies, limiting availability for the Pentagon. RTX spokesperson Chris Johnson stated that the company closely collaborates with the Department of Defense to meet production needs. Since the onset of the Hamas-Israel conflict last year, U.S. ships have launched over $1.8 billion in interceptors to protect Israel and ships passing through the Red Sea from Iranian threats. On average, two interceptors are launched per incoming missile to ensure accuracy, resulting in high costs to counter less sophisticated targets, such as Houthi drones. A congressional official noted that while costly, these munitions take months to replace. Last month, the U.S. deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to Israel, allowing the use of other types of interceptors in addition to Standard Missiles. The Pentagon also repositioned Patriot missile defense systems in the region, though their availability remains limited due to commitments in Ukraine. While the Pentagon aims to maintain current Standard Missile production levels, it may reduce production of older variants to fund newer models. The pace of interceptor use in the Middle East, however, could jeopardize U.S. readiness for a Pacific conflict. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery emphasized that the current use of Standard Missiles risks compromising the Navy’s preparedness for Pacific operations, underscoring the strategic impact of prolonged Middle Eastern engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/pentagon-faces-shortage-of-air-defense-missiles-amid-rising-demand	2024-10-29T07:07:52-07:00	
France's Navy enters Taiwan Strait Following US and Canadian Warships	According to information published by Yahoo on October 29, 2024, following the United States and Canada, France has now sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait amid heightened cross-strait tensions. This move by France comes shortly after China’s recent military exercises in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Navy's Floreal class frigate during exercise with Japanese Mogami-class frigate JS Noshiro. (Picture source: JMSDF) On October 20, the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins and the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver passed through the strait. According to The Mirror Media, the French Navy’s Floréal-class frigate Prairial (F731) sailed through the strait, moving from south to north. This transit aligns with the vessel’s recent regional activity, following its goodwill visit to Cebu from October 22 to 25. French military presence within the first island chain is quite frequent. Earlier this year, between April and May, the French Navy’s frigate Vendémiaire (F734) and Bretagne (D655) also conducted visits to the Philippines. Recent typhoon activity, including Typhoon Typhoon Saola and Typhoon Kanun, likely influenced Prairial’s timing to ensure safe and controlled navigation. France’s approach differs from the United States, as the French Navy typically refrains from issuing overt political statements during such transits. While the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) often dispatches ships to shadow foreign vessels in the region, it generally refrains from public commentary unless prompted by any perceived provocations. French Navy France’s stance on Taiwan and China is centered on maintaining freedom of navigation and supporting a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing non-confrontational yet assertive actions. As the only EU country with territories in the Indo-Pacific, France considers itself an Indo-Pacific power with obligations to uphold international laws in areas like the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. This commitment is driven by concerns over China's aggressive actions, such as military drills and territorial claims that disregard international rulings. In practice, the French Navy has regularly conducted freedom of navigation operations, sending vessels like the destroyer Lorraine to the South China Sea and the frigate Prairial through the Taiwan Strait. These moves are positioned as stabilizing efforts rather than provocations. French lawmakers have openly criticized China's actions, noting that Beijing's moves threaten not only regional stability but also global trade security, reinforcing France's resolve to maintain peace and security in the strait through strategic partnerships and multilateral dialogues​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/frances-navy-enters-taiwan-strait-following-us-and-canadian-warships	2024-10-29T06:51:08-07:00

The missile is also expected to be equipped with a more powerful warhead, designed to penetrate heavily reinforced structures, such as bunkers or underground shelters. Additionally, the Taurus Neo may incorporate technologies to bypass missile defense systems, thus enhancing its ability to evade radars and penetrate enemy air defenses. The decision to launch the Taurus Neo project comes in a context where the war in Ukraine has heightened security concerns in Europe. Since the beginning of the conflict, Russia has intensified its use of cruise missiles to target strategic and civilian infrastructure, underscoring Ukraine's need for similar retaliatory capabilities. In response, the United Kingdom and France have already provided Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, which Ukrainian forces have adapted for use on Soviet-made aircraft. These missiles, equipped with sophisticated guidance systems combining GPS, inertial navigation, and infrared imaging (IIR), are mainly used to strike heavily defended targets like ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical hubs behind Russian lines. The Taurus KEPD 350, with its 500 km range and enhanced penetration capabilities, would offer Ukraine additional capabilities to target critical infrastructure and strategic points in Russia, particularly in Crimea. Unlike the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG missiles, the Taurus is equipped with a dual-stage warhead specifically designed to destroy heavily fortified and deeply buried targets. Currently, the German armed forces have about 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, primarily used from Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, it is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming retirement of the Tornado raises questions about the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. The Eurofighter appears to be the most likely option, while integration on the F-35A, recently ordered by Germany, seems unlikely without a complete redesign of the missile to fit the internal bay of the American stealth fighter. In the longer term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo within the framework of the SCAF (Future Combat Air System) program, a next-generation fighter project developed in collaboration with France, Spain, and Belgium. The SCAF is expected to play a central role in modernizing European air capabilities in the coming decades. The development of the Taurus Neo could have considerable implications for European defense. As a long-range precision weapon, this missile could strengthen Germany's deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic options for the continent's collective defense. The modernization of the German armed forces is part of a broader effort to respond to new security threats exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and rising tensions with Russia. However, funding for the Taurus Neo project remains a major challenge for the German government. The 2025 budget will need to include the €350 million necessary to launch the development, and expenses in subsequent years could be affected by current budget constraints. Nonetheless, the support expressed by the government coalition suggests a favorable outcome for the project, despite potential debates in Parliament on the appropriateness of prioritizing such expenditures in a challenging economic context. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project comes just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at rapidly developing new, more advanced long-range strike weapons than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK's membership in the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), an initiative led by France and involving Germany, Poland, and Italy. ELSA aims to develop a missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 km by the 2030s. Although the integration of the Taurus Neo into these programs remains uncertain, the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe reflects an increasing awareness of the need to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities in the face of emerging threats. The Taurus Neo project could therefore fit into a broader dynamic aimed at bolstering collective security on the European continent while positioning Germany as a key player in the development of new defense technologies. The development of advanced cruise missiles, such as the Taurus KEPD 350, represents a critical strategic asset for Western armed forces, particularly in the context of modern conflicts where precision and long-range strike capabilities are crucial. For Ukraine, the use of missiles provided by its allies, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, has demonstrated the effectiveness of these weapons in striking deep behind enemy lines at strategic targets. These missiles allow for the neutralization of critical military infrastructure, such as ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical nodes, thereby disrupting adversary operations and weakening their support capabilities for frontline forces. The Taurus, with its extended 500 km range and reinforced penetration capability, would offer Ukraine increased ability to target strategic sites in Crimea or Russia, expanding the range and impact of Ukrainian operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-to-develop-next-gen-taurus-neo-cruise-missile-after-ukraine-war-lessons	2024-10-29T04:15:55-07:00

Russia Equips T-72B3M Tanks with Advanced Arena-M Active Protection System	According to information published by Uralvagonzavod on October 25, 2024, Russia has upgraded its T-72B3M main battle tanks with the Arena-M Active Protection System (APS). This move reflects a commitment to enhancing the tank's defensive capabilities amid an era of increasingly potent anti-tank weaponry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russia enhances the T-72B3M tank's battlefield resilience with the Arena-M Active Protection System, designed to intercept and neutralize incoming anti-tank missiles and RPGs, ensuring advanced defense in modern combat scenarios. (Picture source: Telegram account of Уралвагонзавод) The T-72B3M represents the latest iteration of the T-72 series, featuring substantial upgrades over its predecessors in terms of firepower, mobility, and protection. Key improvements to the T-72B3M include an upgraded fire control system, a 1,130 hp V-92S2F engine, and advanced sighting equipment. However, the inclusion of the Arena-M APS marks a particularly notable enhancement, aimed at safeguarding the tank and its crew against an array of anti-tank threats. The Arena-M is a Russian-designed active protection system created to intercept and destroy incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles and rockets, before they reach the tank. The system uses a radar array to detect and track incoming threats within a certain radius around the vehicle. Once a threat is detected, Arena-M calculates its trajectory, allowing the system to deploy countermeasures that neutralize the projectile at a safe distance. The APS is specifically designed to handle threats from multiple directions, enhancing protection against high-speed projectiles fired from modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) or rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). This added layer of defense significantly reduces the likelihood of armor penetration, thus improving the survivability of the T-72B3M on the battlefield. Russia’s choice to integrate the Arena-M system into the T-72B3M rather than reserving it exclusively for newer tanks like the T-90M and T-14 Armata underscores the continued relevance of the T-72 in modern warfare. With over 25,000 units produced since its inception in the 1970s, the T-72 has seen widespread deployment across various theaters and remains in service with numerous militaries worldwide. Upgrading these tanks with APS technology extends their operational lifespan, making them capable of countering threats posed by the latest anti-tank systems. The T-72B3M’s combination of affordability, ease of maintenance, and robust firepower makes it a versatile asset for large-scale military operations. The addition of the Arena-M APS, with its ability to repel contemporary anti-tank weaponry, ensures that the T-72B3M remains relevant in scenarios that demand both maneuverability and resilience. Russia’s decision to install the Arena-M system on its main battle tanks reflects a growing trend within the global military community toward equipping armored vehicles with active protection systems. As anti-tank weapon technology advances, the need for countermeasures has become increasingly critical. Arena-M’s effectiveness and the expanded protection it provides offer a glimpse into future armored warfare, where active defenses could be as crucial as the armor itself. While the current configuration of the T-72B3M with the Arena-M APS offers substantial protection, experts speculate that future variants could incorporate additional features, including modular reactive armor and more advanced electronic warfare countermeasures. Such enhancements would further augment the tank’s ability to operate in contested environments where electronic and cyber warfare elements are increasingly prevalent.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-equips-t-72b3m-tanks-with-advanced-arena-m-active-protection-system	2024-10-29T02:49:48-07:00	
Algeria reveals acquisition of Russian Iskander-E ballistic missile system	As reported by ORCA Military on October 28, 2024, the Russian Iskander-E short-range ballistic missile system has been seen for the first time in Algeria, ahead of the military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Algerian Revolution. This sighting confirms Algeria’s acquisition of the Iskander after years of speculation and marks the first time this missile system has appeared in the arsenal of an Arab country.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Algeria received four regiments of the Iskander-E between 2014 and 2017, comprising around 50 vehicles and 48 missiles per regiment, including 12 launchers, 12 transporter-loaders, 11 command vehicles, and various support vehicles. (Picture source: FChillali) The Iskander system, developed by Russia, has a range of up to 500 kilometers and can reach speeds of up to Mach 6. It is designed to strike targets such as command centers, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure. The system's mobile design and rapid-launch capability make it difficult to detect or intercept. The Iskander-E variant, in service with Algeria since 2018, is capable of carrying various types of non-nuclear warheads, including high-explosive fragmentation and penetrating warheads. This acquisition enhances Algeria's missile capabilities, adding significant range and versatility to its existing military equipment. Algeria's acquisition of the Iskander system is part of broader efforts to modernize its military forces, especially amid increasing tensions with Morocco. Diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco have been strained since Algeria cut ties in 2021, citing Morocco’s support for separatist movements in Kabylie and its backing of Western Sahara claims. Morocco, meanwhile, has received international backing for its autonomy plan for Western Sahara, further intensifying the rivalry. Both countries have engaged in an arms race, boosting their military capabilities while maintaining a tense but non-violent standoff. The militarization on both sides continues, although a full-scale conflict remains unlikely. In this context, the Iskander system plays a significant role in Algeria's military planning, particularly due to its capacity to target strategic locations in Morocco. The system’s longer range, compared to Morocco’s M142 HIMARS system, allows it to reach targets such as command centers and air defenses. Morocco's HIMARS system, which has a range of up to 300 kilometers using ATACMS missiles, is designed for rapid fire support and precision strikes on fortified positions and troop concentrations. While the HIMARS offers greater battlefield mobility, the Iskander system’s longer range and hypersonic capabilities provide Algeria with a broader set of strategic options. Algeria's defense budget has grown significantly in recent years, reaching $18.3 billion in 2023, largely due to increased revenues from gas exports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This funding has supported the procurement of military equipment, primarily from Russia and China, including the Iskander system. The growing military rivalry with Morocco has also been reflected in Algerian domestic politics, where anti-Moroccan rhetoric is frequently used in election campaigns to gain popular support. Despite occasional calls for dialogue, tensions between Algeria and Morocco remain high, and the ongoing arms buildup indicates that a resolution is unlikely in the near future. The Iskander system’s appearance in the upcoming military parade further signals Algeria’s intent to maintain and demonstrate its military capabilities in response to regional security concerns. As both countries continue to acquire advanced military technology, the potential for future conflict, while not imminent, remains a significant issue. Algeria’s acquisition of the Russian Iskander and Morocco’s procurement of the American HIMARS in 2023 highlights the continuing arms race in North Africa. The Iskander system, with its longer range and ability to strike strategic targets, complements Algeria's defense strategy, while Morocco’s HIMARS provides tactical flexibility on the battlefield. The presence of the Iskander system in Algeria's military forces underscores the ongoing competition for military superiority in the region, as both countries seek to reinforce their positions without engaging in direct conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/algeria-reveals-acquisition-of-russian-iskander-e-ballistic-missile-system	2024-10-29T02:30:19-07:00

The agreement also provides logistical support, with engineering teams from the U.S. government and partner companies facilitating integration and deployment. The Finnish Ministry of Defense stated that AARGM-ER systems would be delivered per the operational schedule for the Finnish Air Force's F-35A. The first deliveries are expected between 2026 and 2030, ensuring compatibility with Finland's introduction of the F-35. The Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile - Extended Range (AARGM-ER), AGM-88G, is an advanced air-to-ground missile developed by Northrop Grumman to target and neutralize enemy air defenses. Based on the AGM-88E AARGM model, AARGM-ER features an optimized airframe, a larger rocket motor, and advanced electronics, providing a significantly enhanced range and speed essential for countering modern long-range surface-to-air missile systems. AARGM-ER’s operational profile focuses on neutralizing radar-based threats through an enhanced guidance system. This system combines passive homing sensors to detect radar emissions with an active millimeter-wave radar for terminal guidance, enabling precise targeting even if enemy radars attempt shutdown to avoid detection. This dual guidance capability makes the missile particularly effective against mobile air defense systems, enhancing its ability in Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD/DEAD) missions. Designed to fit within the internal weapons bay of the F-35, the AARGM-ER offers compatibility with multiple platforms, including the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler. This adaptability allows for deployment across U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps fleets. Initial tests began in 2021, demonstrating AARGM-ER’s capability to engage both mobile and stationary targets over long distances. The missile is now in low-rate initial production, with operational fielding expected soon. This decision follows a recent U.S. authorization to sell up to 100 AARGM-ER missiles to the Royal Australian Air Force for its EA-18G Growler aircraft, reflecting growing interest from U.S. allies in this missile system to bolster their capabilities in suppressing enemy air defenses.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/finland-strengthens-f-35-fleet-with-acquisition-of-150-aargm-er-missiles-from-united-states	2024-10-29T02:24:52-07:00	
South Korea Moves Up Deployment of Its Iron Dome in Response to North Korean Threats	South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced on October 29, 2024, that it has approved a plan to advance the deployment schedule of the country's Low Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system by two years, setting its operational timeframe between 2029 and 2033. This decision, disclosed during a National Defense Ministry committee meeting, reflects South Korea’s response to rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula as North Korea intensifies its provocations, compelling Seoul to enhance protection against potential attacks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA (Picture source: Rafael) The LAMD system, launched in 2022 with development expected to continue through 2033, is designed to strengthen South Korea's air defense capabilities against artillery fire and missile threats from the North. Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA. This system comprises radar, an engagement control center, launchers, and interceptor missiles to mitigate the impact of long-range artillery strikes from North Korea. DAPA has also approved the second phase of upgrades to its Patriot defense system, including the acquisition of the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system. This advanced system employs more agile and precise hit-to-kill interceptors rather than fragmentation warheads, as in previous versions. The PAC-3 system supports up to sixteen missiles per launcher compared to four with PAC-2, offering increased range and improved radar and tracking capabilities. These defense systems will operate alongside existing assets, including Patriot systems and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system provided by the United States, which targets missiles in their terminal phase upon reentry. THAAD’s initial deployment in South Korea in 2017 prompted objections from China due to the system’s powerful radar, capable of monitoring regional military activities. In response, China imposed economic and cultural sanctions, including restrictions on group travel to South Korea, leading former President Moon Jae-in to pledge not to increase THAAD deployments on South Korean soil. Tensions have escalated further with recent provocations from North Korea, including debris-laden balloons launched towards Seoul as retaliation against propaganda balloons sent by South Korean activists. Seoul, located just 55 kilometers from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and vulnerable to artillery strikes, remains particularly concerned about the thousands of artillery systems stationed by North Korea near the border. In parallel, South Korea is progressing with the development of its Long-range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) system, designed to intercept missiles at altitudes of 50 to 60 kilometers. This component of the Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system integrates with the PAC-3 and Cheongung II, enabling a multi-layered defense against North Korean missile threats. In addition to air defense initiatives, the South Korean government has approved a significant update to the K2 Black Panther main battle tank project. To reduce reliance on foreign equipment, the next 150 K2 tanks for the South Korean army will be outfitted with domestically developed transmissions by SNT Dynamics, alongside locally manufactured engines. This transmission system will also be exported to Turkey for use in the Altay battle tanks. Since the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea has strengthened its position as a major supplier of military equipment, particularly to European nations where defense demand has significantly increased. By consolidating its capabilities and enhancing self-reliance in defense, South Korea aims to establish itself as a prominent player on the international military stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-moves-up-deployment-of-its-iron-dome-in-response-to-north-korean-threats	2024-10-29T02:16:55-07:00	
SWATT Training: Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group Advances Warfighting Capabilities	According to information published by the US DoD on October 23, 2024, the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRF CSG) is actively participating in the Surface Warfare Advanced Tactical Training (SWATT), an intense at-sea training program designed to enhance warfighting capabilities and tactical proficiency across multiple domains.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crew members on the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the largest aircraft carrier in the world, perform flight operations while navigating the Atlantic Ocean. (Picture source: DVIDS) Overseen by the Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), SWATT is a critical phase in preparing units for deployment, allowing for integration and real-time tactical development. The Gerald R. Ford CSG consists of a formidable array of assets, including the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81), USS Mitscher (DDG 57), USS Mahan (DDG 72), USS Bainbridge (DDG 96), and USS Forrest Sherman (DDG 98). These vessels are supported by the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8, which adds a critical aerial dimension to the group's operations. SWATT provides a diverse range of training scenarios, bringing together individual, team, and unit-level exercises designed to sharpen the warfighting capabilities of each component. It also includes integrated in-port, live virtual construct, and at-sea training evolutions, which build on the tactical knowledge and proficiency of each participant. The goal is to deliver multi-domain combatants ready for full-spectrum combat operations. Led by SMWDC, SWATT is the premier advanced tactical training exercise tailored for the surface fleet, pushing units to achieve new levels of tactical precision and adaptability. It aims to equip watch teams, individual units, and warfare commanders with cutting-edge strategies and skills for the complexities of modern naval warfare. CSG 12, as the immediate superior in command of USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 2, CVW 8, and the five guided-missile destroyers, plays a central role in overseeing this readiness. The Gerald R. Ford CSG’s strengths begin with its multi-layered defense network. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, a sophisticated platform that supports anti-air, anti-missile, and anti-submarine operations, creating a protective buffer around the carrier and the entire strike group. This layered defense approach is essential in countering diverse threats, including missile attacks, submarines, and aerial incursions, which enhances the security and survivability of the group in complex operational theaters. However, the CSG faces notable weaknesses, beginning with its significant logistical demands. Operating such a complex group requires extensive support in terms of fuel, supplies, and maintenance, and maintaining a CSG over extended deployments is resource-intensive. These logistical demands mean that the CSG’s operational endurance can be limited by access to supply lines, especially in remote or contested areas where consistent resupply may be challenging. Cost is another substantial factor. The Gerald R. Ford-class carrier is one of the most expensive warships ever built, with each destroyer and supporting vessel further adding to the operational budget. These costs extend to maintenance and upgrades, making the CSG a considerable investment that requires sustained funding. The high expense also raises strategic questions about the long-term sustainability of carrier-based power projection, particularly as other nations develop countermeasures designed to challenge traditional carrier strike group operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/swatt-training-gerald-r-ford-carrier-strike-group-advances-warfighting-capabilities	2024-10-29T01:47:03-07:00	
Taiwan Secures US Deal for 1,000 Attack Drones Amid Rising PLA Drills	Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense has recently formalized an agreement with the U.S. government to purchase 1,000 attack drones, marking a significant step in the island’s defense strategy amid rising concerns over a potential military threat from China. Bloomberg reported on October 29, 2024, that this agreement was solidified with the signing of a 'letter of offer and acceptance' at the end of September, which precedes the final contracts specifying exact quantities, financial terms, and delivery timelines. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US Army Exercise with a Switchblade Drone in July 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) While the final contracts have yet to be signed, they are expected to be formalized in the coming weeks, according to informed industry sources who remain anonymous due to the unannounced nature of the transaction. A U.S. Department of State spokesperson declined to comment on ongoing sales to Taiwan. Attack drones have become increasingly central in modern warfare. In Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have ramped up their use of drones for reconnaissance and attacks, underscoring their effectiveness in active combat scenarios. Unmanned aerial vehicles were also deployed in an Iranian attack on Israel in April, reinforcing these systems as critical elements in contemporary military operations. According to Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, Senior Director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, this type of acquisition by Taiwan demonstrates 'that both Taiwan and the United States are applying key lessons from the conflict in Ukraine and translating those lessons into future procurement decisions.' Montgomery, who has visited Taiwan to assess its defense needs, views this agreement as a strategic move for the island as it seeks greater self-sufficiency in its deterrence capabilities. In June, the U.S. Department of State had notified Congress of its approval for an advanced drone sale to Taiwanese authorities. This arrangement included 291 Anduril Altius 600M-V systems, valued at approximately $300 million, and 720 AeroVironment Switchblade 300 drones, 'B' model, with an estimated value of $60 million.

With its advanced stealth capabilities, the B-21 could penetrate sophisticated air defenses undetected, deliver precise strikes with conventional or nuclear munitions, and exit the area safely. For example, in a crisis scenario with an adversary possessing advanced anti-aircraft systems, the B-21 could be used to destroy radars or surface-to-air missile batteries, paving the way for other air forces to conduct offensive operations. In addition to its strategic strike capabilities, the B-21 Raider is designed to perform a wide range of conventional missions, such as supporting military operations in conflict zones, conducting air interdiction, and carrying out precision strikes on mobile targets. For instance, during an air campaign against an enemy force, the B-21 could be used to attack defensive positions, ammunition depots, or military convoys, thereby disrupting the adversary's logistical and operational capabilities. Its stealth allows it to penetrate deep into enemy territory and operate in contested environments, reducing the risk for pilots while maximizing the effectiveness of its strikes. Additionally, the B-21's flexibility enables it to be quickly reconfigured to accommodate various types of conventional missions, adapting its weaponry and sensors to specific field requirements. Warden revealed during an earnings call on October 24, 2024, that the Air Force is conducting a comprehensive review of its force structure, including the B-21 fleet. This review is part of a congressionally mandated effort to reassess the service's future capabilities and requirements. It also coincides with the Air Force's efforts to complete the NGAD program's requirements analysis, following a pause ordered by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall earlier this year. The NGAD program, aimed at developing a sixth-generation fighter to replace the F-22 Raptor, was paused before a decision was made between two competing designs. Kendall cited concerns over the program's cost, with initial estimates suggesting that each aircraft could cost several hundred million dollars. He has since indicated a preference for reducing the per-unit cost to a range closer to that of the F-35 fighter, between $80 million and $100 million. The cost difference, if achieved, could translate into savings of tens of billions of dollars across a planned fleet of 200 to 250 NGAD fighters. While the official stance of the Air Force has maintained that a fleet of 100 B-21 Raiders would meet current operational needs, there are growing voices within the defense community advocating for a larger fleet. The B-21 is designed to replace the aging B-2 Spirit and B-1 Lancer bombers, providing the U.S. military with a long-range stealth bomber capable of penetrating advanced air defenses. The platform is a cornerstone of the Air Force's future strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities. Northrop Grumman, the B-21's prime contractor, has stated that it is ready to increase production if the Air Force decides to expand the fleet. According to Warden, the decision on fleet size will likely become clearer in the coming months as the force structure review progresses. She emphasized that the performance and cost targets achieved during the B-21's initial production phase could influence the Air Force's decision. The cost of the B-21 has been a central issue in these discussions. The bomber's original unit cost was contractually set at $550 million in 2010, equivalent to approximately $780 million today. Despite this, Kendall informed Congress in April that B-21 production costs had remained below projections during low-rate initial production. However, the cost ceiling is expected to rise as production ramps up in later batches. Several senior officials and defense analysts have argued for increasing the B-21 fleet beyond the initial 100 units. Retired Colonel Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, has been outspoken about the need to increase the Air Force's bomber capacity to address emerging threats. He points out that the current bomber force is too small to meet the demands of a rapidly changing strategic environment, especially in deterring and potentially responding to simultaneous threats from peer adversaries like Russia and China. Gunzinger believes that the B-21 is particularly well-positioned to strengthen both conventional and nuclear deterrence due to its stealth capabilities, long range, and substantial payload capacity. He asserts that acquiring more B-21s at an accelerated pace would be the most cost-effective approach to strengthening the United States' power projection capabilities and operating in contested environments. Expanding the bomber fleet would provide a dual benefit by bolstering both conventional defense and strategic deterrence. Air Force General Anthony J. Cotton, head of U.S. Strategic Command, has also expressed support for increasing the number of B-21 bombers, emphasizing their importance in maintaining a credible deterrent posture. His views are echoed by other analysts, such as Christopher Bowie, who have suggested that 100 aircraft may not be sufficient for the U.S. to achieve its strategic goals, given that even the most advanced bomber can only be in one place at a time. One of the central questions in the ongoing review is whether potential savings from reducing the NGAD program could be redirected to fund additional B-21 bombers. The Air Force is attempting to balance the competing demands of modernizing its aging fleet while adhering to budget constraints. However, some experts, including Gunzinger, caution against viewing the NGAD and B-21 programs as interchangeable. This pause has opened the door for the B-21 to play a more significant role in the Air Force's future force structure. Northrop Grumman's willingness to increase production adds to the service's strategic flexibility as it navigates the challenges of modernizing its fleet under fiscal constraints. Warden indicated that the Air Force is expected to award a second low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract for the B-21 before the end of the year. The first LRIP contract was awarded following the bomber's first flight last year, although specifics regarding the number of aircraft covered under the agreement have not been disclosed. The outcome of the current force structure review and ongoing budget negotiations will likely influence future production rates and fleet size decisions. As the Air Force continues to assess its options, the B-21 remains a key element in the broader strategy to enhance U.S. airpower capabilities. Whether the service will ultimately expand its fleet of stealth bombers will depend on a variety of factors, including cost considerations, technological developments, and the evolving threat landscape. In the meantime, Northrop Grumman is positioning itself to respond quickly to increased demand, offering the U.S. government flexibility in shaping the future of its bomber force. The reconsideration of the B-21 fleet size underscores the dynamic nature of the U.S. Air Force's modernization strategy, driven by both strategic needs and budgetary realities. With the ongoing review of the NGAD program and discussions about expanding the bomber fleet, the Air Force is at a critical juncture. The decisions made in the coming months will shape the future of American airpower and its ability to deter adversaries and project power worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/northrop-grumman-announces-massive-expansion-in-b-21-raider-stealth-bomber-production-to-counter-china	2024-10-28T05:56:13-07:00

Taiwan Unveils Torpedo Launch Tube of Huilong Unmanned Underwater Vehicle	According to information published by TaiwanPlus on October 26, 2024, Taiwan revealed the torpedo launch tube of its domestically developed 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan reveals its 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle, equipped with dual torpedo launch tubes and surveillance capabilities. (Picture source: TaiwanPlus) Earlier, images of the propeller at the vehicle’s rear were also released. However, Taiwan's Defense Minister recently clarified over a lunch with the media that the Huilong platform is primarily intended for testing purposes, specifically for sonar and underwater mine systems, and does not feature an active propulsion system. Consequently, during sea trials, it is towed by support vessels rather than operating independently. The 'Huilong' project is a joint effort between Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Lung Teh Shipbuilding. The development officially commenced in 2020 under the 'Huilong Project,' aiming to establish a versatile, unmanned underwater test platform. According to reports, the vehicle displaces nearly 100 tons and has dimensions measuring approximately 30 meters in length, 3.6 meters in width, and 6 meters in height, including its command tower casing. This UUV resembles a compact submarine and is equipped with dual torpedo tubes. Notably, it is also reportedly designed to deploy small unmanned vehicles, potentially enhancing its capabilities in surveillance, target acquisition, and strike operations against enemy assets. One of the Huilong UUV’s primary roles could be to extend Taiwan’s underwater monitoring capabilities. Equipped with sophisticated sonar, the UUV can detect and track adversary submarines and other vessels operating in the waters around Taiwan. This would be particularly advantageous in tracking potential incursions by Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) submarines, enabling early detection and providing intelligence on the movements of hostile forces. Given the importance of information superiority in modern conflicts, the Huilong’s ability to conduct real-time, covert reconnaissance could significantly enhance Taiwan’s situational awareness. Taiwan’s fleet of submarines is relatively small and would be vulnerable in the event of a conflict. However, integrating UUVs like the Huilong could serve as a force multiplier. Deployed alongside or in support of manned submarines, these UUVs could take on high-risk reconnaissance or even offensive roles, allowing manned vessels to operate with less exposure to detection or attack. In any conflict scenario with a larger naval power like China, Taiwan’s strategy would likely rely on asymmetric tactics. UUVs offer a cost-effective means to deploy a range of weapons or carry out sabotage missions against high-value enemy assets, like aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-unveils-torpedo-launch-tube-of-huilong-unmanned-underwater-vehicle	2024-10-28T04:51:34-07:00

Exclusive: Discover Ukraine's Sky Dragon Devastating Drone-Dropped Incendiary Thermite Weapon Against Russia	Recently, Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, shared a detailed graphic on his X account explaining Sky Dragon, a new Ukrainian weapon system using multi-rotor drones to deploy thermite incendiary devices against Russian forces. This approach, which involves bundling thermite grenades and dropping them over Russian-occupied tree lines, has proven highly effective. By leveraging drones for precise delivery, the Sky Dragon system enables Ukrainian forces to target fortified Russian positions in difficult-to-reach areas, especially in densely forested terrain, causing significant damage to enemy equipment and personnel.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An aerial view captures the devastating impact of Ukraine's Sky Dragon incendiary thermite weapon as a drone drops the fiery payload onto its target. The intense white-hot thermite reaction engulfs the area in flames, melting through metal and creating thick smoke plumes, showcasing this drone-deployed weapon's destructive power in the ongoing conflict. (Picture source: Social network and X account Chuck Pfarrer) The use of incendiary thermite weapons in Ukraine has been reported during the ongoing conflict, with instances of classic incendiary munitions being employed by both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Thermite is used primarily to destroy equipment, fortifications, or infrastructure due to its ability to generate extremely high temperatures, melt metal, and start fires. The first publicized reports of thermite being used in Ukraine emerged in 2014, during the initial stages of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, when Russian-backed separatists were accused of using incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to target Ukrainian military positions. Recently, there have been renewed reports of thermite weapons being used in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, particularly in the context of intense battles in eastern Ukraine. These reports suggest that both sides may be employing incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to destroy military equipment, fortifications, and infrastructure. In late 2022 and throughout 2023, videos and eyewitness accounts surfaced showing the use of incendiary shells, which may contain thermite, in areas like Bakhmut and Mariupol, where fierce urban fighting took place. Sky Dragon uses commercially available multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, to carry bundles of thermite grenades and drop them over enemy positions. Thermite, a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxides, burns at extremely high temperatures when ignited, making it ideal for destroying military equipment, bunkers, and fortifications. The drones deliver these thermite devices in a precise and targeted manner, allowing Ukrainian forces to strike deep within Russian-controlled zones, including fortified positions concealed under tree canopies and within dug-in trenches. The Sky Dragon system operates through a combination of advanced drone technology and destructive incendiary devices. It uses multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, which are capable of carrying heavy payloads and modified for military use. These drones fly over Russian positions, allowing for the precise delivery of their incendiary payloads. The core of the system consists of bundled thermite grenades strapped together with metal bands. These grenades are equipped with a Nonel instantaneous fuse system, commonly used in demolition, ensuring that all grenades ignite simultaneously once they reach the target. This synchronization maximizes the thermite's destructive power. To protect the drone from the extreme heat generated by the thermite, a heat shield is employed along with a tow line that holds the grenades at a safe distance during flight. Once released, the grenades ignite mid-air, raining down molten thermite on the target, making it nearly impossible for enemy infantry or equipment to withstand the intense heat, which can exceed 2,000°C. Sky Dragon is proving to be highly effective against entrenched Russian positions, especially in forested areas. Traditional artillery and mortar systems struggle to penetrate tree lines where Russian forces are often dug in. However, drones can navigate these complex environments, hovering over specific positions and deploying incendiary grenades with pinpoint accuracy. When ignited, thermite creates temperatures exceeding 2,000°C (3,600°F), capable of burning through metal and concrete, making it particularly useful for destroying ammunition depots, bunkers, armored vehicles, and other critical military infrastructure. Graphic by Chuck Pfarrer illustrating Ukraine's Sky Dragon, a drone-deployed incendiary thermite weapon used to target Russian forces. (Picture source X account Chuck Pfarrer ) Additionally, the drones are difficult to detect and intercept due to their small size and low altitude. This makes them ideal tools for engaging targets in areas where Russian air defense systems are concentrated, as drones can maneuver around obstacles and deliver their payloads without risking large aircraft or manned vehicles. The introduction of Sky Dragon highlights Ukraine's ability to adapt to the realities of modern warfare, leveraging low-cost commercial drones in innovative ways to inflict significant damage on Russian forces. The use of incendiary devices like thermite further underscores Ukraine's intent to target key Russian positions where traditional weapons might fail or struggle to reach. As the conflict drags on, the emergence of these new tactics could force Russian troops to adapt their defensive strategies, potentially making their positions more vulnerable to other forms of attack. Sky Dragon adds yet another dimension to the drone warfare that has come to define much of the conflict, where both sides increasingly rely on unmanned systems to deliver destructive payloads with minimal risk to personnel. Sky Dragon represents a significant development in Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities, offering a cost-effective and highly destructive solution to the challenge of entrenched Russian forces. As the war continues, innovations like Sky Dragon will likely play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics on the battlefield, demonstrating how modern technology and creative problem-solving can shift the balance of power in asymmetrical warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-discover-ukraines-sky-dragon-devastating-drone-deployed-incendiary-thermite-weapon-against-russia	2024-10-28T03:41:16-07:00

Preparatory work led to the development and testing of an innovative communication system capable of effectively linking the various aircraft involved in joint missions. The tests were carried out in several phases, first separately and then simultaneously, with operations conducted from the DGA-EM site on Île du Levant and another base in southern Italy. For the French side, the tests involved an H130 helicopter equipped with specific sensors, paired with a VSR700 drone developed by Airbus Helicopters. In Italy, the trials used a helicopter from Leonardo, paired with an SW-4 Solo, a hybrid aircraft that can be piloted or operated autonomously via a drone interface. Both test sites and the aircraft were interconnected via satellite, ensuring real-time communication and the ability to control drones over long distances. The flight demonstration on October 9, 2024, was a highlight of the project, marking a decisive step for interoperability. In the presence of a European Commission representative, the tests showed that interaction levels between helicopters and drones could be progressively increased. This culminated in an impressive demonstration where a drone operated from one country was controlled by a helicopter located 1,000 kilometers away, thus proving the feasibility of joint operations within the European Union. These successful tests anticipate new capabilities for future-generation helicopters, particularly the upgraded Guépard and Tiger models, which will be equipped to cooperate with drones in future military missions.

Indonesia Navy Expels Chinese Coast Guard Ship from North Natuna Sea	According to information published by the Indonesian government on October 25, 2024, Indonesia’s Maritime Security Agency, Bakamla RI, successfully detected and expelled a Chinese Coast Guard vessel, CCG 5402, from the North Natuna Sea. This vessel had been interfering with seismic survey activities led by PT Pertamina East Natuna, a state-owned oil and gas company, which was conducting 3D seismic data processing using the survey vessel MV Geo Coral.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Indonesian Coast Guard Tanjung Datu-class patrol vessel KN Tanjung Datu, the Chinese Coast Guard OPV 5402 and the Indonesian Navy Kapitan Patimura-class corvette. (Picture source: Indonesian government) The incident unfolded when Bakamla RI’s Command and Control Center (Puskodal) received intelligence that CCG 5402 was obstructing MV Geo Coral’s survey, which was being escorted by three chase vessels—UB Anugerah Bersama 17, AHT PSB Roller, and TB Teluk Bajau Victory. These activities were taking place within the operational area of PT Pertamina East Natuna, which is situated on Indonesia's continental shelf in the North Natuna Sea. Following this alert, Bakamla dispatched the Indonesian State Vessel (KN) Tanjung Datu-301 to the location. Upon arrival, KN Tanjung Datu-301 detected the Chinese vessel CCG 5402 at 5:30 a.m. WIB, positioned at a 125° bearing and approximately 7.3 nautical miles away. Despite efforts to establish communication via radio, CCG 5402 asserted that the area fell under Chinese jurisdiction, a claim that Indonesia firmly disputes. Shortly after, at around 5:38 a.m., Bakamla RI received reinforcement from the Indonesian Navy’s (TNI AL) patrol vessel KRI Sutedi Senaputera 378 and a maritime patrol aircraft. Together, these Indonesian patrol forces shadowed the Chinese vessel, ultimately succeeding in expelling CCG 5402 from Indonesia’s jurisdictional waters in the North Natuna Sea. China’s Foreign Ministry responded to the situation in a routine press conference on Thursday, stating that Chinese coast guard vessels were patrolling 'waters under China’s jurisdiction' according to both international and domestic laws. The ministry expressed its willingness to negotiate with Indonesia to resolve maritime issues between the two countries. Although Indonesia is not involved in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, China’s 'Nine-Dash Line' claim overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Natuna Islands. Chinese coast guard vessels have entered Indonesia’s Natuna Sea in recent years. However, it is noteworthy that these two recent incidents occurred within a week of Prabowo taking office. China has consistently expressed interest in collaborating with Indonesia to develop the North Natuna Sea, so these actions may be a way to test the new administration’s stance on potential cooperation. The Chinese coast guard entered Indonesia’s EEZ in the Natuna Sea immediately after Prabowo’s inauguration and his meeting with China’s Vice President Han Zheng, which could be seen as an unwelcome 'gift' for Prabowo.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indonesia-navy-expels-chinese-coast-guard-ship-from-north-natuna-sea	2024-10-28T03:33:22-07:00

The system would complement existing defenses such as the Iron Dome by providing a solution capable of destroying aerial threats like drones and missiles at a lower operational cost than traditional interceptor systems. This approach is vital in the face of Iran's evolving military capabilities, which include the development of armed drones and precision missiles, often deployed through proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and other Iran-supported militant groups in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/elbit-systems-secures-contract-for-israels-iron-beam-lasers-amid-growing-drone-and-missile-threats	2024-10-28T03:09:04-07:00

(Picture source: Dvids) The Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX-1) remains a cornerstone of the U.S. ballistic missile defense strategy due to its unprecedented ability to detect and assess threats from vast distances, making it a powerful mobile asset for tracking and intercepting missile threats. Positioned on a self-propelled, semi-submersible oil platform, this radar provides coverage that can be quickly adapted to varying geopolitical hotspots across the Pacific, a region where missile threats from countries like North Korea, China, and Russia are a growing concern​. The SBX-1’s high-precision X-band radar, encased within a massive radome, has approximately 45,000 transmit/receive modules, allowing it to detect and discriminate between missiles, decoys, and debris. It can track objects as small as a baseball from up to 2,500 miles away, feeding critical data back to ground-based interceptors for midcourse corrections. This data transmission occurs through the In-Flight Interceptor Communications System Data Terminal onboard, which enables real-time adjustments for interceptors and heightens the radar’s utility in ballistic missile defense​. Operational since 2006, SBX-1 has been deployed extensively in the Pacific, often supporting defense readiness against North Korean missile tests and other emergent threats. However, recent deployments have highlighted both its strengths and limitations. While it offers exceptional tracking precision, its relatively narrow field of view poses challenges when responding to complex scenarios involving multiple missiles or advanced countermeasures such as decoys. In response, the SBX-1 has undergone upgrades and maintenance in Hawaii, addressing structural issues from its extensive 662-day deployment and enhancing its ability to support intercepts under higher demand from the U.S. Space Command and Space Force​. The SBX program has sometimes drawn criticism for its high operational costs, which stem from its maintenance-intensive mobile platform and the need for frequent crew rotations. Nonetheless, the radar’s mobility and ability to adjust to the Earth's curvature give it a distinct advantage over land-based radars, enabling tracking over oceanic expanses and the flexibility to relocate in response to shifting threat landscapes. These advantages remain critical as missile defense analysts underscore the necessity of monitoring emerging hypersonic threats, which can travel at extreme speeds and low altitudes, evading traditional missile defense systems​. Looking ahead, discussions around the SBX's future are ongoing, with considerations about whether additional units or complementary systems are required. Space-based sensors are also under evaluation as potential support for a more diversified missile defense network.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/raytheon-awarded-contract-to-maintain-us-navy-sea-based-x-band-radar	2024-10-28T02:52:00-07:00
