Despite the acquisition of numerous assets, including M1A2 Abrams tanks, F-35A fighters, and HIMARS artillery systems, the absence of heavy transport helicopters remains a notable gap. The urgency of this need became apparent during relief operations following last month’s storm 'Boris,' which caused widespread flooding in Poland. These events highlighted the necessity for helicopters capable of carrying larger numbers of people, supplies, and heavy materials required to temporarily repair damaged flood defenses. While the Polish Navy has already acquired four AW-101 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare missions, which also belong to the heavy transport category, Kosiniak-Kamysz mentioned the potential purchase of the CH-47F Chinook, an American-made model by Boeing. Already in service with several NATO members, this helicopter's interoperability could be a decisive factor in Poland’s choice. Germany, for instance, cited this reason when it decided in 2022 to purchase 60 of these helicopters. The CH-47F Chinook is a heavy transport helicopter designed to carry substantial loads under varied conditions. Equipped with two Honeywell T55-GA-714A engines, each providing 4,777 shp, it can reach a maximum speed of 315 km/h and carry over 9,500 kg of payload. Its cargo area spans 42m³, allowing for the transportation of up to 50 troops or two HMMWVs. The cabin can also be configured for medical evacuation, accommodating 24 stretchers. The Chinook’s triple-hook system enables the external transport of heavy loads, making it essential for complex logistical missions.

Its advanced avionics include the Rockwell Collins Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) and BAE Systems' Digital Advanced Flight Control System (DAFCS), enhancing navigation and communication capabilities. Combined with a reinforced structure, these systems allow the Chinook to operate in challenging environments while minimizing maintenance requirements. Another option for Poland could be the CH-53K King Stallion, offered by Sikorsky, a subsidiary of Lockheed-Martin. However, the Chinook seems to have an advantage due to its integration within NATO forces and defense cooperation agreements. The number of helicopters Poland plans to acquire has not yet been disclosed, but this information is expected once the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DCSA), the U.S. body responsible for military equipment exports, delivers its opinion on the potential purchase.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/poland-considers-acquisition-of-ch-47f-chinook-heavy-transport-helicopters-to-address-logistical-gaps	2024-10-21T02:30:02-07:00	
US approves sale of Rolling Airframe Missiles to Japan for enhanced defense	According to information published by the US Gov on October 18, 2024, the US State Department has approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Japan, which could see the transfer of up to 212 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Block 2B Tactical Missiles, alongside related equipment, for an estimated value of $360 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS New Orleans (LPD-18) fires a RIM-116 missile from its RAM launcher during a live-fire exercise off the coast of California. (Picture source: Dvids) The sale includes the advanced RIM-116E RAM Block 2B, known for its enhanced area defense capabilities, designed to protect key maritime and coastal regions from incoming missile threats. This package also comprises supporting elements, including RAM Guided Missile Round Packs, specialized shipping containers, training gear, technical manuals, and logistical support. Notably, the sale will also aid in establishing an Intermediate Level Maintenance Facility (ILMF) in Japan to support these systems. Technical comments The RAM Block 2B missile system that Japan is acquiring brings a highly adaptable and advanced defensive capability to its maritime forces. Designed to counter sophisticated threats, the RAM Block 2B employs an enhanced dual-mode seeker using both passive radio frequency and infrared guidance. This enables it to track and engage advanced anti-ship missiles, even those that utilize countermeasures like radar jamming or infrared decoys. The improved guidance system allows the missile to operate in complex electronic warfare environments, increasing the likelihood of successful target interception. In terms of its kinetic performance, the RAM Block 2B is a supersonic missile, reaching speeds in excess of Mach 2. Its high maneuverability and speed allow it to engage agile sea-skimming missiles, which are designed to evade radar by flying at very low altitudes. This capability is critical as Japan faces growing concerns over China’s deployment of highly advanced anti-ship missiles such as the YJ-12, which poses a significant threat to its naval forces. The RAM’s ability to counter these fast-moving threats at close range offers a crucial layer of defense in high-risk zones like the East China Sea. Technologically, one of the key advancements of the Block 2B variant is its missile-to-missile link, which allows missiles launched in salvo to coordinate and share targeting information in real-time. This system optimizes the defense against complex and simultaneous missile raids by improving engagement efficiency. It is particularly important when dealing with saturation tactics, where a large number of incoming missiles can overwhelm traditional defense systems. Japan’s decision to integrate RAM Block 2B into its naval platforms reflects a broader strategic goal of building a multi-layered defense system. The missile’s modular design allows it to be installed on a variety of ships, from smaller patrol vessels to larger Aegis-equipped destroyers, enhancing the defensive network across Japan’s fleet. By providing close-in defense capabilities, RAM Block 2B complements longer-range systems, creating a more robust defense architecture. This adaptability is crucial for Japan, as it seeks to defend its maritime territory against increasingly sophisticated and fast-evolving missile threats from regional actors like China and North Korea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-approves-sale-of-rolling-airframe-missiles-to-japan-for-enhanced-defense	2024-10-21T01:51:15-07:00	
US Says THAAD Anti-Missile System is Now in Place in Israel	On October 21, 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Ukraine that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system was now in place, though he did not confirm if it was fully operational. This system was deployed to Israel on September 25, 2024, in response to recent escalations between Israel and Iran. The deployment followed Iran’s launch of approximately 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel earlier in October, an event seen as retaliation for Israeli strikes on Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon and the death of a Hamas leader in Tehran. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The US military deploys a THAAD missile defense system in Israel, in March 2019 (Picture source: US DoD) The THAAD system, a key component of the U.S. military's layered air defense network, has now been positioned in Israel to enhance the country’s already strong missile defense capabilities. According to Austin, the system is 'in place' and can be quickly made operational, though specific details on its current readiness were not provided. THAAD adds an important layer to Israel’s defense system, complementing existing systems like the Patriot by covering larger areas and intercepting threats at ranges of up to 200 kilometers. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile system is designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of up to 150 km and ranges between 150 and 200 km. It is a transportable ground-based system equipped with eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 radar for target detection, and a control and communication center to manage operations. THAAD uses hit-to-kill technology, where the missile's kinetic energy neutralizes incoming warheads either within or outside the atmosphere. Developed by Lockheed Martin, THAAD was first deployed in 2008. Several U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and more recently Germany and Japan, have acquired or integrated THAAD into their air defense systems. With its high mobility and ability to intercept at high altitudes, THAAD plays a critical role in protecting military forces, infrastructure, and civilian populations from ballistic missile threats. Israeli sources indicate that the system is already operational, with up to three batteries in use. These reports come amid rising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation, which could prompt an Israeli military response. While the scope of future Israeli strikes remains unclear, Austin emphasized the importance of de-escalating tensions while continuing to meet Israel’s defense needs. He also noted that the U.S. is diplomatically working to reduce tensions between Iran and Israel, though any military actions would ultimately be Israel’s decision. US Air Force shows a US Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense at Fort Bliss, Texas, on Feb. 23, 2019 (Picture source: US DoD) The Pentagon had previously confirmed the arrival of an advance team and essential components needed to operate the THAAD system in Israel, with additional personnel and equipment arriving in the days following. This deployment involves approximately 100 U.S. personnel, putting American forces on the ground in Israel and deepening U.S. involvement in the region. The deployment of THAAD signals a significant shift as the U.S. moves from a supportive role to a more active defense posture, potentially placing American forces at greater risk should hostilities intensify. Developed in the 1990s and operational since 2008, this missile defense system includes truck-mounted launchers, radar systems, and fire control components. Each battery consists of six launchers, each equipped with eight interceptors. THAAD is specifically designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at high altitudes, providing a critical defense layer against Iranian missile threats. The deployment of THAAD to Israel demonstrates the continued U.S. commitment to Israel’s defense, particularly in light of the growing missile threats from Iran. The Pentagon has confirmed that the THAAD system will soon be fully operational and capable of defending Israeli airspace. Despite the complexity of the situation, the U.S. continues to prioritize diplomatic efforts aimed at reducing tensions while maintaining a robust defense posture in the region. This development also coincides with a warning from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Israeli officials, urging them to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The U.S. has made clear that continued military support will depend on significant efforts to address the humanitarian crisis, and Israel has since facilitated the entry of aid trucks into Gaza.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-says-thaad-anti-missile-system-is-now-in-place-in-israel	2024-10-21T01:49:05-07:00	
Chinese DF-31AG Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Launched from Hainan Island	On September 25, 2024, China's Ministry of National Defense announced that the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) had conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the South Pacific. This exercise, described as part of China's annual training plan, drew attention due to its unusual launch site: Hainan Island. The missile, a DF-31AG, traveled an estimated 11,700 km before landing in the Pacific, marking the first time since 1980 that China has targeted this area during an ICBM test. The last such event involved a DF-5 missile launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An image of the DF-31AG launch was released by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on September 25, 2024 (Picture source: PLA) The launch has sparked discussions regarding China’s nuclear posture and its advancing military modernization. Navigation warnings and trajectory calculations quickly identified that the missile had been fired from northeast Hainan Island, a location not typically used for ICBM launches and lacking a permanent ICBM brigade. This unusual choice suggests that China used a mobile launcher for the test, likely a DF-31AG, as confirmed by images released shortly after the event. The DF-31AG is a modernized version of the DF-31, China’s first solid-fuel ICBM, introduced in 2017 to replace earlier models. The DF-31AG is mounted on an eight-axle mobile transporter, which offers improved maneuverability and requires less logistical support than previous versions. The Dong Feng 31 (DF-31), also known as CSS-9 according to NATO classification, is a mobile, long-range ICBM developed by China. This three-stage missile, powered by solid fuel, was designed in the 1980s as a successor to the DF-4. First unveiled during China's National Day Parade in 1999, the DF-31 is housed in a large container mounted on an eight-wheeled trailer, providing significant operational flexibility. With an estimated range of 8,000 to 11,700 kilometers, it can strike targets across much of the continental United States, giving China a second-strike nuclear capability that is difficult to counter. The missile's accuracy is estimated at around 150 meters for mobile launches and 100 meters for silo-based launches. The DF-31 can carry a single 1-megaton nuclear warhead or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), capable of delivering three to four warheads with yields ranging from 20 to 150 kilotons. It uses an inertial navigation system coupled with stellar and GPS updates to improve precision. In terms of mobility, the missile is transported on HY4430 trailers towed by off-road trucks designed to operate in rugged conditions. The DF-31 remains a central component of China's nuclear deterrent, offering rapid strike capabilities and an extended range, making it difficult to neutralize. An image of the DF-31AG missile driving on Hainan Island shortly after the launch (Picture source: X Channel @Resonant_News) The DF-31AG used a cold-launch method, where the missile is ejected from its canister using compressed gas before its engine ignites. This method makes it more challenging to geolocate the exact launch site, as there are no burn marks left on the ground. This test is significant for China, which has not conducted an ICBM test in the Pacific for over four decades, typically opting for high-apogee tests within its own borders. The missile was likely transported from the Shaoyang brigade, about 800 km from Hainan, via rail and sea before being driven to the final launch site. Analysis of images and videos identified a probable launch area near Wenchang, on Hainan Island, which appears to be part of a newly developed military training zone, reinforcing the strategic importance of this location for future observations. The decision to launch an ICBM from Hainan could serve multiple purposes, such as allowing a full-range test without debris fallout or overflight of other countries. This test may also be part of a broader PLARF strategy to restore credibility following internal issues such as corruption scandals and leadership changes. Furthermore, by conducting this test as part of a military drill rather than a technological development program, China may be aiming to demonstrate combat readiness while reinforcing its status as a global nuclear power. The Pentagon confirmed it had received prior notice of the launch, which could set a precedent for future risk-reduction communications. It remains to be seen whether China will continue conducting such tests outside its borders and whether it will maintain this policy of pre-launch notifications to relevant states.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/chinese-df-31ag-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-launched-from-hainan-island	2024-10-21T00:51:27-07:00

RTX Coordinates Autonomous UAV Airstrike During US Army's EDGE24 Exercise	On October 14, 2024, three uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) from RTX scanned miles of rugged terrain to identify potential threats during the U.S. Army’s EDGE24 military exercise. The drones detected and assessed risks using RF signals, recording their positions. Within seconds, this information was relayed to a command center, which then deployed additional UAVs to confirm the targets and simulate a strike. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link While UAVs are already used for reconnaissance and strike missions, this demonstration showed that they can now operate with minimal human intervention, relying on autonomy to make real-time decisions (Picture source: US Army) This demonstration, conducted as part of the U.S. Army's EDGE24 exercise in Yuma, Arizona, marked a significant step for RTX. Teams from Collins Aerospace and Raytheon, both divisions of RTX, completed a flight mission that had previously been tested only in simulations. While UAVs are already used for reconnaissance and strike missions, this demonstration showed that they can now operate with minimal human intervention, relying on autonomy to make real-time decisions. Two key RTX technologies were employed in this test: Collins Aerospace's RapidEdge mission system and Raytheon’s CODE autonomy. Rather than following precise commands or preplanned routes, the UAVs were assigned a broad objective. They communicated with one another to strategize and adapt to obstacles encountered during the mission. Even when the communication link between the drones and the ground station was severed, simulating a communication-denied environment, the UAVs continued to execute the mission autonomously. They also coordinated their actions with Raytheon’s Coyote Block 3 system, demonstrating the technology's capability in realistic and challenging conditions. Bernd Knox, Collins’ business development lead, highlighted the system’s ability to quickly and effectively distribute critical data to both Raytheon’s team and the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team. He emphasized the importance of timely information sharing to leverage the system’s capabilities fully. This exercise supports the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift initiative, with Peter Laird noting that autonomous behavior adds complexity that can only be fully validated in real flight conditions (Picture source: US Army) The EDGE24 event, also known as the Experimentation Demonstration Gateway Event, tested emerging launched effects technologies and their integration with other systems on a simulated battlefield. This exercise supports the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift initiative, which seeks to modernize its rotorcraft fleet. Peter Laird, Collins’ program manager for autonomy and launched effects, pointed out the complexity added by autonomous behavior, which can only truly be validated in real flight conditions, despite the inherent challenge of flying the UAVs themselves. The demonstration also showcased the speed and agility of Collins’ RapidEdge team. They developed the system used in the EDGE24 exercise in just five months, using advanced prototyping, integration, and simulation techniques. These simulations can execute entire missions in seconds, while hardware-in-the-loop testing combines simulation data with real flight equipment to fine-tune performance before the final real-world test.

Although the systems demonstrated at EDGE24 are still in development, the team plans to build on this experience to refine and enhance the technology for future deployments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/rtx-coordinates-autonomous-uav-airstrike-during-us-armys-edge24-exercise	2024-10-21T00:08:34-07:00	
North Korean Hwasong-9 Ballistic Missiles Reportedly Used By Russia To Target Ukraine	Credible reports have emerged indicating that North Korea’s Hwasong-9 medium-range ballistic missiles have been deployed against Ukrainian targets. According to an update shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six leader and renowned military analyst, these North Korean missiles have been used on Ukrainian territory since November of last year.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hwasong-9 is a medium-range ballistic missile developed by North Korea based on the Hwasong-6 (Scud-C) design. It is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile capable of striking targets up to 500-700 kilometers away . (Picture source: MDAA website) Pfarrer's report highlights the potential deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, with North Korea's provision of strategic missile support representing a notable escalation. North Korea's Hwasong-9 missiles are a critical component of its ballistic missile arsenal, developed indigenously from the earlier Hwasong-6, which is itself a variant of the Soviet-era Scud-C missile. The Hwasong-9 is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile (SSM) capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. It was designed to improve on the Hwasong-6, which North Korea has had in its inventory for several decades. The Hwasong-9 has an estimated range of around 500-700 kilometers, allowing it to strike targets within short to medium distances. The missile's mobility and versatility are key attributes, as it is mounted on a transport erector launcher (TEL), allowing for rapid repositioning and surprise launches. This development demonstrates North Korea’s long-standing strategy of adapting foreign technology, like the Scud-C, to suit its own military needs and ambitions. It also raises significant concerns about the ongoing transfer of military technologies between countries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. North Korea has played a significant role in supplying munitions for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, reportedly providing about half of the large-caliber ammunition used on the battlefield in 2024. Ukrainian sources indicate that over 2 million rounds of ammunition were supplied, alongside KN-23 ballistic missiles, which were utilized in dozens of strikes across Ukraine during the winter of 2023-2024. In May 2024, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed through debris analysis that Russia was indeed deploying North Korean missiles, following a summit between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin in September 2023. The deployment of the Hwasong-9 against Ukraine marks the first clear instance of North Korea’s military involvement in the conflict. The specific targets struck by these missiles remain unclear, but such an involvement suggests a growing alignment between Russia and North Korea, particularly in military terms. This alliance has been developing since the start of the war, with Russia reportedly seeking North Korean arms and ammunition to bolster its military supplies, strained by more than a year and a half of intense fighting in Ukraine. For Ukraine, the addition of a new type of ballistic missile to the conflict adds another layer of complexity to its defense strategy. Ukraine has largely relied on air defense systems provided by Western allies to intercept Russian missile strikes. However, the inclusion of North Korean systems, such as the Hwasong-9, will likely force Ukraine to adapt further, as it is unfamiliar with North Korean missile technology.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korean-hwasong-9-ballistic-missiles-reportedly-used-by-russia-to-target-ukraine	2024-10-20T11:34:40-07:00

Breaking News: North Korean Soldiers in Russia Receive Russian Gear for Future Deployment in Ukraine	Recent video reports have emerged suggesting that North Korea has deployed thousands of soldiers to Russia's Far East, potentially preparing them for involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Videos circulating on social media and messaging platforms purportedly show North Korean soldiers being equipped with Russian military gear and training alongside Russian forces. One such video, published on Telegram, has been geolocated to the garrison of the 127th Motor Rifle Division in Sergeevka, approximately 130 kilometers north of Vladivostok. The footage appears to depict North Korean troops engaging in training exercises, fueling speculation about their potential deployment to Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korean soldiers in Russia are seen receiving Russian individual military gear, reportedly in preparation for future deployment in Ukraine. (Picture source: Telegram Video) According to South Korean intelligence sources cited by Yonhap News Agency, an estimated 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including special forces units, are currently in Russia. These troops have reportedly formed four combat brigades and are undergoing intensive training in Eastern Russia. The training is said to encompass a range of combat skills suited for the conflict in Ukraine, including urban warfare tactics, reconnaissance operations, and the handling of Russian military equipment. The soldiers are reportedly acclimating to the operational environment they might face in Ukraine, including familiarization with the terrain and climate conditions. North Korea maintains one of the world's largest standing armies. The Korean People's Army (KPA) is estimated to have approximately 1.2 million active-duty personnel as of 2023. This sizable force is complemented by a reserve component that could bring the total number of military personnel to over 6 million, including paramilitary organizations and reserves. The KPA comprises ground forces, navy, air force, strategic rocket forces, and special operations forces. The ground forces alone account for most active-duty personnel, with around 950,000 soldiers. North Korea's military strategy emphasizes large numbers of infantry and artillery units, fortified defenses, and the capability to conduct asymmetric warfare. Military analysts note that North Korean troops are known for their rigorous training and discipline. Their potential involvement could bring a new dimension to the conflict, given their experience in asymmetric warfare and special operations. Including special forces units suggests an emphasis on operations requiring specialized skills, such as sabotage, infiltration, and close-quarters combat. Deploying 12,000 troops represents a fraction of North Korea's military manpower but could have strategic implications depending on their roles and integration with Russian forces. The international community has expressed concern over these developments. South Korean officials have highlighted the potential destabilizing effects on regional security. 'We are closely monitoring the situation,' a spokesperson for South Korea's Ministry of National Defense stated. 'The deployment of North Korean troops abroad, especially in a conflict zone, is a serious matter.' The United States and European nations have also reacted cautiously. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department commented, 'Any involvement of North Korean forces in the Ukraine conflict would be deeply concerning and would represent a significant escalation.' If the reports are accurate, the deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia could have significant implications. The addition of North Korean troops could bolster Russian capabilities in Ukraine, potentially impacting the balance of power on the ground. This move could also signify a deepening alliance between Russia, North Korea, and potentially other nations, complicating diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict. The international community may need to reassess security strategies in light of new alliances that are forming that challenge existing geopolitical norms. Despite the circulating reports, there has been no official confirmation from Russian or North Korean authorities regarding the presence or intended deployment of North Korean soldiers. Experts urge caution in interpreting these reports without verified information. 'While these reports are alarming, it's important to approach them with a critical eye,' said Dr. Emily Carter, a senior analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'We need concrete evidence before drawing conclusions about North Korea's involvement.' As the situation develops, the international community watches closely for further evidence and official statements. The potential involvement of North Korean forces in Ukraine adds a complex layer to the conflict, with far-reaching implications for international relations and global security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-north-korean-soldiers-in-russia-receive-russian-gear-for-future-deployment-in-ukraine	2024-10-19T04:41:52-07:00

Royal Netherlands Navy shares photos of Walrus-class submarine maintenance	According to information published by the Dutch MoD on October 18, 2024, the Royal Netherlands Navy has released new images showcasing the ongoing maintenance work on its Walrus-class submarines. These submarines are undergoing a series of essential upgrades aimed at ensuring their continued service. Key activities include the replacement of batteries and various onboard systems critical to their functionality.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Netherlands Navy's Walrus class submarine. (Picture source: Dutch MoD) The Royal Netherlands Navy is undergoing a significant upgrade of its submarine fleet, centered around the Orka-class program. This new class of submarines will replace the aging Walrus-class, which has been in service since the 1990s. The contract for this project was awarded to the French Naval Group in 2024, following a competitive and extensive procurement process. The agreement includes the construction of four submarines that will enhance the Navy’s underwater capabilities. These submarines are part of the Barracuda family and will be diesel-electric variants specifically designed to meet the Netherlands' operational requirements. The new submarines, named Orka, Zwaardvis (Swordfish), Barracuda, and Tijgerhaai (Tiger Shark), will strengthen the Royal Netherlands Navy's strategic autonomy and submarine warfare capabilities. The first two submarines are expected to be delivered within the next decade. This program is not just about defense modernization; it also represents a significant collaboration between the French Naval Group and the Dutch maritime industry, highlighting the Dutch government’s efforts to maintain a strong defense industrial base. The Orka-class will be integral to NATO’s strategic deterrence efforts in the North Atlantic. The contract value is estimated at €5.4 billion, and the first two submarines should be operational by the early 2030s, ensuring that the Netherlands continues to maintain a capable and modern submarine fleet well into the future. Technical comparison The Walrus-class submarines have a displacement of around 2,800 tons, while the Barracuda-class, designed specifically for the Netherlands, has a significantly larger displacement of approximately 5,300 tons. This size difference allows the Barracuda class to carry more advanced systems, larger payloads, and have greater endurance. In terms of propulsion, both submarine classes are diesel-electric, but the Barracuda class benefits from more advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology. This allows the Barracuda submarines to remain submerged for longer periods, providing a strategic advantage in stealth and operational flexibility, whereas the Walrus-class has more limited underwater endurance due to its older propulsion technology. Stealth and sensor technology have also seen major improvements in the Barracuda class. The newer submarines are designed to be much quieter and harder to detect compared to the Walrus class. Additionally, the Barracuda class comes equipped with six torpedo tubes, allowing for a broader range of offensive capabilities, including anti-ship and land-attack options, a significant step up from the Walrus class's more limited armament.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-netherlands-navy-shares-photos-of-walrus-class-submarine-maintenance	2024-10-18T06:39:10-07:00	
Poland Receives New South Korean Homar-K Chunmoo Multiple Rocket Launchers for Artillery Units	On October 7, 2024, Poland received four Homar-K launchers as part of an order for 218 modules signed in 2022. This delivery is part of Poland's ongoing modernization of its artillery systems, developed in cooperation with international partners. The Polish Armed Forces are set to receive eight additional modules by the end of the year, reflecting the continued progress in integrating these systems into the country's artillery units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Polish Homar-K Chunmoo Multiple Rocket Launcher (Picture source: Hanwha Defense) The Homar-K is a Polish adaptation of the K239 Chunmoo multiple launch rocket system, originally designed by South Korea. This Polish version is distinguished by its integration on a Jelcz 8x8 chassis, replacing the original South Korean Doosan chassis, reflecting Poland's intent to localize the production of its military equipment. The Homar-K modules are integrated at the Huta Stalowa Wola (HSW) factory, with production becoming increasingly localized. In fact, under a second contract signed in April 2024, 72 new modules are to be delivered, 60 of which will be fully constructed in Poland. This local adaptation extends beyond just the chassis. The Homar-K launchers are capable of firing a wide range of rockets and ballistic missiles. Among these weapons are the guided CGR-080 rockets with a 239 mm caliber and a range of 80 km, and the short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) CTM-290, capable of hitting targets up to 290 km away. These rocket systems benefit from a GPS-assisted navigation system, ensuring an accuracy of around 15 meters for the CGR-080 and only 2 meters for the CTM-290. The versatility of the Homar-K is further enhanced by its ability to integrate unguided 122 mm rockets, commonly used with systems like the WR-40 Langusta or the BM-21 Grad. One of the major strengths of the Homar-K is its firepower. Each launcher can fire six 239 mm rockets in 30 seconds, providing formidable area saturation capabilities. Additionally, developments are underway to integrate new rockets with ranges of up to 200 km, or even more for 400 mm rockets, which are currently in development. The technical specifications of the Homar-K make it particularly effective on the battlefield. Weighing 31 tons, this system is 9 meters long, 2.9 meters wide, and 3.3 meters tall. It is powered by a 450-horsepower HD Hyundai Infracore DV11K diesel engine, allowing it to reach a maximum speed of 80 km/h with a range of 450 km. With a transmission system provided by Allison Transmission, the Homar-K is capable of maneuvering across difficult terrains, enhancing its operational flexibility. The crew, consisting of three personnel, is protected by armor compliant with STANAG 4569 Level 2 standards, using a combination of steel, ceramics, and polymer composites to resist ballistic threats and shrapnel. The modernization of Polish artillery through the acquisition of systems like the Homar-K is part of a broader strategy to replace aging equipment inherited from the Soviet era. In October 2022, the Polish Armaments Agency signed an agreement with Hanwha Aerospace for the purchase of 288 K239 Chunmoo launchers, with the first modules being integrated in Poland. This ambitious program continues with the signing of a new agreement in April 2024, which includes the delivery of 72 additional launchers by 2029, bringing the total number of launchers to 290 units. At the same time, cooperation between Poland and South Korea also extends to the production of munitions. In 2024, during the KADEX International Defense Exhibition, WB Group, a Polish company, and Hanwha Aerospace signed an agreement to establish a joint venture for the local production of CGR-080 rockets, intended for the Homar-K. This initiative highlights the importance for Poland to achieve strategic autonomy in its munitions production while strengthening its ties with its South Korean partners. The delivery on October 7 included four Homar-K launchers from an order of 218 modules signed in 2022. In total, the Korean side has produced and delivered 42 units (one of which, mounted on a Jelcz chassis, remained in Korea for testing), providing the 1st Artillery Regiment and the 18th Artillery Brigade with equipment already integrated at HSW. Eight additional modules are expected to be delivered this year. These deliveries position the Polish army as one of the most modern in Europe in terms of artillery capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-receives-new-south-korean-homar-k-chunmoo-multiple-rocket-launchers-for-artillery-units	2024-10-18T05:46:53-07:00	
Britain Joins European Cooperation for Long-Range Missile Development	The war in Ukraine continues to shift the military balance in Europe, prompting NATO to intensify its response. On October 17, 2024, Britain officially announced its participation in a program for developing long-range missiles alongside Germany, France, Poland, and other European partners. This initiative aims to address a gap in military stockpiles highlighted by the conflict in Ukraine, where the use of long-range missiles has become strategically important. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. (Picture source: MBDA) British Defense Secretary John Healey confirmed this commitment during a meeting with his NATO counterparts in Brussels. He explained that the UK is formally joining the long-range missile development program, which is intended to improve the integration of European air defense systems, enhancing their collective effectiveness. According to Healey, these missiles will provide capabilities far beyond those currently available to participating nations, in line with NATO's broader goal of strengthening deterrence and protecting Europe. At the NATO summit in Washington in July, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland had already signed a letter of intent to collaborate on developing missiles with a range of more than 500 kilometers. Military sources at the time indicated that the goal was to create a new land-based cruise missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers to meet NATO's deterrence requirements. Britain's participation underscores the importance of the program as Europe seeks to protect itself against external threats, particularly from Russia. As part of this cooperation, the United States and Germany also announced that starting in 2026, they will temporarily deploy U.S. long-range missiles on German soil, including SM-6, Tomahawk missiles, and developmental hypersonic weapons. This deployment, criticized by Moscow as a 'very serious threat' to Russian national security, is seen as a temporary measure until Europe develops its own long-range missiles. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. Moscow has increased cross-border strikes, while Kyiv has responded by targeting sites within Russian territory. Existing European stocks of cruise missiles, such as Britain's Storm Shadow, France's Scalp, and Germany's Taurus, which have a range of around 500 kilometers, have become critical in addressing these escalating threats. Alongside the missile development program, Healey also confirmed that Britain is ready to quickly deploy troops to Estonia, if necessary, to bolster NATO's eastern flank against the Russian threat. The UK has already prepared thousands of troops for rapid deployment to strengthen security along the Russian border. This additional military commitment reflects Britain's intention to play a key role in European defense at a time when tensions with Moscow remain high.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/britain-joins-european-cooperation-for-long-range-missile-development	2024-10-18T05:38:02-07:00

(Picture source: Kirill Zykov) This submarine is the fifth of its modified 09552 project (Borei-A) and the eighth next-generation ballistic missile submarine of the Borei family overall. Built at the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk under the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), Knyaz Pozharsky first set sail for sea trials on July 28, 2024. It is expected to join the 31st Submarine Division of the Northern Fleet in December 2024. Construction of Knyaz Pozharsky began under a contract signed by the Russian Ministry of Defense with USC on May 25, 2012, covering the production of four Borei-A class submarines. This submarine, laid down on December 23, 2016, was launched on February 3, 2024. The vessel is the last of this batch, which includes the previously commissioned submarines Knyaz Oleg (K-552), Generalissimus Suvorov (K-553), and Imperator Aleksandr III (K-554). The Borei and Borei-A class submarines represent the backbone of Russia’s strategic submarine fleet, with earlier units like Yuri Dolgorukiy (K-535), Aleksandr Nevskiy (K-550), and Vladimir Monomakh (K-551) already in service. These vessels are divided between the Northern and Pacific Fleets, with the Borei-A submarines expected to ensure the continued capability of Russia’s nuclear deterrence well into the future. Equipped with Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles, the submarine can carry multiple nuclear warheads, offering a critical component of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces. Technologically, Knyaz Pozharskiy incorporates advanced features compared to earlier Borei-class submarines. These include better stealth capabilities, improved maneuverability, and cutting-edge sonar and electronics systems, making it more difficult to detect and more efficient in long-range operations. The submarine’s reactor systems and overall design provide operational endurance, allowing it to remain submerged for extended periods and conduct global patrols. Its ability to operate in critical regions such as the Arctic underscores Russia’s growing presence and influence in this increasingly contested area. The Arctic, with its valuable resources and strategic shipping routes, is a focal point of Russia’s geopolitical ambitions. As a submarine-based platform for launching ballistic missiles, it is much harder to detect and counter compared to land-based missile systems. This complicates the efforts of potential adversaries to neutralize Russia’s nuclear forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-new-borei-a-class-submarine-knyaz-pozharsky-begins-state-trials	2024-10-18T05:17:25-07:00	
UK imposes largest sanctions yet on Russian oil tankers targeting shadow Fleet	According to information published by the UK government on October 17, 2024, the United Kingdom has announced its most extensive sanctions package yet, targeting Russian oil and gas tankers linked to President Vladimir Putin's so-called 'shadow fleet.' The move aims to cripple a network of vessels that has circumvented previous sanctions, fueling Russia's economy and military operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian crude oil tanker NS Bora. (Picture source: Fleetphoto) Eighteen oil tankers and four liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers have been added to the sanctions list, making it the largest single action to date against Russia’s maritime fleet. These vessels will be barred from accessing British ports and services, bringing the total number of sanctioned Russian ships to 43. This network of tankers is crucial for maintaining Russian oil exports, a significant source of revenue funding its ongoing war in Ukraine. The United States and Canada have joined the UK’s 'Call to Action' initiative, first announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in July, which now has 47 signatories. These countries are working together to address the shadow fleet's violation of international safety standards and the potential environmental hazards it poses, such as the risk of oil spills. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the importance of cutting off Russia’s financial lifelines, noting that the shadow fleet poses a threat not only to maritime safety but to the global economy. As a result of the sanctions, Russia’s state-controlled shipping giant, Sovcomflot, has been scrambling to evade penalties by renaming and reassigning its vessels. Despite these efforts, many ships have been forced to idle in international waters, unable to unload their cargo or generate revenue. This development has added strain to Russia's energy sector, where flagship companies like Gazprom have already reported significant losses, including a $6.9 billion net deficit in 2023—their first in over two decades. The sanctions also extend beyond the shadow fleet, targeting key players in Russia's gas industry, such as Rusgazdobycha JSC. Background The UK's latest sanctions on Russia’s 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers represent a critical escalation in the effort to cripple the financial resources fueling President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. These measures are part of a broader campaign, which has already blocked Russia from accessing over $400 billion in assets and revenues since the start of the war. The shadow fleet, a collection of vessels designed to evade sanctions and continue the illicit trade of Russian oil, has become a primary target, with the UK's actions disrupting operations of vessels that have collectively transported billions in oil since February 2022​. This crackdown aligns with wider international efforts, with the US, Canada, and several European countries backing the UK's initiative to halt Russia’s oil trade. Notably, the shadow fleet comprises ships operating under complex management systems often based in non-Western jurisdictions, making enforcement challenging.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uk-imposes-largest-sanctions-yet-on-russian-oil-tankers-targeting-shadow-fleet	2024-10-18T03:39:36-07:00

Additionally, the Rafale F5 will be supported by a stealth combat drone inspired by the Neuron demonstrator, designed to assist the aircraft in penetrating enemy defenses. This companion drone, a key feature of the F5 standard, will be engineered for maximum stealth and advanced connectivity, allowing operations over extended ranges thanks to aerial refueling. Its mission, enhanced by native integration of artificial intelligence, will enable direct collaboration with the Rafale in adaptive combat strategies, providing a foundational component of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This potential partnership with the UAE arises as France seeks to optimize its defense budget for the 2024–2030 period, with a €413 billion military programming budget. In 2023, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu discussed the possibility of Rafale Club members contributing to development costs while ensuring sovereignty over critical components. This shared financing would also strengthen France’s relations with Rafale clients, while maintaining national control over sensitive elements. Expected by 2030, the Rafale F5 fighter jet will succeed the F4 standard, addressing modern threats for both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence missions within the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS). It represents a new generation of connected fighters, integrating interoperable systems with other ground and aerial platforms. For the UAE, this project represents not only a military upgrade but also an extension of their cooperation with France in defense, consolidating their position as one of France's privileged allies. The UAE Armed Forces are among the best-trained and most capable among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. While Iran remains a major strategic concern, partly due to an ongoing dispute over islands in the Strait of Hormuz, the UAE has shown an increasing capacity to project influence and engage militarily beyond its borders. Their involvement in conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as their crucial role in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, has reinforced their experience and strategic approach to managing military risks. This orientation towards international engagement is supported by foreign bases, including a French base and a South Korean contingent, as well as diversified defense relations, particularly with Israel, Turkey, and China, while maintaining a primary partnership with the United States. According to Military Balance 2024, the UAE’s air fleet reflects these ambitions, with an advanced inventory of 148 combat aircraft sourced from American and European suppliers.

Airbus Helicopters, in partnership with the Netherlands and Germany, is also developing a new mission computer to centralize all data flows in a single display, facilitating real-time decision-making. The acquisition of these helicopters includes infrastructure and training programs. Next-generation simulators will be implemented through a separate program starting next year, aiming to increase training hours from 700 for the current Cougar fleet to between 2,000 and 3,000 for the Caracal, preserving the aircraft while enhancing pilot and operator readiness for critical missions. This adjustment will impact the operational capacity of the 300 Special Operations Squadron. While the initial plan anticipated the ability to conduct two simultaneous missions over six months, the current configuration limits capacity to one long-term mission, with a second short-term mission possible if needed. This change reflects Defence’s intent to maximize capabilities within budget constraints, taking into account rising integration costs and logistical challenges. Anticipated delivery delays also stem from technical challenges associated with integrating numerous mission systems and high demand on Caracal’s production lines internationally. The Dutch Ministry of Defence acknowledges that further delays cannot be ruled out, though contractual safeguards aim to minimize this risk. In the worst case, an extension of the Cougar helicopters’ operational life may be considered to offset scheduling delays. With the acquisition’s preparatory phase now complete, a final agreement with Airbus Helicopters is expected next month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/netherlands-confirms-a-reduced-order-of-h225m-caracal-helicopters-for-special-forces	2024-10-17T06:13:43-07:00

Armenia Could Be First Country to Acquire India's Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile	On October 16, 2024, News.Az reported that the Indian Ministry of Defense authorized the export of Pralay quasi-ballistic missiles to Armenia, marking an important step in strengthening the defense partnership between India and Armenia. This decision, which has yet to receive official confirmation from the Armenian Ministry of Defense, reflects India's intent to conclude an agreement aimed at bolstering Armenia’s defensive capabilities in a context of regional tensions. According to Alpha Defense, this potential agreement is at an advanced stage, with sources indicating that India is actively negotiating to finalize it in the near future.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link India Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Pralay missile, developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), is an advanced short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile, primarily designed for tactical use in combat conditions. Launched in 2015, the Pralay program represents a strategic advancement for India’s missile arsenal, incorporating sophisticated quasi-ballistic trajectory adjustments that allow the missile to evade interceptors and anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses. The missile has already successfully completed several tests, with the first two conducted in December 2021 and a third in November 2023, each demonstrating the missile’s accuracy, payload capacity, and terminal maneuverability. The Pralay's unique quasi-ballistic trajectory enables it to shift from a traditional ballistic path to a flatter trajectory after launch, making interception more difficult by reducing its radar profile. This feature, combined with high speed and terminal maneuverability, brings the Pralay closer to the Russian Iskander-M missile, which has proven effective in recent conflicts, notably in Ukraine. The Pralay shares characteristics with the Iskander-M, such as a CEP (Circular Error Probable) of around 10 meters, highlighting its high accuracy and ability to evade air defenses. India and Russia have long-standing collaboration in missile technology, a partnership that has significantly shaped India's missile capabilities. One of the most notable outcomes of this cooperation is the BrahMos missile, developed jointly by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyenia. Launched as the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, the BrahMos demonstrates both high speed and precision, making it a valuable asset in India’s arsenal. This collaboration has allowed India to integrate Russian expertise in propulsion and guidance systems with its own indigenous technological advancements, setting a foundation for India's development of future missile systems. Russia’s involvement in India’s missile program has also extended through technology transfers and support in ballistic missile defense research, further strengthening India's defense capabilities and boosting its strategic autonomy in missile production. To comply with international arms control regulations, India has committed to limiting export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 kilometers and a payload capacity not exceeding 500 kilograms. This adherence to missile technology control guidelines requires technical modifications to the Pralay system, an adaptation that India is actively pursuing. Powered by a solid-fuel motor and integrating maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MaRV) technology, the missile can carry payloads ranging from high-explosive fragmentation warheads to runway denial submunitions. These capabilities enable it to effectively target and neutralize critical military infrastructure such as radar installations, command centers, and forward airstrips, with enhanced precision and lethality. Armenia’s interest in acquiring the Pralay missile stems from its need to counterbalance the capabilities acquired by Azerbaijan through its purchase of LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missiles developed by Israel Aerospace Industries. With a range of 400 kilometers and a CEP of 10 meters, the LORA missile represents a significant threat to Armenia’s strategic assets. The Pralay’s compatibility with various warhead types and its advanced guidance system, using both inertial navigation and a DSMAC (Digital Scene-Matching Area Correlation) seeker for increased accuracy, provide Armenia with an adequate response to Azerbaijan’s missile capabilities. A distinctive feature of the Pralay is its fused silica radar dome (RADOME), which enhances its evasion capabilities and survivability in hostile airspace. The jet vane thrust vector control system allows the Pralay to perform evasive maneuvers in the terminal phase, effectively countering enemy defense systems. Additionally, the Pralay includes two sets of small fins that help reduce its radar signature, further complicating interception efforts. The Indian Pralay missile and the Israeli LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missile are two quasi-ballistic systems with short to medium range, but their performances and capabilities differ in several aspects. The Pralay has a theoretical range between 150 and 500 km, with a payload capacity ranging from 350 kg to 700 kg, allowing it to target strategic installations such as radars, command centers, and airstrips. However, to comply with international arms control regulations, India has limited export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 km and a payload not exceeding 500 kg. This technical adaptation, necessary to adhere to missile technology control guidelines, ensures that exported versions meet international standards. The LORA, on the other hand, has a maximum range of 400 km and a payload capacity of approximately 570 kg. This missile was operationally used by Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, demonstrating high accuracy with a CEP of 10 meters, particularly on targets such as bridges and critical infrastructure. Its guidance system, using GPS and TV imaging in the terminal phase, ensures high precision, although it remains potentially vulnerable to electronic countermeasures. Thus, the Pralay prioritizes better terminal maneuverability to evade interceptions, while the LORA stands out for its extreme precision in targeted strikes, with each featuring specific adaptations according to their usage contexts and regulatory requirements. The Indian armed forces have shown strategic interest in the Pralay missile, with substantial orders from both the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. In 2022, the Indian Ministry of Defense approved the purchase of 120 missiles for the Air Force, followed in 2023 by the acquisition of a regiment of 250 missiles for the Army, intended to strengthen tactical capabilities along sensitive borders with China and Pakistan. If the agreement with Armenia is finalized, this country would become the first international buyer of the Pralay missile, marking a historic milestone in Indian defense exports. Defense relations between India and Armenia have considerably strengthened in recent years, illustrated by the transfer of sophisticated weaponry to meet Armenia's growing security needs in a tense regional context. In 2020, India sold Armenia four Swathi radars, capable of detecting and locating enemy artillery fire, as well as M982 Excalibur precision artillery shells, enhancing Armenia’s defensive and retaliatory capabilities. Armenia is also interested in ATAGS (Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System) howitzers developed by DRDO, which offer extended range and increased accuracy, with the capability to fire projectiles up to 48 km. The addition of ATAGS would strengthen Armenia's offensive capabilities, complementing its current arsenal. Additionally, the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, also developed by DRDO, has attracted significant interest from Armenia. Capable of launching a salvo of twelve rockets in less than 45 seconds and reaching a range of 40 to 75 km depending on the variant, the Pinaka would provide mobile and versatile firepower, ideal for saturation strikes and ground support missions. Integrating the Pinaka would further strengthen Armenia's tactical options, while consolidating India as a key partner in defense.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/armenia-could-be-first-country-to-acquire-indias-home-made-pralay-quasi-ballistic-missile	2024-10-17T04:52:13-07:00

UK maintains Challenger 3 Tank schedule toward 2030 full capability	As reported by the UK Defence Journal on October 11, 2024, the British Ministry of Defence has confirmed the continued progress of the Challenger 3 main battle tank program, in response to questions from Danny Kruger, MP for East Wiltshire, regarding the review's potential impacts on the program and recent discussions with the Army Board. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Luke Pollard clarified that the Challenger 3 is set to achieve Initial Operating Capability by 2027, with Full Operating Capability expected by 2030.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Pollard noted that the Strategic Defence Review aims to align future capability development with the UK’s security needs. As part of this process, the Ministry will provide regular updates to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Secretary of State for Defence, with a comprehensive final report anticipated by mid-2025. This review is intended to ensure that the UK’s defense infrastructure supports both current and future requirements. The Challenger 3, developed by the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL), represents an upgrade of the existing Challenger 2 tanks rather than the deployment of entirely new vehicles. The program evolved from the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme (LEP), designed to improve mobility, lethality, and survivability for continued use through the 2030s. The primary modification in the Challenger 3 is the integration of a new turret with a 120mm L55A1 smoothbore gun, replacing the previous L30A1 rifled gun. This modification aligns with NATO standards, improving interoperability, although it requires a new kinetic energy round to be developed in collaboration with Germany, as the smoothbore system is incompatible with current Challenger 2 ammunition. Initial deliveries of pre-production Challenger 3 tanks began in early 2024, with live-firing trials starting in Germany in April. The British Army is scheduled to receive a total of 148 tanks, with the first units entering service in 2025. The project’s estimated cost is approximately $1.17 billion, and it is expected to support around 300 jobs at RBSL’s Telford facility, with an additional 450 positions across the UK defense supply chain.

While the adoption of the smoothbore gun introduces an ammunition compatibility issue, the Ministry of Defence has partnered with German defense companies to develop a new Enhanced Kinetic Energy (EKE) round, suitable for both the Challenger 3 and the Leopard 2 tanks. The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. The Challenger 3 continues this progression with modular armor upgrades and enhanced survivability features, including Active Protection Systems (APS). Previous trials on the Challenger 2 tested APS such as the Rheinmetall ROSY Rapid Obscurant System and the MUSS system, providing a basis for their integration into the Challenger 3. Additionally, the Challenger 3 is powered by a Perkins CV12-9A 26.1-liter V12 diesel engine, delivering 1,500 bhp, and utilizes a David Brown Santasalo TN54E transmission system with updated components. The development of the Challenger 3 reflects the UK's approach to modernizing its existing tank fleet rather than procuring new models from other countries. In a 2021 report, the Defence Select Committee noted challenges in the LEP, including budget overruns and delays. Later that year, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would upgrade 148 Challenger 2 tanks into Challenger 3 models through a contract with RBSL valued at £800 million. This contract solidified the selection of Rheinmetall’s upgrade proposal, which includes the 120mm smoothbore gun. Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system.

US Global Strike Command's B-2 Bombers return to combat for first time since 2017 against Houthis in Yemen	On October 16, 2024, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) carried out a series of precision airstrikes on underground weapons storage facilities in areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-backed Houthi forces, marking the first combat use of the B-2 stealth bombers since 2017. These facilities housed conventional weapons used by the Houthis in attacks on U.S. and international vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. (Picture source: US DoD) According to the US Central Command, the strikes aimed to limit the Houthis' ability to target maritime traffic in this strategically significant region, which affects both commercial shipping and regional stability. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that the operation, which included various U.S. Air Force and Navy assets, focused on five fortified underground storage locations within Yemen, housing missiles, weapons components, and munitions. According to OSINTdefender, the mission involved B-2 bombers from the 13th Bomb Squadron of the 509th Bomb Wing, part of the US Air Force's Global Strike Command, and the 131st Bomb Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard, flying from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. These bombers were equipped with 2,000-pound Mark-84 bombs modified with Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits for precision targeting of these deeply buried sites. Each B-2 is designed to carry up to 20 tons of bombs, providing significant strike capability at long ranges. The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes near Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and in the stronghold of Saada, though they provided no immediate details on damage or casualties. CENTCOM stated that initial assessments suggested no civilian casualties. The Houthis have used underground facilities in these areas, including tunnels originally constructed to store Scud missiles. These tunnels were reportedly expanded to accommodate the group's weapons storage, further complicating efforts to disrupt their capabilities. The B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. strikes were also seen as a signal to Iran, a supporter of the Houthi movement. In recent years, Iran has conducted missile attacks against Israel, and the B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. The Houthis have continued to attack merchant vessels in the Red Sea since October 2023, and CENTCOM’s strikes align with efforts to secure these waters against further disruptions to commercial shipping. The Houthis claim their attacks target vessels linked to Israel, the U.S., and the U.K., citing these countries' involvement in the Gaza conflict, although some targeted vessels have not been directly connected to the conflict. Additionally, Houthi attacks have seized one vessel, sunk two others, and led to the deaths of four sailors, prompting ongoing concerns about the group’s impact on maritime security. The Northrop B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy strategic bomber developed under the Advanced Technology Bomber program in the late 1970s. Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. Originally intended to replace the Mach 2-capable B-1A, the B-2 program faced significant delays and rising costs, leading to extensive debate in Congress. The B-2 can carry up to 18,000 kg of ordnance, including conventional and nuclear payloads, and has a maximum unrefueled range of 11,000 km, with a service ceiling of 15,000 m. (Picture source: US DoD) Ultimately, the planned production was reduced from 132 units to 21, reflecting changing strategic priorities after the Cold War. Entering service in 1997, the B-2 made its combat debut during the Kosovo War in 1999 and has since been deployed in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The B-2’s flying wing design, which lacks both a fuselage and tail, contributes to a reduced radar cross-section and increased aerodynamic efficiency, enabling extended range operations. The aircraft’s structure includes radar-absorbing materials and advanced flight controls for stability, allowing a two-person crew to operate the bomber. Maneuverability is achieved through a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust, supporting the aircraft’s low radar profile. The B-2 is equipped with the AN/APQ-181 radar, which provides multi-mode functionality to support navigation and target acquisition. During the RIMPAC 2024 exercise, the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit bomber also employed the QUICKSINK maritime strike capability, designed to sink surface vessels with modified JDAM precision-guided bombs, marking the first publicly reported test of this system. Conducted during the second SINKEX exercise, the test demonstrated the B-2’s capability in maritime strike roles. Developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, QUICKSINK converts JDAMs into precision-guided bombs equipped with GPS-assisted INS guidance, a radar seeker, and an Imaging Infrared camera, allowing them to target moving maritime threats. Ongoing modernization programs for the B-2, supported by a recent $7 billion contract with Northrop Grumman, focus on enhancing defensive and communication systems to address emerging threats, including cyber risks. (Picture source: US DoD) The B-2 can carry up to 18,000 kg of ordnance, including conventional and nuclear payloads, and has a maximum unrefueled range of 11,000 km, with a service ceiling of 15,000 m. Its bomb bays are configured to accommodate up to 80 GPS-guided bombs or two Massive Ordnance Penetrators for penetrating fortified targets. Powered by four non-afterburning turbofan engines, the aircraft can reach speeds of up to 1,010 km/h. Ongoing modernization programs for the B-2, supported by a recent $7 billion contract with Northrop Grumman, focus on enhancing defensive and communication systems to address emerging threats, including cyber risks.

Belgian Military barracks tighten security amid sabotage and espionage threats	According to information published by VTM Nieuws on October 12, 2024, Several military barracks in Belgium have raised their security measures following credible threats of sabotage and espionage. This information has been confirmed by the Ministry of Defense. As a result, the threat level in certain military quarters has been elevated from level 1 (Alpha) to level 2 (Bravo), after an assessment by the General Intelligence and Security Service (ADIV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During a high-intensity training exercise at Chièvres Air Base, Belgium, a Belgian Para-Commando and a U.S. Soldier exchange gunfire with simulated enemy forces, honing their combat skills in a realistic battlefield scenario. (Picture source: Dvids) The heightened security specifically targets Defense personnel, particularly those responsible for guarding the affected barracks. While no specific details about the new security measures have been disclosed, the adjustments reflect the increased threat environment. The enhanced protocols currently apply to a limited number of military installations, which had reportedly received concrete threats. These measures were implemented as of yesterday and will remain in place indefinitely. Similar Incidents in Germany This development follows similar actions taken in Germany earlier this year, where heightened security was introduced at various military bases due to concerns over sabotage. In August, the NATO Air Base in Geilenkirchen, near the borders of the Netherlands and Belgium, saw an increase in security measures due to a 'potential threat.' Additionally, a week earlier, a major German airbase near Cologne was temporarily locked down after concerns arose over possible water supply tampering. A soldier discovered a breach in the fence surrounding the base's drinking water facility, and abnormal readings were detected in the water. Similar security precautions were also implemented at another German NATO base for related reasons. The broader European security landscape has been deeply influenced by Russia's continued covert operations, which have included cyberattacks, sabotage, and espionage targeting NATO members and their critical infrastructure. The Belgian government’s response is part of a collective effort by European nations to safeguard military operations amidst these growing challenges. Pro-Russian hacker groups have previously targeted Belgian infrastructure, and while no official connection has been made, this escalation follows a pattern of cyber and physical sabotage that has been observed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine​. Security analysts have noted that these incidents are likely part of a larger strategy to disrupt Western military and defense logistics. Recent events such as the attempted sabotage of water supplies at German airbases and fire incidents at defense facilities have put NATO countries on high alert. The possibility of espionage and sabotage being used to weaken European military capacities, especially those involved in supporting Ukraine, continues to be a significant concern for NATO and EU member states alike.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/belgian-military-barracks-tighten-security-amid-sabotage-and-espionage-threats	2024-10-17T00:31:39-07:00

Royal Malaysian Navy The Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) faces a range of challenges as it navigates efforts to modernize its fleet and maintain maritime security in the region. One of the core issues is the obsolescence of its current fleet. A significant portion of the RMN's warships are decades old, with two-thirds of the fleet dating back over 30 years. The aging vessels struggle to meet the growing demands of modern naval warfare, especially given the geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea. To address these challenges, the RMN initiated the '15-to-5' Transformation Program in 2015. This plan aims to streamline the number of ship classes from 15 to 5, reducing operational complexity and maintenance costs. It also includes the acquisition of new vessels, such as the Maharaja Lela-class littoral combat ships and the Keris-class littoral mission ships. However, progress has been slower than expected, with delays in construction and delivery. For instance, of the 18 planned littoral combat ships, only a fraction have been delivered so far, significantly weakening the RMN's patrol capabilities across its vast maritime domain​. In addition to these material and logistical issues, the RMN must confront the strategic threat posed by China’s assertive presence in the South China Sea. Chinese naval and coast guard vessels regularly intrude into Malaysia's exclusive economic zone, challenging the RMN's ability to effectively patrol and defend its maritime borders. Despite these provocations, Malaysia has often downplayed the threat, focusing instead on regional diplomacy​	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/malaysias-first-lcs-kd-maharaja-lela-set-for-sea-trials-in-november-2024	2024-10-16T05:46:52-07:00

Textron Creates Next-Gen XM204 Top Attack Mine System for Tactical Obstacles Against Tanks	At the AUSA 2024 exhibition, held from October 9 to 11 in Washington, D.C., the American company Textron is presenting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) System, a new type of system developed under the U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program to block enemy armored vehicles by deploying mines. Equipped with autonomous sensors, the XM204 TA can launch mines to create complex tactical obstacles, combining top and bottom attacks. Its mobility could be further enhanced through drone transport, as demonstrated at the event.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Textron XM204 Top Attack Mine System could be further enhanced through drone transport (Picture source: Army Recognition) Textron’s XM204 Top Attack (TA) system marks a significant advancement in terrain-shaping obstacle technology, designed to meet the U.S. Army’s temporary requirements for top-attack anti-vehicle capabilities, specifically to support U.S. Army Europe Command (USAREUR). Used as a standalone solution or in conjunction with other systems, it enables the creation of complex obstacles by combining top and bottom attacks, especially when deployed alongside the XM343 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) system. The operational concept of the XM204 TA involves several steps: once manually armed, the system activates its ground sensors and submunitions to autonomously detect, track, and engage multiple vehicle targets. Its detection and tracking process relies on seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors, paired with an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead for top attack, maximizing its effectiveness against weaker vehicle armor. The operational stages include target detection, submunition deployment, engagement area scanning, target confirmation, EFP charge activation, and, ultimately, target destruction. The U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program aims to develop and deploy defense systems that create tactical obstacles to slow down, divert, or immobilize enemy armored vehicles on the battlefield. These obstacles, which include technologies such as the XM204 Top Attack (TA) system, are designed to be autonomous and used in diverse operational scenarios to enhance the combat brigades' counter-mobility capabilities. The TSO allows forces to create temporary yet effective barriers that exploit specific terrain areas to block the advance of enemy armored formations, particularly in open and sparsely vegetated environments. The XM204 Top Attack (TA) is an autonomous anti-vehicle system designed to attack armored vehicles from above, targeting their vulnerability in the upper armor. After being manually activated by a soldier, the XM204 uses a combination of seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors to detect, track, and identify enemy vehicles within a 100-meter radius. When a target is confirmed, the system deploys submunitions equipped with explosively formed penetrator (EFP) charges to engage and neutralize the vehicle. The EFP detonates either above or near the target, maximizing the damage to render the vehicle inoperable. Designed to function autonomously after activation, the XM204 is resistant to active protection systems, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and deactivation attempts. It is also equipped with programmable self-destruct timers (4 hours, 48 hours, or 15 days), ensuring the area’s safety after engagement. This system thus allows the creation of effective obstacles against armored vehicles in strategic zones without requiring continuous monitoring. The XM204 TA features a 'Zone of Authority' (ZOA) with a 100-meter diameter, providing extensive engagement area coverage. It is designed to resist active protection systems, smoke, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and mechanical deactivation attempts, making it a robust counter-mobility tool suitable for varied terrains and conditions. The system is also recoverable, reusable, and equipped with visual safety indicators to alert on its arming status. The XM204 can be deployed quickly by hand and is resistant to unauthorized handling. It also offers three manually programmable self-destruct durations—four hours, forty-eight hours, or fifteen days—to meet specific mission requirements in the field. This system will be fielded for the first time in the U.S. Army during the 2025 fiscal year, thus meeting the Army’s modernization priorities, including long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, and soldier lethality. Mounting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) on a drone would provide significant strategic advantages by increasing its range, mobility, and flexibility on the battlefield. While the system is currently limited to manual and ground-based deployments, integration on a drone would enable the XM204 to be transported over long distances, precisely positioned in hard-to-reach or hazardous areas, and used to create anti-vehicle obstacles in regions where ground forces cannot safely intervene. Additionally, the drone could relocate or reposition the XM204 based on enemy movements, optimizing its autonomous multi-target engagement capability through its advanced seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors. This combination with a drone would transform the XM204 into a dynamic, responsive defense system capable of creating mobile obstacles and adapting to the evolving needs of a modern combat environment. Several stakeholders are involved in the development of this system, including the Project Manager Close Combat Systems (PM CCS) within the Joint Program Executive Office for Armaments and Ammunition, in collaboration with Textron Defense Systems and centers of excellence such as the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence. The Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center also provides critical functions within the program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/textron-creates-next-gen-xm204-top-attack-mine-system-for-tactical-obstacles-against-tanks	2024-10-16T03:28:09-07:00

Canadian defense analyst Martin Shadwick has highlighted that Canada’s approach to tanks has varied over time, noting that a 2003 decision to retire the Leopard fleet was reversed in favor of lighter vehicles, only to be reinstated when tanks were deployed in Afghanistan. The future of Canada’s tank fleet remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether Canada will acquire new tanks in the immediate future. To address maintenance needs, Canada has increased the use of contracted Field Service Representatives (FSRs) from KMW since 2018, allowing for specialized technician support at Army facilities across the country. Additionally, adjustments to the training and management of Canadian technicians are intended to strengthen maintenance capabilities and ensure sufficient technical support during periods of increased demand. The Canadian Army has emphasized that these changes are part of broader efforts to maintain the operational readiness of the Leopard 2 fleet, with the LTSC anticipated to play a critical role in sustaining the tanks until their projected end-of-service date in 2035. The Leopard 2A6M CAN C2 seems to retain the weaponry of the Leopard 2A6M CAN, which is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun and two 7.62mm machine guns. (Picture source: ARD 1) Currently, Canada operates 74 Leopard 2 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) in three main variants: 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. Additionally, 52 older Leopard 1C2 tanks remain in storage. In addition to these tanks, the Canadian Army has around 30 recovery and engineering vehicles, including 5 Buffalo Armoured Engineering Vehicles (AEVs) and 18 Wisent 2 vehicles, as well as 12 BPz-3 Büffel Armoured Recovery Vehicles (ARVs). With 8 tanks donated to Ukraine and 15 Leopard 2A4 tanks now deployed to Eastern Europe as part of NATO’s bolstered presence since the onset of the Ukraine conflict, questions have arisen about the readiness and condition of Canada’s remaining tanks. National Defence spokesperson Dan Le Bouthillier emphasized that Leopard 2 tanks, like other heavy vehicles, require extensive maintenance and inspections. On average, these tanks spend about 30% of their time in maintenance, which includes scheduled inspections. In response to reports that Canada was allegedly cannibalizing certain tanks to maintain others, Le Bouthillier clarified that such practices are only permitted under specific and urgent circumstances, with authorization from local commanders. He noted that no Leopard 2 tanks have been permanently decommissioned to support other units. Canada's defense policy contends with limited defense spending and a complex security environment. In 2023, the defense budget was about 1.38% of GDP, below NATO’s 2% target. However, Canada ranks seventh in NATO for absolute defense spending, with some modest increases in outlays planned. Plans include doubling its NATO Enhanced Presence Battlegroup in Latvia by 2026 and committing more than $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine, along with continuing training under Operation Unifier. Currently, Canada operates 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. (Picture source: Canadian MoD) The Leopard 2A6M CAN is a Canadian version of the German Leopard 2A6 main battle tank, deployed in 2007 to address operational needs in Afghanistan. Canada initially assessed its Leopard C2 tanks but determined that they were insufficient for the region's conditions, particularly due to a lack of air conditioning, which impacted crew performance. Consequently, Canada arranged for the German Bundeswehr to loan twenty Leopard 2A6 tanks, which were then modified by KMW to include mine protection and other adjustments to meet Canadian Army requirements. This deployment aimed to enhance vehicle protection and provide a more suitable platform for Canadian forces in Afghanistan's demanding operational environment. The Leopard 2A6M CAN includes several modifications unique to this variant. Enhancements consist of a mine protection package to reinforce the tank's underside, specific communications and anti-IED jamming equipment mounted on the turret, and stand-off slat armor for additional defense. An air conditioning unit and cooling vests were later added to reduce heat strain on the crew, alongside Saab Barracuda camouflage mats to decrease heat absorption by 50 percent. The initial twenty tanks were on loan from Germany, configured with MG3 machine guns, while subsequent tanks, procured from the Netherlands, were integrated with C6 GPMGs for consistency with Canadian forces. Upon returning to Canada in 2011, features like ECM boxes and slat armor were removed, yet the Canadian Army retained and continues to modify these tanks. In terms of specifications, the Leopard 2A6M CAN is equipped with a 1,500-horsepower MTU diesel engine and RENK transmission, enabling a top speed of 68 km/h and a range of 550 km on roads. It is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun, with a wide range of elevation, and two 7.62mm machine guns. The tank, weighing 62.3 tons in combat, can traverse obstacles up to 1.1 meters high and 3 meters wide. Other features include modular and composite armor, NBC protection, and options for additional modular armor. These characteristics contribute to the tank’s operational capabilities in various combat scenarios.

In April 2022, tests confirmed the Iron Beam's ability to intercept drones, rockets, mortar bombs, and antitank missiles. Following these trials, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced plans to deploy the system to Israel's southern border with the Gaza Strip, where it could be tested in active conflict scenarios, including during the 2023 Israel–Hamas conflict. The system is expected to reach full operational capacity by the end of 2025, with coordinated defense using both missile interceptors and laser technology. Moreover, Rafael, in collaboration with Lockheed Martin, continues to enhance the Iron Beam's capabilities, with future developments expected to enable it to reach higher power levels and engage multiple threats simultaneously. The Iron Beam's fiber laser system can achieve a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers, neutralizing targets within seconds of contact. By 2023, the technology had advanced to a point where the laser could deliver energy levels exceeding 100 kW, with the beam focused to the diameter of a coin at distances of up to 10 kilometers. However, the effectiveness of high-energy lasers like the Iron Beam can be influenced by atmospheric conditions such as rain or clouds, which may limit the laser's ability to hit its target. The system also requires sustained focus on a moving target for several seconds to deliver enough energy to destroy it, which could reduce its effectiveness against multiple simultaneous threats, such as rocket barrages. In addition, certain targets may be equipped with materials designed to resist laser attacks, further limiting the system’s effectiveness.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rafael-expands-iron-beam-laser-family-with-new-mobile-variant-on-tatra-chassis	2024-10-15T23:49:11-07:00

Russia Launches New Yakutsk Submarine for Pacific Fleet at Admiralty Shipyard	According to information published by the Russian MoD on October 11, 2024, the Admiralty Shipyard held a ceremonial launch for the new Yakutsk diesel-electric submarine, part of the Project 636.3 series, designed for the Russian Navy.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launching ceremony of the Project 636.3 submarine Yakutsk. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The Yakutsk is the sixth submarine in the series, specifically constructed for the Pacific Fleet. Laid down in August 2021 under the supervision of President Vladimir Putin, the submarine will now undergo outfitting, mooring trials, and sea tests before its formal transfer to the Navy. About the class of submarines Project 636.3, known as the Varshavyanka class by Russia and referred to as the Improved Kilo class by NATO, is a diesel-electric attack submarine. These submarines are an evolution of the older Project 877 Kilo submarines, benefiting from enhancements in stealth, navigation, and weapons systems. The submarines of Project 636.3 have been primarily constructed at the Admiralty Shipyards in St. Petersburg. These boats are recognized for their stealth capabilities, often described as 'black holes' due to their reduced acoustic signatures, which make them harder to detect underwater. They measure about 74 meters in length, with a submerged displacement of approximately 3,900 tons. Each submarine can carry six 533mm torpedo tubes, capable of launching Kalibr-PL cruise missiles, which allow them to strike both sea and land targets from a submerged position. Designed for operations in the 'near sea' zone, these submarines are intended to engage surface ships, submarines, and perform reconnaissance and patrol missions. Their introduction addressed delays and technical problems with the more advanced but troubled Project 677 Lada-class submarines, which led the Russian Navy to prioritize expanding its fleet of Project 636.3 boats. Since 2010, these submarines have been steadily incorporated into both the Black Sea and Pacific Fleets. Russia also plans to deploy additional units to its Baltic and Northern Fleets. Beyond Russia, other nations like China and Vietnam have also acquired variations of the Project 636 submarines, underscoring their export success and popularity as a non-nuclear alternative in modern submarine warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-launches-new-yakutsk-submarine-for-pacific-fleet-at-admiralty-shipyard	2024-10-14T07:17:37-07:00

US Navy Demonstrates New At-Sea Missile Reloading System for Warships	According to information published by the US DoD on 7, October, 2024, the Navy showcased a groundbreaking rearming system designed to reload warships at sea, in a recent demonstration at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Sailors from the Navy and USS Chosin (CG 65) demonstrate reloading a MK 41 Vertical Launching System cell. (Picture source: DVIDS) The event featured the Transferrable Rearming Mechanism (TRM), which successfully transferred a missile canister along cables to simulate the reloading of a ship’s MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) cell. This demonstration involved sailors from the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group and crew members from the USS Chosin (CG 65). The TRM allows for at-sea replenishment of munitions, potentially reducing the time a warship would need to spend in port for resupply. Comments This capability enhances both strategic and tactical flexibility. Strategically, the Navy can maintain a forward presence without frequent interruptions for resupply, keeping vessels on station longer and increasing mission endurance. Tactically, the ability to rearm during operations enables quicker adaptation to evolving threat environments. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where maintaining a constant missile loadout is critical, such as anti-air warfare, missile defense, and strike operations. From an operational standpoint, the TRM could significantly reduce dependency on fixed supply chains, allowing task forces to operate further from logistical bases. This reduces vulnerabilities, as adversaries may target supply hubs or transit routes in an effort to limit naval power projection. In contested regions, where port access might be constrained, the TRM provides a degree of independence from shore-based infrastructure, improving the Navy's ability to operate in hostile environments. However, the implementation of at-sea rearming will require adjustments. First, the technical and procedural aspects of using such a system in real-world conditions, especially during combat or high-threat scenarios, need to be thoroughly validated. Safety and efficiency concerns in transferring heavy missile canisters across cables in potentially rough seas will also require attention. Training sailors to operate the system effectively and integrating it into existing replenishment doctrines will be key to realizing its potential. In terms of broader strategic implications, the TRM contributes to the concept of distributed maritime operations (DMO). By decentralizing logistical capabilities, the Navy can distribute forces more widely across a theater.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-demonstrates-new-at-sea-missile-reloading-system-for-warships	2024-10-14T05:07:21-07:00

Additionally, it supports a variety of external weapon configurations, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder for air-to-air engagements, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and up to two 1,500-pound weapons on its outermost wing pylons. For close air support, the F-35B is fitted with an optional 25 mm GAU-22/A gun pod, mounted externally on the aircraft’s centerline. The F-35B is capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings due to its integrated Rolls-Royce Lift System, which includes a lift fan, drive shaft, and a Three-Bearing Swivel Module that allows for vectoring the engine’s thrust downwards for vertical flight. (Picture source: USMC) Initiated in 2019, the Block 4 upgrade for the F-35 introduces over 75 enhancements, marking the most significant modernization phase for the F-35 Lightning II to date. Specifically, it increases the fighter's missile carriage by incorporating systems like the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile and the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, expanding its combat reach and flexibility. The Block 4 suite also includes the AN/APG-85 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which provides enhanced detection capabilities, and upgrades to the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) for improved 360-degree situational awareness. These upgrades enable the F-35 to carry a wider range of precision-guided munitions, allowing it to engage both air and ground targets more effectively. Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3) serves as the backbone of Block 4, providing a major overhaul to the F-35’s computing and data-processing systems. At the heart of TR-3 is a new Integrated Core Processor (ICP) developed by Lockheed Martin, which offers over 25 times the processing power of its predecessor. This ICP is paired with a new Panoramic Cockpit Display and an enhanced Memory System, supporting advanced applications and enabling the integration of future technologies. TR-3 also introduces an open mission systems architecture, making the F-35 more adaptable to rapid updates and capable of hosting additional software-driven capabilities, such as advanced sensor fusion and AI-assisted targeting. The upgrade package is completed by the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) by Pratt &amp; Whitney, which addresses the cooling and thrust needs generated by the new Block 4 capabilities. The ECU provides increased bleed air (compressed air taken from the engine) required for the jet's enhanced electronic systems, while simultaneously boosting engine durability and fuel efficiency, allowing for an expected $40 billion in lifecycle cost savings. This enables the F-35 to operate at higher temperatures and power levels, optimizing the platform for sustained, high-intensity missions.

Iran Missile Strikes on Israel Reveal Limits of Ballistic Missile Threat in Modern Warfare	According to information published by Business Insider on October 12, 2024, Iran's recent missile strikes on Israel highlight a growing debate about the effectiveness of ballistic missiles in modern warfare. Despite their ability to deliver sudden, destructive blows, the real-world impact of these weapons appears to be less decisive than their reputation suggests.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crane clearing debris from Iranian missiles fired on Israel. (Picture source: Twitter account of Israel Defense Forces) In two high-profile attacks, Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, yet the results were underwhelming. In April, a barrage of 300 missiles and drones was largely intercepted by Israeli and allied defense systems, while a subsequent strike in October saw a higher percentage of missiles breaching defenses but causing minimal damage overall. While these attacks made headlines with their dramatic visuals—explosions, fiery streaks across the sky—the aftermath tells a different story. Critical infrastructure remains functional, public morale appears undeterred, and the Israeli military continues its operations. This mirrors the experience of Ukraine, which has endured repeated Russian missile attacks over two years without a collapse in its fighting capacity. Such resilience raises questions about whether the threat posed by ballistic missiles is overstated. Ballistic missiles have long been feared for their potential to strike without warning, following a high-arcing path before slamming into targets at high speed. This threat, dating back to World War II with Nazi Germany's V-2 rockets, has only grown as more countries—31 at present—develop their own missile capabilities. Yet, history shows that ballistic missiles, despite their lethality, rarely decide wars on their own. Whether in the 1980s Iran-Iraq conflict, the 2015 Houthi missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, or recent conflicts involving Israel and Ukraine, missile barrages have inflicted damage but failed to break the will of the targeted populations. Modern ballistic missiles are more accurate than their historical counterparts, aided by advanced guidance systems like GPS. Still, even high-tech missiles often miss precise targets, and the damage inflicted is often limited compared to the massive bombing raids of previous wars. In World War II, for example, Allied forces dropped millions of tons of bombs on Germany without compelling surrender, showing that even overwhelming firepower from the air has its limits. Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, reportedly numbering around 3,000, may seem formidable on paper, but in practice, even a simultaneous launch of all these weapons would face significant interception and accuracy issues. Furthermore, the damage caused by those that do get through would likely be less than a single large-scale bombing raid from the past. Ballistic missiles remain a potent symbol of military power, and their proliferation is a legitimate concern, especially if used to target infrastructure or as a means of political coercion. However, as Iran's attacks on Israel suggest, these weapons alone are unlikely to secure a decisive victory in war.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iran-missile-strikes-on-israel-reveal-limits-of-ballistic-missile-threat-in-modern-warfare	2024-10-14T03:10:16-07:00	
North Korea Attempts to Down South Korean Modern Drone with Old KS-19 Anti-Aircraft Guns	On October 13, 2024, according to Yonhap, North Korea ordered its artillery units, including eight brigades stationed near the South Korean border, to be on high alert and prepared to engage in response to alleged South Korean drone incursions over Pyongyang. North Korea’s General Staff directed these brigades, which reportedly include older KS-19 100mm anti-aircraft guns, to be fully armed and set in wartime configuration. Pyongyang accused South Korea of flying drones over its capital multiple times earlier in the month. In a statement, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry warned that any further incursions would be met with a military response, describing such actions as 'acts of war.'Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link South Korea RQ-101 Songgolmae fixed-wing UAV from Korea Aerospace Industries (Picture source: Wikimedia) Meanwhile, South Korea denied any airspace violations, condemning North Korea's recent use of propaganda balloons and waste-filled devices across the border, which South Korea views as provocations disrupting the security of its border regions. This exchange of accusations has intensified tensions along the Demilitarized Zone, with both countries expanding their military drone programs. While North Korea has made drone development a strategic priority, recently unveiling a suicide attack drone, South Korea is preparing to counter potential escalations with its own advancements in drone technology. The South Korean military employs a variety of High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE) drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, primarily to monitor North Korean military activities and potential security threats. These drones play a critical role in enhancing South Korea’s border surveillance, maritime monitoring, and intelligence capabilities. Among the HALE assets is the RQ-4 Global Hawk, capable of operating at high altitudes for extended periods, providing broad-area coverage with real-time intelligence over long distances. For medium-altitude operations, South Korea utilizes MALE drones such as the KUS-FT, developed by Korea Aerospace Industries. The RQ-101 Songgolmae is a fixed-wing UAV designed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) primarily for reconnaissance. With a wingspan of 6.4 meters and a maximum takeoff weight of 290 kg, it has a range of up to 200 km and an endurance of approximately 6 hours. This drone is equipped with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras and GPS/INS navigation systems, which allow it to gather high-resolution images and real-time intelligence over long distances. Operating at altitudes of up to 4,500 meters, the Songgolmae is especially useful for monitoring the heavily militarized border areas, giving South Korea crucial surveillance capabilities without risking personnel​. South Korea, in collaboration with Boeing, is working on a new High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) drone development project designed to enhance its surveillance capabilities, particularly for monitoring North Korea. This initiative stems from a Memorandum of Understanding signed between South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Boeing in April 2023, aiming to build a South Korean-manufactured HALE UAV that benefits from Boeing's design expertise and technological support. The joint project intends to position South Korea at the forefront of advanced UAV production, with a focus on developing a model suited for long-endurance reconnaissance missions. South Korea's Air Force operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, a high-altitude, long-endurance platform developed by Northrop Grumman. The RQ-4 operates at altitudes up to 60,000 feet with a range of over 12,000 miles, equipped with advanced radar and infrared sensors for long-range surveillance. It can remain airborne for over 30 hours, covering extensive areas and providing high-resolution imaging, making it a valuable tool for observing North Korea's military movements. South Korea also uses KUS-FT drones, developed domestically by Korea Aerospace Industries. The KUS-FT operates at medium altitudes, up to 30,000 feet, with an endurance of around 24 hours. Equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors, it is designed for tactical reconnaissance and can conduct close monitoring along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), complementing the broader surveillance provided by HALE drones like the Global Hawk. South Korea’s drones are tailored for intelligence-gathering missions that allow for extended coverage of North Korean activities, including potential missile launch sites, military movements, and cross-border provocations. By leveraging drones with high-definition imaging, infrared vision, and real-time data links, the South Korean military can maintain a continuous, low-profile surveillance presence. These capabilities reduce the need for manned flights, minimizing risk while maximizing reach and responsiveness. Furthermore, United States operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones in collaboration with South Korea to monitor North Korean activities across the Korean Peninsula. These high-altitude, long-endurance UAVs are stationed at Sacheon Air Base in South Gyeongsang Province, where they serve as a crucial part of South Korea's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Delivered through a strategic partnership, four Global Hawks were supplied to South Korea's Air Force between 2019 and 2020, as part of a defense initiative to enhance South Korea’s monitoring capabilities against regional threats​. The Global Hawk drones, designed by Northrop Grumman, are equipped with high-resolution synthetic aperture radar and electro-optical/infrared sensors, allowing them to capture detailed images of large areas, including North Korean military installations and missile sites. This UAV fleet is capable of covering up to 100,000 square kilometers in a single flight, which is approximately the size of South Korea, enabling comprehensive border surveillance and intelligence sharing between U.S. and South Korean forces​. This collaboration not only enhances South Korea’s situational awareness along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) but also strengthens interoperability with U.S. forces, who are stationed in the region as part of a defense alliance. These joint efforts aim to maintain a high level of readiness against North Korean provocations, ensuring a rapid response to emerging threats in the region. North Korea’s recent provocations include frequent missile tests and the development of drones, which serve both strategic deterrence and as direct responses to perceived threats from South Korea and the U.S. In 2023 alone, North Korea test-fired a variety of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. The Hwasong-17, one of its most advanced ICBMs, is estimated to have a range of up to 15,000 kilometers and can potentially carry multiple warheads or countermeasures designed to evade missile defenses. This long-range capability adds to North Korea’s growing arsenal of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles that can target South Korea and U.S. bases in Japan. Additionally, North Korea has enhanced its maneuverable, solid-fueled missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept, posing a significant challenge to South Korean and U.S. missile defenses. Beyond missiles, North Korea has also advanced its drone program, often utilizing these unmanned aerial systems as tools of psychological and military provocation. The North has deployed drones capable of surveillance and, potentially, small payloads. This was evident in recent incidents where North Korean drones allegedly crossed into South Korean airspace, heightening tensions on the peninsula. Combined with North Korea’s efforts to send balloons with propaganda and waste materials into the South, these drones add a new layer to Pyongyang’s tactics, aiming to provoke and destabilize without direct engagement, a strategy that allows it to maintain pressure on its adversaries while avoiding immediate military escalation. These provocations underscore North Korea’s commitment to demonstrating its military capabilities and maintaining a high-stakes environment in the region. As a reminder on July 27, 2023, North Korea unveiled two new drones, the 'Morning Star-4' and 'Morning Star-9,' which closely resemble the U.S.-designed MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These drones, categorized as High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE), are intended for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and ground-strike missions. Despite significant challenges posed by U.N. sanctions, North Korea appears to have made strides in replicating these advanced models, possibly influenced by prior incidents involving captured U.S. drones in Iran. However, questions remain about the drones’ actual capabilities and North Korea’s access to advanced SATCOM technology, sparking speculation of potential foreign assistance. The capabilities of North Korean artillery brigades to shoot down South Korean surveillance drones are limited due to the anti-aircraft equipment available. North Korea primarily uses anti-aircraft guns like the ZU-23 23 mm and the KS-19 100 mm, which are designed to target low-flying aircraft rather than high-altitude drones. These systems lack the precision and tracking abilities needed to effectively engage modern MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) or HALE (High Altitude, Long Endurance) drones used by South Korea. To intercept surveillance drones operating at higher altitudes, North Korea would require modern surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) with radar or infrared guidance, capable of tracking high-speed targets over long distances. Although North Korea possesses older SAMs, such as the Soviet-era SA-2 and SA-3, these systems are not sufficiently accurate to reliably target modern drones. Consequently, South Korean high-altitude drones remain less vulnerable to North Korea’s conventional artillery defenses.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-attempts-to-down-south-korean-modern-drone-with-old-ks-19-anti-aircraft-guns	2024-10-14T02:46:25-07:00	
Turkiye and Serbia Sign Defense Cooperation Agreement Focused on Drone Technology	According to information published by Middle East Monitor on October 12, 2024, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić announced a strategic collaboration between their countries in the defense industry during an official visit to Belgrade.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Bayraktar TB3 Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle. (Picture source: Navy Recognition) This agreement includes joint efforts in military technology, particularly focusing on drones, a sector where Turkey has become a global leader. Erdoğan emphasized that Turkish drone technology, including the renowned Bayraktar TB2 systems, would be an integral part of this cooperation. Turkish Defense Industry in Balkan countries Several Balkan countries have purchased Bayraktar TB2 drones from Türkiye, reflecting the growing military ties between the region and Ankara. Kosovo, which has been working to strengthen its defense capabilities, received its first batch of Bayraktar TB2 drones in July 2023. This acquisition is viewed as a strategic move amid ongoing tensions with Serbia, and it has been reported that Kosovo bought five drones, although the exact number remains unconfirmed​. Albania also joined the ranks of Bayraktar TB2 buyers in 2022, purchasing three drones to support both military and civilian operations, including surveillance and firefighting efforts. Bosnia and Herzegovina recently followed suit, placing an order for at least six Bayraktar TB2 drones in 2024. This move is designed to bolster its defense capabilities amid the complex security dynamics of the Balkans. Turkey’s role is not without challenges. Its involvement in the defense sectors of both Serbia and Kosovo positions it at the center of regional tensions. The sale of advanced weapons to countries in close proximity, often with competing interests, requires a careful diplomatic balance. Turkey has used its military strength and its defense industry to foster partnerships, positioning itself as a reliable supplier of advanced military technology, but it must also be wary of exacerbating existing conflicts. In the Balkans, Turkish arms sales serve not only as an economic driver but also as a tool for increasing Ankara’s regional influence. The Balkan states, many of which are NATO members or aspirants, see Turkish military technology as a valuable addition to their security frameworks. Turkey’s defense industry policy in the Balkans is a calculated mix of economic strategy, geopolitical ambition, and military influence. As Turkey continues to expand its defense exports, its ability to manage the complex political landscape of the Balkans will be crucial to its long-term success in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/turkey-and-serbia-sign-defense-cooperation-agreement-focused-on-drone-technology	2024-10-14T02:15:11-07:00	
Germany Launches Technical Talks with Türkiye for Eurofighter Fighter Jet Sale	With German Chancellor Olaf Scholz scheduled to visit Türkiye on October 19, 2024, Germany has greenlit technical discussions with Türkiye for a potential sale of Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. This decision, taken in a confidential meeting by the German Federal Security Council, marks a shift from Berlin, which had previously blocked the sale over concerns that these aircraft could be used against Kurdish armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase (Picture source: Eurofighter) The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, multi-role combat aircraft developed by a European consortium composed of Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom under Eurofighter GmbH. Used by several European nations and Saudi Arabia, the Typhoon is designed to perform air superiority missions, airspace defense, interdiction, close air support, and reconnaissance. Its delta-wing configuration, combined with advanced control systems and optimized aerodynamic instability, delivers exceptional agility and speed, reaching up to 2,495 km/h. Equipped with two EUROJET EJ200 engines, the Typhoon offers robust power and redundancy for secure operations both in peacetime and in conflict. Technologically, the Typhoon stands out with its CAPTOR radar, a mechanically scanned system that can evolve to AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, providing long-range detection, advanced air-to-ground capability, and enhanced electronic protection. This radar offers a broad field of view optimized for both aerial and ground engagements. The Typhoon’s weaponry includes 13 hardpoints for missiles and bombs, with configurations tailored to mission requirements: air-to-air AMRAAM and ASRAAM missiles, anti-radar and anti-ship missiles, and guided bombs. This weapon system, coupled with advanced piloting controls such as voice-commanded VTAS (Voice Throttle and Stick), maximizes in-flight effectiveness and reduces pilot workload, enabling swift responses in demanding combat scenarios. The Eurofighter consortium, consisting of Germany, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom, fully supports the potential sale of 40 Eurofighters to Türkiye, valued at approximately $5.6 billion. The agreement gained momentum following a meeting between Chancellor Scholz and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the UN General Assembly in New York last month. The technical talks, expected to last about three weeks, will cover aircraft specifications, acquisition stages, personnel training, and maintenance and spare parts management protocols. The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase. Additionally, sources close to the matter indicate that Chancellor Scholz might be seeking an agreement to expedite the repatriation of approximately 15,000 Turkish nationals whose asylum requests were denied in Germany, thereby strengthening ties between Berlin and Ankara. Airbus, one of Eurofighter's main partners, has actively supported efforts to navigate political challenges. Simon Ward, head of Airbus in Türkiye, even suggested that Eurofighters could arrive in Türkiye sooner than anticipated. While the start of technical talks does not guarantee a finalized sale, this move is seen as a significant indication of Germany’s openness amid rising regional tensions, particularly with the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the ongoing Gaza crisis. Turkish defense officials suggest that acquiring the Eurofighter would provide Türkiye’s air force with AESA radar technology for the first time, significantly enhancing its capabilities. Turkish experts view the Eurofighter as an optimal interim solution while Türkiye awaits the integration of its domestic KAAN fighter jet and American F-16 Block 70s into its fleet. The outcome of these talks could also pave the way for broader military-economic partnerships between Germany and Türkiye, a development closely observed by other Eurofighter consortium members. In conclusion, this initiative marks a turning point in bilateral relations and highlights the complexity of defense negotiations in Europe, shaped by geopolitical dynamics and regional security imperatives.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/germany-launches-technical-talks-with-tuerkiye-for-eurofighter-fighter-jet-sale	2024-10-14T02:06:03-07:00	
Australia’s new AS9 Huntsman 155mm howitzer makes first appearance in South Korea for testing phase	As reported by Mason on October 12, 2024, the Australian variant of the K9A1, the AS9 Huntsman, was reportedly observed in South Korea for the first time. It is likely that the 155mm self-propelled howitzer was transported by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development (ADD), which is responsible for developing the K9 Thunder and conducting various testing and evaluation services.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Australian variant of the K9 Thunder, later known as the AS9, is set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, quality assessment tests for mass-produced military products, performance tests for export items, and performance enhancement evaluations. The prospect of Australia acquiring the South Korean K9 Thunder was first publicly discussed in June 2005, when discussions began between Australian and South Korean defense officials about potential trade opportunities, including the K9 Thunder and Australian naval gun ammunition. By August 2009, Samsung Techwin and Raytheon Australia became leading contenders for Australia’s Land 17 artillery replacement program, as other bidders did not provide sufficient detail. Testing of the K9 platform commenced in April 2010, and the vehicle successfully fired the M982 Excalibur, meeting key requirements for the program. The proposed Australian variant, later known as the AS9, was set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, and performance tests for export items. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) In June 2010, the K9 was announced as the preferred option for the Land 17 program. However, funding for the project was redirected due to floods in Queensland in 2011, leading to the program’s cancellation in 2012. In 2019, then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia planned to acquire 30 K9 howitzers and ten K10 ammunition resupply vehicles, although no specific timeline was provided at that time. In September 2020, Australia issued a tender for Hanwha Defense Australia to locally produce 30 K9 variants as part of the Land 8116 Phase 1 project. The Australian variant, based on the Norwegian K9 VIDAR, was to include enhancements first proposed in 2010, alongside up-to-date modifications. In December 2021, the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) and Hanwha Defense Australia formalized a $788 million contract for the production of 30 AS9 howitzers and 15 AS10 armored ammunition resupply vehicles at a new facility in Geelong, Victoria. Hanwha’s Geelong facility, the Hanwha Armoured Vehicle Centre of Excellence (H-ACE), began construction in April 2022. This 150,000-square-meter site includes a 1.5-kilometer test track and various R&amp;D areas, with plans to create 300 jobs for local specialists. Through international partnerships, including a $67 million deal with Norway’s Kongsberg Gruppen for Integrated Combat Solutions (ICS) and a contract with Hanwha Systems worth 20.8 billion KRW, Hanwha Defense Australia has integrated various systems into the AS9. The AS9 Huntsman, a 155mm/52-caliber self-propelled howitzer, has a maximum firing range of 40 kilometers with standard ammunition and can reach up to 60 kilometers with specialized rounds. (Picture source: Australian MoD) Mass production of the AS9 and AS10 began at H-ACE in 2024, and the first deliveries to the Australian Army are expected by 2027. The AS9 includes an enhanced suspension system, additional armor for increased protection, and a fire control system from Kongsberg, which allows for integration with other Australian defense assets. These modifications align with the Australian Army’s specific requirements and distinguish the AS9 from the original K9 Thunder. Capable of firing three rounds in 15 seconds and sustaining a rate of six to eight rounds per minute, the AS9 is also equipped with a semi-automated loading system. The AS9 Huntsman, a 155mm/52-caliber self-propelled howitzer, has a maximum firing range of 40 kilometers with standard ammunition and can reach up to 60 kilometers with specialized rounds. Its mobility allows it to quickly relocate after firing, minimizing exposure to potential counterattacks. Therefore, the Australian Army plans to integrate the AS9 into its artillery units, replacing the existing M777 howitzers starting with the 4th Regiment. The AS9 will support operations with increased range and mobility, while the M777 will continue in roles requiring lightweight, air-mobile artillery. The AS9 can fire multiple rounds timed to arrive on target simultaneously, enhancing operational flexibility. These features, combined with armor improvements and digital control systems, support Australia’s defense modernization objectives. The AS9 Huntsman includes an enhanced suspension system, additional armor for increased protection, and a fire control system from Kongsberg, which distinguish the AS9 from the original K9 Thunder.

South Korea Conducts Live Test of Taurus Missile Amid Rising Tensions with North Korea	Amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the South Korean Air Force (RoKAF) recently conducted live-fire drills featuring the German-designed Taurus missile. This exercise, held on October 8 and 10 over the Yellow Sea, has drawn international attention, especially from Ukraine, which has long expressed interest in acquiring such capabilities to counter Russian forces. These tests underscore Seoul's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid ongoing provocations from North Korea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Republic of Korea Air Force F-15K Slam Eagle, assigned to the 11th Fighter Wing, arrives for Korea Flying Training 2024 at Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, April 12, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) During the exercise, a Taurus missile was launched from an F-15K fighter jet, traveling over 400 kilometers to hit its designated target. A video released by RoKAF documented the entire process, from integrating the missile onto the aircraft to its launch. Beyond these live tests, RoKAF also implemented scenarios to intercept potentially hostile cruise missiles, involving both F-15K and F-35A Lightning II jets, though the exact number of aircraft used was not disclosed. The Taurus missiles demonstrated their ability to identify and track enemy cruise missiles moving at high speed and low altitude. The E-737 early warning and control aircraft played a crucial role, relaying real-time information to other aircraft and the central control center. This exercise, part of a broader training program to counter cruise missile threats, enhances South Korea’s defensive posture as tensions remain high. These missile drills follow a series of provocations from North Korea, including the deployment of propaganda balloons toward South Korea and threats to cut off ground and rail communications. North Korea also announced plans to fortify its border defenses, accusing South Korea and the United States of destabilizing actions. This South Korean military response recalls similar missile tests conducted in 2017 in reaction to North Korea's nuclear tests. The Taurus KEPD-350 missile, developed by Germany's MBDA in collaboration with Saab Bofors Dynamics, is designed for deep-strike missions. With a range exceeding 500 kilometers, it allows engagement of heavily fortified targets from a secure distance. Powered by the Williams P8300-15 turbofan engine, the missile combines precision with fuel efficiency. Its two-stage warhead, MEPHISTO, is engineered to penetrate bunkers and underground structures before detonation, targeting strategic facilities. Equipped with advanced guidance systems, including GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain reference navigation (TRN), the Taurus KEPD-350 maintains high accuracy even in GPS-denied environments. This missile, weighing 1,400 kg and measuring 5.1 meters in length, can be deployed on various platforms, including the F-15K and Eurofighter Typhoon, enhancing South Korea’s strike capabilities. Integrating the Taurus missile into South Korea’s F-15K Slam Eagle fleet aligns with its 'kill chain' strategy, aimed at quickly neutralizing North Korean command centers and fortified positions housing nuclear or conventional missiles in the event of conflict. In 2023, South Korean defense firm LIG Nex1 and Taurus Systems signed an MoU to adapt the KEPD-350K missile for the FA-50 light attack aircraft, further expanding Seoul’s long-range strike options. In parallel, South Korea conducted interception exercises involving KF-16 and F-35A fighter jets coordinated with E-737 'Peace Eye' surveillance aircraft. These early warning aircraft, capable of tracking thousands of targets simultaneously, play a central role in detecting and neutralizing low-altitude cruise missiles that are challenging to detect and intercept. The F-35A’s advanced sensors and avionics are designed for effective operations in contested airspace, providing a higher probability of intercepting enemy missiles before they reach their targets. The KF-16, an upgraded version of the American F-16, is equipped with sophisticated radar and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, allowing precise interception of aerial threats. These exercises, part of a multi-layered defense strategy, highlight South Korea's readiness to respond swiftly to North Korean threats, which often involve low-altitude, fast-moving projectiles designed to evade detection. By showcasing advanced weaponry such as the Taurus missile, South Korea sends a clear message of deterrence to North Korea.

US Army accelerates M113 replacement with new $184 Million AMPV order	On October 9, 2024, BAE Systems received a $184 million contract modification from the U.S. Army for an additional 48 Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV), building on the existing full-rate production agreement. The AMPV Family of Vehicles (FoV) is being introduced to replace the older M113 series in the U.S. Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), offering modernized capabilities in survivability, mobility, and interoperability. The contract modification will support the Army’s plan to expand its fleet of AMPVs, thereby modernizing and improving the operational flexibility of the ABCTs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV) program was initiated with a $383 million EMD contract in 2014, producing 29 prototypes before entering low-rate production to deliver 289 vehicles by 2020. (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV lineup includes five specialized variants, each designed for specific roles: the M1283 General Purpose (GP), M1284 Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), M1285 Medical Treatment Vehicle (MTV), M1286 Mission Command (MC), and M1287 Mortar Carrier. The M1283 GP variant is utilized for resupply, maintenance, and casualty evacuation operations. The M1284 MEV is equipped for medical evacuation, accommodating up to six ambulatory personnel or four patients on litters. The M1285 MTV functions as a mobile medical treatment facility, supporting battlefield care with equipment typically found in civilian ambulances. The M1286 MC variant supports mission command functions, enhancing command, control, and communication within the ABCT. The M1287 Mortar Carrier provides indirect fire support using the M121 Mortar System and the M95 Mortar Fire Control System. The AMPV program has been pursued to address the limitations of the M113, a platform that has been in service since the 1960s. Although versatile, the M113 has shown vulnerabilities in modern combat scenarios, particularly during the Iraq War where urban warfare tactics exposed its weaknesses. The Army subsequently adopted Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for active service. However, the AMPV is intended to offer enhanced off-road mobility, similar to that of the M2 Bradley and M1 Abrams, making it more suitable for a variety of operational environments.

(Picture source: US DoD) This follow-on order represents the Army’s shift in acquisition priorities, following the cancellation of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. Initially, the GCV was intended to replace M2 Bradley vehicles within the ABCT, but cost constraints led to a preference for the AMPV program, estimated to cost over $5 billion, compared to the $37 billion projected for the GCV program. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office highlighted the AMPV as a more feasible option, and the Army’s FY 2015 budget proposal reflected a reallocation of resources to focus on AMPV production. BAE Systems, in response to the contract modification, has expanded its production capabilities, particularly at its York, Pennsylvania facility. Alongside facilities in South Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, and Michigan, this network is designed to meet current and projected demand for AMPVs. The expansion aligns with the Army’s objective to gradually increase production, reaching full-rate production after an initial low-rate production phase that began in 2018. Production plans include an incremental ramp-up, from 57 vehicles in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 to 122 units annually by FY 2026 and FY 2027, before reducing in later years. The AMPV program’s phased approach began with a $383 million Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract awarded to BAE Systems in 2014. This phase produced 29 prototypes, followed by a low-rate production phase to supply 289 vehicles by 2020. General Dynamics initially contested the AMPV requirements, claiming the design favored the BAE Bradley chassis. However, the Army Materiel Command dismissed the protest, stating that BAE’s manufacturing of the M113 and Bradley provided certain logistical advantages that did not constitute preferential treatment. The AMPV’s modular design aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. (Picture source: US DoD) Following this decision, General Dynamics did not pursue further action through the Government Accountability Office but continued to advocate a mixed fleet concept to Congress. This proposal suggested combining tracked Bradley and wheeled Stryker vehicles, which General Dynamics argued could enhance mission flexibility and reduce life-cycle costs. The AMPV’s modular design allows for future upgrades in communications and electronic systems, supporting the Army’s strategy of leveraging commercial off-the-shelf components. This approach aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. By allowing for incremental upgrades, the Army plans to incorporate new technologies over time, including satellite communications, further integrating the AMPV into the digital battlefield. Looking forward, the AMPV program includes potential future variants designed for counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) roles. One such variant may feature the Leonardo DRS Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) turret, equipped with a 30mm XM914 cannon, a 7.62mm M240 machine gun, and Stinger missile launchers. This development aligns with the Army’s intent to adapt the AMPV for a range of defense scenarios within the ABCT framework, while also considering international interest in the platform. The AMPV shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for the US Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs). (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV continues to replace the M113 in Army units, such as the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division, which recently replaced over 130 M113s with AMPVs after completing necessary training. This replacement supports the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Modernization Priority, with AMPVs designed to withstand threats from mines, improvised explosive devices, and direct fire. Their design shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for ABCTs. BAE Systems has also developed additional variants to fulfill specific mission requirements. Recently, a turreted mortar variant was introduced, equipped with the Patria NEMO 120mm remote-controlled mortar system. This variant provides responsive fire support within the ABCT. With the full-rate production now underway, BAE Systems will continue to supply AMPVs to the U.S. Army, fulfilling both current operational needs and potential future requirements as the Army transitions its fleet to more modernized combat vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-accelerates-m113-replacement-with-new-184-million-ampv-order	2024-10-14T00:26:14-07:00

Breaking News: US Authorizes Deployment of THAAD Air Defense Missile in Israel to Counter Missile Threats from Iran	On Sunday, October 13, 2024, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had authorized the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to Israel at the direction of President Joe Biden. This move comes in response to recent escalations, including Iran's ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October of this year. Ryder emphasized that the deployment would strengthen Israel’s air defense capabilities amid heightened regional tensions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A U.S. Air Force Airman unloads an American THAAD air defense missile system from a C-17 Globemaster III at Nevatim Air Base, Israel, on March 1, 2019. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) This is not the United States' first deployment of THAAD in the region. President Biden directed a similar deployment last year, following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, to protect American troops and interests. The U.S. also deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 as part of a joint training and integrated air defense exercise. The new deployment adds to Israel’s already robust air defense systems, which include the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow 3 systems, designed to intercept threats ranging from short-range rockets to long-range missiles. THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase—right before impact—providing a crucial layer of defense against missile threats. THAAD’s key strength lies in its ability to intercept threats at both high altitudes and long ranges, making it particularly effective against ballistic missiles. The system can engage targets at ranges of up to 200 kilometers and at altitudes exceeding 150 kilometers, far beyond the reach of most missile defense systems, allowing it to neutralize warheads before they reenter the atmosphere. Iran possesses one of the largest and most diverse missile arsenals in the Middle East, comprising a wide range of short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles. The country has developed several missile systems, such as the Shahab, Ghadr, and Sejjil series, capable of striking targets throughout the region, including Israel and U.S. military bases. Some of Iran’s missiles, like the Shahab-3, have a range of over 1,000 kilometers, while more advanced systems like the Sejjil-2 have ranges that extend beyond 2,000 kilometers, potentially reaching parts of Europe. These missiles can carry conventional or, in a worst-case scenario, nuclear warheads, though Iran insists its missile program is defensive. In addition to ballistic missiles, Iran has also developed cruise missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept due to their low-altitude flight paths. Iran’s missile capabilities, combined with its ability to produce and modify these systems domestically, pose a significant strategic threat in the region, especially to adversaries like Israel and the United States. These missiles have been central to Iran’s military strategy, allowing it to project power and retaliate against potential threats without relying solely on conventional forces. Against Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, which includes a variety of long-range and medium-range systems, THAAD offers a significant defensive advantage. Its ability to intercept missiles at such high altitudes ensures that the debris or any remaining missile fragments fall harmlessly outside of populated areas. Paired with Israel’s existing air defense systems, THAAD adds another crucial layer of protection to Israel’s multi-tiered defense strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-us-authorizes-deployment-of-thaad-battery-in-israel-to-counter-missile-threats-from-iran	2024-10-13T14:39:46-07:00	
Breaking News: Ukrainian F-16 Fighter Wins First Air-to-Air Fight Shoots Down Russian Su-34	According to several reports published on social networks on October 13, 2024, an F-16 fighter jet operated by the Ukrainian Air Force shot down a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber. This victory, Ukraine's first in air-to-air combat using the F-16, was achieved with the advanced AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, known for its infrared homing and high maneuverability. The AIM-9X, widely regarded for its lethality, gives the F-16 a significant edge in dogfights, able to engage enemy aircraft at high angles and within close-range combat scenarios.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Historic Moment: Ukrainian F-16 Claims First Air-to-Air Victory by Downing Russian Su-34 Fighter-Bomber The F-16 Fighting Falcon is renowned for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and an array of precision-guided missiles. One of its standout features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing enhanced detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry a range of air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfighting. Thanks to its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X's ability to lock onto targets from extreme angles makes it particularly lethal in close-quarters combat. This mix of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate in both long-range and short-range engagements​. Compared to other contemporary fighter aircraft, such as Russia’s Su-35 and MiG-31, the F-16 has certain advantages regarding agility and electronic warfare capabilities. While the Su-35 boasts superior long-range radar and missile systems, the F-16 compensates with its superior maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures to evade radar-guided threats. This agility, coupled with advanced helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to engage targets by simply looking at them, gives the F-16 a distinct advantage in close combat​. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable for a range of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, however, its ability to engage multiple targets at various ranges and its integrated defensive measures provides a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While Russian aircraft like the Su-35 may have superior radar range, the F-16’s electronic warfare and countermeasures systems, combined with its superior dogfighting agility and modern missile systems like the AIM-9X, allow it to compete effectively against modern Russian fighters in both defensive and offensive air operations​. The AIM-9X Sidewinder missile is a state-of-the-art air-to-air weapon that has revolutionized modern dogfighting. Its infrared (heat-seeking) guidance system allows it to detect and lock onto the heat signature of an enemy aircraft, typically from the engines, making it highly effective against fast-moving targets. What sets the AIM-9X apart from previous iterations is its 'high off-boresight' capability. This means that the pilot doesn’t need to be directly facing the enemy to fire; the missile can target and hit aircraft even at extreme angles relative to the jet's flight path. This off-boresight capability is paired with a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system, enabling the pilot to simply look at a target to guide the missile. This feature drastically reduces the reaction time needed in close air engagements, a critical advantage when pilots maneuver at high speeds and in high-threat environments. Moreover, the AIM-9X is known for its agility and ability to perform sharp turns, allowing it to stay locked onto highly agile enemy fighters. In addition to the AIM-9X, the F-16 itself offers a combination of speed, radar systems, and maneuverability that make it a formidable platform for air-to-air combat. Equipped with beyond-visual-range missiles (such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM) alongside the AIM-9X, the F-16 can engage enemies both at close range and from distances where visual contact is not required. This first victory in air-to-air combat for Ukraine marks a significant milestone in the conflict, demonstrating the growing capability of the Ukrainian Air Force thanks to NATO's continued support in terms of advanced weaponry and pilot training. The F-16, paired with the AIM-9X, offers a significant edge in aerial warfare against Russian aircraft like the Su-34, which are typically less maneuverable in close engagements​.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-wins-first-air-to-air-fight-shoots-down-russian-su-34	2024-10-13T08:20:31-07:00

By aiming for a more stable future and opening new sales opportunities, NHI plans ambitious upgrades, increased reliability, and supply chain restructuring to ensure the NH90’s long-term usage. This new strategy leverages the helicopter’s untapped potential and targeted improvements, despite major challenges, including contract cancellations, delivery delays, and high operating costs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Royal New Zealand Air Force NH90 helicopter lands to deploy soldiers from Australia’s 7th Battalion for land clearing and fuel reduction on Brindabella Mountain, west of Canberra, on 20 January 2020 (Picture source: Australian MoD) The NH90 helicopter, developed to meet NATO’s stringent standards by a consortium comprising Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters, and Fokker Aerostructures, is available in two main versions: the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) and the NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH). It features a fully composite structure and integrated mission systems for complex land and sea operations, day and night. Equipped with advanced technologies such as fly-by-wire controls and a digital cockpit, it reduces pilot workload, enhancing efficiency for autonomous and mixed-team missions. In terms of armament, the NH90 can be configured for anti-submarine (ASW) and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) missions with anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, sonar systems, and lateral machine guns for maritime security operations. Its modular design and large transport capacity (up to 20 soldiers or NATO-standard pallets) also make it a strategic tool for tactical transport, logistical support, and special operations, including counter-terrorism and disaster relief missions. Currently used by multiple countries in various operational contexts, including combat missions in Afghanistan, Mali, and Iraq, as well as disaster relief in New Zealand, the Philippines, and Europe, the NH90 combines low radar and infrared signatures with advanced self-protection systems (chaff/flare dispensers, threat detectors). This agile and compact helicopter is built to withstand demanding environments, making it a valuable asset for modern military forces. Aloccio asserted that the NH90 could remain operational for 'at least another 50 to 60 years,' a claim he described as a 'fact,' based on the substantial investments already made by current customers. Speaking at an Airbus Helicopters press day in Marignane, France, Aloccio emphasized the company’s commitment to developing a 'Block 2' NH90, in discussions with clients for nearly a year. Although the main technologies for this upgrade are still being defined, discussions include increasing payload capacity and integrating drone cooperation capabilities to meet growing demand for joint operations. Simultaneously, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands approved the 'Software Release 3' upgrade for the NH90 last June. This upgrade will integrate the Link 22 datalink, Leonardo’s LEOSS-T electro-optical gimbal, new sonar equipment, and additional armament capabilities, allowing the NH90 to meet modern operational needs and enhance its versatility in the military helicopter market.

The Netherlands’ recent announcement of additional NH90 purchases last September highlights this momentum, as does expressed interest from several Middle Eastern countries. NHI aims to capture new markets by meeting potential customers’ expectations. Nonetheless, past challenges have not been overlooked. Aloccio acknowledged that supply chain difficulties had long hampered the NH90 program, with delays in part delivery and underestimation of certain client expectations. To address these, NHI implemented specific action plans for each supplier and simplified maintenance processes to improve fleet availability. By increasing critical parts deliveries by 15% last year and targeting an additional 15–20% improvement this year, NHI is working to resolve logistical issues that have impacted its reputation. Aloccio noted that essential parts, including main gearboxes, blades, and mission equipment, are partly manufactured by NHI-associated companies, underlining the consortium’s direct responsibility for some of the issues encountered. These industrial challenges have had significant financial impacts on NHI, leading Australia, Norway, and Sweden to cancel contracts despite aircraft deliveries. In June 2022, Norway ended its NH90 program, with Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram stating that efforts to make the helicopter operational were insufficient to meet the armed forces’ requirements. Consequently, Oslo is seeking compensation of nearly 5 billion kroner ($525 million), while NHI refuted Norway’s claims, describing the contract termination as 'legally unfounded.' The situation between NHI and Norway has escalated into legal proceedings after failed mediation attempts. 'They took us to court, and we are also pursuing legal action,' said Aloccio, explaining that the two parties had merged their claims into a single case. The matter will be heard in an Oslo court next year, but for now, Norway’s fleet of 14 NH90s remains in storage, unused since the program’s cancellation. In Australia, a €250 million buy-back program for MRH-90 Taipan spare parts is underway following Canberra’s decision to retire its MRH-90 fleet prematurely after a fatal accident during Exercise Talisman Sabre in July 2023. Around 300 parts have already been returned to NHI, marking the beginning of a complex process to wind down the program in Australia. In contrast, Sweden has seen a notable improvement in NH90 fleet availability, with flight hours increasing by 60% between January and August 2022 and the same period in 2023. Nevertheless, Stockholm has shown no indication of reversing its decision to abandon the program, instead moving forward with the acquisition of 12 additional UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/nhindustries-strives-to-stabilize-future-of-nh90-helicopter-despite-past-challenges	2024-10-10T06:25:39-07:00

India Showcases Rafale Jet Capability to Intercept High-Altitude Chinese Spy Balloons	The Indian Air Force (IAF) recently conducted an exercise to demonstrate its ability to intercept targets representative of Chinese spy balloons at very high altitudes. Deploying one of its thirty-six Rafale jets, the IAF successfully engaged a simulated target at over 55,000 feet or approximately 16.7 km altitude. According to a source cited by the Times of India, this operation marks a significant milestone for India, proving its air force’s capability to destroy such targets in previously unexplored flight zones for these types of missions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) India’s Rafale, first delivered in 2020 under a contract signed with France in 2016, is a versatile combat aircraft designed for high-altitude operations, extended range, and high payload capacity. With a maximum operational ceiling of 55,000 feet, the Rafale enables the IAF to maintain heightened vigilance against potential aerial incursions, including in upper airspace. Equipped for air-to-air and ground attack missions, the Rafale can carry a broad array of guided and unguided munitions, offering substantial flexibility. This operation comes as interest in very high-altitude security intensifies, particularly since the downing of a Chinese spy balloon by the US Air Force over American waters in 2023. This incident highlighted the strategic importance of this layer of airspace, which remains under-regulated due to a lack of consensus on the boundary between airspace and outer space. The Chinese balloon, measuring nearly 60 meters in diameter and equipped with a 900 kg payload, demonstrated high-altitude intelligence-gathering capabilities. However, US authorities stated that no significant data was collected during its passage. To prevent further intrusions, NORAD recalibrated its radars in March, enabling the interception of an aerostat at over 43,000 feet above Utah. Although this object posed no direct threat, vigilance remains essential, and other Chinese balloons have been observed near Taiwan. Given its own tensions with China, particularly concerning the Arunachal Pradesh region, India has been preparing for potential incursions of Chinese balloons into its airspace, though no official comment was made on a similar sighting over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2022. During this recent operation, the Indian Rafale was armed with Meteor and MICA missiles, capable of striking targets at ranges of 200 km and 80 km, respectively. No details were disclosed on the tactics employed to intercept the target at such a high altitude, which represents the Rafale’s operational ceiling. This demonstration echoes the capabilities affirmed by General Stéphane Mille, Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, in 2022, who stated that France also possesses the capability to intercept such devices. Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. This mix of Russian, French, and indigenous technology enables the IAF to maintain diverse and robust intervention capabilities. India is also considering expanding its Rafale fleet, with plans to acquire an additional 26 aircraft, primarily for its navy, which would strengthen India’s maritime defense capabilities. This potential expansion demonstrates India’s confidence in the Rafale, which has proven effective in high-altitude exercises and national security scenarios. The international context underscores the growing importance of very high-altitude protection, a domain that major powers are actively exploring to ensure enhanced surveillance and counter emerging threats. Beyond the technical dimension, the IAF’s exercise shows India’s determination to defend its airspace from any form of unwanted surveillance, affirming its sovereignty and increasing control over an area of airspace that has so far been sparsely utilized.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/india-showcases-rafale-jet-capability-to-intercept-high-altitude-chinese-spy-balloons-2	2024-10-09T02:18:49-07:00

L3Harris Explores Maritime Version of Vampire Counter-Drone Defense System	Defense technology manufacturer L3Harris is exploring a maritime version of its Vampire counter-drone defense system to enhance naval protection against airborne threats. Initially designed as a truck-mounted platform to provide low-cost precision defense for ground forces, the Vampire gained recognition in 2022 as one of the first weapon systems supplied to Ukraine by the Pentagon. Simple and durable in design, the Vampire combines widely available 2.75mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Systems (APKWS) rockets from BAE Systems with an L3Harris Wescam MX-10D digital sensor equipped with a laser designator. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield (Picture source: L3Harris) L3Harris has announced the adaptation of this system into a version intended to provide an anti-drone solution for ships at sea. According to Jason Lambert, president of the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance division at L3Harris, demonstrations for maritime use are currently underway, with a version of the Vampire deployed on ships. These tests are taking place amid repeated drone and cruise missile attacks targeting U.S. warships in the Red Sea over the past year, described by Pentagon officials as the most intense naval combat involving the U.S. since World War II. Although combat vessels are equipped with multi-layered air defense systems, these systems primarily rely on costly missiles, of which ships can carry only limited quantities. Each Raytheon SM-2 missile used by the U.S. Navy costs approximately $2 million, while the larger SM-6 model exceeds $4 million. In contrast, the smaller and less expensive APKWS rockets used in the Vampire system offer a cost-effective option between long-range missiles and close-range defensive guns, optimizing cost per shot. The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield. By deploying, for example, four such autonomous vessels equipped with numerous rockets around a single main ship, L3Harris envisions an additional layer of protection against attacks. These Vampire units would be remotely controlled from the primary vessel, with human operators managing targeting and rocket guidance. The company is also examining the possibility of incorporating autonomy into the system to facilitate target identification. The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks (Picture source: L3Harris) The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks. Over the past year, U.S. warships have faced dozens of armed drone strikes conducted in saturation waves, which have been intercepted by naval air defenses and carrier-based fighters. Despite these efforts, civilian ships have been impacted, with some even sinking. Since deploying the Vampire in Ukraine, L3Harris has implemented several enhancements, including the addition of proximity fuses on APKWS rockets, eliminating the need for direct hits to neutralize targets. According to Lambert, feedback from Ukraine regarding the Vampire’s performance in combat has been 'extremely positive.' The Ukraine conflict has underscored the critical role of drones in modern warfare, with both sides deploying small drones extensively for reconnaissance, artillery adjustment, and anti-personnel and anti-armor strikes. Russia has also used waves of armed drones and cruise missiles to target Ukrainian civilian areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/l3harris-explores-maritime-version-of-vampire-counter-drone-defense-system	2024-10-09T01:30:49-07:00

Greece purchases 592 US-made Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions for Special Forces	According to Doureios on October 10, 2024, Greece plans to acquire 592 units of Switchblade 300 Block 20 and Switchblade 600 loitering munitions from the United States. The Hellenic Parliament’s Special Permanent Committee on Armaments and Contracts approved this procurement on September 17, 2024, as part of a broader defense enhancement initiative.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Most of these Switchblade loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. (Picture source: AeroVironment) Greece's decision follows a series of strategic evaluations that began in December 2023, when the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA) approved a related study for the acquisition, upgrade, and modernization of military equipment. Initial considerations involved two companies: the Israeli firm Aeronautics, which offered the Orbiter 1K, and the American company AeroVironment, which manufactures the Switchblade. However, in late 2023, Greece opted solely for the Switchblade, a choice influenced by a shift in funding priorities. The initial plan to procure used AAV7A1 amphibious armored vehicles from the United States was 'frozen,' with the allocated funds redirected to the loitering munitions program. Specifically, $25 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) credits, provided under the U.S. European Recapitalization Incentive Program (ERIP), were repurposed to cover part of the Switchblade procurement costs. This funding was initially available to support Greece's transition away from its BMP-1 armored vehicles of Soviet origin. Additionally, Greece received a further $30 million in FMF credits as part of U.S. assistance for Greece’s support of Ukraine. Combined, these credits amount to approximately two-thirds of the €75.2 million total cost of the loitering munitions procurement, reducing Greece’s direct financial outlay. The acquisition involves both the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 models, which together total 592 units. Most of these loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 300 is a small, expendable loitering munition designed to provide platoon-sized infantry units with precision strike capabilities. This UAV assists units under enemy fire by engaging long-range targets, following a pre-programmed path, and allowing operators to redirect its course en route. It has been deployed to destroy light-armored vehicles and personnel, and it can detonate mid-flight if necessary. Utilizing a Ground Control Station (GCS) compatible with other AeroVironment UAVs, such as the Wasp, RQ-11 Raven, and RQ-20 Puma, the Switchblade 300 can be coordinated with other drones to locate and attack targets. Its forward-firing warhead minimizes collateral damage, with an option to adjust detonation height mid-flight. The system is considered a loitering munition rather than a UAV, as it is not recoverable and is controlled by a fly-by-radio frequency signal. Additionally, it has been paired with SRC Inc.’s software and counter-drone technologies, enhancing its capability to intercept hostile UAVs. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. With a gross weight of around 8 pounds, it supports land, sea, and mobile platforms, allowing rapid deployment in under two minutes. The Block 20 also features an improved Digital Data Link (DDL) for secure, encrypted communication, reducing signal interception risks, enabling concurrent operations of multiple Switchblade systems, and supporting extended range operations through additional UAVs. The Block 20 includes a Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL), which can remotely launch several units in configurations from 2 to 20 rounds, with reloading times of under 30 seconds per round. This configuration supports base defense and facilitates 'sensor-to-shooter' operations by transmitting mission plans from other AeroVironment UAVs. The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. It can travel up to 40 kilometers in 20 minutes, then loiter for another 20 minutes, giving it a total range of 80 kilometers. Its warhead is based on the Javelin anti-tank missile, and it operates at a speed of 185 kilometers per hour during the terminal phase of its flight. The Switchblade 600 is controlled through a tablet-based system with autonomous and manual modes, secured by encrypted data links and anti-spoofing GPS. It is also compatible with a pocket DDL module for longer-range engagements. As part of the Army's Single Multi-Mission Attack Missile development program, AeroVironment has been able to scale production to manufacture up to 6,000 Switchblade 600 units annually. This model can also be configured for a six-pack vehicle-mounted launcher or air-launch options, broadening its potential deployment scenarios. The agreement, valued at 3.47 billion euros, includes the procurement of 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters. (Picture source: US DoD) Greece’s procurement of these munitions is part of its larger ten-year defense spending strategy, which includes plans to acquire 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters, from the United States and a fourth Belharra frigate from France. The Switchblades are also intended to complement other weapons systems in Greece’s inventory, such as the Spike anti-tank missiles recently purchased from Israel, which will be stationed on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. In addition, Greece is developing its own drone and anti-drone technologies as part of a broader focus on modernizing its defense capabilities. The choice to procure Switchblade munitions directly from the United States rather than through domestic production has raised questions regarding the Greek defense industry’s capacity for developing similar technologies. While some efforts have been made to advance indigenous loitering munition projects, these remain at the initial design or early development stages. The Greek Armed Forces' reliance on foreign partners reflects current operational requirements that domestic capabilities have not yet met. This loitering munitions acquisition aligns with ongoing U.S.-Greece defense cooperation and has received approval from Greece's top foreign and defense decision-making body, the Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defense (KYSEA). The decision situates Greece’s defense procurement within the context of its relations with NATO allies and broader strategic objectives, as well as ongoing regional tensions with Turkey over maritime boundaries, airspace, and resource rights in the Aegean Sea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-purchases-592-us-made-switchblade-300-and-600-loitering-munitions-for-special-forces	2024-10-09T00:01:53-07:00

The transmission typically operates in automatic mode but can switch to manual for specialized off-road conditions or in case of an automatic mode failure, providing versatile operational capabilities. The LTTV also boasts a theoretical range of 1,200 km, making it suitable for long-duration missions. Earlier this year, Jankel, which also manufactures the Fox RRV (Rapid Reaction Vehicle) used by the Belgian Special Operations Group, faced critical financial issues, initiating a judicial restructuring process on March 8 to resolve its financial situation. This raised concerns about the company’s ability to fulfill its 2018 commitment to the Belgian army, involving a €67 million contract for 199 light troop transport vehicles (LTTV) under the 'Wolf' designation. These vehicles are intended to replace aging Unimog models, contributing to enhanced transport and logistical capabilities within the Belgian armed forces. After securing a 2015 contract to supply the Belgian Ministry of Defense with over 100 Fox Rapid Reaction Vehicles (RRVs), Jankel obtained a second major contract to deliver a new fleet of specialized tactical vehicles under the LTTV program. Jankel’s engineers developed the LTTV to offer modular, mission-adaptable functionality through interchangeable mission modules that allow configuration changes based on operational needs (Picture source: Army Recognition) Jankel’s engineers developed the LTTV to offer modular, mission-adaptable functionality through interchangeable mission modules that allow configuration changes based on operational needs.

Psychologically, the incident demonstrates the reach and capabilities of Ukrainian military intelligence and special forces. This could lower morale within the Russian military and boost confidence among Ukrainian forces and their supporters. It reflects a shift towards asymmetrical warfare tactics, where unconventional methods are employed to target high-value assets, thereby altering the traditional dynamics of the conflict.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-baltic-fleet-minesweeper-disabled-in-ukrainian-sabotage-in-kaliningrad	2024-10-08T06:47:03-07:00	
Bundeswehr’s New Reconnaissance Vehicle Korsak Would Be Based on Piranha 6×6	The Bundeswehr is preparing to renew its fleet of reconnaissance vehicles for its military intelligence forces, with the Spähfahrzeug Next Generation project, or 'Korsak,' reportedly progressing on the Piranha 6×6 platform from General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS), as revealed by Hartpunkt. Selected over competitors including Rheinmetall’s Fuchs Evolution and KNDS’s Patria CAVS, the Piranha 6×6 outperformed its rivals during a rigorous bidding process. However, final vehicle approval will require the resolution of appeal periods followed by a parliamentary review of the '€25 million proposal.' If on schedule, the contract may be finalized by late 2024 or early 2025, marking it as a second Bundeswehr project involving the Piranha platform. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications (Picture source: GDELS) The Korsak project aims to partially replace the light, four-wheeled Fennek vehicles currently used by reconnaissance units. According to the Bundeswehr, up to 252 vehicles may be ordered, with an initial order of 92 units confirmed. The first two prototypes are anticipated by 2026, pending a swift contract conclusion. Production delivery of the remaining 90 vehicles would follow in 2027 and 2028, with an option for an additional 162 units. Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications. Compliant with Korsak project requirements, this version is expected to include amphibious capabilities, though it may reduce armored protection to STANAG 4569 Level 2, thereby optimizing mobility with a favorable power-to-weight ratio. The Piranha 6×6 features a unique engine configuration for a reconnaissance vehicle, placing the engine to the driver’s right, unlike the traditional rear placement. This design maximizes roof space for turret and sensor systems, enhancing weapon reach. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets, as showcased at Eurosatory 2024. This cannon provides variable firing modes and a rate of up to 600 rounds per minute. The initial version of the Piranha I 6×6 dates back to 1972, having been adopted by the Swiss Army and produced under license in Chile and Canada. The Canadian version is known as the AVGP and LAV I. Some Chilean Piranha I units were fitted with a 60 mm IMI HVMS (Hyper Velocity Medium Support) gun acquired in 1980, while Swiss Army models included the NM142 turret, capable of launching TOW anti-tank guided missiles. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets (Picture source: Swiss MoD) The latest model, Piranha V, was introduced in the early 2010s. Designed to protect against medium-caliber ballistic threats, it includes a modern electronic architecture for integrating various weapon systems, from medium-caliber automatic cannons to large-caliber fire-support guns. The Piranha V meets current mobility demands on challenging terrain, equipped with a powerful motor and independent suspension, allowing a top speed of 100 km/h and a range of 1,000 km.

(Picture source: Japanese MoD) India and Japan share growing concerns about the Chinese Navy's increasing presence in both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. These concerns are driven by China's aggressive territorial expansion, notably in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and its broader strategy to extend its influence across the Indo-Pacific region. For India, China's 'String of Pearls' strategy, which involves building partnerships and establishing naval facilities in countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Myanmar, is seen as an effort to encircle India and limit its influence in the Indian Ocean. China's increasing naval deployments, including submarines, in the Indian Ocean further fuel India's apprehensions. In response, India has been strengthening its maritime surveillance and increasing cooperation with allies, particularly Japan, to counter China's activities. Japan, similarly, faces direct threats from China, particularly concerning the disputed Senkaku Islands (known as Diaoyu in China). China’s assertive actions in the East China Sea and its growing military capabilities have led Japan to bolster its defense, particularly in its southwestern islands, and strengthen its security partnerships, notably through the Quad alliance, which includes India, Japan, the United States, and Australia. Both countries have responded to these threats by enhancing military cooperation. India and Japan recently signed a 10-year military pact that allows for greater coordination between their armed forces, particularly in naval operations. This pact is seen as a strategic move to counter Chinese assertiveness and is part of a broader effort to strengthen the Quad as a counterbalance to China in the region. The two nations regularly conduct joint naval exercises, such as the 'Malabar' exercises, to improve interoperability and readiness against potential Chinese threats. UNICORN India and Japan have recently strengthened their naval defense cooperation, focusing on key technology transfers and joint development projects. At the heart of these efforts is Japan’s decision to export the 'UNICORN' stealth antenna system to India, marking a significant step in their defense relationship. The UNICORN system, officially known as the Unified Complex Radio Antenna, integrates various communication and radar functions to enhance the stealth capabilities of naval vessels. This equipment, initially used on Japan’s Mogami-class frigates, will be installed on select Indian Navy ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-js-ariake-and-indias-ins-shakti-conduct-joint-naval-exercise-in-bay-of-bengal	2024-10-08T05:30:14-07:00

France Tests New Anti-Air Shield with Aster 30 B1NT to Strengthen Future SAMP/T-NG Defense System	On October 8, 2024, France conducted a pivotal air defense test within the Direction générale de l'armement (DGA) base in Biscarrosse. This strategic trial, part of Operation Mercure, marks the first launch of the Aster 30 B1NT missile against aerial targets simulating a complex threat scenario. The event was attended by French Minister of Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu and the General Delegate for Armaments, Emmanuel Chiva, underscoring the importance of this new generation missile for both French and Italian defense.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Aster 30 B1NT, a new-generation missile, is designed to upgrade the French-Italian SAMP/T NG air defense system and will also be used in naval defense within the PAAMS framework (Picture source: French MoD) The Aster 30 B1NT, referred to as 'new Technology,' is specifically designed to enhance the SAMP/T (Surface-to-Air Medium Range Land-based) NG ( New Generation) air defense system, a French-Italian collaboration. Additionally, it will be deployed in naval defense within the PAAMS (Principal Anti-Air Missile System) used by both nations. With this version, France aims to modernize its air defense capabilities to respond effectively not only to conventional aerial threats but also to more sophisticated ballistic missiles. During this test, targets were used to simulate a complex threat environment, demonstrating the system’s ability to react in high-stakes operational scenarios. The SAMP/T-NG marks an upgrade from the current SAMP/T, bringing enhanced interception capabilities for high-speed threats at ranges up to 150 kilometers and altitudes over 25 kilometers. Equipped with advanced radar and sensor systems, the SAMP/T-NG enables rapid detection and interception of threats, particularly hypersonic missiles, which pose specific challenges due to their high speed and maneuverability. This system is a critical component in European defense against modern missile threats. On September 23, 2024, France’s Air and Space Force announced an expedited timeline for the SAMP/T-NG’s deployment, now scheduled to begin in 2026. Developed in partnership with Italy, this advanced system reflects a joint commitment to counter evolving global security threats, including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. As part of the Eurosam consortium, defense companies MBDA and Thales played key roles in the project, supported by a €400 million contract awarded by the DGA in 2015 to develop the Aster 30 B1NT under the coordination of the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR). Alongside this new missile, the contract also included an upgrade to the SAMP/T system to improve its capabilities against ballistic missiles, aligning with NATO’s ballistic missile defense program. The SAMP/T-NG marks an upgrade from the current SAMP/T, bringing enhanced interception capabilities for high-speed threats at ranges up to 150 kilometers and altitudes over 25 kilometers (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) The Aster missile family comprises two versions: the Aster 15, with a range of up to 30 kilometers for short and medium distances, and the Aster 30, capable of reaching targets over 100 kilometers away for short and long-range engagements. These missiles are now integral to France's air defense. Earlier this year, the French Navy demonstrated the Aster’s efficacy by intercepting Houthi drones and ballistic missiles in the Red Sea. In March, the air-defense frigate Alsace successfully intercepted three Houthi ballistic missiles mid-flight, marking a first for the Aster 30 system. The Alsace thus took over the role from the Languedoc in Operation Aspides, protecting maritime traffic. The Aster 30 Block 1NT missile is equipped with a radar seeker operating in the Ka band, allowing it to focus energy into a narrower beam than its predecessor, the Block 1, which uses the Ku band. This enhancement grants the missile increased long-range detection capabilities and the ability to intercept much faster targets, particularly longer-range ballistic missiles. Additionally, the Ka band seeker provides superior angular precision, enabling more accurate tracking of target movements and significantly increasing the probability of target destruction through direct impact. This Aster 30 B1NT test in Biscarrosse represents a milestone in European defense, solidifying France and Italy’s military cooperation under the Eurosam project. The joint program not only aims to shield military forces from increasingly sophisticated threats but also seeks to fortify European territory with a solution compatible with NATO’s integrated air and missile defense systems. Enabling European forces to respond to complex, multi-layered attacks, this new generation of missiles is set to become a cornerstone of European anti-air capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-tests-new-anti-air-shield-with-aster-30-b1nt-to-strengthen-future-samp-t-ng-defense-system	2024-10-08T04:44:08-07:00	
South Korea Commissions Cheongwang Its Most Modern Laser System to Counter Aerial Threats	The Republic of Korea Armed Forces has marked a significant advancement in air defense capabilities with the official announcement of the commissioning of the 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system for military use, which was officially integrated into active service on October 4 during the KADEX 2024 exhibition in South Korea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hanwha displays its 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system at the Defense Exhibition KADEX 2024. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Developed as a state-of-the-art anti-aircraft solution, the 'Cheongwang' system uses high-energy lasers to intercept a variety of aerial targets, including drones, missiles, and potentially other airborne threats. By employing directed energy rather than conventional munitions, the system offers a rapid, precise, and cost-effective means of neutralizing targets. With the increasing prevalence of unmanned systems and low-cost drones in global military engagements, the integration of such systems is becoming essential for maintaining robust air defenses. Hanwha Aerospace, South Korea’s leading defense and aerospace company, played a pivotal role in the unveiling and presentation of this system. Alongside the 'Cheongwang,' Hanwha Aerospace introduced an array of mobile and fixed high-energy laser solutions at KADEX 2024. These systems aim to provide adaptable and responsive defense options, aligning with the Republic of Korea Armed Forces' broader objective to achieve a multi-layered air defense network. The commissioning of the 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system is critically important for South Korea as it enhances the country's defense capabilities against emerging threats from North Korea. The HEL system provides a sophisticated means to detect, track, and neutralize aerial threats such as drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and potentially even artillery shells or low-flying missiles. North Korea has been increasingly investing in drone technology and advanced missile systems, which pose significant challenges to South Korea's security. By deploying the 'Cheongwang' system, South Korea can effectively counter these threats with precision and speed, strengthening its defensive posture and deterrence capabilities. Moreover, the high-energy laser system offers a cost-effective and efficient solution compared to traditional missile defense systems. Laser weapons have a virtually unlimited magazine, as they rely on electricity rather than physical ammunition, allowing for continuous operation against multiple incoming targets. This is particularly important in scenarios where North Korea might employ swarm tactics or saturation attacks to overwhelm conventional defenses. The 'Cheongwang' system's ability to engage numerous threats rapidly reduces the risk of successful attacks on South Korean territory and minimizes potential damage and casualties. In essence, the deployment of the HEL system is a strategic move to address the evolving nature of threats from North Korea, ensuring that South Korea remains resilient and prepared in the face of regional security challenges. The development of the 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system began as part of South Korea's efforts to bolster its defense capabilities against evolving aerial threats.

The Cheongwang HEL system represents a significant technological advancement in South Korea's defense arsenal, addressing the need for rapid and effective responses to modern warfare challenges posed by adversaries like North Korea. In terms of operational capability, the 'Cheongwang' high-energy laser is engineered for both precision and efficiency. Utilizing high-frequency laser beams, it delivers a rapid response against fast-moving threats with minimal collateral impact. The decision to opt for laser technology enables the system to operate effectively even in urban or high-density areas, where traditional interception methods might pose additional risks. The Block-I Cheongwang is a container-sized, land-based laser weapon system developed by South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) since 2019, with a budget of $63 million. Measuring 9 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 3 meters high (29.5 x 9.8 x 9.8 feet), it utilizes a 20 kW optical fiber laser capable of generating approximately 700°C heat during 10-20 second impulses. The system has an effective range of up to 3 kilometers and includes an integrated radar mast for target detection and tracking. Designed to counter small to mid-sized drones, multicopters, and UAVs, it operates silently and invisibly, requiring only electricity without the need for separate ammunition. Each shot costs about $1.45 (2,000 Won), making it a cost-effective solution for air defense. Deployment is scheduled to begin in 2024, with future versions potentially capable of neutralizing larger targets like aircraft and ballistic missiles. The 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system is a cutting-edge defense technology commissioned by South Korea to enhance its capability against aerial threats, particularly drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Unlike traditional weapons, it does not utilize a conventional warhead; instead, it employs a powerful laser beam as its means of interception. The laser's high-energy output allows it to effectively disable or destroy the electronic components of incoming targets, neutralizing them without the need for explosive force. This directed-energy approach provides a rapid response to threats and reduces the risk of collateral damage. In terms of range and guidance, the Cheongwang HEL system is equipped with advanced sensors and tracking systems that detect and monitor aerial targets at significant distances. While specific range details are classified, high-energy laser systems typically engage targets within several kilometers. The system uses precise targeting algorithms to focus the laser beam on critical parts of the threat, such as guidance systems or propulsion units. The guidance system continuously adjusts for target movement and atmospheric conditions, ensuring high accuracy and effectiveness. This combination of advanced detection, tracking, and directed-energy interception makes the Cheongwang HEL a vital asset in countering modern aerial threats posed by adversaries like North Korea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-commissions-cheongwang-its-most-modern-laser-system-to-counter-aerial-threats	2024-10-08T03:40:43-07:00	
Royal New Zealand Navy ship grounds off Samoa Coast	According to information published by the New Zealand Ministry of Defence on October 8, 2024, a Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) ship, HMNZS Manawanui, ran aground near the southern coast of Upolu, Samoa, while conducting a reef survey. The grounding incident has triggered a comprehensive rescue and environmental response, with the safety of all personnel successfully ensured.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The multi-role offshore support vessel HMNZS Manawanui sailed in formation alongside other ships during Exercise RIMPAC 2020. (Picture source: Dvids) The 75 crew members and passengers aboard the vessel evacuated safely using life rafts and sea boats. They were supported by several vessels that responded to the incident and are currently receiving assistance in Samoa. The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) worked in close coordination with Maritime New Zealand’s Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ) to manage rescue efforts. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-8A Poseidon aircraft was deployed to assist in the operation. HMNZS Manawanui sank in waters approximately 30 meters deep. RNZN divers began assessing the wreck at first light the following day to evaluate environmental impacts and determine the necessary clean-up measures. A light oil sheen was observed on the water, though it is being naturally dispersed by wind and waves. The site of the sunken ship has since been declared a prohibited area by Samoan authorities. The primary cause of the grounding remains unclear, with investigations ongoing. Initial reports suggest challenging conditions, such as strong currents and winds, may have contributed to the ship's inability to recover after striking the reef. The incident highlights vulnerabilities in RNZN fleet readiness, as the loss of Manawanui—a vital hydrographic and dive-support vessel—leaves the fleet with only eight operational ships, further straining a force already dealing with maintenance and crew shortages. A formal Court of Inquiry is being established to investigate the incident in detail, aiming to identify any procedural or technical failures that contributed to the accident. New Zealand The recent sinking of HMNZS Manawanui intersects with New Zealand's evolving geopolitical environment, especially as the country navigates a complex relationship with China and the broader Indo-Pacific security landscape. New Zealand has historically balanced its economic reliance on China with its security relationships, primarily with Western allies like Australia and the United States. However, rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, particularly concerning China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea and broader regional influence, are pressuring New Zealand to re-evaluate its foreign and defense policies. The loss of Manawanui not only weakens New Zealand’s naval capabilities but also occurs at a time when the country is increasingly involved in regional security frameworks, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and discussions around joining Pillar II of AUKUS. This signals a potential shift toward deeper defense cooperation with Western allies, which may strain its relationship with China—a critical trading partner. New Zealand has sought to diversify its trade relationships to reduce its dependency on China, reflecting the need for strategic flexibility amid growing U.S.-China rivalry.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-new-zealand-navy-ship-grounds-off-samoa-coast	2024-10-08T03:10:27-07:00

The anti-drone cages, initially perceived as improvised defenses, have become standard protective measures across military forces worldwide, offering a significant advantage by deflecting drone strikes and mitigating potential damage from FPV drone attacks. For China, incorporating these defenses on the Type 15 signals a strategic shift in addressing emerging threats. The tank’s design—lightweight and mobile, suitable for high altitudes and dense forests—makes it particularly effective in diverse terrains, bolstering the Chinese army’s resilience against aerial attacks. Meanwhile, India faces growing challenges in defending its positions along the China-Pakistan border, especially in the elevated regions of Kashmir. Tensions with China in these mountainous areas prompt New Delhi to reassess its strategies and bolster its military capabilities against an increasingly assertive Chinese force. This need for strategic modernization is mirrored by other nations, such as Japan, where China’s advancing military capabilities necessitate strengthened deterrence measures.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-adapts-to-new-battlefield-threats-by-equipping-type-15-tanks-with-anti-drone-cages	2024-10-08T01:49:38-07:00

(Picture source: Clash Report) According to U.S. defense sources, the strikes were carried out by the USS Georgia, a guided-missile submarine, and focused on 15 key targets including military bases and weapons installations associated with the Iran-backed Houthi group. The strikes commenced at 5 p.m. local time, primarily hitting locations in the capital Sanaa, Hodeida, and Dhamar province. Houthi media confirmed that strikes hit the airport in Hodeida and a military base in the Katheib area. U.S. officials indicated that the operation was part of efforts to ensure the safety of international waters, particularly the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, where Houthi attacks have recently disrupted commercial shipping. Since the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict, Houthi forces have increasingly targeted vessels in the region, seizing ships and damaging others with missiles and drones. The USS Georgia had entered the region in September following rising tensions involving Iranian proxies. This latest action follows the downing of several U.S. drones over Yemen in recent years, with the Houthis significantly ramping up attacks on U.S. and international assets since October 2023. USS Georgia The USS Georgia, an Ohio-class submarine, has a surfaced displacement of 16,764 long tons and a submerged displacement of 18,750 long tons. Its length is 560 feet, with a beam of 42 feet and a draft of 38 feet. Propulsion is provided by an S8G pressurized water nuclear reactor enriched to 93.5%, alongside two geared turbines and a 325-horsepower auxiliary motor. The vessel is powered by a single shaft generating 60,000 shaft horsepower, with a speed exceeding 25 knots. The submarine is designed for depths greater than 800 feet and typically operates with a crew of 15 officers and 140 enlisted personnel. In terms of armament, the USS Georgia is outfitted with four 21-inch torpedo tubes and carries 154 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, stored in 22 groups of seven. Tomahawk Its long-range precision enables highly accurate targeting of key military infrastructure, such as missile launch sites, command centers, and weapons depots, while minimizing collateral damage. This capability is essential in Yemen's complex environment, where U.S. forces aim to neutralize specific threats without causing wider destruction.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-strikes-houthi-targets-in-yemen-as-attacks-on-red-sea-shipping-increase	2024-10-07T05:05:37-07:00	
Russian Navy's frigate Neustrashimy joins South African Navy Festival	According to information published by Russian sources on October 5, 2024, the Russian Navy's frigate Neustrashimy made an appearance at the South African Navy Festival, held from October 4-6, 2024, in Simon’s Town.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 11540 Yastreb frigate Neustrashimy. (Picture source: South African Defense Forces) The vessel, accompanied by the replenishment ship Akademik Pashin, docked in Cape Town on October 3 as part of the international naval presence at the event. This year’s festival saw participation from several nations, including China, which sent its Type 54A frigate CNS Xuchang. The arrival of the Neustrashimy, a Baltic Fleet frigate, and the Chinese warships is seen by some as a signal of deepening naval cooperation among BRICS nations. However, the participation of the Russian warship has stirred diplomatic controversy, particularly in light of Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine. Critics, including the Ukrainian Association of South Africa, expressed concerns that such invitations implicitly support Russia’s military actions. BRICS Naval cooperation within the BRICS group, particularly between China, Russia, and South Africa, has grown significantly in recent years, reflecting a broader trend of military collaboration among BRICS nations. This cooperation is primarily focused on joint naval exercises, enhancing maritime security, and extending influence across key strategic waterways. For example, China and Russia have regularly conducted joint naval drills, which have expanded in scale. These exercises are not just limited to bilateral engagements but often include other BRICS members like South Africa. One notable instance is the Mosi series of naval exercises, where China, Russia, and South Africa conduct operations aimed at improving maritime security and operational interoperability. The latest iteration occurred off South Africa's coast. Additionally, China and Russia’s naval engagements extend to collaborations with non-BRICS nations like Iran, conducting large-scale drills in the Gulf of Oman. These exercises showcase their growing ability to project power across the Indian Ocean, particularly in regions critical to global shipping routes. The focus of these drills has often been on anti-piracy operations, search and rescue missions, and broader maritime security.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-navys-frigate-neustrashimy-joins-south-african-navy-festival	2024-10-07T03:49:49-07:00	
US Army's 34-year-old unique ARES close air support aircraft still active for classified tests	On October 6, 2024, TaskForce23 observed a new flight of the unique Scaled Composites ARES (Agile Responsive Effective Support) aircraft near the Mojave Air and Space Port. This Close Air Support (CAS) concept demonstrator continues to serve as a research test bed for the US Army. Remarkably, it has done so for 34 years since its initial flight on February 19, 1990. The ARES maintains several features from its original design, including metallic leading edges, fairings, and a distinct patch of coating on the right tail.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link 34 years since its initial flight, the mysterious ARES maintains several features from its original design, including metallic leading edges, fairings, and a distinct patch of coating on the right tail. (Picture source: TaskForce23) The ARES (Agile Responsive Effective Support) was developed in response to a US Army request in the early 1980s for a Low Cost Battlefield Attack Aircraft (LCBAA), designed to fulfill roles requiring low-altitude, anti-tank battlefield support with long endurance and the ability to operate outside improved airfield environments. US Army aviators Jim Kreutz and Milo Burroughs initiated a study in 1981 to develop an aircraft with high maneuverability at low altitudes and stall resistance. Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites joined this effort, resulting in the development of the ARES under Model No. 151. The aircraft has a canard configuration, with a foreplane that provides pitch control. This foreplane is designed to stall before the main wings, enhancing safety during low-altitude operations. Although initially planned for a turboprop engine, the design was updated to use a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D-5 turbofan engine, producing 13.12 kN of thrust. This change addressed potential issues with debris ingestion during takeoffs and landings on unimproved surfaces. One notable feature of the ARES is its asymmetrical design. It mounts a GAU-12/U Equalizer 25 mm rotary cannon on the right side of the nose, with the engine intake located on the left. This layout minimizes the impact of the cannon's recoil on performance and prevents exhaust gases from entering the engine intake. The cannon is positioned in a concave recess beneath the cockpit to trap exhaust gases and balance recoil forces during firing.

(Picture source: Flickr/Corporate Flight Management) First flown on February 19, 1990, by Scaled Composites test pilot Doug Shane, the ARES has completed over 430 flight hours with the tail number/aircraft registration number N151SC. In November 1991, the ARES tested the GAU-12 Equalizer five-barrel 25 mm Gatling-type rotary cannon under a US Air Force contract, validating its Close Air Support (CAS) capabilities. This testing led to the cannon’s integration into various aircraft, such as the AC-130U Spooky gunship, the AV-8 Harrier II ground attack aircraft, and the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter. Despite its successful demonstrations, the ARES remained a private project as the military did not adopt it for operational use. However, it continues to function as a research test bed. After being stored in December 2000 at the Mojave Spaceport, the aircraft returned to flight on March 7, 2008, following Scaled Composites' acquisition by Northrop Grumman. The ARES remains active as a research test bed, providing services in conceptual design, aerodynamic analysis, structural design, systems integration, and experimental flight testing. In 2020, the ARES was observed flying alongside its successors, the Model 401 'Son of Ares' jets, over the Mojave Desert, showcasing a reflective metallic-like surface coating. This aligns with previous tests involving reflective coatings, possibly related to research on aircraft signatures against sensor systems such as infrared search and track technologies. The Proteus testbed platform by Scaled Composites has also conducted similar flights, equipped with large pods believed to house electro-optical systems.

(Picture source: The War Zone) Defense-related flight testing in the southwest U.S. desert has increased, with Scaled Composites' testbed jets actively participating. Observations of aircraft, such as F-15s equipped with infrared spectrum data-collection test pods, suggest research into infrared search and track systems or low-power laser technologies. Additionally, the ARES has also played the role of a fictional German jet, the ME-263, in the film 'Aces: Iron Eagle III' released in 1992. Specifications for the ARES include a length of 8.97 meters, a wingspan of 10.67 meters, and a height of 2.99 meters. Its wing area is 17.5 square meters, with an empty weight of 1,308 kilograms and a maximum takeoff weight of 2,767 kilograms. Equipped with a single Pratt &amp; Whitney JT15D turbofan engine, the ARES reaches a maximum speed of 750 kilometers per hour at 7,620 meters and has a service ceiling of 10,668 meters. Its combat range is 1,110 kilometers, with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.43 at maximum weight. The ARES is capable of carrying a 25 mm GAU-12/U Gatling cannon and has provisions for air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder or AIM-92 Stinger, as well as unguided rockets and other air-to-ground weapons. Its design emphasizes low-altitude performance and the ability to operate from unimproved airfields, meeting the goals of the original LCBAA program. The aircraft features twin boom-mounted vertical fins for directional stability and uses a canard for pitch control. The structure is composed primarily of fiberglass composite over a foam core, a fabrication technique developed by Scaled Composites. The flight controls are mechanical, and the engine includes a backup mechanical fuel control to maintain control in the event of electrical system failure.
