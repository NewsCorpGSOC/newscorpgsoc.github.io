Exclusive: Russia Poised to Deploy Deadly BMPT-72 Terminator 2 Combat Vehicle in Ukraine	As reported by the Russian news website Vestnik-RM on September 12, 2024, the Russian army may deploy the latest generation of the BMPT-72 Terminator fire support vehicle on the battlefield in Ukraine. The BMPT used by Russian forces, commonly known as the BMPT Terminator model 2017, is an updated version of the BMPT-72 Terminator 2. Introduced into Russian service in the late 2010s, this model saw its first significant deployment for the invasion of Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BMPT-72 Terminator 2 is the latest generation of Russian-made fire support vehicle in the BMPT family. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The BMPT model 2017 shares the same chassis as the T-72 but includes various modernizations and enhancements over the earlier Terminator 2. It retains the core armament of two 30mm 2A42 autocannons, four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles, and secondary weaponry like a 7.62mm PKTM machine gun and automatic grenade launchers. However, the 2017 model benefits from improved fire control systems and better protection, making it more effective in modern combat environments. The deployment of the BMPT Terminator model 2017 in Ukraine is the vehicle's first significant combat test. Russian forces introduced the BMPT to bolster their tank units in complex combat situations, particularly in urban areas where tanks are vulnerable to ambushes, anti-tank guided missiles, and infantry armed with RPGs. The BMPT was seen as a vehicle that could bridge the gap between tank operations and infantry support, offering more protection and firepower to help secure Russian armored advances. In Ukraine, the BMPT was deployed alongside T-72 series and T-90M tanks, primarily in urban and forested areas where tank units faced heavy resistance from Ukrainian forces. The BMPT's combination of autocannons, anti-tank missiles, machine guns, and grenade launchers made it highly effective in neutralizing infantry positions, engaging light armored vehicles, and providing suppressive fire for advancing tank units. However, its actual performance in Ukraine has been met with mixed results. While the BMPT's firepower and armor were considered assets in specific engagements, there were reports that the vehicle was not used in large numbers or in an optimal role. One of the reasons for this is that the Russian military might not have fully integrated the BMPT into their combined arms strategy. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has shown that modern battlefield environments, especially in urban settings, are extremely lethal for armored vehicles, even with support vehicles like the BMPT present. There have also been challenges with Russian logistics and the high intensity of combat, which have limited the BMPT's widespread use. Some analysts suggest that while the BMPT performed well in specific roles, it did not dramatically change the overall effectiveness of Russian armored units in Ukraine. Nevertheless, its deployment highlighted the importance of dedicated armored support vehicles in modern warfare, especially in urban or asymmetric environments where traditional tanks are vulnerable to mobile infantry and advanced anti-tank weapons. The BMPT Model 2017 is the current version in service with the Russian army and deployed in Ukraine. (Picture source Army Recognition Group) The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 are both Russian armored vehicles designed to support tanks and infantry in challenging combat environments, but there are several differences between the two. The BMPT Terminator 1 is based on the T-90 tank chassis, while the BMPT-72 Terminator 2 uses the older T-72 chassis. This difference in platform allows the BMPT-72 to be more cost-effective for countries that have a surplus of T-72 tanks, enabling them to convert those older tanks into BMPTs. In terms of weight, the BMPT Terminator 1, due to its T-90 base, is heavier, weighing around 48 tons. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, being based on the T-72, is slightly lighter. The armament configurations of both models are largely the same, featuring a combination of 30mm cannons, anti-tank missile launchers, and machine guns, designed for anti-infantry and anti-armor roles. The key distinction is the modernization and production flexibility of the BMPT-72, which was designed to be a more affordable upgrade solution by leveraging the widely available T-72 chassis, while the original BMPT Terminator 1 was a more specialized system built from the newer T-90 platform. Both vehicles serve a similar purpose in the battlefield, but the BMPT-72 provides a more versatile and budget-friendly option for militaries with a large inventory of older tanks. The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 both have robust armor and powerful armament designed for urban warfare and supporting tanks, though there are differences between the two models. The Terminator 1, based on the T-90 chassis, benefits from the advanced armor of the T-90 tank, including Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor (ERA), which provides protection against modern anti-tank projectiles and RPGs. This makes the Terminator 1 highly resistant to a variety of battlefield threats. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, built on the older T-72 chassis, also has strong armor but does not come with the same advanced protection as standard. However, the BMPT-72 can be equipped with modern ERA upgrades to enhance its survivability. In terms of armament, both vehicles are equipped with a formidable array of weapons designed to engage multiple types of targets, including infantry, light vehicles, and even aircraft. The BMPT Terminator 1 is armed with two 30mm 2A42 autocannons. These autocannons are capable of firing both armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds, making them versatile against various threats. Additionally, the Terminator 1 carries four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which can penetrate heavy armor and engage tanks or bunkers from long distances. The BMPT Terminator 1 is the first version in the BMPT family.

Rafael CEO confirms deployment of Iron Beam laser weapon system by Israel in 2025	According to The Nziv Report on September 12, 2024, Yoav Turgeman, CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, announced that its Iron Beam High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) will become operational with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) next year. This 100kW system is intended to be a new component of Israel's air defense system, serving as the 'final line of defense' against drones, rockets, and mortars. It is expected to enter active service by late 2025.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Iron Beam laser system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. (Picture source: Rafael) According to Rafael, the Iron Beam system can focus a laser beam with up to 100 kilowatts of power on an aerial target, destroying it within seconds. Its effective range varies depending on factors such as laser power, weather conditions, and the type of target, and it is capable of addressing short- and medium-range threats up to 7 kilometers away. The Iron Beam system has undergone testing, including a series of tests conducted by the IDF in March 2022 that demonstrated its ability to intercept drones, mortars, and missiles. One of the key attributes of the Iron Beam is its lower cost per shot compared to conventional missile interceptors. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. The system also has an unlimited magazine, allowing for continuous use without the need for reloads, and does not produce debris from intercepted threats, reducing the risk of collateral damage. These features are relevant in the context of the ongoing conflict, where Israel has faced a shortage of Iron Dome ammunition. The Gaza war has reportedly cost the Israeli economy over $67.3 billion, according to Israeli economists. Turgeman also discussed the performance of Rafael’s Python 4 and Python 5 missiles, which have been used against drones and cruise missiles during recent Iranian attacks. He noted that the Python 4 missile, in service for four decades, continues to meet operational requirements. Rafael is also developing the 'Skysonic' system, which is intended to provide a hypersonic interception capability against hypersonic missile threats. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. (Picture source: Rafael) Rafael, which has been developing directed-energy systems for over 30 years, is working on enhancing the capabilities of the Iron Beam. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously. This development is primarily funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The Iron Beam, also known as 'Magen Or' or 'Shield of Light,' is a 100kW High Energy Laser Weapon System first unveiled at the Singapore Airshow in February 2014. It is designed to intercept a variety of aerial threats using a directed-energy approach. The Iron Beam system uses a fiber laser to destroy short-range rockets, artillery, and mortar bombs, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It operates by detecting and tracking airborne threats, either as a stand-alone system or as part of a broader air defense network. Iron Beam is one component of Israel's integrated missile defense system, which also includes Arrow 2, Arrow 3, David's Sling, and Iron Dome systems. It is intended to complement these layers by providing a directed-energy option for intercepting threats that may not be effectively managed by other interceptors. A Naval Iron Beam variant is also being developed for use on ships to protect against drone swarms and anti-ship missiles. This version, which retains the same external dimensions as the ground-based system, is expected to be operational within four to five years and is planned for deployment on Israeli Navy vessels such as the Reshef-class corvette. The Naval Iron Beam, which retains the same external dimensions as the ground-based system, is expected to be operational within four to five years and is planned for deployment on Israeli Navy vessels such as the Reshef-class corvette. (Picture source: Rafael) Further developments have included efforts to create a mobile version of the Iron Beam system. However, weight and power supply considerations have led to a focus on integrating it with existing stationary platforms. The system's ability to achieve high precision over extended distances suggests potential applications in both military and civilian contexts, particularly in defending against slow-flying drones and other aerial threats that are more vulnerable to laser-based attacks. In April 2022, experiments demonstrated the system's ability to intercept drones, rockets, mortar bombs, and antitank missiles. In response to operational needs, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced plans to deploy the Iron Beam to Israel’s southern border with the Gaza Strip to test its effectiveness in real-world conditions, including during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. The system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. (Picture source: Rafael) The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. By 2023, advancements in the technology enabled the laser to achieve energy levels of 100 kW or more, with the beam's precision focused to the diameter of a coin at distances of up to 10 kilometers. Despite its potential, the use of high-energy lasers like the Iron Beam or the British DragonFly has challenges. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds or rain can affect the beam's ability to reach its target, and the laser must remain focused on a moving target for several seconds to deliver sufficient energy to destroy it. This requirement can limit its effectiveness in countering multiple threats simultaneously, such as a barrage of rockets. Additionally, some targets could be shielded with materials resistant to laser attacks, which could reduce the system’s effectiveness. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously.

Germany Tests G95 Rifles at US Army's Tropical Regions Test Center	The German armed forces, known as the Bundeswehr, recently tested both variants of their new G95 assault rifle at a Panamanian center frequently used by the U.S. Army's Tropical Regions Test Center (TRTC). These tests are part of the Bundeswehr's ongoing efforts to evaluate its equipment in various extreme environments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The G95, based on Heckler &amp; Koch’s HK416A8, comes in two versions: one with a 16.5-inch barrel and the other with a 14-inch barrel, both chambered for NATO 5.56mm ammunition. (Picture source: US DoD) In addition to testing the G95 rifle, the Bundeswehr also took the opportunity to test its G22A2 sniper rifle, as well as the MG4 and MG5 machine guns. During the trials, 55 German soldiers navigated a muddy jungle trail, facing challenging conditions that included streams, dense vegetation, and thorny vines. This environment was designed to replicate the difficult conditions soldiers might encounter during real-world missions in tropical regions. Sergeant Major Ernest Tretow of the Bundeswehr praised the quality of the jungle course, noting that the soldiers conducted live-fire exercises and tested night vision goggles. 'The jungle trail and its tactical targets were excellent,' he said. 'We tested the new night vision goggles at night in the jungle and used the trail for live fire during the day.'

The Bundeswehr's version includes some modifications, notably to the grip, trigger guard, and cheek rest, compared to the civilian model. The tropical tests in Panama are part of the Bundeswehr's ongoing evaluation efforts. Previous tests had been conducted in more temperate environments, such as in the Almeria region of Spain, where hot conditions last only a few weeks each year. The soldiers found that Panama's conditions better represented a true jungle environment, which they sought for more rigorous equipment evaluations. The Bundeswehr had also tested weapons in Hawaii but felt that the subtropical conditions there did not fully reflect the extreme challenges of a true jungle. The humid, muddy conditions of Panama provided the ideal testing ground for their new equipment. Sergeant Major Michael Diehl of the Bundeswehr expressed satisfaction with the test site and the support provided by the TRTC team. 'The test site was exactly what we were looking for, and the support from the Tropical Regions Test Center team was outstanding,' said Diehl. 'We encountered no problems during the weapons testing.' The German military has long maintained a relationship with U.S. Army testing facilities. Ten years ago, they tested the MG5 machine gun at the Yuma Test Center, part of the U.S. Army's Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), under the supervision of the Army Test and Evaluation Center (ATEC). The broad range of testing environments offered by YPG—including desert, tropical, and arctic regions—has allowed for comprehensive evaluations of Bundeswehr equipment. Colonel John Nelson, YPG commander, emphasized the importance of these collaborative efforts with NATO partners. 'It was an excellent opportunity for security cooperation and support of our NATO partners to test their equipment in the challenging natural environment of the tropics,' Nelson said.

US grants Egypt $1.3 Billion in Military Aid Boosting Defense Cooperation	On September 11, 2024, the Biden administration confirmed that Egypt would receive its full allocation of $1.3 billion in military aid, despite persistent concerns over the country’s human rights record. This marks the first time that the administration has granted this aid without withholding any portion, reflecting the increasing reliance of the U.S. on Egypt’s mediation efforts, particularly in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An Egyptian M1A1 Abrams tank participated in a field training exercise during Bright Star 2017 at Mohamed Naguib Military Base, alongside more than 200 U.S. service members as part of the bilateral U.S. Central Command exercise held from September 10 to 20, 2017. (Picture source: US DoD) Of the $1.3 billion aid, $320 million is usually conditioned on Egypt's improvement in human rights, leading to partial withholdings in past years. However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken informed Congress that $225 million of this amount would be released, citing U.S. 'national security interests.' The U.S. government emphasized Egypt’s key role in regional peace efforts, especially in mediating ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas and managing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Despite this crucial diplomatic role, the Egyptian government, led by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, continues to face accusations of human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary detentions. Some U.S. lawmakers, such as Senator Chris Murphy, criticized the waiver of human rights conditions, insisting that Egypt remains a repressive state. However, the State Department noted progress, such as the release of political prisoners and proposed reforms on pretrial detention, which led to the release of $95 million in previously withheld military aid. For many years, the U.S. has played a central role in equipping Egypt’s military, providing advanced systems that enhance the operational readiness of Egypt’s armed forces. This annual military aid includes armored vehicles, combat helicopters, and sophisticated weaponry, thereby strengthening Egypt’s defense capabilities. Among recent deliveries, armored personnel carriers such as the RG-33 and MaxxPro, delivered in 2016, have provided Egypt with enhanced mobility and protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), critical in counterinsurgency operations in the Sinai. These vehicles are particularly suited for counter-insurgency missions, offering essential protection to troops. The M1A1 Abrams tank, with 125 units delivered, is another key component of Egypt’s military arsenal. Considered one of the most powerful tanks in the world, it is equipped with a 120mm smoothbore gun and advanced composite armor. These tanks are supported by M88 armored recovery vehicles, which ensure that damaged tanks can be retrieved and returned to service, maintaining their operational availability. The United States delivered a batch of mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles to the Egyptian military in 2016 (Picture source: Egyptian Army) In the air domain, Egypt has received F-16C Block 50 fighter jets and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters, armed with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, which are effective against armored vehicles. These aircraft play a crucial role in anti-terrorism operations in the Sinai, where Egypt combats various armed groups. On the naval front, Egypt has strengthened its fleet with Ambassador-IV corvettes and Swift-93 patrol vessels, vital for coastal defense in strategic areas such as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. These ships, equipped with anti-ship missiles and advanced radar systems, provide crucial maritime protection for Egypt. In the field of intelligence and reconnaissance, Egypt has received systems such as the SIGINT Beech-190 aircraft and DB-110 reconnaissance pods. These assets provide critical real-time intelligence capabilities, enhancing Egypt’s ability to monitor and respond to threats along its borders. While the U.S. remains Egypt’s primary military supplier, the country has diversified its sources of armaments, strengthening ties with partners like China. This diversification allows Egypt to reduce its reliance on the U.S. while accessing alternative technologies. For instance, Egypt has acquired Wing Loong II drones from China, similar to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper, which are used for both reconnaissance and strike missions. This strategy aims to ensure a robust and versatile military supply chain, enabling Egypt to address regional security challenges effectively.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-grants-egypt-1-3-billion-in-military-aid-boosting-defense-cooperation	2024-09-12T04:57:52-07:00	
Philippine Army Recommissions Scorpion FV101 CVRT Light Reconnaissance Tracked Armored Vehicle	On September 2, 2024, the Philippine Army reportedly decided, as shown in images from a blessing ceremony on social media, to recommission the light tank FV101 Scorpion, the CVR(T) Arayat, equipped with a low-pressure L23A1 76mm turret, previously withdrawn from service due to maintenance issues. This tank has recently been recommissioned after a comprehensive overhaul, signifying a revitalization of its capabilities within the Armored Division.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Philippine Army's Scorpion FV101 CVRT Light Reconnaissance (Picture source: Philippines Social Media) For reference, the Philippine Army had embarked on an ambitious project to modernize twelve of its aging Scorpion tanks, with a budget of $4.6 million. This project included replacing the gasoline engines with diesel engines to address the shortage of spare parts. This enhancement not only increased the reliability of the tanks but also made them more suitable for current operations, particularly in the conflict regions of Mindanao. The 'Arayat' is one of the few Scorpions to have survived a phase where many of its counterparts were declared out of service and cannibalized for their parts. The removed turrets had been adapted to Belgian M113A2 vehicles, modified by Israel's Elbit Systems. However, the recent decision to repair and reintegrate these tanks shows a notable change in military resource management. Army officials have not disclosed the exact number of tanks that will be restored, but it appears that it will be a modest number. Moreover, it is noted that these reintegrated tanks will not benefit from the same advanced fire control systems found on the M113A2s. According to the Military Balance 2023, the Philippine Army still has six FV101 Scorpion light tanks to date. It is possible that the Arayat will be used for training and fire support purposes. As a reminder, the Philippine Army has recently bolstered its arsenal with strategic additions, including the Sabrah light tank and the Guarani 6x6 armored vehicle. Introduced in 2024, the Sabrah light tank, based on the Ascod 2 and Pandur II 8x8 chassis, is the result of a collaboration between Israel's Elbit Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems, offering tracked and wheeled options. Equipped with an advanced turret with a 105mm cannon, the Sabrah aims to enhance the versatility and firepower of the armed forces in the face of regional threats. Indeed, the turret comes from the Matak program, developed in collaboration between Israel and the South African industry. This tank is specially designed to meet the demands of varied terrains and complex combat scenarios. On the other hand, the Guarani 6x6, developed by Iveco Defence Vehicles and delivered for the first time in 2023, was selected for its superior mobility and protection performance. This armored vehicle excels in the secure transportation of troops, including in amphibious conditions, which is crucial for operations in the numerous archipelagos of the Philippines. The integration of the Guarani into the Philippine Army marks a significant step in the modernization of its troop transport vehicle fleet, thereby enhancing its ability to respond quickly and effectively to regional security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/philippine-army-recommissions-scorpion-fv101-cvrt-light-reconnaissance-for-training-missions	2024-09-12T04:49:04-07:00

US Allows Ukraine to Use Long-Range Missiles to Target Russian Territory After Iranian Missiles Delivery	Citing information published by 'People's World' on September 11, 2024, Moscow claimed that the U.S. has given the green light for Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian targets. This development comes as part of a broader international effort to support Ukraine, with several European countries also backing Kyiv’s use of long-range weapons to strike Russian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A weapon Loader crew uploads a Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile to an external pylon on a B-1B Lancer at Edwards Air Force Base. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) On September 3, 2024, 'Reuters' announced that the U.S. is nearly finalizing an agreement to supply Ukraine with Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), which can reach deep into Russian territory. These missiles are expected to be delivered to Ukraine as part of a weapons package by autumn. The move is seen as a significant escalation in the conflict, as Ukraine will now be able to strike further into Russian territory than ever before. The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) is a long-range, precision-guided cruise missile developed by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. military. It is designed to be launched from aircraft and strike high-value, well-defended targets from a safe distance, reducing the risk to pilots. The missile is equipped with advanced stealth technology to evade enemy radar and has a range of up to 370 km (230 miles) in its basic version, with an extended-range variant (JASSM-ER) reaching over 900 km (560 miles). JASSM is used primarily by the U.S. Air Force and Navy and has been exported to several allied nations. European nations have also signaled their approval for Ukraine to use their donated missile systems in strikes targeting Russian military assets. Several European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, have provided Ukraine with long-range missile systems such as the British-supplied Storm Shadow and French SCALP-EG cruise missiles. These missiles, with ranges up to 300 kilometers, have already played a crucial role in Ukrainian strikes against Russian positions in occupied territories. However, until now, the use of European-donated long-range missiles had been limited to Ukrainian targets within its own borders or occupied territories. According to *People’s World*, recent developments indicate a shift in policy, with Western countries softening their stance on allowing Ukraine to strike military targets deep inside Russia. The UK, in particular, has reportedly supported Ukraine’s right to defend itself, even if that means conducting offensive operations within Russian territory, as long as those strikes are aimed at military infrastructure. This shift follows Russia's own aggressive actions, including Iran’s delivery of Fath 360 ballistic missiles to Moscow, which has heightened the sense of urgency among Ukraine's Western allies. The Iranian-Russian missile deal, cited by *People's World*, has been seen as a provocative step, further fueling the arms race in the region and prompting NATO allies to reevaluate their restrictions on Ukraine’s use of donated long-range weapons. With the U.S. poised to provide the JASSM missiles and European nations indicating their support for Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil, Ukraine is now better equipped to launch offensive operations that reach far beyond the frontlines. This new phase in the war has raised concerns about a potential escalation in hostilities, as long-range strikes from both sides could destabilize not only Ukraine and Russia but also the broader region. The growing use of advanced Western missile systems, alongside Ukraine’s requests for more offensive capabilities, signals a new chapter in the conflict, one that could significantly shift the balance of power on the battlefield. As the conflict intensifies i Ukraine, the international community watches closely, with fears that this increased missile activity could lead to unpredictable consequences, potentially drawing other nations deeper into the conflict. Western nations continue to walk a fine line between supporting Ukraine's defense and preventing a further escalation that could lead to direct confrontation with Russia	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-allows-ukraine-to-use-long-range-missiles-to-target-russian-territory-after-iranian-missiles-delivery	2024-09-12T03:01:07-07:00

Latvia Pledges New Military Aid Package Including Armored Vehicles for Ukraine to Strengthen Defense	On September 11, 2024, during the fourth Crimean Platform summit in Kyiv, Latvian Prime Minister Evika Siliņa announced a new military aid package for Ukraine. This announcement came after her meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who confirmed that the package would include armored personnel carriers. Though the exact details and financial value of the aid were not disclosed, the package reflects Latvia's consistent support for Ukraine's defense efforts since the start of the Russian invasion.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In October 2022, Latvian Atlas Dynamics supplied the Ukrainian military with futuristic drones, plans to start production in Ukraine (Picture source: Atlas Dynamics) Latvia has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine, and this latest aid package further underscores that commitment. Both leaders also discussed strengthening cooperation between their defense industries to enhance military capabilities. Latvia has pledged to provide military aid equivalent to 0.25% of its GDP each year, with this year’s assistance amounting to €112 million. In collaboration with the United Kingdom, Latvia co-leads a drone coalition aimed at supplying Ukraine with critical drone technology. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed that Latvia would deliver thousands of drones as part of this initiative. Since the beginning of the war, Latvia’s total military aid to Ukraine has reached approximately €370 million, covering a wide array of equipment, including drones, helicopters, 155mm artillery shells, anti-tank weapons, and Stinger air defense systems, as well as radars and land vehicles. As part of the latest package, Latvia is preparing to send M113 armored personnel carriers, known for their mobility and protection capabilities. Latvia has also committed to delivering Patria Armored Modular Vehicles (AMVs) to Ukraine in 2025, further enhancing Ukraine’s defense with versatile and highly protected vehicles for combat environments.

By supporting Ukraine, Latvia not only strengthens its own security but also contributes to NATO's collective defense. Latvia’s actions also reinforce European solidarity against the growing threats from the east.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/latvia-pledges-new-military-aid-package-including-armored-vehicles-for-ukraine-to-strengthen-defense	2024-09-12T02:32:02-07:00	
GDELS Unveils Another Variant of Pandur Evolution for Special Forces	At the 9th KSK Armament Symposium, General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) revealed a new variant of the Pandur Evolution, designed for special forces missions. This marks the first public presentation of this specialized version of the Pandur Evolution, showcasing its advanced capabilities and potential applications.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration of the Pandur Evo 6x6, the version presented at KSK is equipped with an automated turret. (Picture source: Austrian MoD) The vehicle on display is based on a modified 6×6 Pandur Evolution platform. It is equipped with a remotely operated weapon station featuring a 30mm autocannon, an anti-drone protection net, and several canisters for carrying and launching Switchblade 300 Block 20 loitering munitions. Despite the impressive presentation, GDELS representatives refused to provide detailed specifications, only offering limited information regarding the vehicle's weight and mobility. The presented vehicle is described as a potential mission variant, which has not yet been selected by any customer. GDELS declined to comment on whether this vehicle could serve as a base for the Armored Ground Mobility System (AGMS) Heavy Platform Vehicle. Although the special forces variant of the Pandur Evolution includes elements such as the weapon station and Switchblade canisters, these components appear to be more demonstrative than definitive equipment. Additionally, the size of the weapon station would hinder the vehicle’s air transportability, suggesting that this configuration will not be included in the final AGMS version. Three major modifications distinguish the special forces variant of the Pandur from the standard version. The vehicle’s chassis has been significantly shortened at the rear, reducing its empty weight to less than 15 tons without mission equipment. Other visible changes include the presence of a ballistic driver's cabin and a modified engine cooling system. The total authorized weight of the vehicle is 19.5 tons, with a payload capacity of around 3 tons. The powertrain has not been modified, and the vehicle retains a Cummins ISLe 450 diesel engine with 335 kW and a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission. The base vehicle’s dimensions (2.6 meters wide and 2.2 meters high) allow it to be transported by a C-130 aircraft. The basic armor of the Pandur vehicle family protects the crew from shrapnel, small arms fire, and mines. Although GDELS did not provide details on the armor of the special forces variant, it is likely equipped with additional armor from Rheinmetall Protection Systems and meets the ballistic protection standards of STANAG 4569, likely level 3 or higher. Since the vehicle was presented in a closed configuration, no information could be obtained about the interior layout or combat space configuration. However, the presence of the ballistic driver's cabin and the modified engine cooling system, also found on previous AGMS versions of the Pandur used by USSOCOM, suggests that this vehicle is well-suited for special operations. The armored engine cooling system protects the engine while allowing the surface to be used for transporting material or mission equipment, and the ballistic driver's cabin allows the driver to maintain situational awareness even under enemy fire. The AGMS vehicles currently in service, as seen in publicly available images, are equipped with numerous mission-specific modifications, such as remotely operated weapon stations, communication equipment, and sensors. This leads to the conclusion that the special forces version of the Pandur on display is likely only the base platform for future AGMS vehicles, with the final versions expected to include different equipment and armor tailored to specific missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/gdels-unveils-another-variant-of-the-pandur-evolution-for-special-forces	2024-09-12T02:13:59-07:00
