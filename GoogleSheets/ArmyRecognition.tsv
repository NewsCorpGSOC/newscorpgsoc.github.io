US Navy seeks industry input for development of Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile SLCM-N	According to information published by the US government on November 15, 2024, the US Navy has issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the development of a Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N). The program is designed to create a modular and survivable cruise missile system that provides a proportional response and ensures critical adversary targets remain at risk. This initiative aims to field an operational system by FY 2034, with prototype demonstrations expected within the next three years.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy advances its nuclear deterrence strategy with the development of the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N), aiming for rapid prototyping and operational deployment by FY 2034. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The SLCM-N will be deployed aboard Virginia-class attack submarines and built around an 'All Up Round' (AUR) concept. This encompasses an expendable booster, a nuclear-capable cruise missile, and a launch canister, enabling underwater launches from Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) or Virginia Payload Modules (VPM). The Navy’s approach emphasizes leveraging mature technologies and a modular open systems design to reduce development timelines and control costs while maintaining the flexibility for future upgrades. The United States first introduced nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles in the mid-1980s with the deployment of the TLAM-N, a nuclear variant of the Tomahawk Land-Attack Missile. These missiles were stationed on both surface ships and attack submarines, offering a range of approximately 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles). In 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced the withdrawal of all sea-based tactical nuclear weapons, leading to the removal of TLAM-N missiles by mid-1992. The Navy retained the option to redeploy them on attack submarines if necessary. However, in 2010, the Obama Administration recommended retiring the TLAM-N system, deeming it redundant given other available nuclear capabilities. The retirement was completed in 2013. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) under the Trump Administration proposed developing a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, now known as SLCM-N. This initiative aimed to provide a 'non-strategic regional presence' and address the need for 'flexible and low-yield options' in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The SLCM-N was intended to strengthen deterrence against regional adversaries and reassure U.S. allies. In its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request, the Biden Administration allocated funds for research and development of the SLCM-N. However, the 2022 NPR recommended canceling the program, suggesting that existing capabilities were sufficient to meet deterrence requirements. Despite this, Congress continued to provide funding for the SLCM-N and its warhead. The Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated the executive branch to ensure the initial operational capability of the SLCM-N. Subsequently, the Administration has taken steps to implement the program. Proponents of the SLCM-N argue that it offers a flexible and survivable nuclear option, capable of being deployed in various regions without the need for forward-basing nuclear assets on allied territories.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-seeks-industry-input-for-development-of-nuclear-armed-sea-launched-cruise-missile-slcm-n	2024-11-22T05:46:13-08:00

French Navy's Jacques Chevallier Replenishment Ship Officially Enters Active Service	According to information published by the French MoD on November 21, 2024, Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, Chief of Staff of the French Navy, officially declared the Force Replenishment Ship (BRF) Jacques Chevallier operational. Based in Toulon, the vessel is now fully ready for deployment at the order of the Chief of Defense Staff.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BRF Jacques Chevallier is now in active service, contributing to the French Navy's operational support and readiness. (Picture source: French MoD) The Jacques Chevallier is the first in a series of four BRFs designed to modernize and enhance the French Navy's logistical capabilities. It will be joined by its sister ship, the Jacques Stosskopf, in 2026, which was launched in August 2024, followed by two additional vessels in 2028 and 2033. These ships will progressively replace the older Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR). The BRFs are central to the extensive capacity renewal efforts outlined in France's previous Military Programming Law (LPM) and further reinforced under the 2024–2030 LPM. As part of the FlotLog program, these ships ensure the fleet's operational readiness and endurance during long-term deployments. They play a critical role in supporting the fleet’s operational effectiveness by delivering essential supplies, including fuel, munitions, provisions, and technical support. These capabilities enable the BRFs to sustain the carrier strike group centered around the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle or other units involved in strategic deterrence missions. Since its delivery by the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA) on July 18, 2023, the Jacques Chevallier has demonstrated exceptional performance in diverse environments. It has spent 193 days away from its home port, including 153 days at sea, taking part in inter-service training and high-intensity exercises with allied navies. A highlight of its early operations was its participation in the AKILA mission, integrated into the carrier strike group during Mediterranean deployments. The ship has proven its operational flexibility, successfully performing complex resupply missions. Notably, on June 24, 2024, it conducted a sophisticated ammunition replenishment maneuver in coordination with a Multi-Mission Frigate (FREMM). Replenishment ships are the backbone of any blue-water navy, enabling sustained operations far from home ports. They provide essential support in terms of fuel, munitions, spare parts, and provisions, ensuring that frontline combat units, such as aircraft carriers, frigates, and submarines, can remain at sea for extended periods. For the French Navy, which aspires to maintain its position as a global maritime power, replenishment ships are critical. The Navy's capacity to deploy its carrier strike group, centered on the Charles de Gaulle, hinges on a robust and reliable logistical support system. These ships are equally vital for France’s strategic deterrence, as they support submarines and surface ships involved in the country’s nuclear deterrence missions. However, for years, France's fleet of replenishment ships has been insufficient, outdated, and overstretched, limiting the Navy's ability to operate effectively in multiple theaters simultaneously. France's existing Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR), introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, have struggled to meet the demands of a modern blue-water navy. The Somme, Marne, and Var—the three remaining BCRs—are nearing the end of their operational lives. These ships lack the fuel and cargo capacity to support modern naval operations, particularly for high-intensity deployments involving the carrier strike group or multinational coalitions. The limited number of replenishment ships has forced the Navy to prioritize missions, often at the expense of flexibility. The BCRs have been tasked with supporting operations in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and occasionally the Indo-Pacific, stretching their capabilities and availability. This overstretch has led to increased maintenance needs and reduced readiness. The French Navy has faced significant delays in renewing its replenishment fleet. While the need for modern replenishment ships was identified over a decade ago, financial constraints and shifting defense priorities delayed the launch of the FlotLog program.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navys-jacques-chevallier-replenishment-ship-officially-enters-active-service	2024-11-22T04:42:18-08:00

The E-130J, previously referred to as the E-XX, is poised to replace the venerable E-6B Mercury, becoming the backbone of the Navy’s Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) mission.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lockheed Martin unveils the first C-130J-30 Super Hercules for the U.S. Navy's E-130J program, set to redefine strategic airborne communications for the TACAMO mission. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program is a transformative step in modernizing its airborne strategic communications, replacing the aging fleet of E-6B Mercury aircraft. The E-6B, built on the Boeing 707 airframe, has been a cornerstone of the Navy's 'Take Charge and Move Out' (TACAMO) mission since the 1980s. This mission ensures resilient and secure communication links between national command authorities and strategic ballistic missile submarines. However, with the closure of the Boeing 707 production line and increasing maintenance costs, the Navy has faced growing challenges in sustaining the E-6B fleet. The E-130J program addresses these issues by leveraging the modern and reliable Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Super Hercules as its foundation. This airframe was selected after rigorous evaluations under the Navy’s E-XX program, with the decision driven by the C-130J’s proven operational history, manufacturing sustainability, and ability to meet the demanding TACAMO mission requirements. The C-130J’s enhanced payload capacity, extended range, and advanced avionics systems make it an ideal platform for long-duration, mission-critical operations. In October 2024, the U.S. Navy officially designated this new platform as the E-130J. Lockheed Martin began assembling the first E-130J aircraft at its Marietta, Georgia facility shortly thereafter. The program's timeline aims for initial delivery by 2026, with additional units to follow in subsequent years. The Navy plans to procure between eight and twelve E-130J aircraft to fully replace the E-6B fleet, ensuring continuity of operations and enhanced performance. The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program, built on the C-130J-30 Super Hercules airframe, aligns with a global trend among nations to enhance strategic airborne command and control platforms, particularly for missions critical to national defense and continuity of government operations. While the United States is transitioning to this medium-sized, highly adaptable platform, other countries have opted for varying strategies based on their unique requirements, technological bases, and military doctrines. Russia’s primary airborne command and control aircraft are the Ilyushin Il-80 (NATO reporting name: Maxdome) and its smaller counterpart, the Il-82. These aircraft function as 'doomsday planes,' ensuring continuity of operations during nuclear or large-scale conflicts. Based on the Il-86 passenger aircraft platform, the Il-80 is heavily modified with advanced Very Low Frequency (VLF) communication systems to maintain secure communication with Russia’s nuclear forces, similar to the TACAMO role of the U.S. E-130J. The Il-80 is equipped with nuclear blast-resistant shielding, no external windows (other than the cockpit), and advanced onboard command systems capable of coordinating military forces in a crisis. Its larger size compared to the C-130J-30 offers greater payload capacity for extensive onboard communication suites and command equipment. However, this bulkier design limits operational versatility and requires substantial runway infrastructure, in contrast to the E-130J’s ability to operate from shorter, less-developed airstrips. China has adopted its domestically produced Y-20 Kunpeng strategic transport aircraft as the basis for a new generation of airborne command and control platforms. These modified Y-20s focus on integrating advanced communication systems that enable strategic coordination between the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) branches, particularly in operations requiring nuclear deterrence or rapid-response military mobilization. The Y-20 platform provides China with a dual-use capability, functioning both as a strategic transport and as an airborne command post. While the Y-20’s larger payload capacity and longer range provide advantages for hosting extensive command systems, its size may limit deployment flexibility, especially in contested regions where runway availability is constrained. India’s Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&amp;CS), primarily based on the Embraer ERJ 145 platform, represents a different approach. While primarily designed for surveillance and reconnaissance, these aircraft are also equipped with command and control capabilities, allowing them to serve dual purposes in strategic missions. India has also developed the DRDO AEW&amp;CS, an indigenous system designed to complement its Embraer-based fleet, with expanded roles for strategic communication. The AEW&amp;CS platforms offer cost-effective solutions compared to the larger aircraft used by the U.S., Russia, or China, but their smaller size and limited range reduce their utility for extended strategic missions such as TACAMO.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/lockheed-martin-prepares-1st-c-130j-30-super-hercules-aircraft-for-us-navy-strategic-mission	2024-11-22T01:32:33-08:00

Houthis Target Turkish-Owned Ship Allegedly Tied to Israel Trade	According to information published by Tasnim on November 19, 2024, the Anadolu S, managed by Istanbul-based Oras Shipping, avoided damage from two missile strikes while navigating near Yemen’s Mocha port and later southeast of Aden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Anadolu S sails through the tense waters of the Red Sea, narrowly avoiding missile strikes amidst escalating geopolitical tensions fueled by allegations of trade with Israel.. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, accusing the vessel’s owners of breaching their declared trade ban with Israel. This incident forms part of a broader Houthi initiative targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, launched after the group imposed a blockade on companies trading with Israel in May 2024. The Anadolu S is operated by Oras Shipping, a company owned by Salih Zeki Çakır, a close associate of Yıldırım and an influential figure in Turkish shipping. Çakır’s ventures, reportedly linked to trade with Israel, have drawn scrutiny amid public anti-Israel rhetoric from Turkey’s government. Türkiye-Israel relations Turkey and Israel have shared a complex and fluctuating relationship since Turkey became the first Muslim-majority nation to recognize Israel in 1949. Over the decades, their interactions have oscillated between cooperation and tension, deeply influenced by regional conflicts and domestic political dynamics. In the latter half of the 20th century, Turkey and Israel developed significant military and economic ties. Israel provided substantial military assistance to Turkey, including the modernization of Turkish F-4 Phantom and Northrop F-5 aircraft and the upgrade of Turkey’s main battle tank, the Israeli-made Sabra. Naval and aerial cooperation also strengthened bilateral ties, with mutual training and operational coordination in shared exercises. The relationship began to strain in the late 2000s, particularly after the 2008–09 Gaza War. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan openly criticized Israel's actions in Gaza, leading to increased tension. Relations hit a low point after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. The incident prompted Turkey to downgrade diplomatic ties and suspend military cooperation with Israel. Efforts to mend relations began in 2013, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the flotilla incident, paving the way for reconciliation. By 2022, diplomatic ties were fully restored with the reappointment of ambassadors, marking a renewed focus on regional stability and economic collaboration. However, recent conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon have reignited tensions. Turkish President Erdoğan has sharply criticized Israel’s military actions. This has led to a series of measures from Turkey, including the suspension of trade relations in mid-2024 and the denial of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane access to Turkish airspace during a diplomatic trip. Most significantly, in November 2024, President Erdoğan announced that Turkey had severed all relations with Israel, signaling a potential long-term rupture in their diplomatic and economic engagement.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/houthis-target-turkish-owned-ship-allegedly-tied-to-israel-trade	2024-11-21T07:53:32-08:00

US Admiral Raises Doubts Over North Korea’s Nuclear Strike Capabilities	On November 19, 2024, Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, stated that North Korea’s numerous tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) have yet to demonstrate the capability to successfully deliver a nuclear warhead to the U.S. mainland. He made this observation during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This photo, taken on November 18, 2022, shows North Korea's new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the 'Hwasong Gun 17,' before its launch at Pyongyang International Airport (Picture source: KCNA) North Korea recently conducted a test flight of its Hwasong-19 missile, the largest ICBM developed by the regime to date. According to Admiral Paparo, the test indicated the missile’s ability to reach the entire continental United States. However, when questioned about North Korea's capability to pair a nuclear warhead with an ICBM capable of enduring the stresses of launch, flight, and atmospheric reentry, Paparo clarified that such a capability has not yet been observed. He added that continued testing is evident in efforts to achieve this goal. Under Kim Jong Un’s leadership, North Korea has accelerated its missile and nuclear weapons development programs while adopting increasingly hostile rhetoric toward South Korea. Simultaneously, the regime has emerged as a strategic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. Following the latest missile test, the state-run Korean Central News Agency described the Hwasong-19 as the 'ultimate version' of an ICBM intended for deployment by North Korea’s strategic forces. Admiral Paparo’s remarks align with earlier assessments by U.S. officials, offering a cautious view of the threat posed by Pyongyang’s missile advancements. In 2022, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan highlighted uncertainties regarding North Korea’s ability to successfully pair a nuclear warhead with an ICBM, fire it, and strike a precise target in the United States. Nonetheless, such uncertainties do not negate the broader threats posed by North Korea to U.S. interests. Over decades, Pyongyang has amassed an extensive arsenal of millions of artillery shells and thousands of rockets positioned north of the border with South Korea, where nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed. Furthermore, North Korea has demonstrated its ability to launch missiles over Japan, a key U.S. ally in the region. Kim Jong Un continues to pledge enhancements to North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, citing the need to counter threats posed by the security alliance among the United States and its regional allies. This week, North Korean state media reported Kim’s accusations against the U.S., Japan, and South Korea for destabilizing the Korean Peninsula and the broader region. Kim referred to the alliance as an 'Asian version of NATO' and asserted that these nations would bear responsibility for undermining peace and stability. North Korea has made significant strides in ICBM development. In July 2017, it conducted its first test of the Hwasong-14, followed in November 2017 by the Hwasong-15. These missiles, with estimated ranges of approximately 10,400 km and 8,500–13,000 km respectively, place the entire U.S. mainland within potential reach. In October 2024, Pyongyang tested the Hwasong-19, its largest ICBM to date. The missile reached a record altitude of 7,000 km and flew for 87 minutes, demonstrating a range sufficient to cover the U.S. mainland. However, analysts have raised concerns about the practicality of this missile in a conflict scenario due to its significant size, which could limit its mobility and make it more vulnerable to preemptive strikes. Despite these advancements, questions persist about North Korea’s ability to effectively integrate a nuclear warhead with an ICBM capable of withstanding the rigorous conditions of launch, flight, and atmospheric reentry.

Analysis | Did China copy the US SR-71 Blackbird with the new Yunxing supersonic aircraft?	As reported by the South China Morning Post on October 28, 2024, a Chinese aerospace company, Space Transportation, has reported progress in developing its supersonic passenger aircraft, the Yunxing. The aircraft is designed to transport passengers from Beijing to New York in two hours, cruising at speeds of Mach 4—double the speed of the Concorde, which retired in 2003. However, the Yunxing's design bears a striking resemblance to the SR-71 Blackbird, the renowned American reconnaissance aircraft retired in 1998, raising questions about its intended use and suitability for commercial operations, even for sub-orbital spaceflight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Like the SR-71 Blackbird, the Yunxing's structure is composed of lightweight, high-strength composite materials, designed to withstand extreme conditions, such as aerodynamic heating that can raise surface temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. (Picture source: Lingkong Tianxing Technology) The Yunxing's structure is composed of lightweight, high-strength composite materials, designed to withstand extreme conditions, such as aerodynamic heating that can raise surface temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its high lift-to-drag ratio is intended to ensure efficient performance even at high altitudes, contributing to its commercial and operational potential. Unlike traditional horizontal takeoff and landing aircraft, the Yunxing employs vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. This feature, combined with its ability to ascend to altitudes exceeding 20,000 meters, enables it to bypass traditional runway constraints and potentially operate from smaller, urban airport facilities. The company has depicted this process through animations showing the aircraft being launched by booster rockets, gliding at high speeds, and decelerating through a combination of subsonic flight and liquid rocket engines before landing vertically. Founded in 2018, Space Transportation, also known as Lingkong Tianxing Technology, operates from multiple locations across China, including Beijing, Xi'an, and Anhui, with a testing facility in Xinjiang. The company collaborates with universities and research institutions and has contributed to projects like the 'Feitian-1' hypersonic vehicle in 2022. While primarily focused on supersonic passenger aircraft, Space Transportation is also developing suborbital space tourism platforms and hypersonic vehicles for military and research purposes. Analysts speculate that its passenger-oriented projects might serve as a cover for potential military applications, such as high-altitude reconnaissance platforms or vehicles for anti-satellite weaponry. These theories are supported by the advanced aerospace technologies integrated into the project, combining aerodynamic efficiency, thermal protection, and precise control systems. Until now, there was no publicly available information indicating that China has developed or is developing a direct replica of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft known for its high-speed and high-altitude capabilities. However, China has been advancing its own high-speed reconnaissance and surveillance technologies. The People's Liberation Army Air Force has introduced the WZ-8, an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of high-altitude, high-speed reconnaissance missions. Launched from an H-6 bomber, the WZ-8 is reported to achieve speeds exceeding Mach 3, comparable to the SR-71's performance. China has also been investing in hypersonic technology, involving speeds greater than the speed of sound, another point of convergence with the development of the SR-71 Blackbird. The development of hypersonic glide vehicles and missiles suggests a focus on advancing capabilities in high-speed flight, potentially applicable to future reconnaissance platforms. Notable developments include the DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, capable of speeds between Mach 5 and Mach 10, and performing evasive maneuvers during flight. The DF-ZF likely became operational around October 2019. In November 2024, during the China Airshow in Zhuhai, China unveiled the GDF-600 hypersonic glide vehicle, developed by the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy. The GDF-600 can reach speeds up to Mach 7 and is designed to carry various payloads, including submunitions, drones, and unmanned aerial systems. The Yunxing's sleek design, with its pointed nose and twin-engine configuration, evokes a close resemblance to the SR-71's streamlined structure, optimized for high-speed performance and minimal radar signature. (Picture source: Lingkong Tianxing Technology) Additionally, China has been enhancing its anti-satellite capabilities through the use of kinetic kill vehicles (KKVs), which are designed to destroy targets through direct collision, relying on kinetic energy rather than explosive warheads. In 2007, China conducted an anti-satellite test by launching a ballistic missile carrying a kinetic kill vehicle that destroyed the defunct Fengyun-1C weather satellite at an altitude of 865 kilometers. This demonstrated China's capability to eliminate satellites in low Earth orbit using kinetic energy. China has also developed the HQ-19 anti-ballistic missile interceptor, equipped with a dual-purpose exoatmospheric kinetic kill vehicle warhead, designed to engage both ballistic missile warheads and satellites. There is therefore nothing to stop China from developing a new, more discreet and faster means of launching a KKV in the event of war, which could further enhance the strategic value of the Yunxing. In the United States, Lockheed Martin continues to work on the SR-72, the anticipated hypersonic successor to the SR-71 Blackbird. On July 29, 2024, reports indicated that Lockheed Martin’s classified program, likely related to the SR-72 hypersonic aircraft, encountered a budget overrun of $45 million in the second quarter of 2024. Total losses associated with this unnamed classified program have now reached approximately $335 million since 2022, reflecting financial challenges during the project's development. These budget overruns suggest that Lockheed Martin is making substantial investments in the SR-72 project, potentially advancing it toward operational status. The company has acknowledged uncertainties involved in such programs, emphasizing variability in cost and time estimates, along with technical challenges typical of advanced aerospace projects. Evidence of the SR-72's progression includes the expansion of Lockheed’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, where advanced manufacturing techniques like 3D printing of composite structures are employed. The workforce at Lockheed’s Palmdale facility has expanded significantly, with over 5,500 employees reported as of September 2023, more than doubling since 2018. The SR-72 is expected to be powered by a turbine-based combined cycle engine, integrating a traditional turbine engine with a scramjet. This configuration allows it to transition from subsonic to hypersonic speeds, potentially reaching Mach 6—twice the speed of the SR-71. Designed to serve as both an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance asset and a strike platform, the SR-72 could provide the U.S. military with enhanced capabilities in both reconnaissance and strike operations, with an expected service entry by 2030. The officially-civilian Lockheed Martin’s X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology experimental aircraft has also reached a development milestone with its first engine run at the Skunk Works facility. Announced by NASA on November 6, 2024, the X-59 aims to reduce the noise impact of supersonic flight over land, potentially informing future regulations for commercial supersonic travel. The aircraft is designed to produce a quieter sonic effect, described as a 'thump,' even at supersonic speeds. Testing of the X-59 may provide data and engineering insights relevant to the SR-72's development, particularly in areas like high-speed aerodynamics, structural integrity at high speeds, and managing thermal and acoustic effects associated with hypersonic flight. The SR-71 Blackbird was developed as a black project by Lockheed's Skunk Works division in the 1960s, based on the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft.

As the mission progresses, the Aeronautica Militare continues to play a key role in securing NATO airspace and contributing to collective defense in Eastern Europe. This milestone reinforces Italy's commitment to NATO and its operational readiness to face emerging security challenges. The Eurofighter Typhoon originated in the 1980s, a period when European air forces faced the need to modernize their aging fleets of fighter aircraft. At the time, operational aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, F-104 Starfighter, Mirage III, and Tornado F3 ADV were becoming obsolete and unable to meet the demands of modern conflicts. Designed during the Cold War, these aircraft could no longer guarantee air superiority or perform multi-role missions effectively. To address this need, five European nations—Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and France—launched a joint program in 1983, called the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). The goal was to develop an advanced fighter capable of bolstering collective defense capabilities while sharing costs and fostering industrial cooperation across Europe. However, disagreements soon emerged among the partners. France, in particular, sought an aircraft tailored to its specific national needs, including naval missions. In 1985, France withdrew from the project to develop the Dassault Rafale, while the other four nations continued with the design of the aircraft based on common specifications. The development of the Eurofighter Typhoon was structured around specific needs for each nation. Germany aimed to replace its F-4 Phantom II, the United Kingdom intended to retire its Tornado F3 ADV, and Italy and Spain sought to modernize their fleets of F-104 Starfighters and Mirage III. After a decade of negotiations and technical work, the four countries signed a production contract in 1998 for an initial total of 620 aircraft, proportionally distributed. The aircraft's manufacturing was entrusted to a consortium of industries, including BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo, ensuring an equitable distribution of tasks among the partners. Deliveries of the Eurofighter Typhoon began in 2003. This advanced aircraft quickly became a cornerstone of European air forces, undertaking missions in air defense, deterrence, and allied support. Today, it stands as a testament to successful European technological collaboration despite the challenges encountered during its development.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/italian-typhoons-conduct-first-air-to-ground-training-in-lithuania-as-part-of-baltic-air-policing	2024-11-20T06:30:28-08:00

The cost estimate for the latest purchase of 14 Leopard 2A4 tanks is consistent with the financial framework of the October 2022 donation contract. Once completed, the 73rd Tank Battalion will operate 42 Leopard 2A4 tanks by 2026. This procurement is part of the Czech Republic’s effort to meet NATO Capability Targets by modernizing its defense capabilities and improving interoperability within the alliance. The Ministry of Defense has identified the enhancement of technological compatibility as a priority, citing the security situation in Ukraine as a key factor. In addition to this contract, the Czech government has approved plans to acquire up to 77 Leopard 2A8 tanks from Germany. This decision, finalized in June 2024, is part of a joint procurement effort intended to replace the Czech Republic's T-72M4 CZ tanks and involve domestic industry in production and maintenance. The estimated cost of these tanks is approximately CZK 52 billion (around €2.08 billion), with deliveries expected by 2030. This acquisition supports the Czech Republic’s objectives to fulfill NATO’s heavy brigade requirements while replacing its aging fleet of T-72M4 CZ main battle tanks. The Leopard 2A4 and T-72M4 CZ differ significantly in their design and modernization. The Leopard 2A4, introduced by Germany in the 1980s, is equipped with a 120 mm smoothbore gun, composite armor, and a four-person crew. It is powered by a 1,500 hp MTU MB 873 Ka-501 diesel engine, which provides a maximum speed of 68 km/h. The T-72M4 CZ, a Czech upgrade of the Soviet-era T-72M1, features a 125 mm 2A46M smoothbore gun, a 1,000 hp Perkins CV12-1000 engine, enhanced armor protection, and a modernized fire control system. It retains the original three-person crew configuration. Operational data indicates differences in capabilities between the two models. The Leopard 2A4 has been assessed as effective against advanced threats such as modern Russian tanks, though its size and weight may present mobility challenges in certain terrains. The T-72M4 CZ, while incorporating improvements, retains design limitations such as restricted internal space and ammunition vulnerability. Its lighter weight, however, may allow for improved mobility in specific scenarios. The Czech Army currently operates both types of tanks, with Leopard 2A4 units being integrated into active service and T-72M4 CZ units undergoing further evaluation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/czech-republic-to-expand-tank-fleet-with-14-additional-leopard-2a4-units-to-modernize-armored-forces	2024-11-20T05:04:25-08:00	
UK-Germany military ties deepened as aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth visits Hamburg	According to information published by the UK MoD on November 18, 2024, the Royal Navy’s flagship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, has arrived in Hamburg, Germany. The visit follows a series of military exercises with German helicopters in the North Sea, solidifying operational interoperability between the two NATO allies. HMS Queen Elizabeth navigated the river Elbe to the port city, where it will dock at the Steinwerder cruise terminal for five days. This marks the first visit by a Royal Navy aircraft carrier to Hamburg in 13 years and the inaugural visit of the Queen Elizabeth-class carrier to the city.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth. (Picture source: UK MoD) The carrier will serve as a venue for high-level defence engagements, including conferences, ministerial visits, and strategic discussions. Central to these discussions is the recent Trinity House Agreement, signed last month, which signifies a significant step forward in UK-Germany defence collaboration. The treaty outlines shared commitments to enhancing European security amidst the ongoing threat posed by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Key projects under the agreement include the development of advanced maritime drone technologies to counteract surface and underwater threats, an area of critical importance in modern naval warfare. The visit highlights the deepening ties between the UK and Germany, both pivotal NATO members. Discussions during the visit will include procurement strategies for military equipment and enhanced collaboration through the Military Equipment Capability Cooperation (MECC) initiative. Before docking, HMS Queen Elizabeth collaborated with the German Navy and Army helicopters, including NH90 and Navy Lynx Mk88, conducting deck landing operations on the carrier’s vast flight deck. Comments During a hypothetical conflict with Russia, the carrier's primary purpose would be to project power, provide air superiority, and secure critical sea lanes vital for sustaining NATO's logistical and operational frameworks. Its F-35B Lightning II aircraft could conduct precision strikes on Russian military targets, perform reconnaissance, and provide close air support to NATO ground forces in Germany and Eastern Europe. Positioning the carrier in the North Sea would offer a safer operational environment, allowing it to launch sustained air operations while remaining outside the immediate range of Russia's A2/AD capabilities, such as Kaliningrad's S-400 systems and Iskander missiles. However, deploying it into the Baltic Sea would provide more direct support to Germany and frontline NATO states, though at the cost of heightened exposure to Russian missile and naval threats. As part of a carrier strike group, the HMS Queen Elizabeth would enhance NATO’s maritime dominance, leveraging its escorts—destroyers, frigates, and submarines—to counter Russian naval movements and secure strategic maritime corridors. However, this deployment would not be without risks. The carrier’s proximity to Russian territory could make it a high-value target for missile strikes and hybrid warfare tactics, such as cyberattacks aimed at disrupting its operations. Extended missions would also strain logistical networks, requiring access to well-secured ports in northern Germany or allied states for resupply and maintenance.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uk-germany-military-ties-deepened-as-aircraft-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth-visits-hamburg	2024-11-20T04:14:49-08:00

Ukraine Strikes Russian Caspian Port of Kaspiysk with UAV Damages Navy Vessels	According to information published by the UK MoD on November 15, 2024, Ukraine executed a daring Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) strike on the Caspian port of Kaspiysk in Russia. The port, a critical hub for the Russian Navy’s Caspian Flotilla, is reported to have hosted multiple naval vessels at the time, with at least two Gepard-class frigates sustaining damage.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Project 11661 (Gepard-class) frigate Tatarstan. (Picture source: Artem Balabin) The Gepard-class frigates, also known as Project 11661, are warships developed by Russia as a successor to earlier designs like the Koni-class frigates and Grisha-class corvettes. Built for multi-role capabilities, these ships are designed to engage surface vessels, submarines, and aerial threats. The lead ship of the class, originally named Yastreb and later renamed Tatarstan, was constructed at the Zelenodolsk Zavod shipyard. Although laid down in 1991, funding challenges delayed its completion, and it was eventually commissioned in 2002 as the flagship of the Russian Navy’s Caspian Flotilla. The Gepard-class features a displacement of up to 1,930 tons at full load, with a length of 102.4 meters and a beam of 13.09 meters. Its propulsion system uses a Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) configuration, allowing a top speed of 29 knots and an operational range of approximately 4,000 nautical miles at 10 knots. The frigates are armed with a variety of weapon systems, including the AK-176M naval gun, Uran-E or Club-N missile systems for anti-ship and land-attack roles, and air defense systems like the Palma gun/missile system. For anti-submarine warfare, the ships are equipped with torpedo tubes and rocket launchers. Additionally, they support aviation operations with a helipad and hangar capable of accommodating a Ka-28 or Ka-31 helicopter. While the full extent of the damage remains unclear, initial assessments suggest that any impairments to the vessels are likely to be swiftly repaired. This marks a rare instance of direct Ukrainian action against Russia’s Caspian Flotilla. The flotilla, heavily involved in launching missile attacks on Ukraine during 2022, has maintained a lower profile in 2023-2024. The strike appears to be a retaliatory measure for Russia’s continued missile attacks on Ukrainian territory. The attack sends a broader message, demonstrating Ukraine's capacity to penetrate Russian defenses and target assets deep within Russian territory. Prior to reaching its target, the UAV is believed to have traversed a significant expanse of Russian territory without being intercepted. This raises critical questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defense systems and will likely alarm Russian political and military leadership. The strike underscores Ukraine’s evolving drone warfare capabilities, even as the operational tempo in the Black Sea remains relatively low. By targeting a port in the Caspian region, Ukraine has highlighted its capacity to project power beyond the immediate conflict zones, challenging Russian assumptions about the safety of its naval assets in peripheral areas. For Russia, the attack serves as a stark reminder of vulnerabilities in its defensive posture, especially against UAV incursions. This could prompt Moscow to bolster air defense coverage in areas previously considered secure, diverting resources from other theaters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/ukraine-strikes-russian-caspian-port-of-kaspiysk-with-uav-damages-navy-vessels	2024-11-19T04:08:03-08:00

China extends DF-100 supersonic missile range to 4,000 km for strategic strikes	On November 17, 2024, the Chinese account C Major provided updated data on China’s Dongfeng-100 (DF-100) supersonic cruise missile, also known as the Changjian-100 (CJ-100). The missile is a land-based system with a range reportedly between 3,000 and 4,000 kilometers and a sustained flight speed of Mach 4. It is designed for precision strikes and features capabilities aimed at targeting various types of installations and structures.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The DF-100’s reported range extends across the Western Pacific, enabling it to reach strategic installations such as the U.S. military bases in Guam, rendering them susceptible to precision strikes. (Picture source: Chinese social media) The DF-100 was publicly introduced during China’s 70th National Day parade on October 1, 2019. At that time, its range was reported to be 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers, with a speed between Mach 4 and Mach 5. The system is capable of engaging targets such as land-based facilities, reinforced structures, underground bunkers, and large naval vessels. It can be deployed in pairs on a 10x10 transporter erector launcher (TEL) vehicle and has the potential to be launched from the H-6K bomber. New information suggests an improved range of up to 4,000 kilometers while maintaining a consistent speed of Mach 4. The DF-100 operates at supersonic speeds for most of its flight and follows a trajectory that takes it into altitudes of over 30 kilometers. This flight profile minimizes atmospheric drag but increases exposure to radar detection. Its guidance system includes inertial navigation, terrain matching, scene matching, and satellite positioning, providing high accuracy. This combination allows the missile to strike both fixed and moving targets, including slow-moving naval vessels. Specifications for the DF-100 include a length exceeding 9 meters, a projectile diameter ranging between 0.7 and 1 meter, and a payload capacity of over 500 kilograms. The missile is powered by a ramjet engine and achieves speeds of Mach 5 during its terminal phase. Its three-stage operation includes an initial boost phase using a solid rocket motor, a cruise phase at altitudes of 30 to 40 kilometers, and a terminal glide phase. The glide phase involves high-speed maneuvering, enhancing its ability to evade defenses and strike moving targets. Reports from the U.S. Air Force’s China Aerospace Studies Institute in 2020 identified the DF-100 as part of the PLA Rocket Force’s 656th Brigade in Shandong Province. Its minimum effective range of 2,000 kilometers places Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and the northern Philippines within its operational scope. The missile was assessed to have reached full operational capability by 2022. The DF-100 has been highlighted as a concern in Taiwan’s defense assessments. In October 2023, the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense reported to the Legislative Yuan that the missile could affect regional security by limiting allied access to surrounding seas. This assessment is consistent with the missile’s deployment within China’s broader objectives. In response, Taiwan has acquired PAC-3 Patriot systems, while South Korea has deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. The DF-100’s reported range extends across the Western Pacific, enabling it to reach strategic installations such as the U.S. military bases in Guam, including Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam, fall within this range, rendering them susceptible to precision strikes. Additionally, key facilities in Japan, such as the Yokosuka Naval Base and Misawa Air Base, are now within reach, posing a direct threat to U.S. and allied forces stationed there. The DF-100's capability to engage large naval vessels also places aircraft carrier strike groups operating in the Western Pacific at increased risk, potentially altering naval deployment strategies in the region. Furthermore, critical infrastructure in countries like South Korea, including Osan Air Base and Camp Humphreys, could be targeted, impacting the operational readiness of U.S. and allied forces. The missile’s speed, range, and precision suggest applications in China’s Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) strategy. These characteristics may challenge existing missile defense systems by reducing interception response times and increasing the likelihood of penetrating defenses. Its ability to carry either conventional or nuclear warheads further adds to its operational utility. The DF-100 represents developments in missile technology, including enhancements in range, targeting systems, and operational versatility. These improvements, combined with the system’s deployment, affect regional security dynamics. The missile’s range and capabilities require adjustments in defensive measures by neighboring countries and those with interests in the region. As such, the DF-100 is a critical element in discussions of regional military strategy and balance of power.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-extends-df-100-supersonic-missile-range-to-4-000-km-for-strategic-strikes	2024-11-18T04:59:43-08:00

Brazil to start receiving new US UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters in 2025	On November 15, 2024, the Brazilian Army announced that it would begin receiving 12 Sikorsky UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, starting in 2025. These helicopters were purchased from the United States through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The delivery schedule anticipates the first helicopter arriving next year, with the remainder expected between 2027 and 2029.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The helicopters, designated HM-2A in the Brazilian Army, are intended to replace four UH-60L Black Hawks (HM-2) and eight Airbus Helicopters AS532UE Cougars (HM-3) currently in service. (Picture source: Brazilian Air Force) The procurement, approved by the U.S. government in May 2024, includes 12 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, 34 T700-GE-701D turboshaft engines (24 installed and 10 spare), 28 EAGLE-M Integrated Inertial Navigation GPS systems, and 24 AN/ARC-231A radio systems. The overall deal is valued at up to $950 million. The helicopters will be new from the factory under the U.S. Army's Multi-Year X production program, which allocates excess defense articles for sale to allied nations. This continues the Brazilian Army's policy of acquiring new helicopters rather than used equipment. A team from the U.S. Army and Sikorsky visited the Army Aviation Command (CAvEx) at Taubaté Aviation Base in São Paulo to evaluate its infrastructure and recommend adjustments needed to accommodate the new helicopters. The base currently operates Airbus H125M Esquilo and H225M Caracal helicopters, necessitating modifications for the integration of the Black Hawks. The base is also home to multiple aviation units, including the 1st and 2nd Army Aviation Battalions, the Army Aviation Training Center, and the Maintenance and Supply Battalion. The T700-GE-701D engines included in the deal are not the latest technology, as the U.S. Army is in the process of transitioning to the T901 Improved Turbine Engine. The T901, designed to enhance performance, range, and fuel efficiency, is undergoing testing with Black Hawk helicopters but is not included in Brazil's contract. Additionally, this purchase does not include industrial, economic, or technological compensation (offset) clauses, unlike previous Brazilian military acquisitions such as the F-39 Gripen fighter and H-36 Caracal helicopter projects. Maintenance capabilities for Sikorsky helicopters in Brazil have been a longstanding issue. The manufacturer does not operate a dedicated maintenance center in the country, instead relying on logistics support contracts and authorized workshops. This differs from competitors like Airbus and Leonardo, which have more comprehensive local support facilities. The acquisition follows a history of Black Hawk operations in Brazil. The first four UH-60L Black Hawks were delivered to the Brazilian Army in 1997 for peacekeeping missions. Additional deliveries included six configured for special forces and search-and-rescue in 2008, followed by ten more in 2009, with deliveries continuing through 2011.

Unlike its predecessors, which use ski-jump ramps for aircraft launches, the Fujian features electromagnetic catapult systems (EMALS). These systems enable heavier and more fuel-laden aircraft like the J-35 to launch with greater efficiency, enhancing their range, payload, and operational flexibility. The deployment of the J-35 is a direct response to China’s growing strategic challenges in the Indo-Pacific. As tensions rise over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, the PLAN’s ability to project power and defend its claims becomes increasingly important. The J-35 positions China to counter regional adversaries and rival powers, particularly the United States. The U.S. Navy’s F-35C, a carrier-based fifth-generation fighter, has long been regarded as the gold standard for naval aviation. By introducing the J-35, China aims to bridge the technological gap and demonstrate its ability to compete on equal footing. Moreover, the J-35 could influence the balance of power in regional security arrangements. For instance, nations aligned with the U.S., such as Japan and South Korea, may be compelled to enhance their naval capabilities in response to China’s advancements. This dynamic is likely to intensify the ongoing arms race in the region. While the J-35 represents a major technological achievement, its integration into the PLAN is not without challenges. The fighter’s performance and reliability in real-world carrier operations remain untested. Another challenge is ensuring the seamless coordination of the J-35 with other elements of the PLAN’s carrier strike groups. This includes integrating the fighter’s advanced capabilities with China’s emerging naval network, which encompasses airborne early warning aircraft, drones, and surface ships. The J-35’s deployment signals a broader shift in China’s military strategy. By fielding a carrier-based stealth fighter, China is asserting its intent to challenge U.S. dominance in the Indo-Pacific and establish itself as a global maritime power. This move is likely to provoke reactions from regional players and could reshape alliances and security dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/j-35-stealth-fighter-to-enhance-chinese-aircraft-carrier-power	2024-11-15T04:15:43-08:00

(Picture source: French MoD) The report points out that prolonging the service life of the current E-3F fleet until 2035 could be counterproductive. Not only would it strain operational readiness, but it would also significantly increase maintenance costs. The report, therefore, recommends a 2025 timeline for launching a replacement program as part of the next annual adjustment of the military budget. AWACS The French E-3F AWACS, a heavily modified Boeing 707, features Northrop Grumman’s AN/APY-1/2 radar system within its rotating rotodome, which offers 360-degree coverage. This radar can detect airborne threats up to 400 kilometers (250 miles) away and maritime targets up to 600 kilometers (370 miles) depending on altitude and radar settings. Operating in the S-band, the radar provides three-dimensional data on range, bearing, and altitude, allowing precise threat tracking. For onboard systems, the E-3F integrates sophisticated data links including Link 16, which enables secure, high-speed data sharing with NATO and allied forces. This connectivity supports its role in network-centric warfare, enabling it to serve as a command hub that relays information in real-time across air and ground forces. Its radar dome, or rotodome, is 9.1 meters (30 feet) in diameter and rotates once every ten seconds, which is crucial for the radar’s continuous scanning capability. The rotodome uses pulse-Doppler technology to distinguish fast-moving aircraft from slower-moving ground clutter. Comments France currently operates four E-3F Sentry AWACS aircraft, which have been pivotal in providing all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications. However, these platforms are becoming increasingly outdated, facing challenges in maintenance and operational efficiency. The need for enhanced capabilities to address evolving threats has prompted the consideration of more advanced replacements. In early 2024, reports emerged indicating that France is considering the acquisition of the Saab GlobalEye system to replace its E-3F fleet. The GlobalEye, developed by Swedish defense manufacturer Saab, is a multi-role AEW&amp;C platform based on the Bombardier Global 6000 business jet. It integrates advanced radar and sensor technologies, offering extended surveillance range and multi-domain operational capabilities. This system has already been adopted by countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Sweden. While the GlobalEye is a strong contender, other platforms are also under consideration. The Boeing E-7A Wedgetail, for instance, has been selected by several NATO allies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, as a replacement for their aging AWACS fleets. The E-7A offers advanced radar capabilities and has been recognized for its operational effectiveness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/french-mps-call-for-awacs-aircraft-to-be-replaced-by-2025	2024-11-14T06:33:30-08:00

Equipped with the advanced Aegis Ashore system from the U.S. Navy, the base is designed to detect, track, and intercept ballistic missiles in flight, enhancing NATO's airspace security in Europe. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Redzikowo now becomes the second ground-based installation in Europe to feature the Aegis Ashore system, complementing the site in Deveselu, Romania, which has been operational since 2016 (Picture source: NATO) The Aegis Ashore system, central to Redzikowo's defense capabilities, relies on the AN/SPY-1 radar, a multifunctional radar with electronic scanning that can simultaneously detect and track numerous airborne and surface targets, providing continuous 360-degree surveillance. The SM-3 interceptors are anti-ballistic missiles specifically designed to destroy enemy missiles in their mid-flight phase, intercepting them while still in the exo-atmospheric layer. These interceptors use direct-impact technology to collide with the target at high speed, effectively neutralizing potential threats. Together, these elements provide Redzikowo with a robust defense against ballistic missile threats, reinforcing the security of Poland and NATO overall. Polish leaders, along with the U.S. ambassador and senior officials, have described the inauguration as a historic moment, viewing it as an increased U.S. commitment to European security. Polish President Andrzej Duda, present at Redzikowo, emphasized that the base demonstrates Poland’s departure from the Russian sphere of influence, declaring that 'the entire world will clearly see that this is no longer within Russia’s sphere of interest.' Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz further described the base as a 'remarkable' milestone for the security of Poland, the United States, and NATO, also noting the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that underscore the importance of modern air defense systems. Redzikowo now becomes the second ground-based installation in Europe to feature the Aegis Ashore system, complementing the site in Deveselu, Romania, which has been operational since 2016. This missile shield is part of a broader defense network that includes U.S. Navy destroyers stationed in Rota, Spain, also equipped with similar Aegis defense capabilities, as well as an advanced radar in Kurecik, Turkey. Together, these installations enhance NATO's capacity to intercept short- to medium-range ballistic missiles, providing an additional layer of protection for European populations, territories, and allied forces. On the Russian side, this new installation has not been well received. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denounced the facility, asserting that it challenges Russia’s security. He accused the United States of using the 'ephemeral' threat from Iran as a cover for its true purpose, suggesting that the base actually aims to contain Russia militarily. According to Moscow, advancing American military infrastructure closer to Russian borders is an attempt to curb its strategic capabilities, prompting Russia to consider 'parity' measures to restore balance. Despite NATO’s assurances that this is a purely defensive installation, military sources indicated that the system in Poland is currently calibrated to counter missiles from the Middle East. To intercept Russian missiles, a reconfiguration of the radar would be required—a complex operation that would also entail a defense policy revision. Polish Defense Minister Kosiniak-Kamysz has expressed interest in expanding the shield’s operational scope, a subject that will be discussed with NATO and the United States to better address current security needs in Eastern Europe. In this context, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is scheduled to meet with President Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw to further strengthen security cooperation among member states. Ultimately, the Redzikowo base stands as a powerful symbol of military cooperation between Poland and the United States—a partnership Poland considers essential to its national defense amid recent political uncertainties. It not only bolsters Poland’s security but also contributes to the broader security of Europe, adding a strategic layer of deterrence amid ongoing tensions with Russia and underscoring NATO’s commitment to regional stability.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-and-us-inaugurate-new-nato-missile-defense-base-previously-criticized-by-russia	2024-11-14T03:09:37-08:00

Lockheed Martin Develops New Rocket Launcher to Modernize US Army Artillery Capabilities	During the US Army’s Human-Machine Integration Summit IV, held at Texas A&amp;M University, Lockheed Martin recently introduced a mobile launcher concept. This new launcher, capable of carrying up to 24 227mm guided artillery rockets, is designed for integration on a 10×10 Marine Corps LVSR truck, potentially supporting various munitions. Among the compatible systems could be surface-to-air interceptors, ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles, and PrSM missiles. If implemented, this launcher may provide both offensive and defensive capabilities through a mobile logistics platform.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lockheed Martin displayed the launcher on a Marine Corps MKR18 LVSR truck, structurally similar to the Army’s M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS), both produced by Oshkosh Defense. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin via The War Zone) The prototype displayed uses the Marine Corps MKR18 LVSR truck, a vehicle similar in structure to the Army’s M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS), with both vehicles produced by Oshkosh Defense. There are suggestions of a potential connection to the earlier Palletized Field Artillery Launcher (PFAL) program, aimed at enhancing logistical vehicles with artillery functions. The launcher’s expanded capacity, potentially carrying up to 24 rockets, quadruples the payload of current HIMARS systems. This modular design could support munitions from the MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM), such as GMLRS, ATACMS, and PrSM missiles. Initial configurations may allow for six GMLRS rockets, two PrSMs, or one ATACMS per module, with potential expansion to PrSM variants, including those with ranges up to 1,000 kilometers and options for anti-ship targeting. The U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC) has ongoing modernization projects that could align with this launcher’s capabilities. Among these are the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) initiative, targeting a range increase from the existing 30 kilometers to over 70 kilometers, and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), operational since 2023, intended as a replacement for the ATACMS. The PrSM program may evolve to include the capability for engaging moving targets. AFC is also working on the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), which aims to engage distant, high-value targets. Another AFC project, the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher (AML), involves an unmanned HIMARS variant designed to improve operational flexibility while minimizing personnel exposure. The launcher’s configuration allows for potential integration of various interceptors, indicating a dual capability for both artillery and air defense. Compatible interceptors may include those from the PAC-3 family, AIM-9X, and Tamir interceptors used in Iron Dome systems. The LVSR platform has previously demonstrated capacity for large payloads, such as serving as a launcher for DARPA’s OpFires hypersonic missile project. If integrated as projected, this launcher would connect with the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), facilitating coordination with radar and sensor networks to provide a comprehensive defense against aerial and missile threats. However, its larger structure might reduce mobility in comparison to the HIMARS system, which is optimized for deployment via C-130 transport. The U.S. Army Futures Command is actively focused on advancing MLRS capabilities to enhance range, precision, and adaptability. The ERCA system aims to extend artillery reach beyond 70 kilometers, a significant increase from current systems’ ranges. The PrSM, compatible with both the M270 MLRS and M142 HIMARS, is designed to double the missile capacity per launcher while providing improved accuracy. With operational capability achieved in 2023, the PrSM may be adapted in the future for engaging moving targets. The LRHW program, a collaborative project across military branches, is focused on developing a ground-launched hypersonic missile system for engaging high-value targets over extended ranges. Finally, the AML initiative involves developing unmanned, remote-controlled HIMARS variants to improve operational flexibility and reduce personnel risks in artillery missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/lockheed-martin-develops-new-rocket-launcher-to-modernize-us-army-artillery-capabilities	2024-11-14T01:39:54-08:00	
First Combat Deployment of US F-35C Fighters in Strategic Strikes Against Houthis in Yemen	Amid rising tensions in the Middle East, the United States mobilized its air power for targeted strikes against military infrastructure controlled by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. On the night of November 10–11, 2024, combat aircraft, including F-35Cs from the U.S. Marine Corps deployed aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, participated in an operation led by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). This mission marked the first combat engagement of F-35Cs in an active theater. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35C Lightning II from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 joined the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2022 to deploy as part of Carrier Strike Group 3 (Picture source: US DoD) The F-35C Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole fighter designed for carrier-based operations. It features advanced stealth technology for low radar visibility and is powered by the F135-PW-100 engine, enabling it to reach speeds of up to Mach 1.6. With a wingspan of 13.1 meters and a length of 15.7 meters, it can carry up to 8,160 kg of payload, including AIM-120C/D and AIM-9X air-to-air missiles, GBU-31 JDAM and GBU-12 LGB guided bombs, as well as AGM-154 JSOWs. Equipped with the AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the F-35C provides advanced detection and tracking capabilities. Its AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare suite offers protection against electronic threats, while the AN/AAQ-40 electro-optical targeting system (EOTS) ensures precise targeting. These systems, along with sophisticated sensor fusion, grant the F-35C unparalleled situational awareness, enhancing its lethality and survivability in combat. The targets included weapons storage facilities in Houthi-controlled areas, where advanced conventional arms used to target both military and civilian vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden were reportedly stored. According to Pentagon spokesperson General Pat Ryder, these strikes directly responded to Houthi attacks on American, commercial, and allied vessels. Ryder stated that the U.S. would maintain pressure on the Houthis to prevent future attacks. This operation involved multiple aircraft, including the F-35C, F/A-18F Super Hornet, and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare plane, all deployed from the USS Abraham Lincoln. While the strikes were initially attributed to the Navy, it was later confirmed that the F-35Cs involved were part of the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314), the 'Black Knights,' the first F-35C squadron to be deployed aboard the Lincoln. The deployment of the F-35C in combat represents a significant milestone for this stealth aircraft variant, which was first operational in 2019 and had its initial deployment in 2021. Until this mission, the F-35C had not seen active combat, unlike the earlier F-35B and F-35A versions, which were deployed in 2018 and 2019 for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively. In response, the Houthis launched an extensive attack on November 11. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance were targeted by eight kamikaze drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and three anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were successfully intercepted without damage or casualties. The military capabilities of the Houthis, bolstered by Iranian weapons and technology transfers, continue to raise international concern. A recent U.N. report highlighted that Iranian support has enabled the Houthis to become a formidable military force with capabilities far beyond those of a typical armed group. It is also suggested that Russia may be providing intelligence and anti-ship missiles to the Houthis. These American strikes and recent interceptions underscore the complex security landscape in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The United States has strengthened its military posture to secure these critical maritime routes amid increasingly sophisticated threats. The deployment of F-35Cs in this conflict reflects a strategic evolution in U.S. military presence in the region and demonstrates its ability to counter diverse threats posed by Iran-backed Houthi forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/first-combat-deployment-of-us-f-35c-fighters-in-strategic-strikes-against-houthis-in-yemen	2024-11-14T01:37:09-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) Following its exclusion from the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program in 2019, Türkiye initially demanded $1.4 billion in compensation. However, in 2021, Türkiye reoriented its strategy, seeking authorization to acquire 40 F-16 Vipers along with 79 modernization kits for its fleet of older-generation F-16s. This proposal encountered resistance within the U.S. Congress, although it received support from the Biden administration, which viewed the sale as leverage to encourage Türkiye to facilitate Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) had given its approval for this potential sale, which included not only the F-16Vs but also AIM-9X Block II missiles, AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles, and GBU-39/B bombs, with an estimated value of $23 billion. However, Türkiye adjusted its plans and, in addition to the F-16 order, expressed its intention to procure 40 Eurofighter Typhoon EF-2000s, with support from the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, despite initial opposition from Germany. German authorities ultimately lifted their objections, paving the way for a potential order of the Typhoons. Yaşar Güler, speaking in an interview with TV100, stated, 'Currently, our relations with our American friends are very positive. The contracts for the acquisition of 40 F-16 Vipers are signed. We will also acquire 40 Eurofighter Typhoons.' However, he did not specify the total contract amount or the delivery schedule for these new aircraft. Meanwhile, Türkiye continues to develop its fifth-generation fighter, the Kaan, which made its maiden flight last February. However, without new fighter acquisitions, the modernization of Türkiye’s air force could face challenges amidst regional threats, especially as Iran encounters similar issues. For its part, Greece, a historical rival of Türkiye, has already taken steps to bolster its capabilities by ordering Rafale jets and upgrading part of its F-16 fleet to the 'Viper' standard. The F-16 Block 70/72 'Viper' is equipped with advanced technology, including an APG-83 SABR active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an advanced mission computer, a 'Center Pedestal Display' for terrain following, and enhanced connectivity via Link 16, making it particularly suitable for modern operations. This new equipment is expected to provide the Turkish Air Force with increased operational capability, enabling Ankara to strengthen its role within NATO while diversifying its defense procurement sources. The dual acquisition of F-16s and Eurofighter Typhoons underscores Turkey's determination to maintain high-level air capabilities in a strategic environment where regional rivalries and alliances play a crucial role.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/tuerkiye-continues-to-strengthen-its-air-force-with-acquisition-of-40-f-16-viper-fighters	2024-11-14T00:47:42-08:00	
Belgium Discusses Arming MQ-9B SkyGuardian Drones in Defense Committee	The debate over arming military drones has resurfaced in Belgium, with discussions held on November 13, 2024, during a Defense Committee meeting considering the possibility of equipping the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones with offensive capabilities. Currently, these drones are used exclusively for observation missions, but advocates for their armament argue that it could significantly enhance Belgium’s defense capabilities in an increasingly volatile international landscape. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In June 2024, the Belgian army announced that the first six Belgian crews had completed their initial training at General Atomics in North Dakota, with additional training scheduled (Picture source: Belgian Army) At the center of these discussions are the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, which Belgium acquired in 2018 at a total cost of 160 million euros, purchasing two units. Developed by General Atomics, the MQ-9B is a next-generation remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) designed for medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) missions. With a wingspan of 79 feet (24 meters), the drone can fly over the horizon for 40+ hours in all weather conditions, while safely integrating into civil airspace. Equipped with the Lynx Multi-mode Radar, advanced electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors, and automatic takeoff and landing features, the SkyGuardian provides robust surveillance capabilities. The SkyGuardian’s design allows it to carry up to 2,155 kg in payload across nine external hardpoints and an internal bay, suitable for integrating various sensors and precision-guided munitions. It reaches a maximum speed of 210 KTAS and boasts a range exceeding 6,000 nautical miles. Compliant with NATO standards (STANAG 4671) and civil airspace regulations, the MQ-9B includes a detect and avoid system, de-ice/anti-ice capabilities, and an airframe built to endure up to 40,000 hours of operation, making it versatile for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions—and potentially offensive operations if armed. The ongoing discussions emphasize the utility of armed drones in recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, where such systems have shown rapid and effective response capabilities on the battlefield, reducing risks to soldiers. Proponents argue that arming drones could offer Belgium a strategic advantage, modernizing its defense posture and aligning it more closely with the practices of NATO allies. The topic of arming the SkyGuardians has been debated in Belgium since their acquisition in 2018, with various discussions over the years exploring both tactical benefits and ethical implications. In 2021, a strategic committee highlighted the advantages that armed drones could bring to Belgian defense forces, but concerns around ethical and political issues kept them restricted to surveillance missions. In early 2024, a proposal to arm the drones was presented but faced opposition due to ethical and legal considerations, leading to its temporary withdrawal. Later, as discussions continued, an alternative parliamentary majority showed interest in advancing the measure, but ultimately, caution prevailed, and the decision was deferred to the current executive's ongoing evaluations. Following recent elections, a working group within the Belgian Defense Committee has resumed the examination of armed drones as part of broader considerations around 'autonomous weapons.' If approved, arming Belgium’s drones could offer significant strategic advantages. Operationally, this shift would provide precision strike capabilities, reducing reliance on fighter jets, which are costly and logistically challenging to deploy. Armed drones could also deliver close air support to ground forces, boosting their security and operational reach. Additionally, with their long-endurance capabilities, these drones would allow continuous monitoring of sensitive areas, ready to respond immediately to identified threats. Aligning Belgium’s drone capabilities with NATO allies would strengthen interoperability, enhancing coherence in joint military operations, particularly in scenarios that require precision strikes to secure intervention zones.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/belgium-discusses-arming-mq-9b-skyguardian-drones-in-defense-committee	2024-11-14T00:26:46-08:00	
Towards Armed Drones for Belgian Army? N-VA Revives Debate in Defense Committee	The debate over arming military drones has resurfaced in Belgium. On November 13, 2024, during a Defense Committee meeting, the N-VA introduced a resolution aimed at equipping the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, acquired by the Belgian army, with offensive capabilities. These drones are used exclusively for observation missions, but the N-VA advocates arming them to bolster Belgium’s defense effectiveness in an increasingly unstable international landscape. This proposal marks a significant moment in the national discussion on drone use, dividing those who view this technology as a modernization tool for the armed forces and those concerned about its ethical and political implications. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In June 2024, the Belgian army announced that the first six Belgian crews had completed their initial training at General Atomics in North Dakota, with additional training scheduled (Picture source: Belgian Army) At the heart of this debate are the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, acquired by Belgium in 2018 for a total of 160 million euros, with two units purchased. Developed by General Atomics, these MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) drones are highly capable, and designed for long-duration surveillance missions. The SkyGuardian can carry a payload of up to 2,155 kg, making it suitable for carrying various types of weaponry, such as missiles and precision bombs. Despite this capability, Belgian drones remain unarmed, limited solely to intelligence-gathering operations. The resolution, introduced by Peter Buysrogge and supported by other N-VA members on November 13, explicitly calls on the government to 'break the taboo' on arming the SkyGuardian drones and to move 'without delay' toward offensive armament. The N-VA argues that recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, underscore the effectiveness of armed drones for rapid, effective responses on the ground, minimizing risks to soldiers. Supporters see drone armament as a strategic shift that would modernize Belgium’s military capability, better positioning it to face contemporary threats and aligning it with NATO allies. The question of arming the SkyGuardians is not new in Belgium. From the time of their acquisition in 2018, the issue has sparked debate within the De Croo government (Vivaldi coalition), with some considering it a step towards a more aggressive military stance. In 2021, a strategic committee led by Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder recommended arming the SkyGuardians, highlighting the tactical benefits for Belgian forces. However, this recommendation was dismissed due to ethical and political concerns, and the drones remained limited to surveillance missions. At the beginning of 2024, a proposal to arm the drones was put forward by Jasper Pillen (Open VLD) and later amended by Tim Vandenput, but it was blocked by opposition from Ecolo-Groen, whose members raised ethical and legal concerns about armed drone use. This blockage led to the proposal’s withdrawal from the Defense Committee’s agenda in May. Later that year, an alternative majority in Parliament—composed of the N-VA, MR, Open VLD, CD&amp;V, Les Engagés, and Vlaams Belang—considered pushing the measure through before the June elections. Ultimately, caution prevailed, and the decision was deferred to negotiations under the new executive. The 'Arizona' coalition formed after the elections has reignited the debate with a specialized working group on 'autonomous weapons,' which includes armed drones. Arming Belgium’s drones would offer multiple strategic advantages, extending beyond mere military modernization. Operationally, this move would enable precise and rapid strike capabilities, reducing Belgium’s reliance on fighter jets, which are costly and challenging to mobilize in certain situations. Armed drones could provide close air support to ground troops, significantly enhancing their security and operational effectiveness. Additionally, the long endurance of these drones would allow continuous surveillance over sensitive areas, with the capacity to intervene immediately in response to identified threats. This evolution would also bring Belgium in line with NATO allies, fostering greater interoperability and coherence in joint military operations, especially in contexts where precision strikes are required to secure intervention zones.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/towards-armed-drones-for-belgian-army-n-va-revives-debate-in-defense-committee	2024-11-14T00:26:46-08:00

French Aircraft Carrier Charles de Gaulle Refines Self-Defense with Anti-Drone Exercise	According to information published by the French MoD on November 12, 2024, in a recent high-intensity anti-drone defense exercise, the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle collaborated with the 31F Flotilla to refine critical skills in combating unmanned aerial threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Navy's aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. (Picture source: NATO) Countering drone threats from an aircraft carrier involves a layered defense strategy, integrating advanced detection, interception, and neutralization capabilities to address a broad range of unmanned aerial threats. Carriers rely heavily on sophisticated radar and sensor networks, such as AN/SPY-6 or AESA radars, capable of detecting small, fast-moving drones at considerable distances. To enhance accuracy, these radar systems work alongside infrared and electro-optical sensors, providing comprehensive tracking even in challenging environmental conditions. Artificial intelligence further augments this capability by analyzing flight patterns, categorizing drones by threat level, and enabling the defense team to prioritize their responses effectively. Electronic warfare (EW) plays a pivotal role in countering drones, with systems like the AN/SLQ-32 or SEWIP being instrumental in jamming communication links or disrupting GPS signals. Such jamming tactics are particularly effective against drone swarms that aim to overwhelm carrier defenses. In addition, EW systems can employ spoofing techniques, confusing a drone’s navigation system by altering its GPS or control signals, which often leads to the drone crashing or veering off course. Carriers are also equipped with kinetic and non-kinetic interceptors to neutralize drones that breach outer detection layers. Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS), such as Phalanx or SeaRAM, provide robust short-range defenses, using rapid-fire projectiles or missiles to engage small, low-flying drones. In parallel, directed energy weapons (DEWs), such as lasers or high-power microwaves, offer scalable responses, incinerating or disabling drones at close range with precision. Anti-air missiles, like the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile or ESSM, are deployed against larger drones that could carry explosives or reconnaissance equipment, providing a longer-range engagement option. Defensive drone systems add an additional layer of response, allowing carriers to deploy their own UAVs to intercept and neutralize hostile drones before they reach the fleet. Defensive drones are often used in swarm-on-swarm tactics to counter incoming drone swarms. These swarms of defensive drones coordinate their actions to intercept hostile UAVs effectively, using either kinetic force or electronic jamming. The success of counter-drone operations depends on an integrated command and control (C2) system that centralizes communication between detection, EW, and weapon systems. This networked C2 system ensures rapid coordination, allowing operators to manage multiple threats in real-time. Carriers also communicate securely with their escorting vessels, creating a unified defense that maximizes the chance of intercepting hostile drones. Regular training and simulation exercises simulate a variety of drone threats, such as swarm attacks and complex flight maneuvers, ensuring that crews are prepared for a range of possible scenarios. Overall, a multi-layered defense, combining early detection, electronic warfare, kinetic interceptors, and networked command systems, is critical for carriers to protect themselves against the evolving challenges of drone warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-refines-self-defense-with-anti-drone-exercise	2024-11-13T06:59:42-08:00

Together, these capabilities represent a comprehensive EW suite, providing NATO fleets with a tactical edge in increasingly complex maritime threat environments. Naval Electronic Warfare (EW) is a critical component of modern maritime operations, encompassing the use of electromagnetic spectrum technologies to detect, intercept, and counteract threats. It involves three primary subdivisions: Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic Warfare Support (ES). Electronic Attack (EA) involves offensive measures to disrupt or degrade enemy electronic systems, such as radar and communications, through jamming or deception techniques. For instance, the U.S. Navy's Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) is designed to replace the aging ALQ-99 system, providing advanced capabilities to counter sophisticated threats. Electronic Protection (EP) focuses on safeguarding friendly forces from adversary EW activities. This includes implementing measures to ensure the resilience and reliability of one's own electronic systems against jamming or interference. Techniques such as frequency hopping and spread spectrum communications are commonly employed to enhance EP. Electronic Warfare Support (ES) entails actions to detect, intercept, and identify electromagnetic emissions from potential threats. This intelligence is vital for situational awareness and informs decision-making processes. Modern naval forces utilize sophisticated ES systems to monitor and analyze the electromagnetic environment effectively. Advancements in naval EW are ongoing, with significant investments in research and development. For example, the Royal Navy is pursuing the Maritime Electronic Warfare Programme (MEWP) to enhance its EW capabilities over the next two decades. Similarly, the U.S. Navy is integrating the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) to upgrade its shipboard EW systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/rafael-wins-nato-contract-for-advanced-digital-shark-naval-electronic-countermeasure-system	2024-11-13T06:02:47-08:00	
Poland Develops Interceptor Missile to Counter Russian-Used Shahed-Class Drones	During the first International Armaments Congress held from October 21-25 in Krakow, the Wojskowy Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia (WITU) unveiled an ambitious new initiative aimed at developing an economical defense solution against enemy drones, as reported by Defence24.

The missile’s specifications include an interception range of 0.5 to 15 kilometers and a maximum altitude of 1,500 meters, making it well-suited for effectively countering drone attacks within a defined area. An intriguing aspect of the project is the choice of guidance method, which remains unspecified at this stage. However, it is possible that the missile may utilize reflected laser beam guidance, a technology already used in Polish anti-tank missile systems such as the JACK-S and Pirat complexes. This type of guidance would help keep costs down while ensuring sufficient accuracy for drone interception. WITU’s initiative aligns with a broader goal of developing an economical and accessible system capable of meeting the growing demand for anti-drone defense. The designers emphasize that this missile is particularly suited for countering swarm attacks, an essential capability as drone swarm tactics continue to evolve. To realize this project, WITU is currently seeking an industrial partner to assist in finalizing and mass-producing the missile, prioritizing the needs of the Polish armed forces. This project reflects a trend seen in recent years, where low-cost combat drones and interceptor missiles have become strategic assets in modern military arsenals. In 2021, the Ukrainian design bureau 'LUCH' launched a project for the RK-10 anti-aircraft missile complex, specifically tailored for combating Shahed-type drones. Poland could thus benefit from a similar solution, optimized for its own strategic needs. The development of a cost-effective anti-drone interceptor by the Wojskowy Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia (WITU) addresses the growing need to counter attack drones, such as those of the Shahed class, which are widely used in modern conflicts. These drones, often deployed in swarms, present significant challenges to traditional defense systems. A low-cost interceptor would allow for efficient neutralization of these threats, avoiding the need to deploy more expensive missiles against relatively low-cost targets. This approach is essential for maintaining sustainable air defense in the face of saturation attacks, where the cost-effectiveness of countermeasures becomes a critical factor. Moreover, the specific design of this interceptor, with a range of 0.5 to 15 km and a maximum altitude of 1,500 meters, makes it particularly suited for neutralizing drones operating at low and medium altitudes. Its lightweight and maneuverable nature facilitates rapid and flexible deployment, offering a tailored response to emerging threats. Integrating laser-guided technology, already proven in other Polish systems, could ensure increased accuracy while keeping costs manageable. In this way, the interceptor provides a strategic advantage for the Polish armed forces, enhancing their capability to effectively protect national territory from hostile drone incursions. To address the growing threat posed by Shahed-class drones used in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Poland is seeking to develop a defense solution. This project meets a strategic need for an economical defense against these aerial threats, which, due to their numbers and low cost, often overwhelm conventional defense systems. With a range of 15 kilometers and potentially laser-based guidance, this missile could offer a sustainable and affordable solution for the Polish armed forces. Poland could also consider supporting Ukraine in protecting its airspace by providing such missiles, even as its Chief of General Staff recently announced that Poland will not shoot down Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-develops-interceptor-missile-to-counter-russian-used-shahed-class-drones	2024-11-13T05:54:53-08:00

China’s new Z-20T assault helicopter challenges US MH-60L DAP for Special Operation Forces	At the 15th Zhuhai Air Show, China publicly showcased for the first time the Z-20T, an armed assault variant of the Z-20 helicopter developed for the Chinese Army. Known as the 'Assault Eagle,' this model features short wings and advanced weaponry, positioned as a specialized aircraft for air assault and special operations. Equipped with a payload that includes eight air-to-ground missiles, the design and functionality of the Z-20T suggest it may fulfill a role similar to the US MH-60L 'Direct Action Penetrator' (DAP), a gunship helicopter specifically used for special operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Z-20T Assault Eagle supports different mission requirements by accommodating payloads such as rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles, or by increasing the range through auxiliary fuel tanks. (Picture source: Weibo) The Z-20 helicopter, developed by the Harbin Aircraft Industry Group, was created in response to the People's Liberation Army Air Force's (PLAAF) need for a high-altitude medium utility helicopter since the 1980s, particularly for operations in China's mountainous regions. After acquiring a limited number of Sikorsky S-70 helicopters from the U.S. in 1984, further imports were restricted following the 1989 Tiananmen protests, prompting China to start an indigenous 10-ton helicopter project in 2006. The Z-20 made its first flight in 2013, drawing design inspiration from the S-70 Black Hawk but featuring domestic modifications such as fly-by-wire controls, a five-bladed rotor, improved engines, and high-altitude capabilities, enabling it to serve across different PLA branches and support various military operations. The Z-20 has several variants designed for specific roles. The base Z-20 serves as a transport helicopter for the PLA Army. The Z-20T is an assault version with hardpoints for weapons, while the Z-20S specializes in search and rescue operations. The Z-20K, Z-20KA, and Z-20KS are variants for the PLAAF, with roles in airborne corps, air assault, and search and rescue, respectively. Naval versions include the Z-20J for utility transport and the Z-20F for anti-submarine warfare, featuring radar and dipping sonar capabilities. The Z-20 PAP variant serves the People’s Armed Police, and a dedicated attack version, the Z-21, is configured with additional weaponry and avionics for combat missions. In this new variant, the ESSS (External Stores Support System) short wings enable it to carry additional weapon systems and auxiliary fuel tanks, enhancing its operational flexibility. This design supports different mission requirements by accommodating payloads such as rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles, or by increasing the range through auxiliary fuel tanks. The Z-20T’s short wings also provide extra lift, reducing the load on the main rotor, which could support higher flight speeds. The helicopter’s standard weapon load includes ground-to-ground rockets and AKD-10 laser-guided anti-tank missiles, with possible future compatibility with long-range Blue Arrow-21 anti-tank missiles. The Z-20T is equipped with an optoelectronic turret on the nose, featuring forward-looking infrared and target acquisition systems.

Observations at the show noted that the Z-20T’s modularity allows for rapid mission adaptation, which may be beneficial for an aircraft expected to fulfill multiple roles, including air-to-ground strikes, troop transport, and infiltration such as the Z-20. Unlike the standard Z-20, the Z-20T is designed with specialized mission requirements, indicated by the 'T' suffix, which denotes its assault focus. The Z-20T lacks in-flight refueling capability, suggesting a focus on shorter-range operations. While the Z-20T is developed for China’s special operations and air assault units, it does not yet match the extensive operational experience of U.S. special operations helicopters. However, the Z-20T’s role suggests China is advancing in the area of specialized helicopter missions, including roles traditionally carried out by Western forces. The Z-20T also shows structural and functional similarities to various U.S. military helicopters, including the MH-60L, MH-60M, and MH-60L DAP models operated by the U.S. Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. The Z-20T may support a range of operations, including reconnaissance, rescue, anti-terrorism, psychological operations, and battlefield infiltration. In certain scenarios, the Z-20T may allow for the rapid deployment and extraction of personnel under hostile conditions and provide close air support. The Z-20T’s adaptability offers mission-specific configurations, such as mounting additional weapon systems for fire support or using auxiliary fuel tanks for extended operational range. This flexibility allows for customized mission loadouts, supporting both increased firepower and extended range as needed. Observers note that this helicopter can carry a slightly larger payload than the MH-60L/L DAP/M models, giving frontline units options to tailor its use to specific mission requirements. Mounting choices on the short wings enable a range of configurations, balancing firepower and range.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/chinas-new-z-20t-assault-helicopter-challenges-us-mh-60l-dap-for-special-operation-forces	2024-11-13T02:41:24-08:00	
Peru confirms acquisition of 30 South Korean K808 White Tiger amphibious armored vehicles	As reported by InfoDefensa on November 11, 2024, the Peruvian government has confirmed a purchase of 30 K808 White Tiger amphibious armored vehicles for the Army, to be managed directly through FAME S.A.C., a state-owned entity within Peru’s defense sector. This acquisition is part of a strategic partnership with South Korean manufacturer Hyundai Rotem, which will oversee the local assembly of these 8×8 wheeled vehicles in Peru. The move reflects an effort to boost Peru's defense autonomy by relying on FAME for the K808’s procurement and future maintenance, rather than using an external supply chain.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The recent Peruvian acquisition marks Hyundai Rotem’s first export of the K808 outside of South Korea and introduces the vehicle into the Latin American defense market. (Picture source: Army Recognition) To facilitate this acquisition, the government excluded it from the General List of Strategic Contracts administered by the Agency of Armed Forces Purchases (Acffaa). The process also circumvents the need for a government-to-government agreement with South Korea, as FAME has been assigned the full responsibility for supply. Consequently, the Ministry of Defense’s authorization for an international agreement was retracted. This project adds to FAME’s existing commitments, including an overdue delivery of 10,000 ARAD 7 rifles to the Army. These K808 armored vehicles are intended for the Army’s 3rd and 6th Armored Brigades. Their acquisition aligns with the Public Investment Project (PIP) framework, specifically under the 'Acquisition of 30 armored vehicles for troop transport' directive. This initiative was previously structured under Supreme Decree No. 007-2023-DE, which authorized government-to-government defense contracts valued at approximately $62.9 million, or 238.8 million Peruvian soles. The current approach, however, consolidates the acquisition under domestic management, thereby reinforcing the defense relationship between Peru and South Korea. The K808 White Tiger, referred to as Baekho in South Korea, is an armored vehicle developed by Hyundai Rotem primarily for the South Korean Army. First delivered in 2016, the K808 was designed for use in difficult terrains and frontline operations. Its 8×8 configuration enhances maneuverability, with run-flat tires and a central tire inflation system (CTIS) to adjust tire pressure according to the terrain, which is essential for crossing rivers and uneven ground. Built with a modular platform, the K808 can be adapted for different missions and is compatible with various weapons systems, including options for 12.7 mm or 30 mm remote-controlled weapon stations. In South Korea, over 500 units of the K808 have been delivered to the Army, where the vehicle is used for transport and reconnaissance missions, often in coordination with main battle tanks like the K1A1 and K2. The recent Peruvian acquisition marks Hyundai Rotem’s first export of the K808 outside of South Korea and introduces the vehicle into the Latin American defense market. Demand for similar vehicles in Central and South America is on the rise, attributed to security and counterterrorism requirements, positioning Hyundai Rotem to potentially expand further in the region. The K808 incorporates components developed by Hyundai Motors, such as a V6 diesel engine based on Hyundai’s commercial models, adapted to military specifications. Its design supports network-based command and control systems, enabling it to serve as a command post in mobile operations. Hyundai Rotem, having previously exported its K2 tank to Poland, continues to enhance its defense product line for broader export markets, with an emphasis on meeting operational standards across varied environments. Peru and South Korea have significantly strengthened their military relations through various defense agreements and acquisitions in the last months. In April 2024, Hyundai Heavy Industries signed a contract to construct four naval vessels for the Peruvian Navy, including a 3,400-ton frigate modeled after South Korea's Daegu-class, with expected delivery by 2030. In May 2024, Hyundai Rotem was selected to supply K808 White Tiger 8×8 wheeled armored combat vehicles to enhance the Peruvian Army's ground mobility and defense capabilities. Additionally, in July 2024, Peru entered advanced negotiations with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to acquire 20 to 24 FA-50 light combat aircraft to modernize its air force.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-confirms-acquisition-of-30-south-korean-k808-white-tiger-amphibious-armored-vehicles	2024-11-13T02:34:02-08:00

Indra's longstanding partnerships with global shipyards and navies have greatly influenced the development of its SIGINT technology. The company’s systems are already installed on high-profile vessels such as the F100 frigates and the LHD Juan Carlos I of the Spanish Navy, and Indra is currently developing sensors for Spain’s upcoming F110 frigates. These sensors, to be housed within an integrated mast designed for stealth, will further advance the ship's radar reduction capabilities. The new SIGINT system provides robust situational awareness by monitoring the entire electromagnetic spectrum and detecting low-probability intercept (LPI) signals. These signals, often used by stealthy vessels like submarines, are challenging to detect but vital for identifying adversaries attempting to operate covertly. Indra’s extensive signal library enhances the system’s threat-detection capabilities, as it can quickly classify various radar and communication profiles to inform the crew about nearby hostile or suspicious units. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) plays a crucial role in the naval sector by intercepting and analyzing electronic signals to gain insights into adversaries' activities, capabilities, and intentions. This intelligence is essential for maritime operations, as it enables navies to monitor communications, radar emissions, and other electronic signals, providing a real-time picture of potential threats. Naval SIGINT has evolved significantly over time. During World War II, High-Frequency Direction Finding (HF/DF), also known as 'huff-duff,' enabled Allied forces to locate enemy submarines by intercepting radio transmissions. This early technology paved the way for modern SIGINT systems, which today have become highly advanced. For instance, the U.S. Navy's AN/SLQ-32 system allows ships to detect and classify enemy radars and communication signals, enhancing electronic support measures.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/next-gen-sigint-by-indra-offers-comprehensive-threat-detection-for-navies	2024-11-13T02:32:34-08:00

Germany Authorizes Sale of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon Fighter Jets to Türkiye	On November 13, 2024, Türkiye’s Defense Minister Yasar Guler officially announced, according to the Turkish newspaper Türkiye Today during a live interview on the Turkish news outlet TV100, that Germany has authorized the sale of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets to Türkiye. This decision follows intense negotiations between Türkiye and the Eurofighter consortium partners, including the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, who played a key role in securing Germany’s approval. This acquisition aims to enhance Türkiye’s air capabilities and modernize its military fleet. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BAE Systems/Leonardo Eurofighter Typhoon Fighter Jet (Picture source: X) The Turkish Defense Ministry’s announcement of Germany's authorization to sell 40 Eurofighter Typhoons marks a significant turning point in defense relations between Türkiye and several European countries. This process began several years ago when Türkiye expressed interest in strengthening its air fleet, with the Typhoon as a leading option. However, Germany’s hesitations, which surfaced as early as 2021, slowed the negotiations, driven by concerns over human rights issues and Turkish military operations in sensitive areas like Syria. Active support from the United Kingdom, one of the primary Eurofighter backers, followed by Italy and Spain, emerged in 2023, increasing pressure on Germany to reconsider its stance. Since their introduction in the 1980s, F-16 fighters have been the backbone of the Turkish Air Force. With over 240 aircraft in service over the decades, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has played an essential role in Türkiye’s military operations, supporting air surveillance, national defense, and regional interventions. However, over time, Türkiye’s defense needs have grown, requiring more advanced technology and expanded capabilities to meet an increasingly complex security environment. To meet these modernization needs, Türkiye explored new options for its air fleet in the early 2020s. Although Ankara initially considered upgrading its F-16s or acquiring fifth-generation F-35s, Türkiye’s participation in the F-35 program was suspended in 2019 due to diplomatic tensions with the United States related to Ankara’s acquisition of the Russian S-400 air defense system. In this context, the Eurofighter Typhoon emerged as a credible alternative, backed by European partners such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, who seek to strengthen strategic ties with Ankara. Other aircraft were briefly considered, but none offered the same balance of operational performance and political cooperation. The acquisition of Eurofighter Typhoons takes place in a complex geostrategic context, marked by increased tensions with Greece, Türkiye’s historic neighbor and rival. This choice can be seen as a direct response to the modernization of the Greek fleet, which has recently integrated French Rafales and is considering the acquisition of American F-35s. These developments enhance Greece's air capabilities, potentially altering the balance of power in the region. Additionally, the Eurofighter offers Türkiye a strategic alternative to diversify its defense supply sources and reduce its reliance on American systems. In parallel, Türkiye has also initiated the development of its own fifth-generation fighter jet, the TAI KAAN, aiming for increased long-term autonomy in its air defense. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a multi-role combat aircraft developed by a consortium of European aerospace companies, including Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo. Designed for a wide range of air operations, the Typhoon features a delta wing and canard configuration, providing significant maneuverability. The aircraft is intended to meet both current and future operational needs, with continuous upgrades keeping it updated with combat aviation technology. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 23,500 kg and a maximum speed of Mach 2.0. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 afterburning turbofan engines, each providing 60 kN (13,000 lbf) of thrust dry and 90 kN (20,000 lbf) with an afterburner, the Eurofighter Typhoon can reach a maximum speed of 2,125 km/h or Mach 2.35 at high altitude and 1,530 km/h or Mach 1.25 at sea level. It has a supercruise capability at Mach 1.5, a maximum range of 2,900 kilometers, and a service ceiling of 19,812 meters (65,000 feet). The Typhoon's armament includes a 27 mm Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon with 150 rounds and 13 hardpoints (8 under-wing and 5 under-fuselage) capable of carrying over 9,000 kg of payload. In air-to-air combat, the Eurofighter Typhoon can climb at a rate of 315 meters per second (62,000 feet per minute). It is equipped with advanced radar and targeting systems, including the Captor-E AESA radar, capable of tracking up to 20 targets simultaneously and engaging them with precision. Its armament includes air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, MBDA Meteor, IRIS-T, AIM-132 ASRAAM, and AIM-9 Sidewinder for beyond-visual-range (BVR) engagement. The Eurofighter Typhoon also performs well in air-to-ground missions. It can carry precision-guided munitions, including Paveway IV laser-guided bombs, Storm Shadow cruise missiles, Brimstone anti-tank missiles, Taurus air-to-surface missiles, and AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles. Its targeting pod, the LITENING III, allows for accurate identification and engagement of ground targets under various weather conditions. This capability supports roles such as close air support, interdiction, and strategic strike missions. Furthermore, the Typhoon can also carry anti-ship missiles such as the Marte ER and the Joint Strike Missile (JSM). The technical comparison between the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Eurofighter Typhoon highlights two different approaches in the design and capabilities of multirole fighters, each offering specific advantages in terms of performance, technology, and suitable missions. The F-16, developed by General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin), is a fourth-generation fighter widely adopted since the 1980s for its versatility, maneuverability, and relatively low operating costs. Its single-engine design makes it light and particularly agile, making it an effective aircraft for ground attack and air superiority missions. In contrast, the Eurofighter Typhoon, designed by a European consortium (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain), is an advanced fourth-generation fighter with a twin-engine design, providing greater power and acceleration suitable for high-altitude air superiority missions. The Eurofighter is equipped with advanced electronic systems, particularly its Captor-E AESA radar (Active Electronically Scanned Array), which offers increased detection range, better coverage, and the ability to track multiple targets simultaneously. The F-16, though upgradeable, lags in this regard, initially lacking AESA technology (only available in modernized versions). The Eurofighter also has better electronic warfare and defense capabilities, allowing it to operate in more hostile environments and against more sophisticated aerial threats. The F-16 remains a versatile, economical, and effective fighter for traditional missions, including ground attack and air defense, but its lack of stealth and advanced detection systems makes it less suited to modern high-intensity warfare environments. The Eurofighter, designed for air superiority missions, excels in long-range engagements and can perform air-to-ground missions, although it is primarily optimized for air defense environments where the ability to detect and engage distant targets is crucial. In summary, the F-16 and the Eurofighter meet different needs: the more economical and maneuverable F-16 is suited for versatile, cost-effective operations, while the Eurofighter Typhoon, with its advanced systems and ability to operate in hostile environments, is a preferred choice for high-intensity air superiority missions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/germany-authorizes-sale-of-40-eurofighter-typhoon-fighter-jets-to-tuerkiye	2024-11-13T01:10:30-08:00

Baykar TB3 UCAV to attempt first autonomous landing and takeoff on TCG Anadolu by year-end	According to information published by Baykar on Baykar's TB3 Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) is on track to make a historic debut on Turkey's TCG Anadolu aircraft carrier before the end of this year. Equipped with folding wings and a design optimized for maritime operations, the TB3 is engineered to perform both takeoff and landing autonomously, without requiring any external support from the ship's systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Baykar's TB3 UCAV set to make history on TCG Anadolu with autonomous landing and takeoff, marking a breakthrough in Turkey’s maritime drone operations. (Picture source: Baykar) The TB3 can autonomously align itself for landing, decelerate smoothly, and come to a complete stop on the carrier deck, utilizing its own braking system without the need for arresting wires or other mechanical aids. For takeoff, the UCAV's powerful PD170 engine, combined with TCG Anadolu's ski-jump ramp, provides sufficient thrust—even at maximum takeoff weight (MTOW)—to launch the drone smoothly into flight. This innovative setup not only streamlines operations but also allows for rapid redeployment, minimizing deck congestion and maximizing sortie rates. Baykar’s KIZILELMA, a heavier jet-powered UCAV with an 8.5-ton weight, is anticipated to make its own carrier demonstration on TCG Anadolu in 2025. Unlike the TB3, the KIZILELMA will require an arresting wire and hook system to accommodate its greater kinetic energy on landing. This system will bring it safely to a halt on the carrier deck. However, the KIZILELMA, like the TB3, is capable of taking off without assistance from catapult systems, marking a departure from the conventional launch systems seen on many aircraft carriers globally. Further expanding Turkey's naval aviation capabilities, TUSAŞ is preparing to introduce two additional aircraft to TCG Anadolu’s roster by 2026: the Hürjet light combat aircraft and the ANKA-3 DZ UCAV. Both platforms will be optimized for carrier operations, following the operational model set by the KIZILELMA, which requires an arresting wire and hook system for landings but no assistance for takeoff. The Hürjet and ANKA-3 DZ will join a growing fleet of naval-capable drones and aircraft that will enhance the Turkish Navy's operational flexibility and reach. The deployment of drones from aircraft carriers has marked a transformative shift in modern naval operations, showcasing the versatile capabilities of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in maritime environments. Recent advancements have enabled drones to be launched and recovered on the open seas, extending the operational reach of aircraft carriers beyond traditional manned aircraft and bolstering intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike capabilities. These developments bring a new dimension to maritime warfare, allowing for enhanced situational awareness, increased flexibility in combat, and a more adaptive approach to complex missions. One of the key advantages of drones launched from aircraft carriers is their ability to operate autonomously in hostile environments, carrying out precision strikes and gathering critical intelligence without risking pilot lives. Unlike manned aircraft, drones can endure longer missions and maneuver in more constrained spaces, which is particularly beneficial for missions in contested or high-risk areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/baykar-tb3-ucav-to-attempt-first-autonomous-landing-and-takeoff-on-tcg-anadolu-by-year-end	2024-11-13T00:35:03-08:00	
Taiwan Eyes F-35 and Patriot Missiles to Show Defense Resolve to Trump in Face of China	As tensions intensify across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan is evaluating a substantial arms procurement from the United States, aiming to solidify its defense capabilities and affirm its commitment to self-defense. According to reports from the Financial Times, Taiwan is considering a $15 billion investment that would include the acquisition of 60 F-35 fighter jets, 400 Patriot missiles, four E-2D Hawkeye early warning aircraft, ten second-hand warships, and the Aegis combat system. This proposed purchase, aside from enhancing Taiwan’s defense, is intended to signal to the U.S., specifically to the incoming Trump administration, Taiwan's willingness to independently fortify its defenses amid growing Chinese military assertiveness. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan is particularly interested in the F-35B model, which can perform short takeoffs and vertical landings (Picture source: US DoD) The Lockheed Martin F-35 is central to Taiwan's potential purchase, seen as a significant deterrent against Chinese aggression. A fifth-generation stealth fighter, the F-35 is highly capable of air superiority and strike missions, featuring advanced stealth technology, supersonic speed, and superior maneuverability. The aircraft is equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, featuring the AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), all of which enhance situational awareness and targeting precision. Armament options encompass a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, AIM-9X Sidewinder, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The F-35's radar systems, particularly the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, provide advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including radar warning, targeting support, and jamming functions. Among the three F-35 variants, Taiwan is particularly interested in the F-35B model, which can perform short takeoffs and vertical landings (STOVL). The STOVL capability is crucial in Taiwan’s context, as it would enable operations from short runways or emergency airstrips if major airbases were compromised by Chinese missile strikes. However, while the F-35 represents an advanced technological edge, experts are questioning its viability as the best strategic option for Taiwan, primarily due to the high costs involved and the risk of delayed delivery, potentially extending beyond 2027. This timeline is significant as experts estimate a potential Chinese military action around that year, increasing the urgency for Taiwan to evaluate its options carefully. Alongside the F-35, Taiwan has prioritized upgrading its missile defense systems, particularly the Patriot missiles. The MIM-104 Patriot system, developed by Raytheon, is a mobile surface-to-air missile system that plays a crucial role in air and missile defense for several countries. It is designed to detect, track, and engage various aerial threats, including tactical ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. It uses components such as the AN/MPQ-53 or AN/MPQ-65 radar sets and sophisticated guidance systems. The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) variant is especially relevant for Taiwan, providing extended range and improved accuracy, and Taiwan has actively sought to bolster its Patriot system in recent years. A recent U.S. proposal in December 2022 offered Taiwan up to 100 advanced Patriot missiles, valued at $882 million, further underlining Taiwan's commitment to strengthening its missile defense capabilities in response to potential threats. Despite Taiwan’s intent to modernize its forces, some defense analysts argue that other systems might offer more immediate strategic value at a lower cost. For instance, Taiwan has shown interest in acquiring decommissioned American warships, such as Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers and Perry-class frigates. These naval platforms could serve as effective access-denial (A2/AD) assets in the event of an invasion, providing Taiwan with the capability to disrupt and delay a potential Chinese assault. This kind of deterrent strategy is particularly suited to the unique geographic and military constraints Taiwan faces in the Taiwan Strait. Additionally, other assets, like HIMARS artillery and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, which were included in prior U.S. arms sales, align closely with Taiwan's defensive needs and offer an effective means of resisting amphibious incursions and protecting its coastline. Under the Trump administration's first term, several large arms packages to Taiwan were approved, totaling over $21 billion, including F-16 Viper fighter jets, M1 Abrams tanks, HIMARS rocket systems, and Harpoon missiles. However, Trump's pragmatic stance on international relations—exemplified by his comments suggesting that Taiwan should 'pay the U.S.' for its security, likening the relationship to an insurance policy—has raised concerns in Taiwan about the stability and commitment of U.S. support. Despite these arms deals, doubts persist regarding the likelihood of a direct U.S. military intervention in defense of Taiwan, particularly given Trump's comments and recent global shifts in U.S. defense policy. Compounding these strategic uncertainties, Taiwan’s role in global semiconductor production, especially through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), adds another layer of complexity. As the world leader in advanced chip production, TSMC occupies a critical position in the global supply chain, particularly for the United States and its allies, as well as for China. This economic leverage makes Taiwan a focal point in the ongoing U.S.-China rivalry, as Beijing could use Taiwan's semiconductor sector as a pressure point to influence international responses to a Taiwan conflict. Taiwan's strategic interest in F-35 fighter jets and additional Patriot missile batteries signals a clear commitment to enhancing its defense posture, but uncertainties remain about the efficacy of these acquisitions in meeting Taiwan’s immediate defense needs. Delivery timelines and high costs may limit the F-35's impact in the short term, suggesting that investments in access-denial systems and naval defenses could more effectively serve Taiwan’s security interests. Ultimately, Taiwan’s strategic choices are shaped by a complex interplay of regional tensions, economic considerations, and the evolving U.S.-China dynamic, underscoring the island’s need for a nuanced and adaptable defense strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/taiwan-eyes-f-35-and-patriot-missiles-to-show-defense-resolve-to-trump-in-face-of-china	2024-11-13T00:06:56-08:00

Taiwan eyes acquisition of Aegis destroyers from US as strategic signal to Trump Administration	According to information published by the Financialt Times on November 11, 2024, Taiwan is considering the procurement of Aegis destroyers from the United States as a central component of a significant defense package aimed at strengthening its maritime security capabilities in response to the growing threat from China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Japanese Navy's Maya class destroyer JS Haguro during the at-sea phase of Exercise Rim of the Pacific 2024. (Picture source: Dvids) At the heart of Taiwan’s proposed defense package is Lockheed Martin’s Aegis destroyer—a powerful multi-mission warship equipped with advanced radar and missile systems capable of tracking and intercepting multiple threats simultaneously. Known for its effectiveness in air and missile defense, the Aegis system would provide Taiwan with a significant upgrade to its naval capabilities, especially in terms of defending against airborne and ballistic missile threats from China. For Taiwan, acquiring Aegis destroyers would not only enhance its defensive posture in the Taiwan Strait but also solidify its role as a capable security partner for the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. The Aegis system’s interoperability with U.S. and allied forces in the region could facilitate joint defense initiatives, strengthening Taiwan’s strategic partnerships. The consideration for acquiring Aegis destroyers comes as Taiwan and other U.S. allies face renewed pressure to increase their defense spending and capacities amid rising tensions with China. Advocates within the U.S. have called for Taiwan to step up its defense investments, emphasizing the importance of Taiwan’s readiness to defend itself. The Trump administration’s first term saw a series of significant arms sales to Taiwan, signaling a strong U.S. commitment to Taiwan’s security. Should Trump return to office, Taiwan’s pursuit of the Aegis destroyer may find favorable support, especially as the U.S. continues to seek stronger alliances to counterbalance China’s influence in the region. The Aegis destroyers could be a crucial asset to Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, thanks to their advanced radar, missile defense, and combat capabilities. The Aegis Combat System, the heart of Aegis destroyers, allows for unparalleled air defense and ballistic missile interception capabilities. This system is paired with the AN/SPY-1D phased-array radar, capable of detecting and tracking multiple aerial threats over 300 kilometers away. The Aegis-equipped destroyers are fitted with Standard Missile (SM) series interceptors, such as the SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6, which can intercept various threats from aircraft to short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. In a potential invasion scenario, Chinese missile and aircraft threats would likely overwhelm Taiwan's limited defenses, and the addition of Aegis-equipped destroyers could create a robust shield, protecting critical locations and infrastructure. Chinese submarines are a significant threat in any Taiwan Strait conflict, as they could block Taiwan’s ports and sever sea lines of communication. Aegis destroyers are equipped with sophisticated ASW capabilities, including the AN/SQQ-89 sonar suite and Mk 54 torpedoes, and often operate with embarked MH-60R helicopters, further enhancing their ASW range. With these assets, Aegis destroyers could assist Taiwan in identifying, tracking, and neutralizing Chinese submarines attempting to penetrate Taiwan’s maritime boundaries or blockade essential routes. The Aegis Combat System's networked battle management capabilities would offer Taiwan a strategic advantage. The Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Link 16 enable Aegis destroyers to share data in real-time with allied forces, creating a comprehensive situational awareness environment. In collaboration with Taiwan’s existing air and naval defenses, Aegis destroyers could form part of a decentralized but highly integrated defense network. This network would improve Taiwan’s capacity to detect, track, and respond to incoming threats efficiently, distributing decision-making and maximizing resilience against Chinese electronic warfare or cyber-attacks on Taiwan's command and control infrastructure. The presence of Aegis destroyers could serve as a strategic deterrent against China by projecting a credible threat to Chinese forces, particularly when positioned near the Taiwan Strait. Their ability to launch Tomahawk missiles and other long-range anti-ship missiles provides a flexible strike capability, giving Taiwan the potential to respond to Chinese naval actions preemptively. Such capability could force China to reconsider or delay an invasion, knowing the heavy costs Aegis destroyers could inflict on amphibious or naval assets in the initial phases of an assault.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-eyes-acquisition-of-aegis-destroyers-from-us-as-strategic-signal-to-trump-administration	2024-11-12T03:10:19-08:00

This allows the LCS to pivot between tasks like anti-submarine warfare (ASW), mine countermeasures, and surface warfare, backed by helicopter and UAV support. The RV Triton, although not armed, tested many of these technologies, demonstrating the trimaran hull’s flexibility and informing later designs in stealth and modular capability. The Orca’s distinct role as an unmanned platform highlights its purpose for operations in hazardous zones, minimizing human risk while enabling persistent, adaptable presence in high-stakes environments. In contrast, the manned Independence-class LCS leverages modular adaptability for versatility across various mission types, while the RV Triton remains a vital precursor in demonstrating the potential of trimaran warships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinas-jari-usv-a-orca-unmanned-vessel-with-vls-revealed-at-zhuhai	2024-11-12T02:14:56-08:00	
Pakistan to develop indigenous active protection system to protect entire tank fleet	Pakistan’s Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT) recently initiated a project to develop an Active Protection System (APS) for main battle tanks (MBTs), marking a significant step toward enhancing the capabilities of its armored fleet. The project is managed by HIT’s Advanced Research Development and Information Center (ARDIC), which issued a tender on October 14, 2024, seeking lab testing and equipment necessary for the APS's development. This tender specifies requirements for a lab measurement unit, a radar emulator unit, and two radar sensing units, which are critical components in establishing the APS's core functionality through precise testing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The APS project also represents a continuation of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to localize defense technologies, particularly for its Haider, a variant of the Chinese VT-4 tank. (Picture source: HIT) The proposed Active Protection System (APS) aims to shield tanks from advanced threats such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) and loitering munitions. Modern APS systems typically include sensors for detecting incoming threats and countermeasures to neutralize them, often classified as ‘soft-kill’ or ‘hard-kill’ solutions. A soft-kill system deploys measures like smoke or directional infrared emitters to disrupt the targeting system of an incoming munition, while a hard-kill solution engages the threat directly, using either intercepting munitions or explosively formed penetrators to neutralize it before impact. HIT’s approach, as indicated by the tender, appears to focus on radar-based detection, though specific details about the threat-neutralizing component remain unspecified. The tender outlines a structured procurement process, with a single-stage, two-envelope method for bid submission. To qualify, firms must provide a range of documents, including valid National Tax Number (NTN) certificates, bank statements, audit reports from the last three fiscal years, and assurances that they are not defaulters or blacklisted. Interested firms must submit their bids by November 14, 2024, with technical assessments set to begin the same day. The equipment will undergo rigorous testing to ensure durability and adherence to technical standards, while companies are required to provide a warranty covering all aspects of maintenance for at least two years, with additional marks awarded for extended warranty offerings. Furthermore, HIT mandates confidentiality measures and restricts participation from firms linked to countries deemed ineligible, specifically India and Israel, to safeguard the project’s integrity. The APS project also represents a continuation of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to enhance and localize defense technologies across its entire tank fleet. As of 2024, Pakistan’s fleet of main battle tanks (MBTs) includes 2,537 units, comprising approximately 300 Al-Khalid (MBT 2000), an estimated 110 Al-Khalid I, 315 T-80UD, around 500 Al-Zarrar, 400 Type-69, 268 Type-85-IIAP, 44 VT-4, and an estimated 600 ZTZ-59 tanks. Developing an indigenous APS is a strategic move to strengthen the operational capabilities of these units, ensuring they can counter modern threats and remain effective in diverse operational scenarios. This APS initiative reflects Pakistan’s drive to reduce reliance on foreign defense technologies and increase the self-sufficiency of its armored forces. The development of an APS aligns with Pakistan’s defense strategy, as the region faces a rise in sophisticated ATGMs and loitering munitions across various operational scenarios. The adoption of such systems is not only a response to these threats but also a reinforcement of Pakistan’s position in South Asia’s evolving defense landscape. As the project progresses, HIT aims to ensure that the APS meets operational requirements and withstands diverse threat environments, reinforcing Pakistan’s armored capabilities with localized, state-of-the-art defensive technologies. Active Protection Systems (APS) have become a focal point in modern armored warfare, aiming to enhance the survivability of tanks against advanced anti-tank weaponry. Israel's Trophy system, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, has been operational since 2011 and has demonstrated effectiveness in intercepting various threats, including anti-tank guided missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. The system utilizes radar to detect incoming projectiles and deploys countermeasures to neutralize them before impact. As of 2023, production has scaled up, with 40 Trophy systems and 500 countermeasures being produced monthly. Russia has also advanced its APS technology with the development of the Arena system by the Kolomna Engineering Design Bureau. Arena employs a Doppler radar to detect incoming threats and launches defensive rockets to destroy them mid-air. The modernized Arena-M variant claims to intercept munitions from all directions, including top-attack missiles like the Javelin. In 2023, reports indicated plans to equip T-90M and T-80BVM tanks with Arena-M, with considerations for installation on T-72B3 and T-72B3M models. These developments underscore a global trend toward integrating APS into armored vehicles to counter evolving battlefield threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/pakistan-to-develop-indigenous-active-protection-system-to-protect-entire-tank-fleet	2024-11-12T01:30:59-08:00	
Peru receives first shipment of US-donated UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters	As reported by Seguridad y Defensa Noticias on November 9, 2024, Peru received the first three of nine Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the United States, as reported by Seguridad y Defensa Noticias. This transfer is part of a U.S.-Peru government-to-government agreement finalized on August 13, 2024. The helicopters, painted in a bright gray color scheme with burgundy trim, appear to have previously been operated by the U.S. Department of State (DoS).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In January 2024, the United States offered to the Peruvian government a package of nine UH-60 Black Hawks, including training for 14 Peruvian crews, support equipment, tools, and spare parts. (Picture source: US DoD) One of the helicopters displays the number '027' on its stabilizer, identifying it as the former U.S. Army UH-60A 88-26027, which was previously designated N678YP under DoS operation. This identification suggests that all nine helicopters may have been in DoS service, although further confirmation is required. The Peruvian Congress approved the donation on October 28, 2024, with 74 votes in favor out of 95, following a formal request submitted on October 3. The donation consists of nine upgraded UH-60A+ Black Hawk helicopters, currently in Lima with the Peruvian Air Force. They are scheduled to be transferred to the Peruvian National Police (PNP) as part of U.S. assistance aimed at supporting Peru’s counter-narcotics efforts. The Foreign Relations Committee of the Peruvian Congress had approved the agreement earlier, on October 28, with 18 votes in favor, one against, and one abstention. Legislative Resolution N° 9122/2024-PE, which authorized the donation, was presented to Congress in alignment with Peru’s National Multisectoral Policy to Combat Organized Crime 2019-2030 and the National Policy Against Drugs to 2030. Congresswoman Auristela Obando Morgan, the committee chair, noted that integrating these helicopters into the PNP’s Aviation Directorate aligns with the Ministry of the Interior's strategic goals in counter-narcotics operations. Discussions around the transfer of U.S. helicopters to the PNP began in June 2018, initially focusing on a proposed donation of 15 UH-1H Huey II helicopters. Subsequent negotiations with the U.S. Embassy considered various configurations and quantities, culminating in a revised proposal from the Peruvian Ministry of the Interior in August 2023 for 24 UH-1H helicopters. In January 2024, the U.S. Embassy informed the Peruvian government that the 24 UH-1Hs would be decommissioned, offering instead a package of nine UH-60 Black Hawks, including training for 14 Peruvian crews, support equipment, tools, and spare parts. The finalized agreement was signed on August 13, 2024. The program for integrating these helicopters into the PNP includes a five-year transition period, with the United States providing Peru with support in maintenance, training, contractual assistance, and quality control. A Joint Aviation Working Group will coordinate monthly on the Black Hawk program, including monitoring minimum flight hours. After this period, Peru will assume full ownership and insurance responsibilities for the helicopters. The estimated annual program cost, including operations and maintenance, is $20 million. Peru’s financial contributions will progressively increase from $4 million in the second year to the full $20 million by the fifth year, at which point it will assume the program's entire cost. Additionally, Peru will establish a supply chain to maintain the helicopters in accordance with Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary. This agreement, which awaits final approval, is based on the provisions of articles 56 and 102.3 of the Peruvian Political Constitution governing international treaties, as outlined in the October 3 letter submitted by President Dina Boluarte, Council of Ministers President Gustavo Adrianzén, and Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer. The helicopters are intended to enhance Peru’s capacity to respond to a range of operational needs, with applications in military, rescue, and tactical support contexts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/peru-receives-first-shipment-of-us-donated-uh-60-black-hawk-helicopters	2024-11-12T01:21:12-08:00	
New Falcon 70 system fills gaps in China’s short and medium-range air defense capabilities	On November 11, China unveiled the new Falcon 70 short- and medium-range air defense system at the Zhuhai Air Show 2024. Developed by the Shanghai Academy of Space Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), this system integrates detection, guidance, and interception capabilities, allowing it to operate independently. Yang Guang, a representative from the Shanghai Academy, highlighted the system’s multi-role configuration aimed at intercepting aerial threats that penetrate medium- and long-range air defense networks, such as cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles, guided bombs, rockets, and aircraft, including fixed-wing planes, helicopters, and drones.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Although currently equipped with a Volvo 6x2 chassis, the platform could be integrated with other configurations based on client requirements, enabling its potential use by different branches of China’s military, including the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Rocket Force. (Picture source: Weibo) In its design, the Falcon 70 addresses limitations observed in previous air defense systems, particularly challenges posed by swarm attacks. China's air defense infrastructure previously relied heavily on systems like the HQ-16 and HQ-7B, which have relatively limited missile capacities, constraining their ability to handle dense aerial threats without a reload. Russia's experiences in Syria and Ukraine with the Pantsir-S1 system, which encountered difficulties intercepting successive UAV swarms, further demonstrate these challenges. The Falcon 70 system responds to such needs by supporting 21 missiles per vehicle, offering greater resistance to saturation attacks. In a battalion configuration, a Falcon 70 unit can launch over a hundred medium- and short-range missiles, surpassing the engagement capabilities of comparable systems, including Israel's Spyder and Russia’s latest Tor-M2 and Buk-M2 systems. While primarily intended for export, the Falcon 70 is also viewed by CASC as a potential upgrade for China’s own air defense capabilities. China's medium- and short-range air defense currently comprises the HQ-16 and HQ-17 systems, with the HQ-16 tasked with protecting larger operational zones and the HQ-17 focused on battlefield proximity defense. The Falcon 70 provides a system capable of bridging the 15–70 km range gap between existing short- and mid-range systems, as well as offering a higher missile capacity per battery and an adaptable platform. The Falcon 70 system's response to emerging air assault tactics includes 'soft and hard' kill methods to counter UAV and loitering munition swarms. It is equipped with electronic countermeasures that disrupt communication links and GPS signals of incoming swarm drones, reducing their effectiveness and causing them to lose coordination. The growing threat posed by UAVs and loitering munitions has led to similar developments in nearby regions. For instance, Taiwan has developed the Jian Xiang anti-radiation drone, reportedly to counter Chinese air defense systems, while India has invested in anti-radiation and loitering munitions, acquiring Israeli-made Harpy and Harop drones. The Falcon 70’s features align with these trends, incorporating anti-swarm capabilities to address drone threats. Accordingly, the Falcon 70 includes a phased-array radar and electro-optical tracking mounted on its combat vehicle, enabling it to detect and track targets independently and maintain mobility during operations. The vehicle can be deployed in both field and point-defense roles, designed to protect long-range convoys and critical infrastructure. The LY-70 medium-range missile, a key component of the Falcon 70, uses composite guidance (including inertial navigation, data links, and active radar), providing reliable targeting against various aerial threats, while the FB-10A short-range missile employs infrared imaging guidance for strong multi-target capabilities and anti-jamming performance, with an interception range of up to 18 kilometers. Together, these missiles reportedly achieve a high probability of target destruction, reaching up to 90%. The Falcon 70 system’s flexibility is reflected in its modular vehicle platform, which can be adapted to various operational needs by mounting on different vehicles, such as tracked or armored vehicles. Although currently equipped with a Volvo 6x2 chassis, the platform could be integrated with other configurations based on client requirements, enabling its potential use by different branches of China’s military, including the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Rocket Force. The recent introduction of the Falcon 70, SWS2, and HQ-19 air defense systems at the Zhuhai Air Show 2024 collectively strengthens China's multi-layered defense capabilities.

KNDS Delivers First Next-Gen Leopard 2A8 Tank to Norway to Counter Russia	On November 6, 2024, Ralf Ketzel, director of KNDS Germany, revealed that the company has already started delivering Leopard 2A8 battle tanks to Norway, with delivery initially planned for the end of the decade or 2026 now moved forward. These tanks are part of an order for 54 units placed by Norway with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), now part of KNDS, which also includes the former French company Nexter. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link KNDS Leopard 2A8 Main Battle Tank (Picture source: KNDS) Norway signed a procurement contract with KNDS to modernize its battle tank fleet, ordering 54 Leopard 2A8 tanks from Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), a German partner of KNDS that includes the French defense company Nexter. This contract reflects Norway's desire to strengthen its defense capabilities against a potential Russian invasion. Initially, the country planned to acquire the Leopard 2A7 model, but operational requirements and technological advancements led to the choice of the more modern and efficient 2A8 version. Signed in 2022, the contract originally scheduled deliveries between 2026 and the end of the decade, but KNDS has accelerated its timeline, with the first units delivered as early as November 2024. Ritek, a Norwegian company, has also been incorporated into the project to handle maintenance for the new tanks, ensuring technical autonomy in their management. This acquisition is part of a broader initiative by the Norwegian armed forces to modernize and strengthen their military capabilities in response to current geopolitical challenges. In addition to Norway, other European countries, including Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Lithuania, also plan to acquire this upgraded version of the Leopard. Croatia recently announced an order for 50 units, while the Czech Republic has ordered 77 tanks, the Netherlands 50, and Lithuania may acquire up to 94. The Leopard 2A8 is designed to be one of the most advanced main battle tanks currently on the market. It can reach a combat weight of around 70 tons and is equipped with a 120mm L55A1 cannon, capable of firing programmable HE (High-Explosive) rounds and new KE (Kinetic Energy) rounds for increased battlefield effectiveness. Among notable improvements, its fire control system will be fully digital and will benefit from a power system independent of the main engine, providing at least 20 kW of continuous power. The Leopard 2A8, with its cutting-edge technology, offers increased resilience against modern threats encountered in conflicts like Ukraine, where drones and anti-tank missiles are widely used. The tank is notably equipped with the EuroTrophy active protection system, an adaptation of the Israeli Trophy system, designed to detect and neutralize incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles and rockets, before they reach the vehicle. This proactive defense capability enhances crew safety and reduces the risk of direct impact. In response to increasing aerial threats, especially drones, the Leopard 2A8 features advanced detection systems that allow it to quickly identify hostile drones. It is also equipped with a roof-mounted Remote Controlled Weapon Station (RCWS), armed with machine guns or automatic grenade launchers, which enables it to neutralize these drones at close range, thus adding an active defense layer against close aerial attacks. The armor of the Leopard 2A8, made from a composite of advanced materials such as steel, tungsten, composites, and ceramics, provides enhanced protection against ballistic projectiles, improvised explosive devices, and artillery fragments, thereby increasing the survival of the vehicle and its crew against direct impacts. Additionally, the tank is equipped with sophisticated optical and infrared sensors for the early detection of threats, including drones and anti-tank missile teams. Some jamming systems may also be integrated to disrupt enemy communications and drone guidance systems, thereby reducing their operational effectiveness. From a firepower perspective, the Leopard 2A8 is equipped with the Rheinmetall Rh-120 L/55A1 120mm cannon, an advanced version of the L/55 model already present on the 2A7. This cannon can use programmable HE (High-Explosive) rounds, in addition to new KE (Kinetic Energy) rounds, which significantly enhances the tank's ability to effectively engage a wide range of targets, from lightly armored vehicles to fortifications. This versatility is a major asset in combat environments where targets can quickly vary, requiring munitions adapted to each situation. On the technology front, the Leopard 2A8 includes an advanced energy management system with an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) independent of the main engine. This energy autonomy allows the tank to keep its systems active without generating noise or a significant thermal signature, offering valuable discretion during ambush or static defense operations. Furthermore, its fire control system is fully digital and incorporates fusion sensors for optimized target acquisition and tracking. The tank's optics are also enhanced: the PERI-R 17 A2 panoramic sight for the commander and the EMES 15 sight for the gunner provide improved situational awareness and increased precision. For Norway, the modernization process has accelerated in recent years through the renewal of its military equipment, following several major initiatives, including the purchase of 52 F-35 fighters in 2018 to replace its aging F-16s, thereby ensuring air superiority against potential regional threats. In 2019, Norway also strengthened its naval fleet by ordering four new U212CD conventional submarines in cooperation with Germany, to secure its waters and enhance its maritime deterrence capabilities. The deployment of the first Leopard 2A8s in 2024, much earlier than planned, reflects Norway's commitment to rapidly adapting its ground forces to the demands of modern warfare, characterized by an increased use of sophisticated technologies, such as drones and precision anti-tank weapons. Through these initiatives, Norway confirms its commitment to a robust and effective defense, aiming to protect its national sovereignty while contributing to the stability of the Nordic region and the NATO Alliance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/knds-delivers-first-next-gen-leopard-2a8-tank-to-norway-to-counter-russia	2024-11-12T01:13:07-08:00

New US Navy Arleigh Burke class Destroyer USS John Basilone Joins Fleet	According to information published by the US DoD on November 9, 2024, the U.S. Navy's latest Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, USS John Basilone (DDG 122), was officially commissioned. The ceremony, held at the historic pier between the USS Intrepid and New York's cruise terminal, welcomed the newest guided-missile destroyer to the fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Commissioning ceremony of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS John Basilone. (Picture source: US DoD) In comparison to their international counterparts, these U.S. Navy destroyers feature a balanced design that combines advanced technological systems, multi-mission flexibility, and substantial firepower, making them a staple of the U.S. surface fleet. In terms of air defense capabilities, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers leverage the Aegis Combat System paired with the SPY-1 or SPY-6 radar (in the latest Flight III versions), providing robust anti-air and missile defense capabilities. Japanese Maya-class destroyers also utilize the Aegis system, enhancing their BMD capability for regional defense against evolving threats. The South Korean Sejong the Great-class destroyers share similar systems, but with a higher VLS (Vertical Launch System) cell count of 128 compared to the Arleigh Burke's 96, making them particularly well-suited for heavy multi-role missions, including land-attack and anti-air operations. In contrast, China’s Type 052D Luyang III-class destroyers, while also equipped with phased-array radar systems, generally lack the advanced radar sensitivity of the SPY-6 but remain formidable within China's A2/AD (anti-access/area denial) strategy, especially in the South China Sea. The U.K.’s Type 45 Daring-class destroyers focus heavily on air defense, designed to protect carrier strike groups and equipped with the Sampson radar and Sea Viper system for high-efficiency air-defense roles. While the Arleigh Burke class is equally capable in air defense, it is better suited for a multi-role environment, thanks to a wider range of missiles housed in its 96 VLS cells, which support land-attack, anti-surface, and anti-submarine operations. In anti-ship and land-attack roles, Russia’s Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates present a unique challenge due to their hypersonic Zircon missiles, which offer significant regional strike capabilities. Although the Gorshkov-class VLS capacity is lower, its missile technology remains a potent factor in regional engagements. The Arleigh Burke class, however, brings a balance of capability with Tomahawk land-attack missiles, SM-series air-defense missiles, and ASROC anti-submarine missiles. While all of these vessels are powerful in their own rights, each nation’s destroyer class reflects its specific defense priorities. Japanese, South Korean, and British destroyers emphasize air defense, reflecting regional security needs, while the Chinese Type 052D is optimized for near-seas defense as part of a broader strategy to assert control over the South China Sea. Russia’s Admiral Gorshkov, focused on anti-ship missions, serves to project power within contested regions. The Arleigh Burke class, in comparison, is a globally deployable asset capable of performing in various mission profiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/new-us-navy-arleigh-burke-class-destroyer-uss-john-basilone-joins-fleet	2024-11-12T00:37:08-08:00

France Confirms Future Deliveries of Mistral and SCALP Missiles to Ukraine	France is set to deliver additional Mistral air-defense missiles and SCALP long-range missiles to Ukraine, confirmed Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu in an interview published on November 9, 2024, by 'Le Journal du Dimanche.' This announcement underscores France’s deepening commitment to supporting Ukraine’s defense capabilities, particularly in areas where the conflict with Russia remains intense and for operations to counter enemy advances. Lecornu’s confirmation highlights France’s strategic objectives to reinforce Ukrainian defense both in contested zones and in broader, sustained counteroffensive actions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France pledges continued support to Ukraine in its defense against Russia with additional deliveries of Mistral air-defense and Scalp long-range missiles. Since the start of the conflict in February 2022, France has been a critical supplier of advanced defense systems to Ukraine. Lecornu stated that the latest shipment will include Mistral missiles to bolster protection in combat areas. 'We will again supply Mistral missiles, particularly to protect combat zones,' he said. He also noted that to support Ukraine’s ability to strike critical locations behind Russian lines, France will transfer around ten more Scalp missiles. France has already provided Ukraine with roughly 100 Mistral and 50 SCALP missiles in previous shipments, which have proven instrumental in strengthening Ukraine’s layered air defenses and precision strike capabilities. The Mistral missile system, a short-range, man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS), has been essential on the battlefield for neutralizing low-altitude threats such as helicopters, drones, and low-flying fixed-wing aircraft. Operated by a single soldier, the shoulder-fired missile uses an infrared seeker to acquire targets, making it highly effective even against evasive, high-speed threats. With a range of about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) and a high-explosive warhead equipped with a proximity fuse, the Mistral can eliminate small aircraft and drones with remarkable speed and precision. In the Ukrainian context, these systems have proven especially valuable for protecting troops and critical infrastructure from low-level aerial incursions, especially as the conflict sees an increased use of UAVs. Due to its lightweight, portable nature, the Mistral can be easily deployed in remote areas, providing flexible and responsive defense against aerial attacks. The SCALP missile, known as the Storm Shadow in British service, is an air-launched, long-range cruise missile designed to conduct precision strikes on high-value, heavily defended targets far behind enemy lines. With a range exceeding 250 kilometers (155 miles), the Scalp allows Ukrainian forces to target essential Russian infrastructure, command centers, and ammunition depots, delivering strategic impacts with minimal exposure to enemy defenses. The SCALP missile’s dual-charge BROACH (Bomb Royal Ordnance Augmented Charge) warhead is built to penetrate hardened targets, achieving significant destruction upon detonation. Additionally, the missile’s low-flying profile and stealth characteristics make it hard to detect by radar, enabling it to evade advanced air-defense systems.

However, only the designs from Japan and Germany have advanced to this final stage, following a recent decision by the cabinet's National Security Committee (NSC). The German contender, the MEKO A-200, is a modernized version of the Anzac-class frigate. This modular vessel is expected to meet Australian requirements more easily and at a lower cost than Japan’s Mogami-class. Meanwhile, the Mogami 30FFM, known for its cutting-edge capabilities, is regarded as one of the most advanced frigate designs globally. Although Japan is becoming a critical strategic ally for Australia, it has limited experience in exporting naval vessels. Vice-Admiral Mark Hammond, Australia’s Chief of Navy, has previously lauded Japan’s shipbuilding prowess, though other military officials lean towards Germany’s MEKO design due to Australia’s familiarity with German-built vessels. In a bid to bolster its proposal, Japan has reportedly offered to purchase Naval Strike Missiles from a soon-to-be-built Australian factory, though this offer has yet to be publicly confirmed. The SEA 3000 program aims to deliver the first GPF in 2029, with the Australian government anticipating a budget of between $7 billion and $11 billion for the decade-long initiative. Building the initial warships overseas marks a significant departure from Australia’s historical practice of local warship construction, with only a handful of larger vessels built abroad in the past fifty years. The selection of Japan and Germany’s frigate designs will soon be officially announced, with senior Australian defense officials expected to travel to all bidding nations to inform them of Australia’s decision formally.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/australia-pre-selects-japan-and-germany-for-anzac-class-frigate-replacement-program	2024-11-08T07:14:41-08:00
