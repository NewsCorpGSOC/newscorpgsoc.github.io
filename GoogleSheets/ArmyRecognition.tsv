Exclusive: Russia Poised to Deploy Deadly BMPT-72 Terminator 2 Combat Vehicle in Ukraine	As reported by the Russian news website Vestnik-RM on September 12, 2024, the Russian army may deploy the latest generation of the BMPT-72 Terminator fire support vehicle on the battlefield in Ukraine. The BMPT used by Russian forces, commonly known as the BMPT Terminator model 2017, is an updated version of the BMPT-72 Terminator 2. Introduced into Russian service in the late 2010s, this model saw its first significant deployment for the invasion of Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BMPT-72 Terminator 2 is the latest generation of Russian-made fire support vehicle in the BMPT family. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The BMPT model 2017 shares the same chassis as the T-72 but includes various modernizations and enhancements over the earlier Terminator 2. It retains the core armament of two 30mm 2A42 autocannons, four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles, and secondary weaponry like a 7.62mm PKTM machine gun and automatic grenade launchers. However, the 2017 model benefits from improved fire control systems and better protection, making it more effective in modern combat environments. The deployment of the BMPT Terminator model 2017 in Ukraine is the vehicle's first significant combat test. Russian forces introduced the BMPT to bolster their tank units in complex combat situations, particularly in urban areas where tanks are vulnerable to ambushes, anti-tank guided missiles, and infantry armed with RPGs. The BMPT was seen as a vehicle that could bridge the gap between tank operations and infantry support, offering more protection and firepower to help secure Russian armored advances. In Ukraine, the BMPT was deployed alongside T-72 series and T-90M tanks, primarily in urban and forested areas where tank units faced heavy resistance from Ukrainian forces. The BMPT's combination of autocannons, anti-tank missiles, machine guns, and grenade launchers made it highly effective in neutralizing infantry positions, engaging light armored vehicles, and providing suppressive fire for advancing tank units. However, its actual performance in Ukraine has been met with mixed results. While the BMPT's firepower and armor were considered assets in specific engagements, there were reports that the vehicle was not used in large numbers or in an optimal role. One of the reasons for this is that the Russian military might not have fully integrated the BMPT into their combined arms strategy. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has shown that modern battlefield environments, especially in urban settings, are extremely lethal for armored vehicles, even with support vehicles like the BMPT present. There have also been challenges with Russian logistics and the high intensity of combat, which have limited the BMPT's widespread use. Some analysts suggest that while the BMPT performed well in specific roles, it did not dramatically change the overall effectiveness of Russian armored units in Ukraine. Nevertheless, its deployment highlighted the importance of dedicated armored support vehicles in modern warfare, especially in urban or asymmetric environments where traditional tanks are vulnerable to mobile infantry and advanced anti-tank weapons. The BMPT Model 2017 is the current version in service with the Russian army and deployed in Ukraine. (Picture source Army Recognition Group) The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 are both Russian armored vehicles designed to support tanks and infantry in challenging combat environments, but there are several differences between the two. The BMPT Terminator 1 is based on the T-90 tank chassis, while the BMPT-72 Terminator 2 uses the older T-72 chassis. This difference in platform allows the BMPT-72 to be more cost-effective for countries that have a surplus of T-72 tanks, enabling them to convert those older tanks into BMPTs. In terms of weight, the BMPT Terminator 1, due to its T-90 base, is heavier, weighing around 48 tons. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, being based on the T-72, is slightly lighter. The armament configurations of both models are largely the same, featuring a combination of 30mm cannons, anti-tank missile launchers, and machine guns, designed for anti-infantry and anti-armor roles. The key distinction is the modernization and production flexibility of the BMPT-72, which was designed to be a more affordable upgrade solution by leveraging the widely available T-72 chassis, while the original BMPT Terminator 1 was a more specialized system built from the newer T-90 platform. Both vehicles serve a similar purpose in the battlefield, but the BMPT-72 provides a more versatile and budget-friendly option for militaries with a large inventory of older tanks. The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 both have robust armor and powerful armament designed for urban warfare and supporting tanks, though there are differences between the two models. The Terminator 1, based on the T-90 chassis, benefits from the advanced armor of the T-90 tank, including Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor (ERA), which provides protection against modern anti-tank projectiles and RPGs. This makes the Terminator 1 highly resistant to a variety of battlefield threats. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, built on the older T-72 chassis, also has strong armor but does not come with the same advanced protection as standard. However, the BMPT-72 can be equipped with modern ERA upgrades to enhance its survivability. In terms of armament, both vehicles are equipped with a formidable array of weapons designed to engage multiple types of targets, including infantry, light vehicles, and even aircraft. The BMPT Terminator 1 is armed with two 30mm 2A42 autocannons. These autocannons are capable of firing both armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds, making them versatile against various threats. Additionally, the Terminator 1 carries four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which can penetrate heavy armor and engage tanks or bunkers from long distances. The BMPT Terminator 1 is the first version in the BMPT family.

Rafael CEO confirms deployment of Iron Beam laser weapon system by Israel in 2025	According to The Nziv Report on September 12, 2024, Yoav Turgeman, CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, announced that its Iron Beam High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) will become operational with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) next year. This 100kW system is intended to be a new component of Israel's air defense system, serving as the 'final line of defense' against drones, rockets, and mortars. It is expected to enter active service by late 2025.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Iron Beam laser system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. (Picture source: Rafael) According to Rafael, the Iron Beam system can focus a laser beam with up to 100 kilowatts of power on an aerial target, destroying it within seconds. Its effective range varies depending on factors such as laser power, weather conditions, and the type of target, and it is capable of addressing short- and medium-range threats up to 7 kilometers away. The Iron Beam system has undergone testing, including a series of tests conducted by the IDF in March 2022 that demonstrated its ability to intercept drones, mortars, and missiles. One of the key attributes of the Iron Beam is its lower cost per shot compared to conventional missile interceptors. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. The system also has an unlimited magazine, allowing for continuous use without the need for reloads, and does not produce debris from intercepted threats, reducing the risk of collateral damage. These features are relevant in the context of the ongoing conflict, where Israel has faced a shortage of Iron Dome ammunition. The Gaza war has reportedly cost the Israeli economy over $67.3 billion, according to Israeli economists. Turgeman also discussed the performance of Rafael’s Python 4 and Python 5 missiles, which have been used against drones and cruise missiles during recent Iranian attacks. He noted that the Python 4 missile, in service for four decades, continues to meet operational requirements. Rafael is also developing the 'Skysonic' system, which is intended to provide a hypersonic interception capability against hypersonic missile threats. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. (Picture source: Rafael) Rafael, which has been developing directed-energy systems for over 30 years, is working on enhancing the capabilities of the Iron Beam. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously. This development is primarily funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The Iron Beam, also known as 'Magen Or' or 'Shield of Light,' is a 100kW High Energy Laser Weapon System first unveiled at the Singapore Airshow in February 2014. It is designed to intercept a variety of aerial threats using a directed-energy approach. The Iron Beam system uses a fiber laser to destroy short-range rockets, artillery, and mortar bombs, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It operates by detecting and tracking airborne threats, either as a stand-alone system or as part of a broader air defense network. Iron Beam is one component of Israel's integrated missile defense system, which also includes Arrow 2, Arrow 3, David's Sling, and Iron Dome systems. It is intended to complement these layers by providing a directed-energy option for intercepting threats that may not be effectively managed by other interceptors. A Naval Iron Beam variant is also being developed for use on ships to protect against drone swarms and anti-ship missiles. This version, which retains the same external dimensions as the ground-based system, is expected to be operational within four to five years and is planned for deployment on Israeli Navy vessels such as the Reshef-class corvette.

(Picture source: Rafael) Further developments have included efforts to create a mobile version of the Iron Beam system. However, weight and power supply considerations have led to a focus on integrating it with existing stationary platforms. The system's ability to achieve high precision over extended distances suggests potential applications in both military and civilian contexts, particularly in defending against slow-flying drones and other aerial threats that are more vulnerable to laser-based attacks. In April 2022, experiments demonstrated the system's ability to intercept drones, rockets, mortar bombs, and antitank missiles. In response to operational needs, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced plans to deploy the Iron Beam to Israel’s southern border with the Gaza Strip to test its effectiveness in real-world conditions, including during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. The system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. (Picture source: Rafael) The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. By 2023, advancements in the technology enabled the laser to achieve energy levels of 100 kW or more, with the beam's precision focused to the diameter of a coin at distances of up to 10 kilometers. Despite its potential, the use of high-energy lasers like the Iron Beam or the British DragonFly has challenges. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds or rain can affect the beam's ability to reach its target, and the laser must remain focused on a moving target for several seconds to deliver sufficient energy to destroy it. This requirement can limit its effectiveness in countering multiple threats simultaneously, such as a barrage of rockets. Additionally, some targets could be shielded with materials resistant to laser attacks, which could reduce the system’s effectiveness. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously.

The contract, signed in January 2022 for $375 million, reflects India's commitment to supporting the military modernization of the Philippines. In addition to military exchanges, the partnership between India and the Philippines aims to establish stable supply chains within the defense industry. Philippine Undersecretary of Defense, Irineo Cruz Espino, emphasized the importance of long-term investments to build a national industry capable of meeting the needs of its military without excessive reliance on imports. The Philippines views India's experience in defense indigenization as a model to follow in achieving self-sufficiency. Maritime security is also a key area of bilateral cooperation. Alongside the development and delivery of military equipment, India and the Philippines have implemented an information exchange system on commercial shipping as part of the White Shipping Information Exchange initiative. This mechanism allows for real-time tracking of commercial vessels, thereby enhancing maritime security in a region where tensions are particularly high. The two nations have also expressed their willingness to strengthen cooperation within multilateral frameworks, including ASEAN and regional security forums such as the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus. This multilateral collaboration is seen as essential for maintaining regional stability and countering growing threats in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in response to China's maritime ambitions. As India and the Philippines celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations and 10 years of India's 'Act East' policy, their defense cooperation marks a turning point in the military strategies of both nations. The joint development of military equipment, coupled with close collaboration on maritime security, strengthens the Philippines' defense capabilities while solidifying India’s role as a key security player in Southeast Asia. The partnership between the two countries could prove crucial for regional stability in the years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/india-and-philippines-strengthen-military-cooperation-with-joint-defense-equipment-development-partnership	2024-09-13T00:33:02-07:00	
First Images of J-20A Stealth Fighter Prototype Equipped with WS-15 Engine	The development of domestic aircraft engines has long been considered a weakness of China's aerospace industry. For decades, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jets were primarily powered by engines derived from Soviet or Russian designs or produced under license. However, China's economic, industrial, and military rise has enabled its aerospace industry to advance and develop its own engines. These engines now equip the main fourth and fifth-generation combat aircraft. The most recent example is the emergence of the clearest photograph to date of a J-20A stealth fighter, equipped with the new WS-15 engine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The J-20A variant in the photograph features several improvements over previous versions, including a redesigned radome and a slightly elevated cockpit (Picture source: X Channel RupprechtDeino ) Although many specifications of the Xian WS-15 turbofan remain unknown, its development dates back to the 1990s and is directly linked to the fifth-generation J-20 fighter, which is in service with the PLA Air Force (PLAAF). Due to technological limitations in China's aerospace industry at the time, the J-20 was initially powered by Russian Saturn AL-31 engines. Later, as mass production of the 'Mighty Dragon' stealth fighter began, locally produced WS-10 engines were integrated into the aircraft, which were initially designed for fourth-generation Chengdu J-10 fighters. However, China aimed to equip its air superiority fighter with an engine capable of meeting the stealth requirements, comparable to the capabilities of the American F-22 Raptor.The Chengdu J-20, also known as the 'Mighty Dragon,' is a fifth-generation stealth fighter developed by Chengdu Aerospace Corporation for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). Its development began in the late 1990s, with the first prototype unveiled in 2011. The aircraft entered service in 2017 and is primarily designed for air superiority, though it is also capable of conducting ground-attack missions. The J-20 stands out for its stealth characteristics, advanced avionics, and the ability to carry a mix of air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry in internal bays to maintain a low radar signature.By 2023, China is estimated to have around 150 to 200 operational J-20 fighters, making it one of the few countries with an operational fifth-generation fighter fleet, alongside the United States and Russia. The J-20's capabilities include long combat range, advanced radar systems, and enhanced maneuverability. Its development reflects China's ambition to match Western air power, particularly in contested areas like the South China Sea.These long-term efforts have resulted in the creation of the Xian WS-15 engine, which now powers more recent versions of the J-20, produced by Chengdu Aerospace Corporation. In recent months, several reports have indicated the start of production of this new turbofan engine, along with flight tests conducted with fifth-generation aircraft. The WS-15 engine requires modified air intakes to optimize airflow. In terms of power, prototypes have indicated that the engine could reach a thrust of 36,000 pounds with afterburners, with the goal of reaching 40,000 pounds (Picture source: CreativeCommons) Recently, a photograph of a J-20A (serial number 2052) equipped with WS-15 engines circulated on social media, drawing the attention of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) analysts and experts. This image, the clearest ever seen, shows the aircraft in great detail. Although the location of this test flight has not been confirmed, it is likely to have taken place at Chengdu's facilities. The J-20A variant in the photograph features several improvements over previous versions, including a redesigned radome and a slightly elevated cockpit. The fuselage also appears more spacious, which may suggest the integration of new avionics equipment and increased fuel capacity. The WS-15 engine requires modified air intakes to optimize airflow. In terms of power, prototypes have indicated that the engine could reach a thrust of 36,000 pounds with afterburners, with the goal of reaching 40,000 pounds. In comparison, the WS-10 produced thrusts ranging from 32,000 to 35,000 pounds with afterburners. It is noteworthy that while the WS-10 has been observed with thrust-vectoring nozzles, this feature has not yet been confirmed for the WS-15. If these data are accurate, the J-20A powered by the WS-15 could offer greater power than American F-22 Raptors, whose Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engines each provide 35,000 pounds of thrust. This development, while raising new questions, reflects decades of Chinese investment in the research and production of aircraft engines. Recent photographs suggest that another J-20A (serial number 2053) has been seen flying, also apparently equipped with WS-15 engines.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/first-images-of-j-20a-stealth-fighter-prototype-equipped-with-ws-15-engine	2024-09-13T00:26:59-07:00

US Marine Corps Enhances F/A-18 Capabilities with Addition of AGM-158A Missile	The United States Marine Corps has successfully integrated the AGM-158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) into its arsenal for the F/A-18 Hornet, enhancing the operational capabilities of the aircraft. This development was confirmed during validation and verification testing conducted by Marines from Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 11 (MALS-11) and Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (VMFA-232) at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, San Diego, California, on August 27-28, 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marines from VMFA-232 and MALS-11 conducted the first ordnance operations with the AGM-158A JASSM, loading it onto a F/A-18 Hornet during validation and verification at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on August 27, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) The AGM-158A JASSM is a stealthy, air-launched, conventional cruise missile designed for precision ground strikes. With a range of 370 kilometers, this missile allows the F/A-18 to engage targets beyond the reach of enemy air defenses. First used in combat by U.S. forces in 2018 to destroy a Syrian chemical weapons facility, the JASSM has demonstrated its effectiveness and strategic importance in modern warfare. During the recent tests in Miramar, Marines loaded an AGM-158A onto a VMFA-232 F/A-18 Hornet. The tests focused on verifying loading procedures, hardware and software connections, and communication between the missile and the aircraft. This process, crucial before the missile can be fully integrated into the Marine Corps' arsenal, involved coordination between several units and the use of a live missile—an unusual step, as training missiles are typically used for such procedures. However, the absence of training variants of the JASSM required the use of a live missile in real conditions. This validation process also provided junior Marines with critical hands-on experience in missile loading procedures. Senior ordnance technicians from MALS-11 and VMFA-232 supervised the tests, ensuring that every step, from transportation to post-loading checks, was carried out safely and precisely. The feedback collected during this process will contribute to the development of an official Marine Corps loading manual for the AGM-158A, ensuring that future operations are conducted efficiently and safely.

US grants Egypt $1.3 Billion in Military Aid Boosting Defense Cooperation	On September 11, 2024, the Biden administration confirmed that Egypt would receive its full allocation of $1.3 billion in military aid, despite persistent concerns over the country’s human rights record. This marks the first time that the administration has granted this aid without withholding any portion, reflecting the increasing reliance of the U.S. on Egypt’s mediation efforts, particularly in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An Egyptian M1A1 Abrams tank participated in a field training exercise during Bright Star 2017 at Mohamed Naguib Military Base, alongside more than 200 U.S. service members as part of the bilateral U.S. Central Command exercise held from September 10 to 20, 2017. (Picture source: US DoD) Of the $1.3 billion aid, $320 million is usually conditioned on Egypt's improvement in human rights, leading to partial withholdings in past years. However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken informed Congress that $225 million of this amount would be released, citing U.S. 'national security interests.' The U.S. government emphasized Egypt’s key role in regional peace efforts, especially in mediating ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas and managing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Despite this crucial diplomatic role, the Egyptian government, led by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, continues to face accusations of human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary detentions. Some U.S. lawmakers, such as Senator Chris Murphy, criticized the waiver of human rights conditions, insisting that Egypt remains a repressive state. However, the State Department noted progress, such as the release of political prisoners and proposed reforms on pretrial detention, which led to the release of $95 million in previously withheld military aid. For many years, the U.S. has played a central role in equipping Egypt’s military, providing advanced systems that enhance the operational readiness of Egypt’s armed forces. This annual military aid includes armored vehicles, combat helicopters, and sophisticated weaponry, thereby strengthening Egypt’s defense capabilities. Among recent deliveries, armored personnel carriers such as the RG-33 and MaxxPro, delivered in 2016, have provided Egypt with enhanced mobility and protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), critical in counterinsurgency operations in the Sinai. These vehicles are particularly suited for counter-insurgency missions, offering essential protection to troops. The M1A1 Abrams tank, with 125 units delivered, is another key component of Egypt’s military arsenal. Considered one of the most powerful tanks in the world, it is equipped with a 120mm smoothbore gun and advanced composite armor. These tanks are supported by M88 armored recovery vehicles, which ensure that damaged tanks can be retrieved and returned to service, maintaining their operational availability.

These aircraft play a crucial role in anti-terrorism operations in the Sinai, where Egypt combats various armed groups. On the naval front, Egypt has strengthened its fleet with Ambassador-IV corvettes and Swift-93 patrol vessels, vital for coastal defense in strategic areas such as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. These ships, equipped with anti-ship missiles and advanced radar systems, provide crucial maritime protection for Egypt. In the field of intelligence and reconnaissance, Egypt has received systems such as the SIGINT Beech-190 aircraft and DB-110 reconnaissance pods. These assets provide critical real-time intelligence capabilities, enhancing Egypt’s ability to monitor and respond to threats along its borders. While the U.S. remains Egypt’s primary military supplier, the country has diversified its sources of armaments, strengthening ties with partners like China. This diversification allows Egypt to reduce its reliance on the U.S. while accessing alternative technologies. For instance, Egypt has acquired Wing Loong II drones from China, similar to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper, which are used for both reconnaissance and strike missions. This strategy aims to ensure a robust and versatile military supply chain, enabling Egypt to address regional security challenges effectively.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-grants-egypt-1-3-billion-in-military-aid-boosting-defense-cooperation	2024-09-12T04:57:52-07:00	
Philippine Army Recommissions Scorpion FV101 CVRT Light Reconnaissance Tracked Armored Vehicle	On September 2, 2024, the Philippine Army reportedly decided, as shown in images from a blessing ceremony on social media, to recommission the light tank FV101 Scorpion, the CVR(T) Arayat, equipped with a low-pressure L23A1 76mm turret, previously withdrawn from service due to maintenance issues. This tank has recently been recommissioned after a comprehensive overhaul, signifying a revitalization of its capabilities within the Armored Division.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Philippine Army's Scorpion FV101 CVRT Light Reconnaissance (Picture source: Philippines Social Media) For reference, the Philippine Army had embarked on an ambitious project to modernize twelve of its aging Scorpion tanks, with a budget of $4.6 million. This project included replacing the gasoline engines with diesel engines to address the shortage of spare parts. This enhancement not only increased the reliability of the tanks but also made them more suitable for current operations, particularly in the conflict regions of Mindanao. The 'Arayat' is one of the few Scorpions to have survived a phase where many of its counterparts were declared out of service and cannibalized for their parts. The removed turrets had been adapted to Belgian M113A2 vehicles, modified by Israel's Elbit Systems. However, the recent decision to repair and reintegrate these tanks shows a notable change in military resource management. Army officials have not disclosed the exact number of tanks that will be restored, but it appears that it will be a modest number. Moreover, it is noted that these reintegrated tanks will not benefit from the same advanced fire control systems found on the M113A2s. According to the Military Balance 2023, the Philippine Army still has six FV101 Scorpion light tanks to date. It is possible that the Arayat will be used for training and fire support purposes. As a reminder, the Philippine Army has recently bolstered its arsenal with strategic additions, including the Sabrah light tank and the Guarani 6x6 armored vehicle. Introduced in 2024, the Sabrah light tank, based on the Ascod 2 and Pandur II 8x8 chassis, is the result of a collaboration between Israel's Elbit Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems, offering tracked and wheeled options. Equipped with an advanced turret with a 105mm cannon, the Sabrah aims to enhance the versatility and firepower of the armed forces in the face of regional threats. Indeed, the turret comes from the Matak program, developed in collaboration between Israel and the South African industry. This tank is specially designed to meet the demands of varied terrains and complex combat scenarios. On the other hand, the Guarani 6x6, developed by Iveco Defence Vehicles and delivered for the first time in 2023, was selected for its superior mobility and protection performance. This armored vehicle excels in the secure transportation of troops, including in amphibious conditions, which is crucial for operations in the numerous archipelagos of the Philippines. The integration of the Guarani into the Philippine Army marks a significant step in the modernization of its troop transport vehicle fleet, thereby enhancing its ability to respond quickly and effectively to regional security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/philippine-army-recommissions-scorpion-fv101-cvrt-light-reconnaissance-for-training-missions	2024-09-12T04:49:04-07:00

US Allows Ukraine to Use Long-Range Missiles to Target Russian Territory After Iranian Missiles Delivery	Citing information published by 'People's World' on September 11, 2024, Moscow claimed that the U.S. has given the green light for Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian targets. This development comes as part of a broader international effort to support Ukraine, with several European countries also backing Kyiv’s use of long-range weapons to strike Russian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A weapon Loader crew uploads a Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile to an external pylon on a B-1B Lancer at Edwards Air Force Base. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) On September 3, 2024, 'Reuters' announced that the U.S. is nearly finalizing an agreement to supply Ukraine with Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), which can reach deep into Russian territory. These missiles are expected to be delivered to Ukraine as part of a weapons package by autumn. The move is seen as a significant escalation in the conflict, as Ukraine will now be able to strike further into Russian territory than ever before. The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) is a long-range, precision-guided cruise missile developed by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. military. It is designed to be launched from aircraft and strike high-value, well-defended targets from a safe distance, reducing the risk to pilots. The missile is equipped with advanced stealth technology to evade enemy radar and has a range of up to 370 km (230 miles) in its basic version, with an extended-range variant (JASSM-ER) reaching over 900 km (560 miles). JASSM is used primarily by the U.S. Air Force and Navy and has been exported to several allied nations. European nations have also signaled their approval for Ukraine to use their donated missile systems in strikes targeting Russian military assets. Several European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, have provided Ukraine with long-range missile systems such as the British-supplied Storm Shadow and French SCALP-EG cruise missiles. These missiles, with ranges up to 300 kilometers, have already played a crucial role in Ukrainian strikes against Russian positions in occupied territories. However, until now, the use of European-donated long-range missiles had been limited to Ukrainian targets within its own borders or occupied territories. According to *People’s World*, recent developments indicate a shift in policy, with Western countries softening their stance on allowing Ukraine to strike military targets deep inside Russia. The UK, in particular, has reportedly supported Ukraine’s right to defend itself, even if that means conducting offensive operations within Russian territory, as long as those strikes are aimed at military infrastructure. This shift follows Russia's own aggressive actions, including Iran’s delivery of Fath 360 ballistic missiles to Moscow, which has heightened the sense of urgency among Ukraine's Western allies. The Iranian-Russian missile deal, cited by *People's World*, has been seen as a provocative step, further fueling the arms race in the region and prompting NATO allies to reevaluate their restrictions on Ukraine’s use of donated long-range weapons. With the U.S. poised to provide the JASSM missiles and European nations indicating their support for Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil, Ukraine is now better equipped to launch offensive operations that reach far beyond the frontlines. This new phase in the war has raised concerns about a potential escalation in hostilities, as long-range strikes from both sides could destabilize not only Ukraine and Russia but also the broader region. The growing use of advanced Western missile systems, alongside Ukraine’s requests for more offensive capabilities, signals a new chapter in the conflict, one that could significantly shift the balance of power on the battlefield. As the conflict intensifies i Ukraine, the international community watches closely, with fears that this increased missile activity could lead to unpredictable consequences, potentially drawing other nations deeper into the conflict. Western nations continue to walk a fine line between supporting Ukraine's defense and preventing a further escalation that could lead to direct confrontation with Russia	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-allows-ukraine-to-use-long-range-missiles-to-target-russian-territory-after-iranian-missiles-delivery	2024-09-12T03:01:07-07:00

GDELS Unveils Another Variant of Pandur Evolution for Special Forces	At the 9th KSK Armament Symposium, General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) revealed a new variant of the Pandur Evolution, designed for special forces missions. This marks the first public presentation of this specialized version of the Pandur Evolution, showcasing its advanced capabilities and potential applications.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration of the Pandur Evo 6x6, the version presented at KSK is equipped with an automated turret. (Picture source: Austrian MoD) The vehicle on display is based on a modified 6×6 Pandur Evolution platform. It is equipped with a remotely operated weapon station featuring a 30mm autocannon, an anti-drone protection net, and several canisters for carrying and launching Switchblade 300 Block 20 loitering munitions. Despite the impressive presentation, GDELS representatives refused to provide detailed specifications, only offering limited information regarding the vehicle's weight and mobility. The presented vehicle is described as a potential mission variant, which has not yet been selected by any customer. GDELS declined to comment on whether this vehicle could serve as a base for the Armored Ground Mobility System (AGMS) Heavy Platform Vehicle. Although the special forces variant of the Pandur Evolution includes elements such as the weapon station and Switchblade canisters, these components appear to be more demonstrative than definitive equipment. Additionally, the size of the weapon station would hinder the vehicle’s air transportability, suggesting that this configuration will not be included in the final AGMS version. Three major modifications distinguish the special forces variant of the Pandur from the standard version. The vehicle’s chassis has been significantly shortened at the rear, reducing its empty weight to less than 15 tons without mission equipment. Other visible changes include the presence of a ballistic driver's cabin and a modified engine cooling system. The total authorized weight of the vehicle is 19.5 tons, with a payload capacity of around 3 tons. The powertrain has not been modified, and the vehicle retains a Cummins ISLe 450 diesel engine with 335 kW and a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission. The base vehicle’s dimensions (2.6 meters wide and 2.2 meters high) allow it to be transported by a C-130 aircraft. The basic armor of the Pandur vehicle family protects the crew from shrapnel, small arms fire, and mines. Although GDELS did not provide details on the armor of the special forces variant, it is likely equipped with additional armor from Rheinmetall Protection Systems and meets the ballistic protection standards of STANAG 4569, likely level 3 or higher. Since the vehicle was presented in a closed configuration, no information could be obtained about the interior layout or combat space configuration. However, the presence of the ballistic driver's cabin and the modified engine cooling system, also found on previous AGMS versions of the Pandur used by USSOCOM, suggests that this vehicle is well-suited for special operations. The armored engine cooling system protects the engine while allowing the surface to be used for transporting material or mission equipment, and the ballistic driver's cabin allows the driver to maintain situational awareness even under enemy fire. The AGMS vehicles currently in service, as seen in publicly available images, are equipped with numerous mission-specific modifications, such as remotely operated weapon stations, communication equipment, and sensors. This leads to the conclusion that the special forces version of the Pandur on display is likely only the base platform for future AGMS vehicles, with the final versions expected to include different equipment and armor tailored to specific missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/gdels-unveils-another-variant-of-the-pandur-evolution-for-special-forces	2024-09-12T02:13:59-07:00	
US Army's FTUAS Program Tests Drone System Interoperability with Textron Aerosonde 4.8 HQ and Griffon Aerospace Valiant UAVs	On September 10, 2024, the U.S. Army achieved two significant milestones in the development of its Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) program, with the completion of the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) compliance evaluations and flight demonstrations of competing prototypes.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Griffon Aerospace Valiant Drone (Picture source: Griffon Aerospace) The MOSA compliance evaluations were conducted in May and involved companies Griffon Aerospace in Madison, Alabama, and Textron Systems in Huntsville, Alabama. These evaluations were collaborative and involved replacing the mission computers of the vendor prototypes with a third-party surrogate mission computer using a mix of third-party and vendor software. This hardware and software swap allowed an independent evaluator to measure the openness and modularity of the prototype systems to determine the extent to which they meet MOSA objectives. This MOSA compliance verification demonstrated early implementation and alignment with required MOSA functional boundaries and will serve as a model for future evaluations. The Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) is a key initiative of the U.S. Army to enhance the interoperability and flexibility of its systems, particularly in unmanned aircraft system programs like the FTUAS. This strategic framework allows for seamless integration between various technological components, facilitating cooperation between different equipment and platforms. Thanks to MOSA's modular design, systems can easily integrate new technologies or update specific components, which promotes scalability without necessitating a complete overhaul. MOSA also helps reduce development costs and time by decreasing dependence on single suppliers and fostering healthy competition among them, which stimulates innovation and cost reduction. Aligning with open industrial standards also leverages technological advances from the civilian sector, thus enhancing the relevance and efficiency of military systems. Additionally, MOSA's modularity simplifies system maintenance, allowing for updates or replacements of individual components, which ensures increased operational availability and extends the equipment's lifespan. After the MOSA verifications, the FTUAS team conducted flight demonstrations with the prototypes from both suppliers at the Redstone Test Center (RTC), a subordinate command of the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command. Griffon Aerospace and Textron Systems performed multiple flights at RTC, demonstrating key system features such as Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL), reduced acoustic signature, On-The-Move (OTM) command and control, rapid deployment, system integration, and flight performance. Each supplier will continue prototype development, incorporate feedback and lessons learned, and deliver production representative prototypes for future government-led testing at RTC, which will ultimately inform the Army's selection for a Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System program. The FTUAS will provide Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) with an organic capability to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance operations that collect, develop, and report actionable intelligence, allowing the BCT commander to maintain dominance during Multi-Domain Operations. FTUAS's transformational capabilities include VTOL for runway independence, OTM command and control, and soldier-led, field-level maintenance. The Modular Open Systems Approach of the FTUAS allows the system to keep pace with technology through rapid capability insertions. The Program Executive Office (PEO) for Aviation at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, is responsible for modernizing the Army Aviation fleet of manned and unmanned aircraft to maintain the Army's asymmetric advantage over peer adversaries in large-scale combat operations. The Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Office of PEO Aviation is dedicated to rapidly fielding transformational UAS capabilities at all echelons of Army formations. Griffon Aerospace Valiant The Griffon Aerospace Valiant, a Category 3 Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) platform, represents a significant evolution in tactical unmanned aerial systems (UAS) designed for the U.S. Army's Future Tactical Uncrewed Aircraft System (FTUAS) program. This drone is designed to offer unmatched endurance and payload capacity, meeting the demanding requirements of multi-domain operations and contested logistics scenarios. The Valiant integrates a Modular Open System Approach (MOSA), which enables the integration of interchangeable payloads and facilitates rapid capability insertions, enhancing flexibility and interoperability across various military technologies. Key features of the Valiant include its capabilities for command and control on the move, which provide robust communication links and operational control even while mobile. This feature is particularly vital for operations in environments where traditional communication infrastructures are compromised or absent.

(Picture source: US DoD) Raytheon has confirmed its involvement in this effort, working with the Air Force and two competing vendors, General Atomics and Anduril, who are currently in the development phase for the production of CCA Increment 1. Jon Norman, Raytheon’s vice president for air and space defense systems, discussed the missile integration during a meeting with reporters, following initial reports published by Air and Space Forces Magazine in July. 'We are collaborating with the Air Force on their CCA program to integrate the AMRAAM onto the Increment 1 drones. CCA Increment 2 is still in the early requirements phase,' said Norman. The CCA drones are set to be developed in phases, allowing for progressive improvements in their design and capabilities. The Air Force plans for these drones to carry various payloads for missions ranging from intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) to offensive strikes. According to Norman, the AMRAAM has been designated as the 'reference weapon' for these drones. 'The AMRAAM allows manned aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II or F-22 Raptor, to extend their combat capabilities. These drones can act as force multipliers, strategically positioned to use the AMRAAMs under the control of the manned aircraft,' he explained. In April, General Atomics and Anduril were awarded contracts to design detailed prototypes and conduct flight tests for the first series of CCA drones. Once the design is finalized, these companies, along with other interested vendors, will be able to compete for the final production contract, expected to be awarded in 2026. The Air Force plans to present full-scale models of the prototypes from General Atomics and Anduril during the Air, Space, and Cyber conference in September, according to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. Raytheon has focused on improving the range, navigation, and anti-jamming capabilities of the AMRAAM as part of this integration. Although the company has not specified which variant of the missile will be used on the CCAs, the most recent variant, the AIM-120D, has an estimated range of approximately 160 kilometers. In preparation for a new series of tests under the Air Force’s Weapon System Evaluation Program, Raytheon is working to demonstrate the extended range of the missile. While no changes were made to the missile’s propulsion system, adjustments were made to its flight path to conserve kinetic energy during long-range engagements, thus increasing its effectiveness upon impact. 'This allows us to regain parity, and even surpass, many global threats. It also makes the AMRAAM more resilient against future threats,' concluded Norman.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-air-force-integrates-amraam-missiles-onto-cca-drones	2024-09-11T05:01:29-07:00

US Army Reintegrates Over a Dozen MH-139 Helicopters in 2026	After deciding to cut its MH-139A Grey Wolf fleet by half for the 2025 fiscal year, a new Pentagon review has led the Air Force to reintegrate more than a dozen of these helicopters, thus avoiding a 'critical' cost overrun. The service plans to add 14 MH-139A helicopters to its inventory, bringing the total number to 'at least 56' aircraft in its future budget request.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link MH-139A Grey Wolf is a US helicopter. (Picture source: Boeing) This increase in procurement is expected to benefit Boeing, the primary contractor, and the Italian company Leonardo, whose commercial AW139 serves as the base model for the Grey Wolf. Initially, the Air Force planned to acquire 80 helicopters, but this number was reduced to 42 in the 2025 fiscal year budget. However, the recently published Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) from the Pentagon confirms the authorization to add 14 additional helicopters, partially reversing the initial cut. The SAR indicates the 2026 fiscal year budget, which is generally kept confidential until the full Pentagon spending plan is released in the spring. An Air Force spokesperson declined to provide further information, while Boeing referred inquiries back to the Air Force. The MH-139A Grey Wolf is designed to replace the aging UH-1N Huey, and its primary mission will be to patrol the Air Force’s extensive nuclear missile silos. According to Andrew Hunter, the Air Force's acquisition chief, this mission will be fully funded, even though other roles traditionally performed by the Huey, such as VIP transport and civilian search and rescue, are facing budget cuts. With the apparent expansion of the Grey Wolf fleet, it remains to be seen whether some of these missions, initially slated for removal, might be reinstated. Hunter previously explained that the helicopter procurement reduction was due to budget constraints, but this cut also triggered a 'critical' cost breach under the Nunn-McCurdy Act. This breach occurs when the total program cost is spread over fewer aircraft, thereby increasing the unit cost. The SAR indicates that the planned increase in procurement for 2026 will bring unit costs below the critical Nunn-McCurdy threshold, although the breach will still be classified as 'significant' under statutory guidelines. The Grey Wolf is equipped with advanced avionics systems, improved range, greater speed (approximately 250 km/h), and enhanced capacity for surveillance and transport missions, while maintaining lower operating costs compared to its predecessors. The helicopter is designed to perform other roles, such as VIP transport, search and rescue, as well as general support missions. Thanks to its flexibility and state-of-the-art equipment, the Grey Wolf enables the US Air Force to maintain strict surveillance while improving force security and modernizing logistical capabilities in a constantly evolving environment. The Air Force had deferred the acquisition of helicopters to obtain the necessary certifications from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Acquisition resumed in fiscal year 2023 after receiving the certifications, and Grey Wolf production began last year with Hunter's approval. In August, Boeing announced that it had delivered the first low-rate initial production helicopters to the Air Force. Additionally, in August 2023, Air Force officials reported progress in securing technical data packages for the Grey Wolf, a traditionally thorny issue for the industry. This advancement is expected to facilitate service-led maintenance and create more competition among contractors for helicopter sustainment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-army-reintegrates-over-a-dozen-mh-139-helicopters-in-2026	2024-09-11T00:41:10-07:00

John Norman, Raytheon's Vice President for Air and Space Systems, emphasized the evolution of the AMRAAM over its 30 years of service, noting that its range has now reached near parity with newer threat missiles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Despite the AMRAAM’s shorter range compared to the JATM, it remains crucial to force composition, especially with the uncertainty surrounding the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program (Picture source: USAF) The AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) entered production in the late 1980s, with initial service starting in 1991. Developed by Raytheon, the AMRAAM is a medium-range air-to-air missile capable of engaging targets beyond visual range, with a reach of approximately 160 kilometers. It is equipped with an active radar seeker, GPS guidance, and enhanced electronics, allowing it to engage multiple targets in challenging environments. The AMRAAM is widely used by U.S. and allied forces across more than 14 platforms in 43 countries. Upgrades such as the D3 variant have extended its range and improved its ability to counter modern threats, including electronic jamming. The AIM-260 JATM, developed by Lockheed Martin, is designed to replace the AMRAAM and address next-generation threats. While production details remain confidential, the JATM is expected to enter service in the mid-2020s. With a range exceeding 190 kilometers, it is designed to provide enhanced capabilities against advanced threats, including countermeasures and electronic warfare. The JATM is expected to be a high-end, costly weapon that complements the more affordable and deployable AMRAAM. In a recent call with reporters, Norman explained that despite the AMRAAM’s shorter range compared to the JATM, it remains crucial to force composition, especially with the uncertainty surrounding the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. Norman noted that the range of the AMRAAM is approaching the level sought by the Air Force for the JATM, which remains largely confidential. Although specific details were not disclosed, Norman suggested that the AMRAAM can intercept targets at around 160 kilometers, while the JATM is designed for engagements beyond 190 kilometers. He described the AMRAAM as the 'capacity weapon' due to its financial accessibility, while the JATM is positioned as a specialized solution for advanced threats. The latest AMRAAM variant, the D3, results from close collaboration with the U.S. Air Force, incorporating improvements such as extended range and enhanced resistance to modern jamming techniques. These upgrades have significantly boosted the missile's effectiveness against current digital threats. Norman emphasized that these developments, combined with its integration across 14 platforms in 43 countries, ensure that the AMRAAM remains 'future-proof' against evolving global threats. As global demand for the AMRAAM continues to grow, Raytheon has ramped up production, reaching 1,200 units annually in recent years—double the historical production rate. Discussions are underway to potentially produce the missile in other countries, with Japan being a potential partner. However, such plans would require an increase in demand to 2,000 units per year. Norman expressed optimism about the future of the AMRAAM, stressing that consistent demand and investment will be key to ensuring the missile continues to play a critical role in the U.S. Air Force's strategy, alongside the cutting-edge capabilities offered by the JATM.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/raytheon-sees-complementarity-between-amraam-and-jatm-missiles-in-future-u-s-air-force	2024-09-11T00:15:07-07:00	
Egypt Officializes Its Choice of Chinese J-10C Fighters to Replace American F-16s	According to The National Interest, Egypt has officially announced that it will replace its aging fleet of American F-16s with Chinese J-10C Vigorous Dragon fighters, following discussions over the past few months. This decision made public during the first Egypt International Air Show, reflects Cairo's intent to diversify its military equipment sources, thus reducing its reliance on U.S. defense systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This decision comes during a time of geopolitical realignment for Egypt, which recently joined the BRICS bloc alongside major players such as China, Russia, and India. (Picture source: PLA Air Force) The Chengdu J-10C, in service with the Chinese Air Force (PLAAF) since 2004, is a multirole fighter equipped with a single engine, delta wings, and a canard configuration. Known for its maneuverability and versatility, the J-10C offers advanced capabilities at a competitive cost, making it an attractive alternative to the American F-16V, which had been proposed as an upgrade for the Egyptian fleet.Developed by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation (CAC), the J-10C features advanced electronic warfare systems and an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. It supports multirole operations with targeting pods, laser-guided bombs, and air-to-air missiles. Officially entering service in December 2017, the J-10C is currently operated by China and Pakistan, and Egypt has expressed interest in acquiring a dozen units, primarily due to its lower cost compared to Western and Russian fighter jets.The J-10C is designed with a 'tailless delta-canard' aerodynamic layout, which improves its maneuverability and overall lift. It is powered by a Russian Lyulka-Saturn AL-31FN turbofan engine, capable of reaching a maximum speed of 2,200 km/h and a range of 3,200 km. Additionally, it is equipped with modern avionics, including an IRST sensor and various externally-mounted avionics pods for navigation, targeting, and electronic reconnaissance missions.This decision comes during a time of geopolitical realignment for Egypt, which recently joined the BRICS bloc alongside major players such as China, Russia, and India. In recent years, Egypt has also acquired defense equipment from Russia and France, including the MiG-29M and Dassault Rafale. The Chinese J-10C is set to become a key part of Egypt's diversified arsenal.This development also reflects the growing economic and strategic ties between Egypt and China. China's participation in the Egypt Air Show in El Alamein is part of its broader effort to strengthen its presence in the Middle East and North Africa. China’s military-industrial influence in the region has significantly expanded, supported by its growing economic relationships, particularly through energy imports. A Yun-20 and a J-10 fighter aircraft from the Chinese Air Force flew over the Pyramids during the 2024 Egypt International Air Show. (Picture source: PLA Air Force) Despite adopting Chinese fighters, Egypt continues to maintain defense relations with the United States, as evidenced by a recent agreement to acquire two C-130J Hercules transport aircraft through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. However, the transition to the J-10C represents a significant shift, as Egypt’s American F-16s, which have formed the backbone of the Egyptian Air Force since the 1980s, are now considered outdated in the face of modern air defense systems.Several factors likely influenced Egypt's decision, including the J-10C's cost-effectiveness and its advanced combat capabilities. Additionally, Egypt's concerns regarding U.S. policy in the region, particularly its support for Israeli operations in Gaza, may have played a role in the shift towards Chinese defense technology.With this acquisition, Egypt becomes the second country after Pakistan to operate the J-10C Vigorous Dragon. The Egyptian Air Force is expected to deploy these fighters to enhance its operational capabilities in North Africa and the Middle East, solidifying Egypt's position as a regional military power.Egypt’s interest in Chinese fighters extends beyond the J-10C, with the country also showing interest in the J-31, a fifth-generation stealth fighter. While the J-10C offers multirole capabilities at a reduced cost, making it competitive with Western and Russian aircraft, the J-31 is seen as a strategic asset to counter Israeli F-35s. The J-31’s advanced stealth features, radar evasion capabilities, and modern weapon systems make it a serious candidate for modernizing Egypt’s air capabilities and maintaining a balance of power in the region. Its ability to perform bombing, interdiction, and close air support missions further reinforces Egypt’s interest, particularly in a geopolitical context where it seeks to diversify its defense sources in response to sanctions on Russia and the U.S.-Israel relationship.The Egyptian Air Force (EAF) plays a central role in the country's defense strategy, with a diversified fleet of fighter jets from various sources. Egypt currently operates American F-16s, Russian MiG-29s, and French Rafales, reflecting its military diversification strategy. However, many of these aircraft, particularly the F-16s, are considered aging and less effective against modern threats. Egypt’s desire to acquire J-10Cs and J-31s demonstrates its commitment to strengthening its air fleet in the face of new regional challenges, including Israeli air superiority.The defense partnership between China and Egypt has a long history, dating back to the 1970s. Over the decades, this partnership has grown stronger with the supply of various Chinese military equipment, including submarines, destroyers, missile boats, and aircraft. China's non-interference policy and its strategic approach to arms exports, free from political conditions, make this cooperation particularly attractive to Egypt. Additionally, China offers competitive pricing and advanced technology transfers, facilitating joint production projects.

Israeli-Designed Russian Drone Targets Ukrainian Positions in Kursk in Coordinated Strike	Since the onset of large-scale warfare, reconnaissance and attack drones have become pivotal in modern military strategies. The 'Forpost-RU' drone, a Russian-enhanced version of the Israeli IAI Searcher II, exemplifies this well. This device has proven effective in both reconnaissance and attack roles due to the integration of new light guided munitions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Forpost -RU flying with KAB-20 under wing ( top), Russian weapon specialist fixing KAB-20 under Forpost-RU UAV ( bottom) during coordinated strike on September 9th, near Kursk. (Picture source: Russian fighters) The Forpost-RU is a significant example of how military technology can evolve and adapt in response to a country's tactical and strategic needs. This reconnaissance and attack drone is based on the Israeli IAI Searcher II model, which has been widely used for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The Forpost-RU resulted from a licensing agreement between Russia and Israel, allowing Russia to acquire the Searcher II drone technology. In 2010, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) entered an agreement with Russia for the licensed production of these drones. This partnership was crucial for Russia, aiming to modernize and enhance its surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. Following the initial agreement, production was localized in Russia under the name Forpost, a version almost identical to the Israeli Searcher II. Localizing production allowed Russia to benefit from technology and skills transfer, leading to the adaptation and enhancement of the device to specifically meet the requirements of the Russian armed forces. The development of the Forpost-RU marked a significant evolution from its predecessor. By integrating more advanced technologies and armaments, such as adapting to carry light guided munitions like the KAB-20 bombs, the Forpost-RU has transformed into a more versatile platform capable of performing both reconnaissance and attack missions. The 'Forpost-RU' operates at a medium altitude, capable of staying airborne between 16 and 18 hours, allowing it to conduct extended surveillance and strike missions. Equipped with an 85 horsepower piston engine, the АПД-85, it can reach a maximum speed of 200 km/h, with a cruising speed ranging from 120 to 160 km/h. These characteristics make it ideal for various missions, ranging from reconnaissance to precise attacks. The recent adaptation of the 'Forpost-RU' to carry KAB-20 bombs marks a significant evolution in its combat role. These light guided munitions are designed for precise strikes, thus providing increased attack capability without the need for heavy aerial support. This integration represents a notable evolution in military strategy, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of strikes while minimizing risks to equipment and personnel. The KAB-20 is a light guided bomb specifically designed to be deployed from reconnaissance and attack drones, like the Forpost-RU. Weighing approximately 20 kilograms and measuring 1.2 meters long with a diameter of 130 mm, this munition is optimized for use on UAV platforms where payload capacity is limited. It is equipped with an advanced guidance system that combines GPS with inertial sensors to allow for increased precision in striking targets. This guidance technology makes the KAB-20 particularly suited for hitting mobile or semi-mobile targets with high precision, thereby minimizing collateral damage and enhancing the effectiveness of strategic strikes. The effective range of the KAB-20 primarily depends on the altitude from which it is dropped, but it is designed to precisely strike targets several kilometers away, allowing drones like the Forpost-RU to remain out of reach of enemy air defense systems while conducting effective strikes. The use of the 'Forpost-RU' in the Kursk region, particularly against the fortifications of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (FAU) in the village of Snagost, illustrates the tactical impact of this platform. The ability to conduct precise and sustained strikes from a distance is a major asset in the current context where control of the skies is paramount. The 'Forpost-RU' drone, with its capabilities extended by carrying KAB-20 bombs, represents a significant technological advancement for modern warfare. It embodies the continuous adaptation of armed forces to the evolving theater of war, where technology and innovation play a crucial role. The successes recorded in the Kursk region attest to its operational effectiveness, making it a key element in the Russian military arsenal.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/israeli-designed-russian-drone-targets-ukrainian-positions-in-kursk-in-coordinated-strike	2024-09-10T02:06:40-07:00	
Russia proposes partnership with India for local production of Il-76MD-90A strategic airlifters	On September 9, 2024, the Indian Defence Research Wing (IDRW) reported that the Russian company, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), had proposed a partnership with India to locally manufacture the Ilyushin Il-76MD-90A strategic airlifter. This proposal aims to replace the Indian Air Force's (IAF) fleet of 17 Il-76MD heavy transport aircraft, which were acquired in the early 1980s.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The first production Il-76MD-90A aircraft began flying in October 2014, and the initial unit was delivered to the Russian Ministry of Defense in April 2019. (Picture source: RussianPlanes.net/Alexey Reznichenko) Introduced in 2012, the Il-76MD-90A is a variant of the Il-76MD, a Soviet-era heavy military transport aircraft that has been in service since 1971. The aircraft's payload capacity has been increased from 40 tons to 60 tons, and it offers enhancements in flight range and efficiency, along with a reduction in noise and emissions. Over 70% of the aircraft’s systems have been updated to improve flight safety.

Singapore Army introduces Vesper tactical drone to use 3D view of battlefield	The Singapore Army, in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), has recently introduced a new tactical drone, the Vesper, developed by Vantage Robotics. This advanced quadcopter is designed to enhance the situational awareness of soldiers on the battlefield, marking a significant turn in tactical military operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Vesper UAV in service alongside 5th Bataillon of Singapore infantry Regiment (Picture source: Singapore Army ) During the recent Panther Strike exercise, troops from the 5th Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (5 SIR) were the first to deploy the Vesper, highlighting its effectiveness and ease of use. Capable of flying in free or tethered mode for persistent surveillance operations, the Vesper is equipped with two low-light cameras and an infrared (IR) sensor with 4K resolution and 48x zoom, allowing for target detection even in low-light conditions. Thanks to a three-axis stabilized gimbal, the Vesper can transmit live Full HD (1080p) video streams to the Ground Control Station (GCS), ensuring high-quality image transmission even under challenging conditions. During the operation, this drone proved its worth by providing aerial surveillance just before the arrival of infantry forces, enabling commanders to modify their operational plans in real-time to maximize mission success. The drone can be deployed in less than 90 seconds from its carrying case and can fly at a maximum speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) with an extremely low noise signature, comparable to a whisper (&lt;32 dBA at 25m), and a flight time of 50 minutes. Soldiers using the Vesper have been trained through the Basic Vertical Take-Off and Landing UAV Operator Course (BVOC), which has allowed them to quickly master the drone's intuitive controls. This ease of use, combined with magnetic snap-on components that facilitate quick replacement of parts in the field, makes the Vesper particularly suited to the evolving dynamics of the modern battlefield, especially in urban environments. The adoption of the Vesper underscores the Singapore Army's ongoing commitment to integrating the most advanced technologies to strengthen its operational capabilities. Particularly by bringing 3D vision into operational capabilities for detection and recognition, the Vesper incorporates identification technology that allows for the advanced detection and classification of personnel as friend or foe, providing a real advantage in reconnaissance, tailored for an army sized for local interventions. The Singapore Army is sized by the geographical and social conditions of the country, which today is an enclave close to Malaysia and Indonesia. Its army is not designed for interventionist operations but to maintain the nation's foothold in its maritime and terrestrial zones of influence. The Vesper drone thus fits into this logic as well.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/singapore-army-introduces-vesper-tactical-drone-to-use-3d-view-of-battlefield	2024-09-10T01:24:20-07:00	
Russian fiber-optic controlled FPV is not so Russian but Chinese	Ukrainian radio technology and drone pilot specialist since the Russian military action, Serhiy Beskrestnov (also known as Serhiy Flash), has challenged Russia's claim that it is developing a new fiber-optic controlled drone, suggesting that the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) might actually originate from China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link FPV drone with different Optic fiber length adaptable to mission. (Picture source: Russian Telegram channel ) Beskrestnov's allegations highlight Russia's reliance on foreign technologies for its military operations, despite official statements to the contrary. Several videos show heavy use of these drones since March 2024, with fiber optics as a control system for FPV drones presenting a solution to jamming and its effectiveness. The optical link is physical and thus limits drone movement and range, and previously negligible obstacles (buildings, windows, power lines, etc.) are now taken into account. It is not yet known if redundancy in case of a break is planned, nor if a radio link could serve as a backup system in case of fiber breakage. Despite these drawbacks, which involve a flight trajectory more 'ballistic' than a straight line close to the ground as with traditional FPVs, optical FPVs offer particularly interesting image quality. In the video at the end of the article, it is noted that there are over 50 constant FPS and very sharp resolution. This makes it easy to identify areas of interest and facilitates target designation. In a post on social media, Beskrestnov stated: 'There are discussions among enemy groups that the Russian optical fiber drone 'Vandal' does not exist. It is actually a Chinese drone purchased for $2,000.' He also claimed that these drones could be bought for Russian military use at a significantly inflated price of $17,000, but no information corroborates these statements. Russia has recently increased the use of optical fiber FPV drones in combat, with officials boasting that these drones are immune to electronic warfare (EW) countermeasures due to their lack of radio signals. Russian sources have already celebrated the launch of what they called the 'Prince Vandal of Novgorod' drone, developed by the NPC Ushkuy company based in Novgorod. Russian military sources have stated that 'no EW system can affect it, and the images captured are clear and intact.' According to Beskrestnov, this Russian innovation is actually a Chinese Skywalker drone, marketed and known for its fiber optic capabilities. Unlike traditional drones, which can be jammed by electronic warfare systems, fiber optic drones remain resistant to such interference, as they rely on a physical cable for control, rather than radio frequencies. Additionally, these drones are undetectable by most drone detectors due to the absence of radio command and video transmission signals. Russia's dependence on these drones and their components manufactured abroad further underscores the country's difficulties in developing cutting-edge technologies independently, despite public claims of innovation and self-sufficiency.

The AIM-120C-8, an improved version of the AIM-120C series, stands out with its extended range and enhanced resistance to electronic jamming, thanks to upgrades in its guidance system and sensors. Its range, estimated at over 100 kilometers, allows it to engage targets before they pose a threat to the launching aircraft. Introduced in 1991, this missile variant is a continuation of the AIM-7 Sparrow series but offers significant enhancements in speed, size, and target engagement capabilities. This sale is seen as key support for U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives, aiming to strengthen the position of a strategic ally in Asia. As a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific region, Singapore already benefits from close military relations with the U.S., particularly in terms of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces. According to the Military Balance 2023, Singapore has an operational fleet of 105 combat aircraft. Among them are 100 multirole fighters, including 40 F-15SG Eagles, 20 F-16C Block 52 Fighting Falcons, 20 F-16D Block 52 Fighting Falcons, and 20 F-16D Block 52+ Fighting Falcons, including reserve aircraft. These aircraft are equipped to fire the advanced AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM, thereby enhancing their air defense capabilities and ability to engage medium-range targets. The State Department emphasized that this agreement would not only improve Singapore’s operational capabilities but also help maintain regional stability in light of growing tensions in this strategic area. The introduction of these missiles will increase the effectiveness of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in both training and combat operations, thus reinforcing deterrence in this key region. The Singapore Armed Forces are considered the best-equipped in Southeast Asia. Their structure is largely modeled after the Israeli system, with the air force and navy primarily composed of professional personnel, while the much larger army relies mainly on conscripts and reservists, aside from a small core of career soldiers. The modernization of the SAF’s equipment continues, with a boost given by the 'SAF 2040' vision, launched in March 2022. This plan outlines acquisition and modernization priorities across all domains, including the creation of a fourth branch of the armed forces, the Digital and Intelligence Service, which was established in October 2022. Key acquisition projects include F-35 fighter jets, multi-role combat vessels, unmanned surface vessels, unmanned aerial vehicles, offshore patrol vessels, maritime patrol aircraft, and various land equipment. These efforts aim to maintain Singapore’s military edge over other Southeast Asian countries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-approves-sale-of-advanced-aim-120c-8-air-to-air-missiles-to-singapore	2024-09-10T00:58:43-07:00
