Kongsberg secures contract to upgrade Norway's Ula-class submarines	According to information published by Kongsberg on September 23, 2024, Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace has signed a new agreement with the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA) to upgrade the Ula-class submarines. The contract, valued at approximately NOK 436 million, covers both hardware and software upgrades to the submarines' combat systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Norwegian Navy's Ula-class submarine. (Picture source: Kongsberg) These upgrades are intended to maintain the Ula-class submarines' effectiveness until Norway introduces its next generation of submarines, the Type 212CD, expected to enter service in the 2030s. Kongsberg, having originally supplied the Ula-class combat systems and previously undertaken modernization efforts, will once again enhance the submarines' capabilities. Kongsberg is also responsible for supplying the combat systems for the upcoming 212CD submarines, which will be delivered to both Norway and Germany in the future. Technical comparison The Type 212CD and Ula-class submarines represent distinct phases in diesel-electric submarine technology. The Ula-class, commissioned between 1989 and 1992, was designed for coastal defense, leveraging its small size for stealth in shallow waters. However, it lacks some modern features found in newer submarines, such as air-independent propulsion (AIP), which limits its ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing to recharge. In contrast, the Type 212CD, developed jointly by Germany and Norway, integrates AIP, allowing it to stay submerged for significantly longer, enhancing its stealth by avoiding the need to 'snort' at periscope depth. Its larger size and enhanced hydrodynamics further increase its range and versatility, allowing for operations in both coastal and deep-water environments. While the Ula-class submarines remain effective due to regular upgrades, such as new sonar and navigation systems, they lack the strike capabilities of the Type 212CD. The newer design can deploy advanced weapons like the Naval Strike Missile, enabling engagements with both surface ships and land targets, a feature absent in the Ula-class. The Type 212CD also benefits from significant improvements in signature management, with the use of non-magnetic steel and advanced acoustic quieting technologies, making it harder to detect compared to the Ula-class.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/kongsberg-secures-contract-to-upgrade-norways-ula-class-submarines	2024-09-23T01:25:29-07:00

After Acquiring M1A2 SEPv3, Australia Could Transfer Its M1A1 Abrams Tanks to Ukraine	According to information reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, in collaboration with the Biden administration, the Australian government is working on a plan to send 59 M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. As the war in Ukraine continues, where Ukrainian forces struggle to compensate for material losses against a Russian army capable of quickly replacing its tanks through a robust defense industry, the question of tank supply has become critical. With losses of Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams Situational Awareness (SA) tanks, provided by the United States in September 2023, mounting, the possibility of reinforcements from other countries may soon materialize.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Australian Army M1A1 Abrams tank firing during Exercise Gauntlet Strike in Puckapunyal. (Picture source: Australian Army) The Russian army, supported by its defense industry, has recently received an additional batch of T-90M Proryv tanks, further strengthening its ability to maintain a steady flow of heavy equipment to the front lines. Conversely, Ukraine, dependent on military aid from its Western partners, has seen its number of M1A1 Abrams tanks decrease by half, with no additional deliveries from the U.S. scheduled in the near term.The M1A1 Abrams is an improved version of the U.S.-designed M1 Abrams main battle tank. First produced in 1985, this tank features several upgrades over the initial version, including a new suspension system, transmission modifications, and enhanced armor protection. Its main armament is a 120mm M256 smoothbore cannon, capable of firing kinetic energy penetrator rounds with an effective range of over 3,500 meters. The tank is also equipped with two 7.62mm coaxial machine guns and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun, providing significant firepower.The M1A1 uses Chobham composite armor, supplemented with depleted uranium plates, offering effective protection against kinetic and chemical energy rounds.

(Picture source: Ukrainian Army) Another country that could help offset Ukraine's losses is Australia. In January 2022, Canberra confirmed the acquisition of 75 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks for approximately $2.5 billion to replace the 59 M1A1 Abrams tanks in service with the Australian Army. These tanks, which had not seen extensive use, were retired in July 2024 and placed in reserve as the first M1A2 SEPv3 deliveries were imminent. As of late September 2024, Ukraine has received all 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks that were promised by the United States earlier in the year. These deliveries were part of a U.S. pledge made in January 2023 to supply Ukraine with modern tanks to strengthen its defense against Russian forces. However, reports suggest that Ukraine has already lost at least half of these tanks in the ongoing conflict.Kiev's interest in these decommissioned tanks is not new, but the Australian government had previously declined the request, citing the high cost of such a transfer. This same argument was used to justify the refusal to send a fleet of MRH-90 'Taipan' helicopters, also retired from Australian service to Ukraine.However, Australia's Defense Minister, Richard Marles, appears to have reconsidered the issue and is now considering supplying the tanks to Kyiv, subject to U.S. defense export regulations.If this transaction goes through, it could provide significant support to the Ukrainian military, which is struggling against Russia's material strength. Ongoing discussions between Canberra and Washington underscore the strategic importance of Ukraine in maintaining the balance of power in Eastern Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/after-acquiring-m1a2-sepv3-australia-could-transfer-its-m1a1-abrams-tanks-to-ukraine	2024-09-23T00:30:22-07:00

Exclusive: Rheinmetall Demonstrates Challenger 3 Tank's Firepower Against Russian T-72B3 in Live-Fire Test	In a stunning demonstration of firepower, German Company Rheinmetall has showcased the destructive capabilities of the new L55 caliber 120 mm smoothbore gun mounted on the Challenger 3 main battle tank, designed for the British Army. According to military expert Nicholas Drummond, who shared the news on his X (formerly Twitter) account, the test involved using a real Russian T-72B3 tank as the target, simulating a real-world battlefield scenario.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New Challenger 3 main battle tank prototype at DVD 2024, defense exhibition in Millbrook, United Kingdom. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The L55 smoothbore gun, known for its enhanced range and accuracy, fired a DM63 APFSDS (Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) round against the Russian T-72B3 tank. The results were devastating. The round penetrated the tank’s glacis plate—its heavily armored front slope—punched through the crew compartment, tore through the engine block, and exited the rear of the vehicle. This level of penetration demonstrates the lethality of the Challenger 3’s armament against modern armor, especially against Russian tanks, which are frequently encountered in conflict zones. The L55 gun is a 120mm smoothbore cannon developed by German Company Rheinmetall as an upgraded version of the L44, designed primarily for main battle tanks like the Leopard 2A6. It features a longer barrel compared to its predecessor, which improves muzzle velocity and enhances the gun's overall accuracy, range, and armor-piercing capability. This increased length allows the L55 to fire more advanced and powerful kinetic energy rounds, making it more effective against modern armored threats. Initially introduced to equip the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent variants, the L55 has been adopted by several NATO countries. Its improved performance allows tanks to engage targets at greater distances with higher precision and increased penetration power, making it a crucial advancement in tank armament, particularly against heavily armored opponents.The DM63 APFSDS (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) is a modern kinetic energy tank round developed by Rheinmetall for 120mm smoothbore guns, such as those found on the Leopard 2 and other NATO tanks. It is designed to penetrate advanced armor by using a long, dense tungsten penetrator that discards its outer sabot upon firing, allowing the dart-like core to maintain speed and accuracy. The DM63 features a temperature-independent propellant, ensuring consistent performance in varying climates, and is optimized for use with both the L44 and L55 guns, offering enhanced penetration power against modern armored threats. The T-72B3 tank is a modernized version of the Soviet-era T-72 MBT (Main Battle Tank), designed to enhance its capabilities and keep it relevant on the modern battlefield. The tank has seen extensive use in Ukraine, where it is one of the most common armored vehicles employed by Russian forces. Its durability, ease of production, and various upgrades have made it a staple in Russia's armored fleet. The armor on the T-72B3 is a combination of composite and reactive technologies, intended to provide protection against a wide range of modern anti-tank weapons. The base armor of the T-72B3 is composed of composite materials, which combine layers of steel with non-metallic substances, such as ceramics. This setup improves the tank’s resistance to kinetic energy penetrators, such as armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, as well as high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads, which rely on explosive force to punch through armor. In addition to the composite armor, the T-72B3 is equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA) blocks, typically the Kontakt-5 system. These ERA blocks are placed on the tank's turret and hull and work by detonating upon impact, disrupting the penetrating jet or projectile from a HEAT round or significantly reducing the effectiveness of kinetic energy rounds. The combination of ERA and composite armor gives the T-72B3 considerable protection against the most common threats on the battlefield, although it is still vulnerable to modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and advanced APFSDS rounds. Despite these upgrades, the T-72B3's armor is not on par with the latest Western tanks, such as the Challenger 3 or the M1A2 Abrams, which feature more advanced composite armor arrays and reactive systems. In tests like the one conducted by Rheinmetall, the Challenger 3's 120 mm L55 cannon with the DM63 APFSDS round was able to penetrate the T-72B3's highlighting the vulnerabilities of the T-72B3 when facing cutting-edge Western armor-piercing technology. German Company Rheinmetall’s demonstration underscores the strategic advantage the Challenger 3 will bring to the British Army, offering enhanced firepower, mobility, and survivability. The tank is part of the UK's broader effort to modernize its armored forces, ensuring they remain a formidable force on the battlefield.

According to Williams, this exercise highlighted the inter-theater operational capability of the forces involved.In previous iterations of Super Garuda Shield, forces focused on single locations, such as Java or Sumatra, but this year's exercise tested command and control across multiple areas with joint forces and partner nations. Japanese and Indonesian troops also participated in the airborne assault to evaluate joint entry operations, further demonstrating the multilateral nature of the exercise.The exercise also saw a considerable increase in participation compared to earlier years. Williams noted that in 2015, only 200 Indonesian soldiers and 300 U.S. soldiers participated, with Williams himself being one of them. This year, over 2,500 U.S. service members participated, nearly doubling the number of partner nation forces involved. The exercise now includes eight fully participating nations—Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand—not counting the U.S. and Indonesia. Additionally, twelve other nations sent observers who participated in a staff exercise.New to this year's Super Garuda Shield was the introduction of U.S. Air Force assets such as C-130 aircraft, and the deployment of a Combat Aviation Brigade from the 25th Infantry Division, equipped with CH-47F Chinook helicopters. These resources contributed to the formation of a fully combined Aviation Task Force, which played a critical role in pushing the logistics tail throughout the Indonesian archipelago.

The introduction of the U.S. Army’s Integrated Tactical Network and additional mission command nodes provided a clearer operational picture for all participants.Participants also tested logistics capabilities, over-the-horizon communication systems, and the ability to integrate and synchronize assets across multiple domains. In Java, a joint strike exercise saw the U.S. Army deploying its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), alongside U.S. Marine Corps attack aviation, F-16 fighter jets from partner nations, and other missile systems. This allowed forces to evaluate sensor-to-shooter capabilities across air, land, and sea platforms in targeting operations.Amphibious operations were also highlighted during the exercise. The U.S. Marine Corps, in conjunction with Indonesian, Japanese, and Singaporean forces, conducted an amphibious assault using three platforms, including an assault craft from Singapore and the amphibious transport dock USS Green Bay. Long-range fires and reconnaissance were coordinated to set the conditions for the beachhead assault, followed by an air assault operation using the Marine Corps V-22 Osprey aircraft to insert ground forces, which were later extracted as part of the exercise.In preparation for the exercise's final phase, the U.S. Army conducted a combined arms live-fire operation, integrating ground maneuvers with partner forces in a complex scenario. This exercise was part of the U.S. Army’s broader Operation Pathways initiative, which has expanded significantly across the Indo-Pacific in recent years. Operation Pathways is designed to strengthen relationships with regional allies and ensure the ability to conduct complex joint operations in the event of conflict or other contingencies.Brig. Gen. Williams highlighted that exercises like Super Garuda Shield build crucial readiness and interoperability between allied forces, reinforcing trust among partners and ensuring preparedness for any situation. 'It really just provides capable, ready land forces that allow us to be positioned throughout the Indo-Pacific. It bolsters our allies and partners with that trust, and it really ensures we and Indonesia are prepared for any contingency or conflict or disaster that comes along,' Williams concluded.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/super-garuda-shield-a-unique-us-airborne-assault-to-strengthen-operational-capabilities-in-indonesia	2024-09-20T04:40:43-07:00

US raises alarm over increased Russian military activity near undersea cables	According to information published by CNN on September 18, 2024, the United States has reported a rise in Russian military operations around key undersea cables, heightening fears of potential sabotage against critical global communication infrastructure.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Nord Stream gas leak in the Baltic Sea. (Picture source: Danish MoD) According to U.S. officials, the secretive Russian military unit is believed to be focusing its efforts on disrupting undersea internet cables, raising alarms about the security of vital communications networks. This revelation underscores growing concerns about Russia’s ability to target global infrastructure. The unit in question, known by its Russian acronym GUGI (General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research), is reportedly enhancing its capabilities for undersea sabotage. U.S. intelligence highlights that GUGI deploys various vessels, submarines, and marine drones in its operations. The specialized deepwater submarines under GUGI's command are capable of reaching depths of 2,500 meters, and the Russian research vessel Yantar—spotted near sensitive cables off the coast of the U.K. in 2019—has been linked to this effort. The Kremlin appears to be placing significant emphasis on the activities of GUGI, with the unit continuing to receive robust financial backing. U.S. officials have pointed to recent statements by Dmitri Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, who in June hinted that Russia could target undersea communication networks if provoked. Further concerns were raised by reports of Russian vessels regularly patrolling near critical maritime infrastructure, often far from Russia’s own coastline. Undersea cables form the backbone of global internet and telecommunications traffic, stretching thousands of kilometers along the ocean floor, particularly between Europe and North America. Any coordinated sabotage could result in widespread economic and social disruption, especially in Europe. A well-executed attack on these cables could severely impact civilian communications, governmental operations, and military readiness. Additionally, industries reliant on these networks, such as the financial and energy sectors, would face significant challenges. Western nations, already focused on securing vital infrastructure as they develop green energy initiatives in the North Sea, are increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of these undersea assets. Around 95 percent of global internet traffic travels through these cables, which operate at speeds of approximately 200 terabytes per second. Of the 400 undersea cables, NATO considers 200 as critical infrastructure. These cables facilitate an estimated $10 trillion in financial transactions daily, highlighting their economic significance. David Cattler, former head of NATO intelligence, previously noted Russia’s increased activity in mapping out critical allied infrastructure, both on land and at sea. The threat posed by Russia’s focus on undersea cables has not gone unnoticed. NATO sources have confirmed a growing concern over Moscow’s intentions. Data released in June revealed that over the past decade, more than 160 non-military Russian ships have carried out 945 suspicious activities near key infrastructure in the North Sea. Of these incidents, 749 occurred within a one-kilometer radius of essential pipelines. Repairing any damage to such pipelines is both costly and time-consuming. Additionally, 72 suspicious movements involved power cables, and 124 were near telecommunications cables.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-raises-alarm-over-increased-russian-military-activity-near-undersea-cables	2024-09-20T02:43:10-07:00

South Africa's homegrown Olifant Mk2 tank takes center stage at AAD 2024	At AAD 2024, the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) demonstrated a variety of military vehicles, including the Olifant Mk2 main battle tank, alongside the Ratel infantry fighting vehicle and the Rooikat armored reconnaissance vehicle. The Olifant Mk2, a 60.5-ton upgrade of the Olifant Mk1B, was developed based on experiences from the South African Border War and features enhanced armor, mobility, and firepower compared to its predecessor.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Rather than replacing the Olifant Mk1B, the Olifant Mk2 was developed as an upgrade influenced by experiences from the South African Border War. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Olifant Mk2 is one of the heaviest military vehicles currently in service with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). Its name, derived from the African elephant, emphasizes its size and total weight of 60.5 tons, divided between a 20-ton turret and a 40.5-ton hull, while the powerpack weighs 4,740 kilograms. The design of the Olifant Mk2 was influenced by experiences from the South African Border War (1966-1989). After South Africa was no longer subject to international embargoes, the SANDF moved away from acquiring large numbers of new tanks. Instead, the military opted for more mobile, air-transportable vehicles that could be deployed for peacekeeping operations under the United Nations (UN) and the African Union (AU). Rather than replacing the Olifant Mk1B, the Olifant Mk2 was developed as an upgrade. In the 1990s, potential replacement options, including the French AMX-56 Leclerc and the British Challenger 2E, were considered. However, due to budget limitations, the decision was made to focus on upgrading the existing Mk1B tanks, resulting in the production of only 26 Mk2s. Although externally similar to its predecessor, the Olifant Mk2 retains the 29.32-liter Continental turbocharged V12 diesel engine. This engine delivers 1,026 horsepower at 2,400 rpm, improving the power-to-weight ratio from 14.4 horsepower per ton to 17.19 horsepower per ton. The Mk2 accelerates 25% faster than the Mk1B, with a top speed of 58 kilometers per hour on roads, a cruising speed of 35 kilometers per hour, and a maximum reverse speed of 25 kilometers per hour.

U.S. Coast Guard monitors Russian naval vessels near Alaska's maritime border	According to information published by the US Armed Forces on September 16, 2024, the U.S. Coast Guard encountered four Russian Federation Navy (RFN) vessels approximately 57 miles northwest of Point Hope, Alaska. The vessels were identified during a routine patrol by the crew of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Stratton (WMSL 752) in the Chukchi Sea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Severodvinsk-class submarine and Steregushchiy-class frigate. (Picture source: US Coast Guard) The Russian ships were initially seen transiting along the Russian side of the Maritime Boundary Line (MBL) before crossing into U.S. waters, approximately 30 miles into the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Their movements appeared to be in response to sea ice on the Russian side, and they operated in compliance with international maritime law during their transit. Coast Guard Cutter Stratton’s patrol was part of Operation Frontier Sentinel, a mission designed to ensure the U.S. presence is maintained in areas where strategic competitors operate. The Russian naval group consisted of a Severodvinsk-class submarine, Dolgorukiy-class submarine, Steregushchiy-class frigate, and a Seliva-class tug. US Coast Guard The interactions between enemy navies and the U.S. Coast Guard are shaped by the Coast Guard's dual role as both a law enforcement entity and a military service under the Department of Homeland Security. This unique position allows it to engage in a variety of operations that overlap with traditional naval missions, including maritime security, border enforcement, and support for U.S. Navy activities. In regions like the South China Sea, where tensions run high due to territorial disputes and freedom of navigation issues, the Coast Guard has been increasingly involved alongside the Navy. For instance, U.S. Coast Guard cutters have been deployed to participate in freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs), challenging excessive maritime claims, such as those asserted by China. These deployments allow the Coast Guard to take on missions that complement the Navy’s focus on power projection and deterrence, while also potentially de-escalating military confrontations by presenting a non-military, law enforcement-oriented presence. The Coast Guard also plays a critical role in countering 'gray zone' tactics, where adversarial forces use civilian or paramilitary assets to challenge territorial waters without direct military confrontation. In these cases, the Coast Guard’s authority in law enforcement helps manage confrontations that might not warrant a full military response but still threaten maritime sovereignty and security. This approach has been particularly useful in places like East Asia, where coast guard-to-coast guard cooperation can help manage incidents involving fishing vessels or coast guard ships from adversarial nations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/u-s-coast-guard-monitors-russian-naval-vessels-near-alaskas-maritime-border	2024-09-19T06:09:13-07:00

Taiwan's first indigenous submarine Haikun to begin sea trials in 2025 plans for 8-submarine fleet	According to information published by CNA on September 19, 2024, the prototype of Taiwan's first domestically produced submarine, the Narwhal (Haikun), is currently undergoing harbor acceptance tests (HAT), with plans to begin sea acceptance tests (SAT) by late March or early April 2025. The Haikun, launched in September 2023, is the first step in Taiwan's submarine production program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launching ceremony of the Taiwanese Hai-Kun class submarine Hai Kun. (Picture source: Taiwan presidency) The Ministry of National Defense has outlined a phased production plan, starting with two additional submarines based on the Haikun design, followed by three enhanced models. A total of eight submarines are planned for Taiwan's fleet. The timeline for the Haikun project has been extended, with final project completion now expected by 2029. This extension is due to phased deliveries of the critical MK-48 Mod 6 AT torpedoes, affected by global supply chain challenges. To support this initiative, Taiwan's Executive Yuan has approved a budget of NT$284 billion, covering construction costs, training facilities, crew accommodations, weapons systems, and related infrastructure. The budget includes allocations for anti-ship missiles and torpedoes, ensuring the full combat capability of the submarine fleet once operational. In addition, Admiral Chiu Chun-jung, Chief of Staff of the Navy, revealed that Taiwan has signed mutual rescue agreements with allied nations to enhance submarine rescue capabilities. These agreements ensure reliable support for underwater operations, though specific countries involved have not been disclosed. Plans for a dedicated submarine rescue vessel are also in development, with a detailed proposal expected by 2027. Comments Taiwan's pursuit of a modern submarine fleet is a critical element in its broader defense strategy to counterbalance the growing capabilities of China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The island currently operates an outdated submarine force, consisting of just four submarines, two of which are World War II-era vessels. Recognizing the urgent need for modernization, Taiwan has embarked on the Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS) program. The main goal of Taiwan's submarine fleet expansion is to enhance its asymmetric defense capabilities. Submarines, difficult to detect and highly effective in disrupting naval operations, are viewed as essential for protecting Taiwan against blockades or potential invasion attempts. In a blockade scenario, Taiwan’s submarines would play a crucial role in keeping critical supply routes open. Moreover, their ability to operate stealthily could impose significant risks to Chinese surface vessels, including larger assets like aircraft carriers, as demonstrated by past naval conflicts where submarines had an outsized impact. Despite these advantages, Taiwan faces challenges in its submarine program. The IDS relies heavily on foreign technology, with contributions from countries like the U.S., U.K., and others. This has complicated procurement efforts, given China’s diplomatic pressure on potential suppliers. Additionally, some critics argue that Taiwan’s focus on expensive submarines may divert resources from more cost-effective, asymmetric systems better suited for defense in the Taiwan Strait, where shallow waters could limit submarine operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwans-first-indigenous-submarine-haikun-to-begin-sea-trials-in-2025-plans-for-8-submarine-fleet	2024-09-19T03:24:14-07:00

Boeing Develops New Land-Based Version of MQ-25 Autonomous Aerial Refueling System for US Air Force	On September 16, 2024, at the Air &amp; Space Forces Association’s Air Space &amp; Cyber Conference, Boeing unveiled a new land-based version of its unmanned MQ-25 tanker, specifically adapted to meet the future refueling needs of the U.S. Air Force (USAF). This new design significantly expands the capabilities of the device, aiming in particular to refuel Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) in contested airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Boeing MQ-25 Autonomous Aerial Refueling System (Picture source: Wikimedia) According to Boeing officials, this new land-based model of the MQ-25, named the MQ-25 Land-Based Variant (LBV), features a wingspan extended to 92 feet from the 75 feet of the Navy's Stingray version. This modification eliminates the need for folding wings, a requirement for the carrier-based version, and increases the fuel capacity in the wings by 40%. Although this project is developed internally at Boeing, it is designed in consultation with the Air Force. It aligns with the Air Force’s ongoing analysis of the Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System (NGAS), whose conclusions are expected this fall. This analysis anticipates an integrated approach involving multiple systems, including a smaller autonomous tanker for operations in high-risk areas. John Scudi, interim director of the MQ-25 advanced capabilities program and senior manager of business development at Boeing, emphasized that the land-based adaptation of the MQ-25 could also serve intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, airborne early warning, and electronic warfare missions. The LBV was presented at the conference with an image showing the device receiving fuel from a KC-46’s wing refueling pods. Notably, the LBV uses a hose-and-drogue system instead of a refueling boom, initially focusing on aircraft equipped with a receiver probe. Scudi also mentioned that the use of the LBV could be extended to refuel CCAs, anticipating possible adaptations to meet the more complex needs of future CCA increments. Additionally, the LBV could be used to refuel U.S. Navy fighters already equipped with receiving receptacles. The innovative design of the LBV seeks to maximize the investment already made by the U.S. Navy in the MQ-25 program, with the main change being the widened wings. After thousands of hours of modeling and simulation, Boeing settled on the 92-foot wingspan, which not only increases fuel capacity but also adds two additional 3,000-pound pylons that could carry refueling equipment or other systems, including weapons. As a reminder, the MQ-25 Stingray, intended for the Navy, is an unmanned aerial refueling aircraft developed by Boeing for the U.S. Navy. Designed primarily to extend the combat range of carrier-based aircraft such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet and the F-35C Lightning II, the MQ-25 increases operational flexibility and endurance. It represents the first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft in U.S. naval aviation, marking a significant advancement. The aircraft is equipped with sophisticated avionics and an aerial refueling system capable of delivering approximately 15,000 pounds of fuel 500 nautical miles from the carrier, fundamentally transforming the role and capability of carrier air wings. Currently, six MQ-25s are under production at Boeing's facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Of these, one is intended for static tests while the other five are development, engineering, and manufacturing (EMD) models. These EMD models are essential as they serve as aerial test vehicles, laying the groundwork for the eventual Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP). The first flight of an MQ-25 EMD is scheduled for December 2025. Additionally, Boeing plans to relocate MQ-25 production to MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, by the end of 2025. This move is part of a broader strategy to transition the MQ-25 program from development to full-scale production. In a significant development effort, Boeing's team is also focusing on internally funded software improvements. This new software would enable a USN F/A-18 Super Hornet or E-2D Hawkeye to remotely control MQ-25s. The main function of this capability is to allow aircraft requiring refueling to directly command the Stingray in its flight path and refueling operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/boeing-develops-new-land-based-version-of-mq-25-autonomous-aerial-refueling-system-for-us-air-force	2024-09-19T01:25:32-07:00

(Picture source: TKMS) The CDR involved an extensive review of over 100,000 pages of documentation over three years in cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency and the German procurement authority BAAINBw. With the design phase complete, production is set to accelerate, and initial tests are expected by 2027. Delivery of the first submarine to the Norwegian Navy is scheduled for 2029. Both Germany and Norway are reportedly considering increasing the number of submarines beyond the initial six. TKMS expressed readiness to meet this potential demand, with political decisions expected in the coming months. About the program The Type 212CD submarine is an advanced diesel-electric class developed jointly by Germany and Norway to modernize their naval capabilities. A key feature of the Type 212CD is its increased size and enhanced stealth capabilities compared to its predecessor, the Type 212A. The new design boasts a 65% increase in surface displacement, now reaching around 2,500 tons, and a length extended to 73 meters. These submarines are optimized for reduced sonar detection, using faceted hull designs and advanced anechoic coatings to minimize acoustic and active sonar signatures, making them more difficult to detect. This stealth shaping is a major advancement in submarine design, drawing on principles similar to stealth aircraft technology. Another major improvement is the integration of an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using hydrogen fuel cells, which allows for extended submerged operations without surfacing. The Type 212CD may also include vertical launch systems for the Norwegian submarines, capable of deploying advanced missiles like the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), although this remains speculative. Norway-Germany relations The partnership is strongly anchored in NATO's framework, with Norwegian and German troops regularly participating in NATO-led operations, particularly in Eastern Europe. Both countries contribute to NATO's presence in Lithuania, where Germany leads a battle group that includes Norwegian forces. This cooperation has been instrumental in securing NATO’s eastern flank. Energy security has also emerged as a crucial area of military focus, particularly after the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Norway has increased its defense posture around critical subsea infrastructure, with German support, underscoring the connection between national security and energy stability in the region. In addition to military projects, Norway and Germany collaborate within EU defense initiatives, despite Norway not being an EU member.

Currently, the British Army operates 29 M270 MLRS platforms, equipped with Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) munitions, providing long-range strike capabilities at distances of up to 70 kilometers.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In addition to the acquired vehicles, two more launchers are currently in production, and a total of 61 M270 MLRS have already been ordered (Picture source: British MoD) In September 2022, the United Kingdom announced its intention to acquire additional launchers from allied nations, including decommissioned vehicles from museums or those used as display pieces. It is now confirmed that 31 additional M270 MLRS vehicles have been acquired, sourced through various transfer operations as well as from other countries' fleets.Among these new vehicles are MLRS launchers promised by Norway to the United Kingdom as part of a trilateral security agreement involving Ukraine. These Norwegian launchers, currently stored in the UK, will soon be sent to the United States for upgrades, likely to the A2 standard. However, these vehicles will require significant modernization efforts to become operational.In addition to the acquired vehicles, two more launchers are currently in production, and a total of 61 M270 MLRS have already been ordered. Furthermore, 15 additional launchers are expected to be contracted in 2025, bringing the total number of platforms to 76 to meet the British Army's requirements. The full delivery of these M270 MLRS is planned by the end of 2029.This significant increase in the number of M270s in the British Army could lead to a substantial restructuring of the country's long-range artillery units, particularly following the donation of more than half of its AS90 Braveheart 155mm self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine. To bridge this gap, the UK temporarily acquired 14 Archer 155mm self-propelled howitzers from Sweden, though this remains a limited solution while awaiting the delivery of the future RCH 155, developed in collaboration with Germany. The M270 MLRS, often described as a tracked version of HIMARS with double the payload capacity, carries 12 rockets housed in two pods of six rockets each (Picture source: British MoD) With the expansion of the M270 MLRS fleet, the British Army could find itself in a more favorable position regarding its indirect fire capabilities. These efforts to strengthen long-range strike capacity echo NATO's concerns in recent years, especially in light of observations from the conflict in Ukraine. The need to bolster long-range strike fleets, including both 155mm artillery and MLRS systems, has been widely acknowledged.It was previously announced in 2022 that the UK would upgrade nine of its M270 MLRS launchers to the A2 variant, as part of a $32 million contract. This upgrade process includes installing a new engine and redesigning the cabin, bringing it in line with the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). That same year, Lockheed Martin, the original manufacturer of the M270, indicated that the modernization of an unspecified number of British MLRS would be completed by 2026.The M270 MLRS, often described as a tracked version of HIMARS with double the payload capacity, carries 12 rockets housed in two pods of six rockets each. Mounted on a stretched Bradley chassis, this launch system features self-loading and autonomous aiming capabilities. The crew, consisting of three members (driver, gunner, and section chief), can launch 12 rockets in less than 60 seconds without leaving the enclosed cabin. Initially entering service in 1990, the British Army's modernized M270s are now expected to remain operational until at least 2050.Additionally, the United States maintains a significant reserve of non-operational M270A0 MLRS launchers at its Red River storage facility, which has also been used for the U.S. Army's own M270 fleet modernization program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/british-army-to-double-its-fleet-of-m270-mlrs-by-2029	2024-09-19T01:07:07-07:00

TNI AL The Indonesian Navy is undergoing a critical phase of modernization, driven by both domestic imperatives and regional security concerns. Indonesia’s vast maritime domain, which includes critical sea routes such as the Malacca, Sunda, and Lombok Straits, makes its naval capacity essential for national defense and the protection of its economic interests. However, the Navy faces substantial challenges in meeting its ambitious 'Green-Water Navy 2024' goals, which were part of a broader military plan for achieving a 'Minimum Essential Force' (MEF) by 2024. A key focus of the Navy’s modernization is expanding its underwater and surface capabilities. The TNI-AL aims to develop a fleet of 274 ships, including submarines, frigates, and patrol vessels. Currently, there is a significant shortfall, particularly in the submarine fleet, which has only four operational units against the target of 12. This shortage is particularly concerning given Indonesia’s vulnerabilities to underwater intrusions, notably by unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) from foreign actors such as China. Enhancing underwater detection systems and anti-submarine warfare capabilities are therefore priorities, alongside the acquisition of more advanced submarines and maritime patrol aircraft. In addition to hardware challenges, geopolitical tensions, particularly in the South China Sea, are putting increased pressure on Indonesia to modernize its naval forces. China's expanding claims and illegal fishing activities in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone have underscored the need for a more robust naval presence, particularly in Indonesia's eastern waters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indonesian-defense-ministry-launches-locally-built-opv-90m-vessel-in-lampung	2024-09-18T03:58:08-07:00

HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) is anticipated to receive two GE-F404 engines per month starting from November, based on GE's recent commitments.Originally, the first aircraft delivery was planned for February-March 2024, but delays in engine delivery have pushed this timeline to November. This delay was addressed during the recent visit of Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Washington, resulting in a revised delivery schedule from GE. HAL, the state-run aerospace manufacturer responsible for the Tejas, had aimed to commence deliveries in March 2024, following the contract signed in February 2021. However, the first flight of the Tejas Mk 1A took place only in March this year, necessitating additional trials and a postponement of at least four months due to software changes requested by the IAF.In response to these persistent delays and to meet future demand, the IAF has proposed a public-private partnership (PPP) model to establish additional production lines for the Tejas. Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhary emphasized the need to expand production capabilities to fulfill the IAF’s requirements. The plan includes diversifying production lines and exploring joint ventures with private sector partners to support the induction of nearly 300 Tejas variants over the next fifteen years, thereby strengthening the fighter fleet and fostering collaboration within India's aerospace industry.

Initially, the first flight was scheduled for 1994, but the prototype only took to the skies in 2001. The IAF received initial operational clearance in December 2013, and the first operational delivery took place in 2019. However, out of the initial order of 40 Tejas aircraft, four are still pending delivery. The IAF has also expressed interest in acquiring an additional 97 Mk 1A aircraft. To date, the IAF has received 35 to 36 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters from contracts signed in 2006 and 2010.Additionally, India and the United States are negotiating the co-production of GE-F414 engines for the future Tejas Mark-2 fighters. Interest in the Tejas aircraft extends beyond India; several countries, including Nigeria, the Philippines, Argentina, and Egypt, have expressed interest in acquiring this locally developed combat aircraft, as stated by CB Ananthakrishnan, Chairman and Managing Director of HAL. Previously, the United States, Australia, Indonesia, and Malaysia also showed interest, with Malaysia shortlisting the jet as part of its acquisition program.The Tejas is a lightweight, supersonic, multi-role fighter aircraft known for its agility. The Mk 1A variant is equipped with the Uttam Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, capable of scanning the sky and tracking multiple targets simultaneously, with a detection range of over 200 kilometers. The aircraft is also designed to engage enemy targets from a distance and avoid radar detection.Despite delays and logistical challenges, India continues to promote the Tejas as a key component of its air defense strategy. Efforts to enhance production capacity and establish international partnerships aim to support the future development of its fighter fleet.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/indian-air-force-to-receive-tejas-mk-1a-combat-aircraft-next-month-after-engine-delivery-delays	2024-09-18T02:52:12-07:00	
Analysis: Exploring relationship between China's Naval and Commercial shipbuilding industries	The RAND report titled 'PRC Shipbuilding: Naval and Commercial' delves into the evolving relationship between China's naval and commercial shipbuilding sectors, offering insights into how these two industries have influenced one another over the past two decades. China's rise as a dominant maritime power, both commercially and militarily, is explored through a detailed analysis of shipbuilding trends, which reveal complex interactions between these sectors.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a Chinese Naval Shipyard. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Since the 2000s, China has emerged as a global leader in shipbuilding. On the commercial side, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) increased its global market share from 4.7% of ship completions in 2000 to 51.9% of the world's open order tonnage by 2023. On the naval front, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has been rapidly expanding its fleet, especially from the mid-2000s onward. This dual rise has sparked speculation about the relationship between China's naval and commercial shipbuilding capacities. Some argue that these sectors complement each other, with advancements in commercial shipbuilding supporting the naval industry, and vice versa. However, the report demonstrates that this relationship is more nuanced and not simply additive. Data analysis reveals that while there were periods when naval and commercial shipbuilding compensated for each other (e.g., when commercial activity fell during economic downturns and naval production increased), these two sectors have become increasingly distinct in recent years. China's commercial shipbuilding reached its peak in 2011, and although it declined in the following years, it remained globally dominant, particularly in bulk carrier production. The naval sector, however, saw a significant uptick after 2010, peaking in 2014 and sustaining a more steady, high-level production aimed at building sophisticated warships. At the national level, trends show that naval and commercial shipbuilding operated somewhat inversely through the 2000s. Commercial shipbuilding boomed when naval production was low, and vice versa. However, as China's shipyards became more specialized, the two industries began to diverge. Key shipyards, such as Dalian and Jiangnan (Changxingdao), which previously handled both naval and commercial vessels, have increasingly focused on naval projects, especially for advanced platforms like the Type 052D destroyers and Type 055 cruisers. This specialization has made it more challenging for China to leverage its massive commercial shipbuilding infrastructure for naval purposes, particularly as modern warships require more complex designs and production techniques. Regional analyses support this divergence. For example, Shanghai-based shipyards have maintained a leading role in both commercial and naval shipbuilding. Yet, while commercial capacity stabilized after the 2008 financial crisis, naval shipbuilding continued to expand, driven by the construction of major platforms like aircraft carriers and destroyers. This shift is particularly evident in high-end naval yards, where commercial production has diminished as naval work increased, especially for vessels that demand specialized construction expertise. On a broader level, this trend reflects the modernization of the PLAN. Historically, Chinese naval vessels were simpler and could be built in large numbers using commercial shipbuilding techniques. However, as the PLAN has shifted toward more sophisticated platforms comparable to those of the U.S. Navy, the need for dedicated, highly specialized shipyards has grown. This shift underscores that while China’s commercial shipbuilding prowess remains formidable, its ability to quickly repurpose this capacity for naval production is limited by the increasing technical demands of modern warships. In conclusion, the RAND report highlights a complex relationship between China's naval and commercial shipbuilding sectors. While there were historical overlaps, the increasing sophistication of China's navy has led to a separation of these industries, with specialized yards focusing on naval construction. This divergence underscores the limits of China's ability to convert its dominant commercial shipbuilding capacity into a naval advantage, particularly as its navy pursues increasingly advanced vessels requiring dedicated facilities and expertise.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/analysis-exploring-relationship-between-chinas-naval-and-commercial-shipbuilding-industries	2024-09-18T02:25:16-07:00

French Army's TOUTATIS Project Targets Hostile Interference in Space	During his last hearing before the National Assembly as Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, General Stéphane Mille discussed the current situation in space. He highlighted the growing number of 'close approaches between objects' in all orbits, necessitating the development of active defense capabilities. In response to these challenges, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has implemented a series of programs to strengthen space security, including the TOUTATIS demonstration, which complements other initiatives such as YODA.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The TOUTATIS demonstration, complementing the YODA project, aims to establish a comprehensive knowledge and response chain in low Earth orbit (LEO) (Picture source: Agence Innovation Defense) In 2019, the Ministry of the Armed Forces launched the Space Defense Strategy (SSD) and the YODA program (Eyes in Orbit for an Agile Demonstrator). This initiative aims to deploy two 'watcher-patrol' nanosatellites in a near-geostationary orbit. The goal is to ensure continuous monitoring of space objects and prevent any malicious activity. Additionally, two projects have been included in the 2024-30 Military Programming Law (LPM): BLOOMLASE, a laser system intended to blind observation satellites from the ground, and FLAMHE, which involves deploying lasers in orbit.However, the risks of spatial interference affect all types of orbits. It is in this context that the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) initiated the TOUTATIS demonstration (In-Orbit Test of Action Techniques Against Space Interference Attempts) on behalf of the Space Command (CdE). Announced on September 17, TOUTATIS represents the first step in the low Earth orbit defense strategy, as part of Operation Ares (Action and Space Resilience). This operation has three main objectives: to enable the CdE to catalog all space objects in orbit (approximately 60,000), to identify potential malicious actions, and, ultimately, to counter them.The TOUTATIS demonstration, complementing the YODA project, aims to establish a comprehensive knowledge and response chain in low Earth orbit (LEO). It will rely on technologies stemming from innovation in the space sector. The project involves the satellites 'Splinter' and 'Lisa1,' designed by the start-up U-Space, and will benefit from MBDA's expertise in military engagements and satellite protection. In addition to YODA, Splinter, and Lisa1 are part of the EGIDE project (Geoderivative Engine for Intervention and Deterrence), also integrated into Operation Ares (Picture source: DGA) The Splinter satellite will feature high maneuverability and a set of subsystems allowing for autonomous approach and action. Lisa1, on the other hand, will serve as a 'watcher satellite.' Both satellites will carry out opposition or cooperation scenarios to verify the operational performance of the low Earth orbit action satellite and the space surveillance capabilities of the watcher satellite. The DGA emphasizes that TOUTATIS strictly adheres to international law, including the right to self-defense, in line with France's commitment to the peaceful and responsible use of outer space.In addition to YODA, Splinter and Lisa1 are part of the EGIDE project (Geoderivative Engine for Intervention and Deterrence), also integrated into Operation Ares. This operation relies on the GRAVES radar (Large Network Adapted to Space Surveillance), which is set to be replaced by 2030, as well as on a high-capacity computer. This computer will enable the CdE not only to analyze all surveillance data but also to predict the trajectories of referenced space objects.The development of these projects reflects France's intention to strengthen its defense capabilities in space, in response to the growing potential threats in low Earth orbit.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/french-armys-toutatis-project-targets-hostile-interference-in-space	2024-09-18T01:17:42-07:00

Explosive Pagers Reveal Major Security Breach Within Hezbollah	On September 17, 2024, Lebanon was shaken by a wave of nearly simultaneous explosions affecting hundreds of Hezbollah members, the Iran-linked Shiite militia. These explosions originated from pagers, which the organization used to avoid electronic surveillance and cyberattacks. According to several sources contacted by Reuters, the pagers had been intercepted by Israel after their purchase in Taiwan, allowing small explosive charges to be installed within them.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The pagers that exploded were Gold Apollo AR-924 type made in Taiwan. (Picture source: Gold Apollo) Hezbollah had adopted these pagers, also known as 'beepers,' for security reasons. These devices operate via radiomessaging, using the POCSAG radio transmission protocol, which provides a broader coverage—an important asset in Lebanon. The most commonly used model was the Rugged Pager AR924, produced by Taiwanese company Apollo Gold. This robust device offers a battery life of up to 85 days, thanks to its lithium battery. Despite these precautions, the pager explosions have exposed vulnerabilities within Hezbollah’s security apparatus.The explosions quickly sparked speculation. The Lebanese Ministry of Health advised pager holders to distance themselves from these devices immediately, and hospitals were placed on high alert to handle the influx of casualties. According to Lebanese security sources, Israel is suspected to be behind this incident. It is alleged that the pagers used by Hezbollah had been modified during production by the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency. Explosives were reportedly concealed in the devices and remotely activated by a code. This operation is believed to have been planned over several months, indicating a deep infiltration of Hezbollah’s security network.Reuters reported that the 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah originated from the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo. However, the company clarified that these pagers were not its direct products but were manufactured by a European firm called BAC, which holds a license to use its brand. Lebanese security sources claim that the Mossad inserted a small explosive circuit into the pagers, undetectable by standard inspection methods. Approximately 3,000 of these devices exploded simultaneously, causing serious injuries to their users. Lebanese security sources claim that the Mossad inserted a small explosive circuit into the pagers, undetectable by standard inspection methods (Picture source: X Channel Jason Brodsky) Hezbollah described this incident as 'the greatest security breach' it has faced in recent years. Lebanese authorities immediately accused Israel of being responsible for this 'criminal aggression,' which resulted in numerous casualties, including civilians. In a statement, Hezbollah vowed retaliation while reiterating its support for the Palestinian cause, particularly in Gaza.This operation has highlighted Israel's ability to infiltrate Hezbollah, marking one of the most significant counterintelligence failures for the Shiite militia in decades. Already high tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been further exacerbated, with regular exchanges of fire occurring along the Israeli-Lebanese border since the start of the Gaza conflict. However, experts believe these explosions do not necessarily signal an imminent Israeli ground offensive, but they do underline the extent of Israel's infiltration and intelligence capabilities.This incident underscores a new reality in modern cyber warfare, where everyday electronic devices with wireless connectivity can potentially become deadly weapons. It also highlights the vulnerabilities of hardware supply chains, a recurring issue in international security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/explosive-pagers-reveal-major-security-breach-within-hezbollah	2024-09-18T00:44:02-07:00

Rostec Increases BMP Engine Production by 50%	The High-Precision Systems holding of the Russian state-owned company Rostec has announced a 50% increase in the production of engines for infantry fighting vehicles (BMP) during the first seven months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was made possible through a modernization program at the Barnaultransmash plant, carried out with the support of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation and Rostec.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BMP Engine Production in a Russian factory. (Picture source: Rostec) To achieve this increase in production, the company implemented new equipment and expanded its workforce by nearly 1.5 times. The program also allowed for enhanced social support for employees and a substantial 60% increase in the wage fund. 'Rostec produces a wide range of armored vehicles, including advanced infantry fighting vehicles such as the BMP-3 equipped with additional protection kits and the modernized BMP-2 with the Berezhok combat module. These vehicles have proven highly effective in combat situations. The modernization of our production facilities allows us to meet the growing demand from the armed forces and fulfill the requirements of the national defense order,' stated Rostec. As part of the production expansion, the company has introduced additional training and professional development courses for its personnel. New and young employees benefit from individualized career paths, while experienced specialists participate in rotation programs between the company's various divisions, thereby enhancing their skills and the quality of the products. The BMPs (Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty, in Russian) are infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s and used by numerous armies worldwide, especially those in the former Eastern Bloc. They were designed to transport infantry troops onto the battlefield while providing direct fire support. The concept of the BMP is based on the idea of an armored vehicle capable of keeping pace with combat tanks, protecting its crew from light weapons and shell fragments, and delivering sufficient firepower to engage infantry and enemy light vehicles. The first model, the BMP-1, was introduced in the 1960s and was revolutionary for its time. It combined high mobility, armored protection, and powerful armament, including a 73 mm cannon and anti-tank missiles. It could transport a full squad of soldiers while offering them the ability to fire through openings in the vehicle's armor. The BMP-2, an improved version, was developed in the 1980s, featuring a turret equipped with a 30 mm cannon, enhancing its ability to engage a wider range of targets. Since then, the concept has been further developed into numerous models, including the BMP-3, equipped with even more powerful armament, notably a 100 mm cannon coupled with a 30 mm automatic cannon, significantly strengthening its battlefield capabilities. BMPs are designed to actively participate in combat alongside tanks, offering not only a secure means of transport for infantry but also crucial fire support. Their role has evolved over time, especially in modern conflicts where asymmetric threats and urban warfare have introduced new requirements for protection and mobility. Many countries, including Russia, continue to upgrade existing BMPs, reinforcing their armor, weapon systems, and mobility to adapt them to the current needs of the armed forces. 'In the current labor market, it is essential to retain professional expertise and develop young talent. We focus on creating comfortable workplaces, supporting employees' health and fitness, improving housing conditions, and providing opportunities for additional qualifications and specialized training. We also ensure that young employees have the chance to demonstrate their skills, supported by mentors and experts,' stated Tatyana Malyutina, Director of the Human Resources Department at JSC Barnaultransmash.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rostec-increases-bmp-engine-production-by-50	2024-09-17T10:13:05-07:00

US Army deploys rare Ukrainian T-72AG tank in Northern Strike 24 exercise	As reported by The Dead District on September 16, 2024, U.S. intelligence personnel from the 203rd Military Intelligence Battalion (Technical Intelligence) recently conducted a training exercise at Camp Grayling, Michigan, using a prototype of a Ukrainian T-72AG tank. This tank was employed as part of OPFOR (Opposing Force) training for U.S. troops, simulating adversary equipment and tactics. The exercise was part of Northern Strike 24, a multi-disciplinary event aimed at enhancing proficiency for large-scale combat operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The T-72AG prototype used in the U.S. training exercise at Camp Grayling lacks certain components found in some other variants, including radiation detection indicators, OTSHU-1-7 searchlights, and turret modulator systems. (Picture source: US DoD) The T-72AG prototype used in the U.S. training exercise at Camp Grayling differs from other upgraded models, such as the T-72AMG. It lacks certain components, including radiation detection indicators, OTSHU-1-7 searchlights, and turret modulator systems found in some other variants. The version at Camp Grayling retains the open-type commander's cupola, similar to the original T-72, rather than the upgraded turret of the T-80UD, which includes the 'Agat' sight and stabilization system. Developed as a cost-effective option for operators with limited budgets needing to improve their existing tank fleets, the T-72AG is a modernized version of the T-72M tank, which was widely exported and license-built by several countries. It was created by the Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau (KMDB) in Ukraine and first presented in 1997 at the IDEX exhibition in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Despite efforts to market the T-72AG, it did not receive any international orders. After failing to achieve commercial success, the T-72AG was integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces. It was deployed in the Donbass region in 2014 to support Ukrainian units during intense fighting. In February 2022, during the Russian assault on the Gostomel airfield, the tank was captured by Russian airborne forces. This capture was reported by various media outlets, highlighting its rarity within the Ukrainian military inventory. In 2024, the T-72AG was displayed at the Exhibition of Special Military Operation Trophies at Victory Park in Moscow. The T-72AG is a modernized version of the T-72M tank, which was widely exported and license-built by several countries. (Picture source: Russian social media) Weighing 45.5 tons, the T-72AG is heavier than the original T-72, which weighs 41.5 tons. It includes enhancements such as a new 6TD-series diesel engine, replacing the original engine, which had performance limitations in high-temperature conditions. The 6TD engine series, developed for the T-80UD and Oplot main battle tanks, comes in two versions: the 6TD-1, which provides 1,000 horsepower, and the 6TD-2, which offers 1,200 horsepower. These engines are designed to operate effectively in desert conditions at ambient temperatures of up to 55 degrees Celsius. Additional mobility enhancements include a transmission that increases reverse speed and allows for on-the-spot pivoting, enabling the tank to reach a maximum road speed of 65 km/h, or 75 km/h with a high-speed gearbox. The T-72AG retains the original 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore gun but can be upgraded to the Ukrainian KBA1 gun, which improves accuracy and reliability. The tank also features a remote-controlled 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun mounted on the commander's cupola, allowing targets to be engaged without exposing the crew. The fire control system has been modernized, replacing the TPD-K1 sight with the 1G46 sight, stabilized on two axes, and incorporating a laser rangefinder and missile guidance capability. A ballistic computer with associated sensors further enhances firing accuracy, whether the tank is moving or stationary. After failing to achieve commercial success, the T-72AG was deployed by the Ukrainian armed forces in the Donbass region in 2014 to support Ukrainian units during intense fighting. (Picture source: Militarnyi) For night operations, the T-72AG can be fitted with the TPN-4E system or an optional thermal camera, enabling effective operation in total darkness, smoke, or fog. The tank's protection has been augmented with additional armor modules and 'Nozh' explosive reactive armor (ERA), which strengthens its resistance against shaped charges and armor-piercing projectiles. Additional modifications to the T-72AG include tactical mobility enhancements such as a satellite navigation system and an upgraded transmission designed to provide increased reverse speed and pivoting movement. The tank's protection is further improved with additional armor modules, reactive armor on the hull and turret, side screens with reactive armor on the front part of the hull, and a collective protection system designed to shield the crew from weapons of mass destruction. An optional 'Varta' optoelectronic countermeasure system may also be installed.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-deploys-rare-ukrainian-t-72ag-tank-in-northern-strike-24-exercise	2024-09-17T08:34:11-07:00	
Is North Korea Preparing to Launch Its First Advanced Airborne Early Warning Aircraft?	According to a report published by the IISS on September 16, 2024, satellite imagery suggests that North Korea is making progress in modifying a heavy transport aircraft, likely intended to become the country's first advanced Airborne Early Warning (AEW) platform. However, Pyongyang faces technical challenges in its pursuit to deploy a credible AEW aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The conversion work is being carried out on one of three Ilyushin Il-76 Candid aircraft delivered by Russia in the early 1990s, currently based at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. (Picture source: IISS) The conversion work is being carried out on one of three Ilyushin Il-76 Candid aircraft delivered by Russia in the early 1990s, currently based at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. Officially operated by the national airline, Air Koryo, these aircraft are used in parachute drills and can be temporarily camouflaged, indicating their potential availability for military use.In late 2023, one of the aircraft was moved to a separate maintenance area at the airport, surrounded by new fencing. This enhanced security, followed by the appearance of a covered structure on the fuselage, suggested a special modification of the aircraft. A plausible option is that the plane is being converted for an AEW role or, at the very least, serving as a testbed for an AEW radar. The size and positioning of the observed mounting points are consistent with other Il-76 AEW conversions, such as those conducted by Russia (A-50U Mainstay and A-100), China (KJ-2000), and Iraq (Adnan-2).Until recently, these mounting points were hidden in satellite imagery, keeping the project secret, even by North Korean standards. However, satellite images from September 8, 2024, revealed modifications, highlighting two converging vertical struts compatible with a radar dome installation.Additional imagery also showed ventral strakes added to the lower rear fuselage, visible after security screens were placed around this area in August. These strakes are a common feature on other Il-76 AEW conversions, intended to improve flight performance by counteracting the effects of the large radar dome.On September 3, the Il-76 was briefly moved outside the fenced area to a nearby taxiway, possibly to run engine tests for the first time this year. Open access panels on all four engines suggest maintenance checks were carried out. More significant is the appearance of a new tent-like structure within the fenced area, likely intended to house the radar dome. With a size of around 130 square meters, its height and location imply that the aircraft was moved to allow for the future installation of the radar dome. While these developments indicate that Pyongyang aims to establish an AEW system, the imminent physical integration of the radar dome would serve as near-definitive confirmation of these ambitions. An AEW aircraft with reasonable surveillance capabilities would be a valuable addition to North Korea's existing network of ground-based radars, which still largely rely on outdated Soviet systems despite some Chinese equipment and locally produced mobile air-defense radars.North Korea’s ground-based radars also face the challenge of mountainous terrain covering two-thirds of the peninsula. An AEW aircraft's 'look-down' capability would mitigate some of the difficulties posed by the terrain and ground-clutter, allowing for the tracking of low-flying aircraft and cruise missiles.Pyongyang’s ambition to deploy an AEW aircraft depends on access to a suitable long-range radar system. Existing ground-based systems are not compact enough to be adapted for an airborne role, posing a significant technical challenge. It remains unclear whether North Korea is developing such a system domestically or relying on external assistance, potentially linked to its renewed cooperation with Russia.Although the Il-76 airframe offers a solid basis for conversion, it could also present challenges for North Korea's relatively limited aviation industry. A design flaw could be catastrophic, as illustrated by Iraq’s attempt to convert an Il-76 to an AEW role in the late 1980s, which reportedly suffered in-flight structural failure, causing the radar dish to break off.Converting a single Il-76 would not provide permanent AEW coverage, and converting the remaining two aircraft would compromise North Korea's only heavy-lift transport capability. The extent to which this aircraft could function as a simple radar platform, without onboard radar data exploitation or airborne command and control, remains unknown. Effective real-time command and control requires air-to-air datalinks between the AEW platform and combat aircraft. It is uncertain if North Korea’s relatively modern MiG-29 Fulcrums were equipped for this at the time of delivery, or if it would be feasible to retrofit older generations of fighters that comprise most of North Korea’s fleet. North Korea may initially rely on airborne radar data being transmitted to ground stations.Much about North Korea’s Il-76 modification program remains uncertain. However, the regime’s ambitions in terms of military capabilities are considerable, and the country has previously demonstrated its ability to surprise with unexpected developments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/is-north-korea-preparing-to-launch-its-first-advanced-airborne-early-warning-aircraft	2024-09-17T07:43:49-07:00	
Brazilian Air Force considers Indian Tejas fighters to replace American F-5s	As reported by Times Now on September 11, 2024, Brazilian Air Force Commander, Lieutenant Brigadier Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno, met with Indian defense officials, including Air Chief Marshal V.R. Chaudhari and Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi. The discussions covered various topics, including the possible procurement of India's indigenously developed Tejas Light Combat Aircraft, Brazil's Embraer C-390 Millennium medium transport aircraft, and opportunities for collaboration on helicopters, drones, and space satellites.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Tejas's first flight took place in 2001, and it was inducted into operational service in 2016, following several years of development and testing. (Picture source: HAL) During these talks, Lieutenant Brigadier Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno confirmed that Brazil is considering the Tejas fighter aircraft as one option to replace its aging Northrop F-5 fleet, which is expected to be retired after 2030. Presently, the Brazilian Air Force operates the F-5 and the Gripen-E fighter jets. Damasceno mentioned that, in line with Brazilian regulations, the air force intends to maintain a fleet of no fewer than two and no more than three types of fighter aircraft. As the F-5 is phased out, the Tejas could potentially serve as the second or third aircraft type alongside the Gripen-E. He stated, 'We will need maybe two more kinds as the F-5 goes. So, while the Gripen remains, the Tejas is one of the options for our second or third fighter plane.' The Tejas aircraft, part of India's Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) program, was initiated in the early 1980s to develop a new fighter jet to replace the Indian Air Force's aging fleet of MiG-21s. The project officially began in 1984 when the Indian government set up the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to manage the development, with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) serving as the primary contractor. The program faced multiple technological challenges, including the development of a digital fly-by-wire flight control system and an indigenous multi-mode radar. The Tejas's first flight took place in 2001, and it was inducted into operational service in 2016, following several years of development and testing. The Tejas, part of India's Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) program, was initiated in the early 1980s to develop a new fighter jet to replace the Indian Air Force's aging fleet of MiG-21s. (Picture source: HAL) The Tejas has several variants, each with distinct capabilities. The Tejas Mk1, the initial production model, features a GE F404-IN20 engine, a mechanically scanned radar, and a basic electronic warfare (EW) suite. The improved Tejas Mk1A, approved for acquisition in 2021, includes an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an advanced EW suite, and other enhancements, such as a self-protection jammer and an onboard oxygen-generating system (OBOGS). The Tejas Mk2, planned for future production, is expected to have a more powerful GE F414-INS6 engine, a larger airframe, and enhanced avionics, allowing it to carry more advanced weaponry and achieve better performance. Additionally, there is a naval version of the Tejas designed for operations from aircraft carriers, equipped with a reinforced structure and specialized features like arrestor hooks and leading-edge vortex controllers (LEVCONs). The Tejas is a single-engine, multi-role fighter aircraft with a delta-wing design powered by the GE F404-GE-IN20 engine in its Mk1 variant and has a maximum speed of Mach 1.8 for the Mk1A. The aircraft includes nine external hardpoints to carry a range of weapons and equipment, such as air-to-air missiles (Astra, ASRAAM), air-to-surface missiles (BrahMos, Kristal), and various bombs, including laser-guided munitions. The Tejas Mk1A is equipped with the Elta EL/M-2032 multimode radar, contributing to its capabilities in different combat scenarios, including air defense, interception, ground attack, and anti-ship operations.

(Picture source: Indian Air Force) The discussions also focused on Brazil's interest in helicopters, with the Brazilian Air Force looking to add up to 24 new helicopters to its existing fleet of seven squadrons, each consisting of 12 helicopters. The new helicopters are intended to enhance operational capabilities, including in the Amazon region and for flood relief missions. Indian helicopters, such as the Dhruv and Prachand, manufactured by HAL, are among the options being considered. In addition to the interest in the Tejas fighter and helicopters, the Brazilian side presented the Embraer C-390 Millennium medium transport aircraft as a potential alternative to the American C-130. Damasceno noted that the C-390 has been in service for five years and has accumulated 15,000 flight hours, with a reported serviceability rate of over 97 percent. According to Damasceno, the C-390 is faster and can carry a load comparable to that of the C-130. To align with India’s 'Make in India' policy, Embraer has signed two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with the Indian company Mahindra to explore possibilities for manufacturing the C-390 in India for both domestic use and export. The F-5EM is a modernized version of the Northrop F-5 fighter jet used by the Brazilian Air Force, with updated avionics, radar, and weapons systems.

Pułaski, part of the 3rd Flotilla of Ships, is currently participating in the multinational naval exercise Northern Coasts 2024 (NoCo-24), organized by the German Navy. The exercise takes place in the western part of the Baltic Sea and in the Denmark Strait, and brings together naval forces from different countries.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Polish Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate ORP Gen. K. Pulaski. (Picture source: German Navy) ORP Gen. K. Pułaski’s crew has assumed command of one of the task groups in the exercise. Their mission involves conducting defensive operations alongside Lithuanian and German vessels, with a focus on countering submarines, aircraft, and surface threats. Additionally, the group will engage in mine warfare, including clearing pathways through minefields. About the naval exercise Initiated by the German Navy in 2007, the exercise has grown to become a significant fixture in the calendars of many NATO members and partner countries. Throughout the years, Northern Coasts has seen the involvement of numerous ships from different countries. For instance, the German frigate FGS Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has frequently participated, serving as a flagship in several iterations of the exercise. The Swedish corvette HSwMS Visby, known for its stealth capabilities, has also been a regular participant, showcasing Sweden's advanced naval technology. From Denmark, the HDMS Absalon, a flexible support ship, has joined the exercise. Participants engage in complex tasks such as anti-submarine warfare, where ships like the Polish submarine ORP Orzeł play a crucial role in testing the anti-submarine capabilities of surface vessels. Mine countermeasure operations are conducted to ensure safe passage in waters that could be contaminated with naval mines, with ships like the Finnish mine-layer FNS Uusimaa contributing their expertise. Air defense is another critical component of Northern Coasts. Naval ships coordinate with air units to protect against aerial threats, and this coordination is exemplified by the integration of assets like the Dutch air-defense frigate HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën. Amphibious operations are also a focus, with marines and naval infantry from various countries practicing beach landings and coastal assaults, often supported by vessels such as the United States' dock landing ship USS Oak Hill.

ITS Cavour: Italian aircraft carrier with advanced Aster 15 missile system docks in Jakarta	According to information published by Indomiliter on September 17, 2024, the Italian Navy's flagship, the aircraft carrier ITS Cavour, has made a visit to Jakarta, docking at Tanjung Priok Port.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Italian Navy's aircraft carrier Cavour. (Picture source: Dvids) Amid its structure and the presence of stealth F-35B Lightning II fighter jets parked on the main deck, one of the carrier's standout features is its air defense system, which rivals that of a modern frigate. Despite often being escorted by frigates during deployments, the 30,000-ton ITS Cavour is equipped with its own medium-range air defense capability, featuring the Aster 15 missile system, which significantly enhances its defensive posture. Unlike basic short-range systems like MANPADS, the Aster 15 offers a comprehensive medium-range solution, providing protection against a wide range of aerial threats. The ITS Cavour is outfitted with 32 Aster 15 missile launchers produced by MBDA Missile Systems. These are distributed across 16 launchers on the right side of the hull and another 16 toward the rear left side of the deck. The Aster 15 has an operational range of 30 to 35 kilometers and can intercept targets at altitudes of up to 25 kilometers, reaching speeds of Mach 3, or roughly 3,700 km/h. Its vertical launch system (VLS) allows for rapid deployment, offering an optimal response to a variety of aerial threats. One of the advantages of ITS Cavour, compared to conventional warships like frigates or corvettes, is its ability to reload its VLS system using a crane on board. This is crucial given the Aster 15 missile’s size—each weighing 310 kilograms, with a length of 4.2 meters and a diameter of 180 millimeters—making manual reloading, as done with smaller systems like the MANPADS, impractical. Complementing its missile system, ITS Cavour is also armed with two OTO Melara 76/62 mm Strales guns and three OTO Melara 25/80 guns fitted with Oerlikon KBA 25 mm cannons for additional close-in defense. ITS Cavour is not the only carrier equipped with the Aster 15 missile system; France’s Charles de Gaulle carrier also uses this advanced air defense technology.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/its-cavour-italian-aircraft-carrier-with-advanced-aster-15-missile-system-docks-in-jakarta	2024-09-17T05:44:20-07:00	
SAAB Delivers Next-Generation TAIPAN Artillery Hunting Radars to British Army for enhanced Counter-Battery Fire	On September 17, 2024, Saab announced the successful delivery and acceptance of five next-generation Arthur systems, named TAIPAN by the British Army. These state-of-the-art artillery locating radars provide enhanced detection and threat location capabilities, strengthening the UK's counter-battery capacity for the future.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link SAAB TAIPAN Artillery Hunting Radar (Picture source: SAAB) The TAIPAN systems replace the MAMBA radars, the previous generation of Arthur radars, and are now in service with the 5th Regiment Royal Artillery. Developed by Saab, these new radars offer the British Army rapid deployment and redeployment capabilities, increased operational mobility, and formidable accuracy in counter-battery operations. Leveraging Saab's digital antenna technology, TAIPAN radars can detect and locate an increased number of targets over greater distances while minimizing electronic signatures. This capability is crucial for survival in increasingly complex electronic warfare environments. Officially accepted by the Royal Artillery during a ceremony at Larkhill Camp on June 28, the TAIPAN radars mark a new milestone in the modernization of British defense systems. Andy Fraser, Managing Director of Saab UK, expressed his pride at the delivery: 'We are immensely proud to support the British Army with our state-of-the-art TAIPAN systems. Our relationship with the Army and the Arthur system builds on years of experience, extending back through service in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Saab team looks forward to continuing this support for the UK, which has become the first user of both the current and next-generation Arthur systems.' Lieutenant General Sir Andrew Gregory KBE CB, Master Gunner St James’s Park, also praised Saab's work: 'Saab is our key partner for both MAMBA and now TAIPAN. What this company has provided and continues to deliver to our Armed Forces is impressive. MAMBA has more than proved its worth, and TAIPAN represents a real change in capability.' ARTHUR, an acronym for Artillery Hunting Radar, is a mobile weapon-locating radar system developed by Saab Bofors Dynamics and Ericsson Microwave Systems in Sweden. This radar is designed to detect and track incoming artillery and rocket fire, allowing for the determination of their point of origin for counter-battery operations. Operating in the 5.4-5.9 GHz frequency band (C band, typically used for long-distance radio telecommunications), the ARTHUR system can locate guns, mortars, and rocket launchers at a distance of up to 50 km. It has a circular error probable (CEP) of only 0.35% of the range, ensuring exceptional accuracy. The radar uses an active electronically scanned array (AESA) to locate projectiles in three dimensions, enabling it to operate in a 'track and scan' mode. It can simultaneously handle more than 100 targets and also provides air surveillance information to support air defense units. The ARTHUR system has been adopted by several armies around the world, including those of Sweden, Norway, the UK, Italy, and Canada. Radars of this type are particularly valuable in modern asymmetric warfare scenarios, where detecting and rapidly responding to enemy artillery fire is crucial. As part of its strategy to expand its global industrial base outside Sweden, Saab plans to support the maintenance and additional work for the TAIPAN radars from its Radar Centre of Excellence in Fareham, UK. Beyond the UK, the ARTHUR system is already in service in 12 other countries, including six NATO members, as well as South Korea. With the introduction of the TAIPAN systems, Saab significantly strengthens the British Army's ability to detect and respond to artillery threats, while consolidating its position as a leading provider of advanced radar systems worldwide.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/saab-delivers-next-generation-taipan-artillery-hunting-radars-to-british-army-for-enhanced-counter-battery-fire	2024-09-17T04:59:46-07:00

They offer a 24-hour endurance with a range of about 150 km.The Bayraktar TB2, developed and manufactured by the Turkish company Baykar, entered production in 2014 and has since been acquired by several countries, including Türkiye, Ukraine, Qatar, Libya, and Azerbaijan, with over 110 platforms currently in service in Türkiye alone. The TB2 is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) drone capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, as well as armed attacks. It has a line-of-sight (LOS) communication range, an endurance of up to 27 hours, and an operational altitude of 18,000 feet, with a maximum service ceiling of 27,000 feet.Equipped with advanced features such as fully autonomous take-off and landing, automatic flight control with a triple-redundant autopilot system, and a 150 kg payload capacity, the Bayraktar TB2 can carry four laser-guided smart munitions, including Roketsan MAM-L and MAM-C. It allows for precision strikes using an onboard laser pointer for target acquisition. The TB2 has proven its combat effectiveness in operations in Syria, Libya, and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, playing a crucial role in neutralizing various air defense systems, radars, and armored vehicles.These drones gained significant attention during the conflict in Ukraine, where they were used by Ukrainian forces. Additionally, Kosovo ordered a dozen units in 2023, citing ongoing tensions with Serbia.Meanwhile, the European Union continues to oversee the EUFOR Althea mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure compliance with the Dayton Accords and prevent any resurgence of conflict. Despite this international presence, internal tensions persist, fueled by foreign influence and the ambitions of certain factions.The acquisition of Bayraktar TB-2 drones by Bosnia and Herzegovina reflects a desire to strengthen its defense capabilities and uphold its sovereignty in the face of regional challenges. This decision also signals a strategic rapprochement between Sarajevo and Ankara in military cooperation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/bosnia-and-herzegovina-orders-bayraktar-tb-2-drones-from-tuerkiye	2024-09-17T03:10:08-07:00	
Second Invincible-class submarine Invincible returns to Singapore after German launch	According to information published by the Mindef Singapore on September 13, 2024, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) celebrated the return of its Invincible-class submarine, Invincible, at a homecoming ceremony held at RSS Singapura - Changi Naval Base.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Singapore Invincible-class submarine Invincible. (Picture source: Mindef) The Invincible is the lead vessel of the Type 218SG submarine class, commissioned by the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). Designed with a focus on stealth and endurance, the Invincible employs advanced diesel-electric propulsion combined with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. This integration allows the submarine to remain submerged for prolonged periods without the need to surface or use a snorkel mast for air, thereby minimizing detection risks. The AIP system utilizes fuel-cell technology, which not only extends underwater endurance but also reduces acoustic signatures, enhancing the vessel's stealth capabilities. Such measures are crucial for evading sophisticated sonar and surveillance systems employed by potential adversaries in the region. Equipped with advanced sonar arrays and a cutting-edge combat management system, the Invincible offers superior situational awareness and target acquisition capabilities. The vessel's armament includes modern heavyweight torpedoes and the capacity to deploy naval mines, providing versatile offensive options to address a range of maritime threats. Background Given Singapore's strategic location along critical sea lanes such as the Malacca and Singapore Straits, the RSN's submarine fleet plays a crucial role in ensuring maritime security. The submarines enable Singapore to project power and monitor vast maritime domains effectively. They can conduct patrols, escort high-value assets, and respond swiftly to maritime incidents. Initially, the RSN acquired the Challenger-class submarines in the 1990s, which were formerly part of the Swedish Navy. These diesel-electric submarines served as Singapore's introduction to underwater warfare. Though older and less technologically advanced, they provided the RSN with valuable experience in submarine operations, crew training, and maintenance. Operating in the shallow and congested waters around Singapore, these submarines allowed the navy to develop doctrines and tactics suited to the region's unique maritime environment. Recognizing the need for enhanced capabilities, the RSN later incorporated the Archer-class submarines into its fleet. Also originating from Sweden, these submarines underwent significant upgrades before entering service with Singapore. Equipped with air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems, the Archer-class submarines offered increased underwater endurance and stealth, allowing them to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing. This advancement significantly improved the RSN's operational flexibility, enabling it to conduct longer and more covert missions, which is crucial for intelligence gathering and surveillance in the busy maritime corridors of Southeast Asia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/second-invincible-class-submarine-invincible-returns-to-singapore-after-german-launch	2024-09-17T03:07:47-07:00	
Japanese carrier Kaga departs for Indo-Pacific deployment and F-35B trials	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by the Japanese MoD on September 17, 2024, the helicopter carrier Kaga departed from Kure Naval Base in Hiroshima Prefecture, heading towards the waters off San Diego, California. The vessel set sail to participate in the Indo-Pacific Deployment 2024 (IPD24).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Izumo-class JS Kaga departing from Kure. (Picture source: Japanese MoD) In addition to its role in IPD24, the Kaga is scheduled to conduct shipboard operational trials of the F-35B Lightning II fighter aircraft while off the coast of San Diego. These trials aim to integrate the F-35B's short takeoff and vertical landing capabilities with the ship's operations. Background The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) is undergoing significant modernization to address emerging security challenges in the Asia-Pacific region. Central to this effort is the transformation of the JS Kaga (DDH-184), originally an Izumo-class helicopter destroyer, to operate the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Commissioned in 2017, the JS Kaga is one of two Izumo-class helicopter carriers—the largest ships in the JMSDF fleet. Initially designed for anti-submarine warfare and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, the vessel is undergoing modifications to accommodate fixed-wing aircraft. These changes involve reinforcing the flight deck to withstand the intense heat generated by F-35B engines during vertical take-offs and landings, as well as altering internal layouts to support the new aircraft. The F-35B is the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the fifth-generation stealth multirole fighter. Integrating this aircraft onto the JS Kaga provides several strategic advantages. It enhances Japan's air power projection by extending operational reach beyond the limitations of land-based aircraft. The ability to deploy F-35Bs from the JS Kaga strengthens Japan's deterrence posture against regional threats, particularly concerning North Korea's missile program and China's maritime activities in the East and South China Seas. This combination allows for a more flexible and rapid response in various scenarios, from territorial defense to contributions in international security efforts. China has expressed concern over Japan's naval expansions, which could potentially lead to an arms race in the region. Domestically, the move raises debates regarding Japan's pacifist constitution. While the government maintains that these developments are for self-defense purposes, some domestic and regional actors view them as a shift towards a more offensive military posture.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japanese-carrier-kaga-departs-for-indo-pacific-deployment-and-f-35b-trials	2024-09-17T01:50:16-07:00

Sweden to Lead NATO Troops in Northern Finland	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} Sweden has announced its intention to take on the role of framework nation in NATO’s enhanced forward presence in Finland. This decision, welcomed by Finland’s Minister of Defence, Antti Häkkänen, marks a new phase in strengthening defense relations between the Nordic countries. Finland joined NATO in 2023, followed by Sweden in 2024, amid heightened tensions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This initiative significantly enhances the defense relationship between Finland and Sweden, now both NATO allies (Picture source: UK MoD) The Nordic region, particularly areas bordering Russia, is becoming a focal point of defense strategy, as Russia’s Northern Fleet continues to rearm on the Kola Peninsula and the Leningrad Military District aims to establish new brigades in Karelia, near Finland’s border.On September 16, the prime ministers and defense ministers of Sweden and Finland met in Stockholm, where security was a key topic of discussion. During the meeting, Sweden confirmed its commitment to lead NATO’s upcoming presence in Finland. Although the exact location of the headquarters is yet to be determined, the Lapland region is considered a likely site for this new structure. The aim is not to permanently station NATO troops in northern Finland but to establish a command structure to prepare for potential troop deployment in case of conflict.This initiative significantly enhances the defense relationship between Finland and Sweden, now both NATO allies. Together, these countries contribute to strengthening NATO's collective deterrence and defense capabilities. Finnish Defence Minister Antti Häkkänen emphasized the importance of this new partnership for the Alliance: 'Finland and Sweden are now allies. Together, we strengthen NATO and make an important contribution to the development of NATO’s collective deterrence and defense.'In the context of this cooperation, the Finnish government recently allocated an additional €67 million to address needs arising from NATO membership. Moreover, Finland and Sweden emphasized in a joint declaration the necessity of securing communications and transport infrastructure in the northern regions connecting Norway, Sweden, and Finland to ensure supply, trade, and security. Although Norway is not part of this particular initiative, Sweden and Finland plan to promote military mobility within the European Union.The joint declaration specifies that interregional EU funding will be used to improve east-west communication links. The port of Narvik, located on the coast of the Norwegian Sea, holds special significance. It serves as the starting point for Europe’s northernmost cross-border railway, which connects Kiruna, Luleå, and Haparanda in northern Sweden, facilitating the transport of goods into northern Finland via the recently reopened railway line to Tornio.Meanwhile, regional cooperation in the Nordic areas is undergoing changes. The joint declaration by the two countries highlights the role of the Council of the Baltic Sea States. However, Barents cooperation, which aimed to facilitate the integration of Russia's northern regions into international exchanges, is notably absent. Finland's Foreign Minister, Elina Valtonen, hinted earlier this summer at a possible end to this multilateral cooperation, a development that now seems increasingly likely.In summary, this new step in cooperation between Sweden and Finland reflects the Nordic countries' commitment to enhancing their presence and coordination within NATO, in a geopolitical context that is increasingly tense in Northern Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/sweden-to-lead-nato-troops-in-northern-finland	2024-09-17T01:18:25-07:00

Kennedy. (Picture source: US DoD) Recognizing the need to replace the aging Henry J. Kaiser-class oilers from the 1980s, the U.S. Navy initiated the T-AO 205 program. This program aims to enhance logistical support capabilities by commissioning a new class of oilers equipped with modern technology. In 2016, General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) was awarded the contract to design and construct the first ships of the class. The overall plan includes building up to 20 ships to meet the Navy's long-term logistical requirements. The John Lewis-class ships have a full load displacement of approximately 49,850 tons and measure 746 feet (227 meters) in length with a beam of 106 feet (32 meters). They are capable of speeds over 20 knots and are powered by a diesel-electric propulsion system, which offers improved fuel economy and reduced emissions compared to older models. Manned by civilian crews under the Military Sealift Command, these ships are integral to naval logistics. Equipped with a fuel capacity of up to 156,000 barrels, including jet fuel and marine diesel, they feature a consolidated cargo-handling system for efficient transfer of supplies. Multiple underway replenishment stations on both sides of the ship allow for simultaneous refueling and resupply operations. The double-hull design not only meets environmental regulations but also enhances safety by preventing oil spills. The primary mission of the John Lewis-class oilers is to provide logistical support during underway replenishment operations.

They are designed to refuel and resupply ships while both vessels are in motion, enhancing operational flexibility. Additionally, they can support allied vessels during combined operations, contributing to joint mission readiness and sustainability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-signs-deal-with-nassco-for-john-lewis-class-fleet-replenishment-oilers	2024-09-17T00:41:00-07:00	
Lockheed Martin Presents JASSM XR: An Extreme Range Cruise Missile	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} On September 16, 2024, during the Air, Space & Cyber Conference of the Air & Space Forces Association, Lockheed Martin unveiled the latest version of its AGM-158 JASSM cruise missile, known as the JASSM XR (eXtreme Range). This new missile is designed to maintain stealth and precision strike capabilities while offering a range superior to the current JASSM-ER.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The JASSM XR retains the same 1,000-pound (453.6 kg) warhead as the JASSM-ER and structural changes were made based on the JASSM-ER and LRASM models (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) Until now, three versions existed: the AGM-158A JASSM, the baseline air-to-surface version; the AGM-158B JASSM-ER, the extended-range air-to-surface version; and the AGM-158C LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile), an anti-ship variant deployable in air-to-sea or sea-to-sea operations via Mk 41 VLS vertical launch cells.The AGM-158 XR aims to push the boundaries of range even further. While technical details remain limited, Michael Rothstein, Vice President for Strategy and Requirements at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, stated, 'I would say the range is significantly different. It's not minor. It's not on the edges.' As a reminder, the U.S. Air Force reports that the JASSM-ER has a range exceeding 500 nautical miles, or more than 926 kilometers.Jon Hill, Vice President and General Manager of Air Dominance and Strike Weapons at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, explained that the JASSM XR is designed to be the next iteration of the JASSM-D and LRASM-C3, which are currently contracted with the Air Force and Navy. Hill emphasized that the XR leverages existing production lines and processes: 'We think of the XR as an extreme-range missile. What it really does is extend the existing JASSM and LRASM family to allow us to carry more fuel, which gives us the range we need and the warfighters require.'The JASSM XR retains the same 1,000-pound (453.6 kg) warhead as the JASSM-ER. Structural changes were made based on the JASSM-ER and LRASM models. The missile is longer, allowing it to carry more fuel, thereby increasing its range. Other potential enhancements may include the use of lighter alloys, improved aerodynamics, a redesigned structure, modified fins, or a more efficient propulsion system. Rothstein confirmed that some physical modifications were necessary to enhance range, including lengthening the structure to accommodate more fuel. Despite these changes, the goal was to reuse as much technology and components from current missile production as possible.Despite these modifications, the missile maintains its stealth and precision characteristics. The extended range allows launch crews to deploy the JASSM XR from a greater distance, enabling strikes on deeper targets while remaining out of reach of enemy air defense systems. However, the increase in total missile weight prevents certain combat aircraft, such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, from carrying it. In contrast, the F/A-18, likely in its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet version, is already compatible. The F-35 Lightning II is also expected to be compatible in the near future, along with the F-15 Eagle. While there is no specific information regarding strategic bombers, Lockheed Martin's presentation video frequently features the B-1B Lancer.Additionally, the B-52H Stratofortress’s ample carrying capacity should pose no issue, and the JASSM XR is likely to be integrated into the munitions bay of the B-2A Spirit and B-21 Raider stealth bombers of the U.S. Air Force.Lockheed Martin also sought to optimize development costs by utilizing existing JASSM and LRASM production lines and designs. The missile's modular nature hints at the possibility of navalization or anti-ship use. While the LRASM can be launched from the Mk 41 VLS cells on U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, it remains to be seen if the JASSM XR will also be integrated into these systems.Questions remain about the potential launch capability from transport aircraft. The JASSM and JASSM-ER can be loaded onto a standard pallet structure known as the Rapid Dragon. Once the aircraft’s bay opens, the pallet is ejected using a parachute, and the missiles initiate their engines during free fall. A heavier, larger missile might require adaptations to this system or the development of an 'XR' version of Rapid Dragon.The JASSM XR is not yet in service, with the first prototype flight planned for 2025 or 2026. No orders have been placed by the U.S. Air Force or Navy, and the entire development is funded by Lockheed Martin. Nonetheless, given its capabilities, this new missile could play a significant role in countering anti-access and area-denial systems, particularly those deployed by China in the South China Sea.During the #AFA2024 conference, Jon Hill explained that the AGM-158 XR is being proactively developed to meet future U.S. requirements, succeeding the AGM-158D JASSM-ER and AGM-158C LRASM. Details remain limited, apart from the confirmation of an elongated fuselage. The fact that the JASSM XR cannot be carried by the F-16, due to its weight exceeding the F-16's internal station capacity of 4,500 pounds, underscores the missile’s increased mass.According to Rothstein, some engineering changes were implemented, involving minor but clever internal structural modifications to achieve the missile's elongation. 'It's not just a matter of stretching,' he added, 'there are other structural changes that we will make to make this happen. But in the macro sense, these are not major modifications beyond the stretching.'Lockheed Martin plans to conduct a flight test with a prototype within the next 12 to 24 months, with initial operational capability anticipated in the coming years. The JASSM XR is the third proposed derivative of the JASSM to be named 'JASSM-XR.' The original proposal involved lengthening the fuselage from 4.2 to 6.3 meters, integrating an upgraded turbofan, and a larger warhead. If the current model retains the existing 450 kg WDU-42/B warhead, it could potentially achieve a range exceeding 2,000 km.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/lockheed-martin-presents-jassm-xr-an-extreme-range-cruise-missile	2024-09-17T00:31:57-07:00

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. In recent years, China has ramped up military exercises and incursions near Taiwan's airspace and territorial waters, raising international concerns about the possibility of an armed conflict. The Taiwanese government has been actively seeking support from allies to strengthen its defense preparedness. The United States maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, balancing its recognition of the People's Republic of China with commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The reported involvement of SEAL Team 6 suggests a potential shift toward a more proactive stance in supporting Taiwan's security. SEAL Team 6, officially known as the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), is one of the most elite units within the U.S. military. Specializing in counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and direct action missions, the team operates under a veil of secrecy. Established after the failed 1980 Iran hostage rescue attempt, SEAL Team 6 has since been at the forefront of numerous high-stakes operations, including the mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. The Navy SEALs—short for Sea, Air, and Land teams—are the U.S. Navy's primary special operations force. They are trained to operate in all environments and are experts in unconventional warfare, reconnaissance, and direct action missions. The selection process for becoming a SEAL is rigorous, involving intense physical and mental training to ensure only the most capable candidates join the ranks. SEAL Team 6 members are selected from existing SEAL teams based on exceptional performance and experience. The unit's operations are highly classified, and its members are trained in advanced tactics and technologies. Their expertise allows them to undertake the most challenging missions that are critical to national security. The involvement of SEAL Team 6 in training for Taiwan-related missions suggests a strategic shift in U.S. defense policy in the Indo-Pacific region. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. The United States, while maintaining a policy of strategic ambiguity, is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The deployment of elite forces like SEAL Team 6 indicates a strengthening of this commitment. While officials from the U.S. Department of Defense have not publicly confirmed the deployment or specific training activities of SEAL Team 6 related to Taiwan, the news has already elicited reactions from international observers. Analysts warn that such actions could further strain U.S.-China relations and potentially destabilize the broader Indo-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-navy-seal-team-6-special-forces-prepares-to-support-taiwan-amid-escalating-china-tensions	2024-09-16T10:22:36-07:00

Russian nuclear submarines complete 4,000-Mile under-Ice Arctic transit	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by Tass on September 16, 2024, two Russian nuclear-powered submarines, Project 955A Borei-A Imperator Alexander III and Project 885M Yasen-M Krasnoyarsk, recently completed an under-ice transit in the Arctic, navigating through six Arctic seas under challenging ice conditions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Project 955A Borei-A submarine Imperator Alexander III. (Picture source: Tass) The Yasen-M (Project 885M) and Borei-A (Project 955A) classes are both pivotal to Russia’s naval modernization, but they serve markedly different operational roles, reflecting the distinct requirements of tactical and strategic warfare. The Yasen-M, a nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSGN), is equipped to carry a diverse payload of long-range cruise missiles, including the Kalibr and Oniks, and has been upgraded to incorporate the Zircon hypersonic missile. This configuration enables it to strike a variety of targets—land, sea, and even submarines—at considerable distances. It can carry between 24 and 40 missiles, with its UKSK VLS launch system designed for a broad array of mission profiles. These attack submarines possess 10 torpedo tubes (533mm), augmenting their close-quarters combat capability against other submarines and surface ships. A major focus of the Yasen-M is its stealth technology. Equipped with advanced sonar systems like the MGK-600 Irtysh-Amfora, the submarine features a spherical bow array that enhances detection capabilities while maintaining minimal noise levels. The hull is constructed primarily from low-magnetic steel, and its noise-reduction techniques, including a modern fourth-generation nuclear reactor, minimize acoustic signatures. Reports suggest the submarine can operate at around 20 to 28 knots in 'silent mode,' a feature that rivals some of the quietest submarines in the world, such as the U.S. Virginia-class. Moreover, the reactor on the Yasen-M is designed to run for 25-30 years without refueling. The Borei-A class is a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), designed for strategic nuclear deterrence. Unlike the Yasen-M's tactical focus, the Borei-A is built to provide Russia with a secure second-strike capability, ensuring retaliatory potential in the event of nuclear conflict. Each Borei-A carries 16 Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles (SLBMs), with each missile capable of carrying 6-10 warheads, providing a substantial nuclear payload that can be launched from remote underwater positions, safeguarding the submarine from immediate detection. The Borei-A’s design emphasizes stealth as well, but with a focus on reducing broad-spectrum noise through its pump-jet propulsion system. This feature, a first for Russian submarines, significantly lowers acoustic signatures, allowing it to operate more quietly than previous generations. This class is reputed to be five times quieter than the Akula-class and approximately twice as stealthy as the Virginia-class, although issues with its hydraulic pumps have reportedly affected its long-term noise reduction capabilities. Nonetheless, it is among the quietest SSBNs in the Russian arsenal, designed to evade detection by enemy sonar systems and maintain readiness in the event of a nuclear crisis.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-nuclear-submarines-complete-4-000-mile-under-ice-arctic-transit	2024-09-16T04:25:44-07:00

The deal also strengthens defense ties between Qatar and Germany, potentially paving the way for future military technology and training collaborations. Before the Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers are handed over to Ukraine, they will undergo a comprehensive upgrade process in Germany. This refurbishment is expected to include technical overhauls, software updates, and modifications to meet the Ukrainian military's specific requirements. German defense contractors like KMW and Rheinmetall will likely oversee the process to ensure the equipment is delivered in optimal condition. The Panzerhaubitze 2000 has been a mainstay in modern artillery since its introduction in the late 1990s. Known for its rapid-fire capability and long-range precision, it has been utilized by several NATO countries. Qatar originally purchased 24 units to enhance its artillery forces. The decision to part with half of its inventory suggests a strategic trade-off to acquire more advanced systems like the RCH 155. Germany's role in both supplying Qatar with new artillery systems and upgrading the howitzers for Ukraine underscores its active involvement in international defense matters. This dual engagement reflects Germany's strategic interests and its stance on supporting Ukraine. Qatar has generally maintained a neutral stance regarding the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, often advocating for diplomatic solutions and peaceful dialogue. Qatar's foreign policy traditionally emphasizes mediation and conflict resolution. The nation has engaged in various diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and beyond but has not publicly aligned itself militarily in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Any significant shift in Qatar's stance, especially involving military support, would likely be accompanied by official statements and widespread media coverage. If confirmed, Qatar's decision to purchase RCH 155 artillery systems and supply Ukraine with half of its PzH 2000 howitzers represents a noteworthy development in international efforts to support Ukraine. The move not only aids Ukraine's military capabilities but also reflects the complex web of global alliances and defense strategies influencing the region's security landscape.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-qatar-to-supply-half-its-pzh-2000-howitzers-to-ukraine-after-buying-german-rch-155-8x8-howitzers	2024-09-16T04:16:07-07:00

US Navy commissions USS New Jersey SSN 796 latest Virginia-class submarine	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by the US DoD on September 14, 2024, the Navy commissioned its newest Virginia-class fast-attack submarine, USS New Jersey (SSN 796), in a ceremony at Naval Weapons Station Earle in Middletown, New Jersey.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Block IV Virginia-class submarine USS New Jersey. (Picture source: US DoD) The Block IV Virginia-class submarines represent a key evolution in the U.S. Navy's fast-attack submarine fleet, balancing advanced capabilities with cost-saving innovations. These submarines, like others in the Virginia class, are designed for a wide range of missions, including anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, and launching land-attack cruise missiles. They are replacing older Los Angeles-class submarines as the backbone of U.S. naval operations. One of the primary improvements in Block IV submarines is a significant reduction in maintenance requirements. Unlike earlier blocks, Block IV submarines are designed for fewer and shorter maintenance periods over their service lives. This change allows them to conduct more deployments—up to 15, compared to 14 for previous versions—enhancing their operational availability by about 25%. This was achieved through better component durability and upgrades that target maintenance efficiency, reducing overall life-cycle costs. Block IV subs retain the advanced systems seen in previous variants, including the use of photonics masts instead of traditional periscopes and the integration of sophisticated sonar systems. These vessels are equipped with Mark 48 advanced torpedoes and Tomahawk missiles, with the ability to launch them through vertical payload tubes. They also have enhanced capabilities for special operations, with a lock-out chamber to deploy SEAL teams. The overall design of Block IV maintains the 377-foot hull length, with a displacement of 7,835 tons and speeds exceeding 25 knots. Powered by a nuclear reactor, they can remain submerged for extended periods without the need to resurface. These submarines are also optimized for operations in shallow waters. Their construction is split between two shipyards—General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries—under a cooperative arrangement that helps ensure continuous production. This industrial strategy not only helps maintain shipbuilding capacity but also guards against disruptions in case one facility becomes inoperable.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-commissions-uss-new-jersey-ssn-796-latest-virginia-class-submarine	2024-09-16T01:47:23-07:00

The test, conducted as a static fire, took place at the Northrop Grumman Allegany Ballistics Laboratory in West Virginia. This step validated the concept and provided data to support digital models and simulations, confirming the SRM's maturity and performance.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hypersonic refers to aerial objects, such as aircraft, missiles, rockets, or spacecraft, that can exceed Mach 5, a speed of nearly 4,000 miles per hour (6,437 km/h) (Picture source: RTX) The test demonstrated controlled end-burning technology, suitable for hypersonic applications. Both companies emphasized the importance of this milestone in proving the capability of the new rocket motor. Colin Whelan, president of Advanced Technology at Raytheon, stated that industry collaboration had made it possible to demonstrate the feasibility of producing and meeting the requirements for long-range fires. Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have a long history of collaboration in the development of hypersonic systems. Both companies are actively investing in rocket motor testing to ensure the stability and maturity of their designs, which is necessary to deliver this capability on an accelerated timeline. Hypersonic refers to aerial objects, such as aircraft, missiles, rockets, or spacecraft, that can exceed Mach 5, a speed of nearly 4,000 miles per hour (6,437 km/h). The Mach number indicates how many times the object's speed surpasses that of sound. The United States, Russia, and China are currently testing hypersonic technologies, raising concerns about a global arms race and the potential obsolescence of current defense systems. Although some 'hypersonic' weapons are deployable today, their actual applicability remains a topic of debate. In the context of the Ukraine conflict, Russian forces have used their own hypersonic missiles, such as the Kinzhal. This missile exists in both cruise missile and air-launched ballistic missile forms. Both versions have been used in some of the heaviest strikes conducted by Russian forces against Ukraine. According to Frank DeMauro, vice president of Weapon Systems at Northrop Grumman, this end-burning rocket motor test is significant because it offers extended range compared to conventional rocket motors. The collaboration between Raytheon and Northrop Grumman comes at a time when discussions about long-range missiles continue to dominate global debates, particularly as Ukraine seeks Western nations' approval to use such missiles against Russian military installations deep inside Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently emphasized that lifting restrictions on the use of long-range weapons could be decisive in the conflict. 'If we are allowed to use these weapons, we should be able to employ them as needed to strike military targets,' he stated. He further added that removing restrictions without providing the necessary missiles would avoid making a real decision on using these specific weapons. Due to these constraints, Ukrainian forces have had to compensate for their lack of deep-strike capability by carrying out an incursion into Russia's Kursk region. This situation highlights the importance of long-range weapons in modern warfare and the challenges surrounding their use and deployment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/raytheon-and-northrop-grumman-test-new-long-range-solid-rocket-motor	2024-09-16T01:20:57-07:00

The BMPT's combination of autocannons, anti-tank missiles, machine guns, and grenade launchers made it highly effective in neutralizing infantry positions, engaging light armored vehicles, and providing suppressive fire for advancing tank units. However, its actual performance in Ukraine has been met with mixed results. While the BMPT's firepower and armor were considered assets in specific engagements, there were reports that the vehicle was not used in large numbers or in an optimal role. One of the reasons for this is that the Russian military might not have fully integrated the BMPT into their combined arms strategy. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has shown that modern battlefield environments, especially in urban settings, are extremely lethal for armored vehicles, even with support vehicles like the BMPT present. There have also been challenges with Russian logistics and the high intensity of combat, which have limited the BMPT's widespread use. Some analysts suggest that while the BMPT performed well in specific roles, it did not dramatically change the overall effectiveness of Russian armored units in Ukraine. Nevertheless, its deployment highlighted the importance of dedicated armored support vehicles in modern warfare, especially in urban or asymmetric environments where traditional tanks are vulnerable to mobile infantry and advanced anti-tank weapons. The BMPT Model 2017 is the current version in service with the Russian army and deployed in Ukraine. (Picture source Army Recognition Group) The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 are both Russian armored vehicles designed to support tanks and infantry in challenging combat environments, but there are several differences between the two. The BMPT Terminator 1 is based on the T-90 tank chassis, while the BMPT-72 Terminator 2 uses the older T-72 chassis. This difference in platform allows the BMPT-72 to be more cost-effective for countries that have a surplus of T-72 tanks, enabling them to convert those older tanks into BMPTs. In terms of weight, the BMPT Terminator 1, due to its T-90 base, is heavier, weighing around 48 tons. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, being based on the T-72, is slightly lighter. The armament configurations of both models are largely the same, featuring a combination of 30mm cannons, anti-tank missile launchers, and machine guns, designed for anti-infantry and anti-armor roles. The key distinction is the modernization and production flexibility of the BMPT-72, which was designed to be a more affordable upgrade solution by leveraging the widely available T-72 chassis, while the original BMPT Terminator 1 was a more specialized system built from the newer T-90 platform. Both vehicles serve a similar purpose in the battlefield, but the BMPT-72 provides a more versatile and budget-friendly option for militaries with a large inventory of older tanks. The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 both have robust armor and powerful armament designed for urban warfare and supporting tanks, though there are differences between the two models. The Terminator 1, based on the T-90 chassis, benefits from the advanced armor of the T-90 tank, including Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor (ERA), which provides protection against modern anti-tank projectiles and RPGs. This makes the Terminator 1 highly resistant to a variety of battlefield threats. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, built on the older T-72 chassis, also has strong armor but does not come with the same advanced protection as standard. However, the BMPT-72 can be equipped with modern ERA upgrades to enhance its survivability. In terms of armament, both vehicles are equipped with a formidable array of weapons designed to engage multiple types of targets, including infantry, light vehicles, and even aircraft. The BMPT Terminator 1 is armed with two 30mm 2A42 autocannons. These autocannons are capable of firing both armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds, making them versatile against various threats. Additionally, the Terminator 1 carries four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which can penetrate heavy armor and engage tanks or bunkers from long distances. The BMPT Terminator 1 is the first version in the BMPT family.

Rafael CEO confirms deployment of Iron Beam laser weapon system by Israel in 2025	According to The Nziv Report on September 12, 2024, Yoav Turgeman, CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, announced that its Iron Beam High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) will become operational with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) next year. This 100kW system is intended to be a new component of Israel's air defense system, serving as the 'final line of defense' against drones, rockets, and mortars. It is expected to enter active service by late 2025.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Iron Beam laser system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. (Picture source: Rafael) According to Rafael, the Iron Beam system can focus a laser beam with up to 100 kilowatts of power on an aerial target, destroying it within seconds. Its effective range varies depending on factors such as laser power, weather conditions, and the type of target, and it is capable of addressing short- and medium-range threats up to 7 kilometers away. The Iron Beam system has undergone testing, including a series of tests conducted by the IDF in March 2022 that demonstrated its ability to intercept drones, mortars, and missiles. One of the key attributes of the Iron Beam is its lower cost per shot compared to conventional missile interceptors. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. The system also has an unlimited magazine, allowing for continuous use without the need for reloads, and does not produce debris from intercepted threats, reducing the risk of collateral damage. These features are relevant in the context of the ongoing conflict, where Israel has faced a shortage of Iron Dome ammunition. The Gaza war has reportedly cost the Israeli economy over $67.3 billion, according to Israeli economists. Turgeman also discussed the performance of Rafael’s Python 4 and Python 5 missiles, which have been used against drones and cruise missiles during recent Iranian attacks. He noted that the Python 4 missile, in service for four decades, continues to meet operational requirements. Rafael is also developing the 'Skysonic' system, which is intended to provide a hypersonic interception capability against hypersonic missile threats. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. (Picture source: Rafael) Rafael, which has been developing directed-energy systems for over 30 years, is working on enhancing the capabilities of the Iron Beam. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously. This development is primarily funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The Iron Beam, also known as 'Magen Or' or 'Shield of Light,' is a 100kW High Energy Laser Weapon System first unveiled at the Singapore Airshow in February 2014. It is designed to intercept a variety of aerial threats using a directed-energy approach. The Iron Beam system uses a fiber laser to destroy short-range rockets, artillery, and mortar bombs, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It operates by detecting and tracking airborne threats, either as a stand-alone system or as part of a broader air defense network. Iron Beam is one component of Israel's integrated missile defense system, which also includes Arrow 2, Arrow 3, David's Sling, and Iron Dome systems. It is intended to complement these layers by providing a directed-energy option for intercepting threats that may not be effectively managed by other interceptors. A Naval Iron Beam variant is also being developed for use on ships to protect against drone swarms and anti-ship missiles. This version, which retains the same external dimensions as the ground-based system, is expected to be operational within four to five years and is planned for deployment on Israeli Navy vessels such as the Reshef-class corvette. The Naval Iron Beam, which retains the same external dimensions as the ground-based system, is expected to be operational within four to five years and is planned for deployment on Israeli Navy vessels such as the Reshef-class corvette. (Picture source: Rafael) Further developments have included efforts to create a mobile version of the Iron Beam system. However, weight and power supply considerations have led to a focus on integrating it with existing stationary platforms. The system's ability to achieve high precision over extended distances suggests potential applications in both military and civilian contexts, particularly in defending against slow-flying drones and other aerial threats that are more vulnerable to laser-based attacks. In April 2022, experiments demonstrated the system's ability to intercept drones, rockets, mortar bombs, and antitank missiles. In response to operational needs, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced plans to deploy the Iron Beam to Israel’s southern border with the Gaza Strip to test its effectiveness in real-world conditions, including during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. The system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. (Picture source: Rafael) The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. By 2023, advancements in the technology enabled the laser to achieve energy levels of 100 kW or more, with the beam's precision focused to the diameter of a coin at distances of up to 10 kilometers. Despite its potential, the use of high-energy lasers like the Iron Beam or the British DragonFly has challenges. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds or rain can affect the beam's ability to reach its target, and the laser must remain focused on a moving target for several seconds to deliver sufficient energy to destroy it. This requirement can limit its effectiveness in countering multiple threats simultaneously, such as a barrage of rockets. Additionally, some targets could be shielded with materials resistant to laser attacks, which could reduce the system’s effectiveness. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously.

First Images of J-20A Stealth Fighter Prototype Equipped with WS-15 Engine	The development of domestic aircraft engines has long been considered a weakness of China's aerospace industry. For decades, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jets were primarily powered by engines derived from Soviet or Russian designs or produced under license. However, China's economic, industrial, and military rise has enabled its aerospace industry to advance and develop its own engines. These engines now equip the main fourth and fifth-generation combat aircraft. The most recent example is the emergence of the clearest photograph to date of a J-20A stealth fighter, equipped with the new WS-15 engine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The J-20A variant in the photograph features several improvements over previous versions, including a redesigned radome and a slightly elevated cockpit (Picture source: X Channel RupprechtDeino ) Although many specifications of the Xian WS-15 turbofan remain unknown, its development dates back to the 1990s and is directly linked to the fifth-generation J-20 fighter, which is in service with the PLA Air Force (PLAAF). Due to technological limitations in China's aerospace industry at the time, the J-20 was initially powered by Russian Saturn AL-31 engines. Later, as mass production of the 'Mighty Dragon' stealth fighter began, locally produced WS-10 engines were integrated into the aircraft, which were initially designed for fourth-generation Chengdu J-10 fighters. However, China aimed to equip its air superiority fighter with an engine capable of meeting the stealth requirements, comparable to the capabilities of the American F-22 Raptor.The Chengdu J-20, also known as the 'Mighty Dragon,' is a fifth-generation stealth fighter developed by Chengdu Aerospace Corporation for the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). Its development began in the late 1990s, with the first prototype unveiled in 2011. The aircraft entered service in 2017 and is primarily designed for air superiority, though it is also capable of conducting ground-attack missions. The J-20 stands out for its stealth characteristics, advanced avionics, and the ability to carry a mix of air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry in internal bays to maintain a low radar signature.By 2023, China is estimated to have around 150 to 200 operational J-20 fighters, making it one of the few countries with an operational fifth-generation fighter fleet, alongside the United States and Russia. The J-20's capabilities include long combat range, advanced radar systems, and enhanced maneuverability. Its development reflects China's ambition to match Western air power, particularly in contested areas like the South China Sea.These long-term efforts have resulted in the creation of the Xian WS-15 engine, which now powers more recent versions of the J-20, produced by Chengdu Aerospace Corporation. In recent months, several reports have indicated the start of production of this new turbofan engine, along with flight tests conducted with fifth-generation aircraft. The WS-15 engine requires modified air intakes to optimize airflow. In terms of power, prototypes have indicated that the engine could reach a thrust of 36,000 pounds with afterburners, with the goal of reaching 40,000 pounds (Picture source: CreativeCommons) Recently, a photograph of a J-20A (serial number 2052) equipped with WS-15 engines circulated on social media, drawing the attention of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) analysts and experts. This image, the clearest ever seen, shows the aircraft in great detail. Although the location of this test flight has not been confirmed, it is likely to have taken place at Chengdu's facilities. The J-20A variant in the photograph features several improvements over previous versions, including a redesigned radome and a slightly elevated cockpit. The fuselage also appears more spacious, which may suggest the integration of new avionics equipment and increased fuel capacity. The WS-15 engine requires modified air intakes to optimize airflow. In terms of power, prototypes have indicated that the engine could reach a thrust of 36,000 pounds with afterburners, with the goal of reaching 40,000 pounds. In comparison, the WS-10 produced thrusts ranging from 32,000 to 35,000 pounds with afterburners. It is noteworthy that while the WS-10 has been observed with thrust-vectoring nozzles, this feature has not yet been confirmed for the WS-15. If these data are accurate, the J-20A powered by the WS-15 could offer greater power than American F-22 Raptors, whose Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engines each provide 35,000 pounds of thrust. This development, while raising new questions, reflects decades of Chinese investment in the research and production of aircraft engines. Recent photographs suggest that another J-20A (serial number 2053) has been seen flying, also apparently equipped with WS-15 engines.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/first-images-of-j-20a-stealth-fighter-prototype-equipped-with-ws-15-engine	2024-09-13T00:26:59-07:00

This new system is designed to shorten maintenance times for the Vanguard fleet, which undergoes periodic Deep Maintenance Periods (DMPs) to ensure operational readiness and the integration of the latest technology. The Vanguard-class submarines play a crucial role in deterring adversaries and maintaining national security, as they remain at sea year-round to provide continuous nuclear deterrence. The refurbished dock is expected to streamline these essential maintenance processes, allowing the fleet to redeploy more efficiently. The refurbishment also coincides with the opening of Babcock’s Engineering & Skills establishment at City College Plymouth, aimed at training the next generation of engineers to support the UK's nuclear defense programs. This initiative aligns with the government’s broader commitment to strengthening the country’s long-term nuclear capabilities, including plans to build four new nuclear submarines and ensure continuous at-sea deterrence well into the future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-navys-devonport-base-completes-upgrade-to-nuclear-submarine-facility	2024-09-12T07:00:12-07:00	
Analysis: China's advanced aircraft carrier Fujian begins sea trials a step toward naval power projection	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by September 12, 2024, China's latest aircraft carrier, the Fujian (Type 003), is currently undergoing intensive sea trials.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Chinese PLA Navy's aircraft carrier Fujian. (Picture source: Chinese TV) Fujian is equipped with technologies, including an electromagnetic (EM) catapult system, which enhances its ability to launch heavier aircraft, such as the J-15 fighter, as well as lighter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The EM catapult represents a technological leap from the ski-jump ramps used on China’s earlier carriers, Liaoning (Type 001) and Shandong (Type 002), which limited the operational capacity of onboard aircraft. Unlike these Soviet-era designs, Fujian's catapult enables the launch of larger planes like the KJ-600 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft. This boosts China’s surveillance and operational range over its previous carriers, which were restricted to lighter loads and shorter missions. Despite these advancements, Fujian remains behind the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz and Gerald R. Ford-class carriers, which possess nuclear propulsion, allowing them to operate for extended periods without refueling. Fujian, weighing in at over 80,000 tons, falls short of the U.S. carriers' 100,000-ton displacement. Additionally, it operates with three launch catapults, compared to four on the Gerald R. Ford, which may limit its sortie rates during high-intensity operations. China’s decision to stick with conventional propulsion may suggest a regional rather than global focus, particularly in the Western Pacific. The country appears to prioritize quicker shipbuilding cycles to meet its strategic needs in areas like the South China Sea, where it asserts territorial claims under the controversial 'nine-dash line.' The Chinese Navy's ongoing expansion aims to field six carriers by 2035, positioning the country as a dominant regional power with global aspirations. The addition of the fourth Type 004 carrier, reportedly under construction and potentially featuring nuclear propulsion, could extend China's operational reach into distant waters, such as the Indian Ocean and potentially beyond.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/analysis-chinas-advanced-aircraft-carrier-fujian-begins-sea-trials-a-step-toward-naval-power-projection	2024-09-12T05:11:15-07:00	
Taiwan to receive first F-16 Block 70 fighter jet by end of September	As reported by Liberty Times on September 12, 2024, Taiwan is set to receive the first of its 66 F-16 Block 70 fighter jets by the end of September, marking the beginning of a significant delivery for the island’s defense forces. The handover of the aircraft, delayed from the initial schedule planned for last year, will be observed by senior Taiwanese Air Force officials, a delegation from the U.S. military, American instructors, and the U.S. reception team.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New production orders for this variant began in 2017 when Bahrain became the first customer to order newly built F-16 Block 70 aircraft. (Picture source: US DoD) The F-16 Block 70 variant, also known as the F-16V, has been purchased by several countries. Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-16 fighter jets, has already delivered this new configuration to Bahrain and Slovakia. Following the arrival of the first batch later this month, Taiwan will become the third country to receive the F-16 Block 70 fighter jets. The procurement was made through a special budget allocation of over TWD 247.2 billion ($7.686.017.474,64), which includes not only the aircraft but also a range of advanced munitions and support equipment. In 2023, Taiwan secured a comprehensive military acquisition package from the United States, which included advanced weapon systems such as AIM-9X and AIM-120C air-to-air missiles, AGM-88 anti-radiation missiles, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), and AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOW). This $1.4 billion deal aims to enhance Taiwan's defense capabilities, particularly its ability to conduct precision strikes with its F-16 fleet. There are also speculations about the potential inclusion of the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) to further strengthen Taiwan's long-range strike capabilities. Additionally, in July 2024, Taiwan signed contracts with the United States to acquire MS-110 multispectral airborne reconnaissance pods and Infrared Search and Track (IRST) pods to enhance the capabilities of its F-16 fighter jets. The MS-110 pods, worth $343 million, will be delivered by 2025, enabling advanced surveillance and target detection capabilities. Meanwhile, the IRST pods, part of a $344.35 million deal, will help the F-16V Block 70/72 jets detect stealth aircraft by tracking heat signatures up to 150 kilometers away, improving Taiwan's air defense against modern threats. Following the arrival of the first batch later this month, Taiwan will become the third country to receive the F-16 Block 70 fighter jets., following Bahrain and Slovakia. (Picture source: US DoD) Parallel to these new acquisitions, the Taiwanese Air Force is advancing personnel training. According to the Ministry of National Defense's publicly released budget for the next fiscal year, the Air Force plans to send 65 personnel to the United States throughout the year for further F-16 training. This program, costing approximately TWD 36.649 million, is expected to provide tactical training for Taiwan's pilots and expand the pool of qualified instructors. The delivery of these aircraft has encountered several delays due to various factors. Despite Taiwan's repeated requests for Lockheed Martin to adhere to the contractual terms and the delivery schedule, the handover has been postponed multiple times. The Foreign and National Defense Committee of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan has maintained close scrutiny over these delays. During a legislative inquiry, General Lee Shih-Chiang, recently appointed as the head of the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, stated that two project managers from Lockheed Martin had been replaced. Additionally, former Air Force Chief of Staff General Tsao Chin-Ping noted that Taiwanese personnel stationed at the production facility had been withdrawn. The F-16 Block 70/72, also referred to as the F-16V, is an updated version of the F-16 multirole fighter, developed by Lockheed Martin. This variant incorporates various technological upgrades and modifications accumulated over the past 25 years. The Block 70/72 was first proposed by Lockheed Martin in 2012, with Taiwan being the initial customer, ordering an upgrade package for its existing Block 20 airframes. New production orders for this variant began in 2017 when Bahrain became the first customer to order newly built Block 70 aircraft. Other countries, including Greece, South Korea, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Morocco, Jordan, and Turkey, have since placed orders, either for new-build aircraft or to upgrade older models to this new standard. The F-16 Block 70/72 has a tactical radius of 579 km for a hi-lo-hi interdiction mission on internal fuel with six 500-kg bombs and a maximum ferry range of 3,940 km with maximum external fuel. (Picture source: US DoD) The Block 70/72 integrates advanced avionics and systems designed to improve its performance in modern combat scenarios. It features the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, providing enhanced situational awareness, faster targeting, and improved detection and tracking ranges in all weather conditions. The radar includes high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mapping and can manage multiple target tracks simultaneously. The aircraft is also equipped with a Center Pedestal Display that delivers tactical imagery on a high-resolution screen, allowing full use of the AESA radar and targeting pod data. Additional components include a modernized mission computer, an Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, an Infrared Search and Track system, and a Martin-Baker US18E ejection seat. Deliveries of the F-16 Block 70/72 started in 2019, with the first upgrade kits provided to Taiwan. The first newly built Block 70 aircraft flew in January 2023, destined for Bahrain. Later, in July 2024, Slovakia received its first Block 70, becoming the second operator of this variant of the F-16. By the end of 2023, more than 450 upgrade kits had been ordered by countries including Bahrain, Taiwan, Morocco, Greece, Turkey, and South Korea, along with orders for 153 new-built aircraft by Bahrain, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Taiwan, and Jordan. The Taiwan Air Force currently relies on older F-16 jets, French Dassault Mirage 2000 aircraft, and the Taiwanese AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-Kuo, commonly known as the Indigenous Defense Fighter. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The production of the F-16 Block 70/72 involves multiple nations. Production of the upgrade kits began in 2019, with deliveries to various countries to upgrade their existing fleets. Meanwhile, new-built Block 70 aircraft have been produced and delivered to Bahrain, with more deliveries scheduled to other countries. By late 2023, there was sustained demand for both upgraded and newly built versions of the Block 70/72. The F-16 Block 70/72 is powered by either the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229EEP turbofan or the General Electric F110-GE-129 turbofan, both providing around 13,154 kg of thrust with afterburning. The aircraft's maximum short-endurance speed is Mach 2.05 (2,177 km/h) at 12,192 meters, and its maximum sustained speed is Mach 1.89 (2,006 km/h) at the same altitude. It has a tactical radius of 579 km for a hi-lo-hi interdiction mission on internal fuel with six 500-kg bombs and a maximum ferry range of 3,940 km with maximum external fuel. The aircraft's dimensions are a wingspan of 9.45 meters, a length of 15.01 meters, and a height of 5.05 meters, with a wing area of 27.87 square meters. The empty weight is 9,207 kg, with a maximum takeoff weight of 21,772 kg.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/taiwan-to-receive-first-f-16-block-70-fighter-jet-by-end-of-september	2024-09-12T04:58:42-07:00	
US grants Egypt $1.3 Billion in Military Aid Boosting Defense Cooperation	On September 11, 2024, the Biden administration confirmed that Egypt would receive its full allocation of $1.3 billion in military aid, despite persistent concerns over the country’s human rights record. This marks the first time that the administration has granted this aid without withholding any portion, reflecting the increasing reliance of the U.S. on Egypt’s mediation efforts, particularly in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An Egyptian M1A1 Abrams tank participated in a field training exercise during Bright Star 2017 at Mohamed Naguib Military Base, alongside more than 200 U.S. service members as part of the bilateral U.S. Central Command exercise held from September 10 to 20, 2017. (Picture source: US DoD) Of the $1.3 billion aid, $320 million is usually conditioned on Egypt's improvement in human rights, leading to partial withholdings in past years. However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken informed Congress that $225 million of this amount would be released, citing U.S. 'national security interests.' The U.S. government emphasized Egypt’s key role in regional peace efforts, especially in mediating ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas and managing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Despite this crucial diplomatic role, the Egyptian government, led by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, continues to face accusations of human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary detentions. Some U.S. lawmakers, such as Senator Chris Murphy, criticized the waiver of human rights conditions, insisting that Egypt remains a repressive state. However, the State Department noted progress, such as the release of political prisoners and proposed reforms on pretrial detention, which led to the release of $95 million in previously withheld military aid. For many years, the U.S. has played a central role in equipping Egypt’s military, providing advanced systems that enhance the operational readiness of Egypt’s armed forces. This annual military aid includes armored vehicles, combat helicopters, and sophisticated weaponry, thereby strengthening Egypt’s defense capabilities. Among recent deliveries, armored personnel carriers such as the RG-33 and MaxxPro, delivered in 2016, have provided Egypt with enhanced mobility and protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), critical in counterinsurgency operations in the Sinai. These vehicles are particularly suited for counter-insurgency missions, offering essential protection to troops. The M1A1 Abrams tank, with 125 units delivered, is another key component of Egypt’s military arsenal. Considered one of the most powerful tanks in the world, it is equipped with a 120mm smoothbore gun and advanced composite armor. These tanks are supported by M88 armored recovery vehicles, which ensure that damaged tanks can be retrieved and returned to service, maintaining their operational availability. The United States delivered a batch of mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicles to the Egyptian military in 2016 (Picture source: Egyptian Army) In the air domain, Egypt has received F-16C Block 50 fighter jets and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters, armed with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, which are effective against armored vehicles. These aircraft play a crucial role in anti-terrorism operations in the Sinai, where Egypt combats various armed groups. On the naval front, Egypt has strengthened its fleet with Ambassador-IV corvettes and Swift-93 patrol vessels, vital for coastal defense in strategic areas such as the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. These ships, equipped with anti-ship missiles and advanced radar systems, provide crucial maritime protection for Egypt. In the field of intelligence and reconnaissance, Egypt has received systems such as the SIGINT Beech-190 aircraft and DB-110 reconnaissance pods. These assets provide critical real-time intelligence capabilities, enhancing Egypt’s ability to monitor and respond to threats along its borders. While the U.S. remains Egypt’s primary military supplier, the country has diversified its sources of armaments, strengthening ties with partners like China. This diversification allows Egypt to reduce its reliance on the U.S. while accessing alternative technologies. For instance, Egypt has acquired Wing Loong II drones from China, similar to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper, which are used for both reconnaissance and strike missions. This strategy aims to ensure a robust and versatile military supply chain, enabling Egypt to address regional security challenges effectively.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-grants-egypt-1-3-billion-in-military-aid-boosting-defense-cooperation	2024-09-12T04:57:52-07:00	
Philippine Army Recommissions Scorpion FV101 CVRT Light Reconnaissance Tracked Armored Vehicle	On September 2, 2024, the Philippine Army reportedly decided, as shown in images from a blessing ceremony on social media, to recommission the light tank FV101 Scorpion, the CVR(T) Arayat, equipped with a low-pressure L23A1 76mm turret, previously withdrawn from service due to maintenance issues. This tank has recently been recommissioned after a comprehensive overhaul, signifying a revitalization of its capabilities within the Armored Division.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Philippine Army's Scorpion FV101 CVRT Light Reconnaissance (Picture source: Philippines Social Media) For reference, the Philippine Army had embarked on an ambitious project to modernize twelve of its aging Scorpion tanks, with a budget of $4.6 million. This project included replacing the gasoline engines with diesel engines to address the shortage of spare parts. This enhancement not only increased the reliability of the tanks but also made them more suitable for current operations, particularly in the conflict regions of Mindanao. The 'Arayat' is one of the few Scorpions to have survived a phase where many of its counterparts were declared out of service and cannibalized for their parts. The removed turrets had been adapted to Belgian M113A2 vehicles, modified by Israel's Elbit Systems. However, the recent decision to repair and reintegrate these tanks shows a notable change in military resource management. Army officials have not disclosed the exact number of tanks that will be restored, but it appears that it will be a modest number. Moreover, it is noted that these reintegrated tanks will not benefit from the same advanced fire control systems found on the M113A2s. According to the Military Balance 2023, the Philippine Army still has six FV101 Scorpion light tanks to date. It is possible that the Arayat will be used for training and fire support purposes. As a reminder, the Philippine Army has recently bolstered its arsenal with strategic additions, including the Sabrah light tank and the Guarani 6x6 armored vehicle. Introduced in 2024, the Sabrah light tank, based on the Ascod 2 and Pandur II 8x8 chassis, is the result of a collaboration between Israel's Elbit Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems, offering tracked and wheeled options. Equipped with an advanced turret with a 105mm cannon, the Sabrah aims to enhance the versatility and firepower of the armed forces in the face of regional threats. Indeed, the turret comes from the Matak program, developed in collaboration between Israel and the South African industry. This tank is specially designed to meet the demands of varied terrains and complex combat scenarios. On the other hand, the Guarani 6x6, developed by Iveco Defence Vehicles and delivered for the first time in 2023, was selected for its superior mobility and protection performance. This armored vehicle excels in the secure transportation of troops, including in amphibious conditions, which is crucial for operations in the numerous archipelagos of the Philippines. The integration of the Guarani into the Philippine Army marks a significant step in the modernization of its troop transport vehicle fleet, thereby enhancing its ability to respond quickly and effectively to regional security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/philippine-army-recommissions-scorpion-fv101-cvrt-light-reconnaissance-for-training-missions	2024-09-12T04:49:04-07:00	
Project 22800 missile corvette Taifun sent for sea trials by Russian shipyard	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by Paluba on September 9, 2024, the Zelenodolsk Shipyard named after A.M. Gorky has sent the Project 22800 small missile ship (MRK) Taifun for trials. The Taifun was launched on May 7, 2024, and has now been transferred to an external delivery base where it will undergo sea trials and state testing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Karakurt-class corvette Taifun. (Picture source: Portnews) The Karakurt-class corvettes (Project 22800) are small missile ships developed by Russia to enhance its coastal defense capabilities. These corvettes are designed primarily for anti-surface and limited anti-aircraft warfare, leveraging stealth, speed, and powerful missile systems to perform their missions effectively in green-water environments, particularly around Russia's littoral zones. The Karakurt-class evolved as a more seaworthy alternative to the Buyan-M class, another Russian corvette class focused on littoral (close to shore) operations. Although the Buyan-M has performed well in riverine and coastal areas, its capabilities in rougher seas are limited. The Karakurt-class, therefore, was designed to address these shortcomings while maintaining the same level of firepower in a slightly larger platform that could better operate in open waters. At 67 meters long and with a beam of 11 meters, Karakurt corvettes displace around 800 tons. Despite their small size, they are equipped with formidable weapon systems and advanced sensors. The stealthy design incorporates radar-absorbing materials and a low-profile superstructure to reduce the ship's radar cross-section, enhancing survivability in contested environments. The Karakurt-class is armed with a variety of weapons to perform its primary role of coastal defense. The central feature of its offensive capability is the UKSK vertical launch system (VLS), which can carry Kalibr-NK land-attack cruise missiles or P-800 Oniks supersonic anti-ship missiles. The Kalibr missiles have a range of up to 2,500 kilometers, allowing these corvettes to engage distant land targets or large surface vessels. The Oniks missile, on the other hand, is optimized for anti-ship warfare and is a potent deterrent against larger naval vessels. For defense, the ships are equipped with the Pantsir-M close-in weapon system (CIWS), which integrates surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and automatic cannons to engage aerial threats, such as incoming missiles or aircraft. Earlier ships of the class, such as the lead ship Mytishchi, were outfitted with the AK-630M CIWS before being upgraded to the Pantsir system. The main gun of the Karakurt is the 76.2mm AK-176MA naval cannon, capable of engaging both surface and air targets.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/project-22800-missile-corvette-taifun-sent-for-sea-trials-by-russian-shipyard	2024-09-12T03:35:29-07:00

US Allows Ukraine to Use Long-Range Missiles to Target Russian Territory After Iranian Missiles Delivery	Citing information published by 'People's World' on September 11, 2024, Moscow claimed that the U.S. has given the green light for Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian targets. This development comes as part of a broader international effort to support Ukraine, with several European countries also backing Kyiv’s use of long-range weapons to strike Russian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A weapon Loader crew uploads a Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile to an external pylon on a B-1B Lancer at Edwards Air Force Base. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) On September 3, 2024, 'Reuters' announced that the U.S. is nearly finalizing an agreement to supply Ukraine with Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), which can reach deep into Russian territory. These missiles are expected to be delivered to Ukraine as part of a weapons package by autumn. The move is seen as a significant escalation in the conflict, as Ukraine will now be able to strike further into Russian territory than ever before. The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) is a long-range, precision-guided cruise missile developed by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. military. It is designed to be launched from aircraft and strike high-value, well-defended targets from a safe distance, reducing the risk to pilots. The missile is equipped with advanced stealth technology to evade enemy radar and has a range of up to 370 km (230 miles) in its basic version, with an extended-range variant (JASSM-ER) reaching over 900 km (560 miles). JASSM is used primarily by the U.S. Air Force and Navy and has been exported to several allied nations. European nations have also signaled their approval for Ukraine to use their donated missile systems in strikes targeting Russian military assets. Several European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, have provided Ukraine with long-range missile systems such as the British-supplied Storm Shadow and French SCALP-EG cruise missiles. These missiles, with ranges up to 300 kilometers, have already played a crucial role in Ukrainian strikes against Russian positions in occupied territories. However, until now, the use of European-donated long-range missiles had been limited to Ukrainian targets within its own borders or occupied territories. According to *People’s World*, recent developments indicate a shift in policy, with Western countries softening their stance on allowing Ukraine to strike military targets deep inside Russia. The UK, in particular, has reportedly supported Ukraine’s right to defend itself, even if that means conducting offensive operations within Russian territory, as long as those strikes are aimed at military infrastructure. This shift follows Russia's own aggressive actions, including Iran’s delivery of Fath 360 ballistic missiles to Moscow, which has heightened the sense of urgency among Ukraine's Western allies. The Iranian-Russian missile deal, cited by *People's World*, has been seen as a provocative step, further fueling the arms race in the region and prompting NATO allies to reevaluate their restrictions on Ukraine’s use of donated long-range weapons. With the U.S. poised to provide the JASSM missiles and European nations indicating their support for Ukrainian strikes on Russian soil, Ukraine is now better equipped to launch offensive operations that reach far beyond the frontlines. This new phase in the war has raised concerns about a potential escalation in hostilities, as long-range strikes from both sides could destabilize not only Ukraine and Russia but also the broader region. The growing use of advanced Western missile systems, alongside Ukraine’s requests for more offensive capabilities, signals a new chapter in the conflict, one that could significantly shift the balance of power on the battlefield. As the conflict intensifies i Ukraine, the international community watches closely, with fears that this increased missile activity could lead to unpredictable consequences, potentially drawing other nations deeper into the conflict. Western nations continue to walk a fine line between supporting Ukraine's defense and preventing a further escalation that could lead to direct confrontation with Russia	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-allows-ukraine-to-use-long-range-missiles-to-target-russian-territory-after-iranian-missiles-delivery	2024-09-12T03:01:07-07:00

GDELS Unveils Another Variant of Pandur Evolution for Special Forces	At the 9th KSK Armament Symposium, General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) revealed a new variant of the Pandur Evolution, designed for special forces missions. This marks the first public presentation of this specialized version of the Pandur Evolution, showcasing its advanced capabilities and potential applications.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration of the Pandur Evo 6x6, the version presented at KSK is equipped with an automated turret. (Picture source: Austrian MoD) The vehicle on display is based on a modified 6×6 Pandur Evolution platform. It is equipped with a remotely operated weapon station featuring a 30mm autocannon, an anti-drone protection net, and several canisters for carrying and launching Switchblade 300 Block 20 loitering munitions. Despite the impressive presentation, GDELS representatives refused to provide detailed specifications, only offering limited information regarding the vehicle's weight and mobility. The presented vehicle is described as a potential mission variant, which has not yet been selected by any customer. GDELS declined to comment on whether this vehicle could serve as a base for the Armored Ground Mobility System (AGMS) Heavy Platform Vehicle. Although the special forces variant of the Pandur Evolution includes elements such as the weapon station and Switchblade canisters, these components appear to be more demonstrative than definitive equipment. Additionally, the size of the weapon station would hinder the vehicle’s air transportability, suggesting that this configuration will not be included in the final AGMS version. Three major modifications distinguish the special forces variant of the Pandur from the standard version. The vehicle’s chassis has been significantly shortened at the rear, reducing its empty weight to less than 15 tons without mission equipment. Other visible changes include the presence of a ballistic driver's cabin and a modified engine cooling system. The total authorized weight of the vehicle is 19.5 tons, with a payload capacity of around 3 tons. The powertrain has not been modified, and the vehicle retains a Cummins ISLe 450 diesel engine with 335 kW and a ZF 6-speed automatic transmission. The base vehicle’s dimensions (2.6 meters wide and 2.2 meters high) allow it to be transported by a C-130 aircraft. The basic armor of the Pandur vehicle family protects the crew from shrapnel, small arms fire, and mines. Although GDELS did not provide details on the armor of the special forces variant, it is likely equipped with additional armor from Rheinmetall Protection Systems and meets the ballistic protection standards of STANAG 4569, likely level 3 or higher. Since the vehicle was presented in a closed configuration, no information could be obtained about the interior layout or combat space configuration. However, the presence of the ballistic driver's cabin and the modified engine cooling system, also found on previous AGMS versions of the Pandur used by USSOCOM, suggests that this vehicle is well-suited for special operations. The armored engine cooling system protects the engine while allowing the surface to be used for transporting material or mission equipment, and the ballistic driver's cabin allows the driver to maintain situational awareness even under enemy fire. The AGMS vehicles currently in service, as seen in publicly available images, are equipped with numerous mission-specific modifications, such as remotely operated weapon stations, communication equipment, and sensors. This leads to the conclusion that the special forces version of the Pandur on display is likely only the base platform for future AGMS vehicles, with the final versions expected to include different equipment and armor tailored to specific missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/gdels-unveils-another-variant-of-the-pandur-evolution-for-special-forces	2024-09-12T02:13:59-07:00

US Air Force Integrates AMRAAM Missiles Onto CCA Drones	The U.S. Air Force, in collaboration with Raytheon, is integrating the AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) onto its first series of Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. These unmanned systems are part of the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which envisions these drones flying alongside fifth- and sixth-generation manned aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The AIM-120 AMRAAM Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. (Picture source: US DoD) Raytheon has confirmed its involvement in this effort, working with the Air Force and two competing vendors, General Atomics and Anduril, who are currently in the development phase for the production of CCA Increment 1. Jon Norman, Raytheon’s vice president for air and space defense systems, discussed the missile integration during a meeting with reporters, following initial reports published by Air and Space Forces Magazine in July. 'We are collaborating with the Air Force on their CCA program to integrate the AMRAAM onto the Increment 1 drones. CCA Increment 2 is still in the early requirements phase,' said Norman. The CCA drones are set to be developed in phases, allowing for progressive improvements in their design and capabilities. The Air Force plans for these drones to carry various payloads for missions ranging from intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) to offensive strikes. According to Norman, the AMRAAM has been designated as the 'reference weapon' for these drones. 'The AMRAAM allows manned aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II or F-22 Raptor, to extend their combat capabilities. These drones can act as force multipliers, strategically positioned to use the AMRAAMs under the control of the manned aircraft,' he explained. In April, General Atomics and Anduril were awarded contracts to design detailed prototypes and conduct flight tests for the first series of CCA drones. Once the design is finalized, these companies, along with other interested vendors, will be able to compete for the final production contract, expected to be awarded in 2026. The Air Force plans to present full-scale models of the prototypes from General Atomics and Anduril during the Air, Space, and Cyber conference in September, according to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. Raytheon has focused on improving the range, navigation, and anti-jamming capabilities of the AMRAAM as part of this integration. Although the company has not specified which variant of the missile will be used on the CCAs, the most recent variant, the AIM-120D, has an estimated range of approximately 160 kilometers. In preparation for a new series of tests under the Air Force’s Weapon System Evaluation Program, Raytheon is working to demonstrate the extended range of the missile. While no changes were made to the missile’s propulsion system, adjustments were made to its flight path to conserve kinetic energy during long-range engagements, thus increasing its effectiveness upon impact. 'This allows us to regain parity, and even surpass, many global threats. It also makes the AMRAAM more resilient against future threats,' concluded Norman.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-air-force-integrates-amraam-missiles-onto-cca-drones	2024-09-11T05:01:29-07:00

US Army Reintegrates Over a Dozen MH-139 Helicopters in 2026	After deciding to cut its MH-139A Grey Wolf fleet by half for the 2025 fiscal year, a new Pentagon review has led the Air Force to reintegrate more than a dozen of these helicopters, thus avoiding a 'critical' cost overrun. The service plans to add 14 MH-139A helicopters to its inventory, bringing the total number to 'at least 56' aircraft in its future budget request.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link MH-139A Grey Wolf is a US helicopter. (Picture source: Boeing) This increase in procurement is expected to benefit Boeing, the primary contractor, and the Italian company Leonardo, whose commercial AW139 serves as the base model for the Grey Wolf. Initially, the Air Force planned to acquire 80 helicopters, but this number was reduced to 42 in the 2025 fiscal year budget. However, the recently published Selected Acquisition Report (SAR) from the Pentagon confirms the authorization to add 14 additional helicopters, partially reversing the initial cut. The SAR indicates the 2026 fiscal year budget, which is generally kept confidential until the full Pentagon spending plan is released in the spring. An Air Force spokesperson declined to provide further information, while Boeing referred inquiries back to the Air Force. The MH-139A Grey Wolf is designed to replace the aging UH-1N Huey, and its primary mission will be to patrol the Air Force’s extensive nuclear missile silos. According to Andrew Hunter, the Air Force's acquisition chief, this mission will be fully funded, even though other roles traditionally performed by the Huey, such as VIP transport and civilian search and rescue, are facing budget cuts. With the apparent expansion of the Grey Wolf fleet, it remains to be seen whether some of these missions, initially slated for removal, might be reinstated. Hunter previously explained that the helicopter procurement reduction was due to budget constraints, but this cut also triggered a 'critical' cost breach under the Nunn-McCurdy Act. This breach occurs when the total program cost is spread over fewer aircraft, thereby increasing the unit cost. The SAR indicates that the planned increase in procurement for 2026 will bring unit costs below the critical Nunn-McCurdy threshold, although the breach will still be classified as 'significant' under statutory guidelines. The Grey Wolf is equipped with advanced avionics systems, improved range, greater speed (approximately 250 km/h), and enhanced capacity for surveillance and transport missions, while maintaining lower operating costs compared to its predecessors. The helicopter is designed to perform other roles, such as VIP transport, search and rescue, as well as general support missions. Thanks to its flexibility and state-of-the-art equipment, the Grey Wolf enables the US Air Force to maintain strict surveillance while improving force security and modernizing logistical capabilities in a constantly evolving environment. The Air Force had deferred the acquisition of helicopters to obtain the necessary certifications from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Acquisition resumed in fiscal year 2023 after receiving the certifications, and Grey Wolf production began last year with Hunter's approval. In August, Boeing announced that it had delivered the first low-rate initial production helicopters to the Air Force. Additionally, in August 2023, Air Force officials reported progress in securing technical data packages for the Grey Wolf, a traditionally thorny issue for the industry. This advancement is expected to facilitate service-led maintenance and create more competition among contractors for helicopter sustainment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-army-reintegrates-over-a-dozen-mh-139-helicopters-in-2026	2024-09-11T00:41:10-07:00	
Raytheon Sees Complementarity Between AMRAAM and JATM Missiles in Future U.S. Air Force	Raytheon has highlighted the complementary roles of the AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-260 JATM (Joint Advanced Tactical Missile) in the future arsenal of the U.S. Air Force. John Norman, Raytheon's Vice President for Air and Space Systems, emphasized the evolution of the AMRAAM over its 30 years of service, noting that its range has now reached near parity with newer threat missiles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Despite the AMRAAM’s shorter range compared to the JATM, it remains crucial to force composition, especially with the uncertainty surrounding the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program (Picture source: USAF) The AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) entered production in the late 1980s, with initial service starting in 1991. Developed by Raytheon, the AMRAAM is a medium-range air-to-air missile capable of engaging targets beyond visual range, with a reach of approximately 160 kilometers. It is equipped with an active radar seeker, GPS guidance, and enhanced electronics, allowing it to engage multiple targets in challenging environments. The AMRAAM is widely used by U.S. and allied forces across more than 14 platforms in 43 countries. Upgrades such as the D3 variant have extended its range and improved its ability to counter modern threats, including electronic jamming. The AIM-260 JATM, developed by Lockheed Martin, is designed to replace the AMRAAM and address next-generation threats. While production details remain confidential, the JATM is expected to enter service in the mid-2020s. With a range exceeding 190 kilometers, it is designed to provide enhanced capabilities against advanced threats, including countermeasures and electronic warfare. The JATM is expected to be a high-end, costly weapon that complements the more affordable and deployable AMRAAM. In a recent call with reporters, Norman explained that despite the AMRAAM’s shorter range compared to the JATM, it remains crucial to force composition, especially with the uncertainty surrounding the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. Norman noted that the range of the AMRAAM is approaching the level sought by the Air Force for the JATM, which remains largely confidential. Although specific details were not disclosed, Norman suggested that the AMRAAM can intercept targets at around 160 kilometers, while the JATM is designed for engagements beyond 190 kilometers. He described the AMRAAM as the 'capacity weapon' due to its financial accessibility, while the JATM is positioned as a specialized solution for advanced threats. The latest AMRAAM variant, the D3, results from close collaboration with the U.S. Air Force, incorporating improvements such as extended range and enhanced resistance to modern jamming techniques. These upgrades have significantly boosted the missile's effectiveness against current digital threats. Norman emphasized that these developments, combined with its integration across 14 platforms in 43 countries, ensure that the AMRAAM remains 'future-proof' against evolving global threats. As global demand for the AMRAAM continues to grow, Raytheon has ramped up production, reaching 1,200 units annually in recent years—double the historical production rate. Discussions are underway to potentially produce the missile in other countries, with Japan being a potential partner. However, such plans would require an increase in demand to 2,000 units per year.

(Picture source: Dvids) The frigate Baden-Württemberg and the supply ship Frankfurt am Main, currently deployed in the Indo-Pacific region, are scheduled to transit the sensitive waterway in mid-September, on a route between South Korea and Jakarta. Despite warnings from China, which claims Taiwan and seeks to regulate military transits through the strait, Germany has decided not to notify Beijing of its passage—similar to the approach taken by the United States and other Western nations. This decision signals that Berlin views the transit as routine and within its rights under international law. The German warships are participating in a series of international exercises in the Indo-Pacific, including monitoring compliance with sanctions against North Korea. While the operation carries symbolic weight, marking a rare German naval presence in these waters, it also reflects a shift in policy. In 2021, a similar deployment notably avoided the Taiwan Strait, drawing criticism for appearing to yield to Beijing’s pressure. Frigate Baden-Württemberg The vessel displaces 7,200 tons and measures 149.52 meters in length, with a beam of 18.80 meters and a draft of 5.40 meters. Its installed power totals 43,000 shp, provided by a CODLAG propulsion system, which includes a 20 MW gas turbine, two 4.7 MW electric motors, four 2.9 MW diesel generators, and three gearboxes for propulsion through two shafts driving controllable pitch propellers. Additionally, it is equipped with a 1 MW bow thruster. The ship can reach speeds of 20 knots using diesel engines and up to 26 knots at maximum capacity. It has a range of 4,000 nautical miles. In terms of small craft, the vessel carries submarine ROVs and four 11-meter RHIBs capable of speeds exceeding 40 knots. The ship also has space for two containers measuring 6.1 meters. It typically operates with a crew of 190, with a standard crew size of 110.

McCool, Jr. (Picture source: Dvids) These vessels are designed to meet the ever-changing demands of modern naval operations, blending advanced technologies with a capacity to execute a wide range of missions. One critical aspect of the San Antonio-class is its ability to support disaggregated operations. Unlike older ships that primarily operated in close proximity to one another, these LPDs can operate independently if required. This operational autonomy is crucial for modern naval strategy, where units may need to respond rapidly and flexibly to emerging crises, from amphibious assaults to humanitarian aid and disaster response. Each vessel can support more than 800 Marines, their equipment, and various landing craft, making them key enablers of Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs), which often operate far from U.S. shores for extended periods​. A standout feature is the class's ability to accommodate Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) and other amphibious vehicles within its large well deck. This capability allows the rapid deployment of ground forces and supplies from ship to shore under various combat conditions. The Flight II variants of the San Antonio class—currently in construction—will further refine these capabilities. Designed to replace the aging Whidbey Island-class dock landing ships (LSDs), the Flight II vessels maintain many of the features of the original Flight I ships but include several upgrades that enhance operational flexibility. These enhancements include improved aviation support, better medical facilities for larger casualty care, and the ability to handle more diverse operations, from amphibious assaults to humanitarian missions. From a survivability standpoint, the San Antonio-class incorporates several technologies designed to reduce vulnerability in high-threat environments. The ships feature stealthier hulls, advanced radar and sensor systems, and integrated command and control networks, making them more resilient in scenarios involving anti-ship missiles or other adversary capabilities. Another important factor in the design of these ships is their focus on supporting joint and coalition operations. The San Antonio-class is capable of acting as a command-and-control hub for multinational naval forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uss-richard-m-mccool-jr-lpd-29-commissioned-at-naval-air-station-pensacola	2024-09-10T06:39:41-07:00	
Egypt Officializes Its Choice of Chinese J-10C Fighters to Replace American F-16s	According to The National Interest, Egypt has officially announced that it will replace its aging fleet of American F-16s with Chinese J-10C Vigorous Dragon fighters, following discussions over the past few months. This decision made public during the first Egypt International Air Show, reflects Cairo's intent to diversify its military equipment sources, thus reducing its reliance on U.S. defense systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This decision comes during a time of geopolitical realignment for Egypt, which recently joined the BRICS bloc alongside major players such as China, Russia, and India. (Picture source: PLA Air Force) The Chengdu J-10C, in service with the Chinese Air Force (PLAAF) since 2004, is a multirole fighter equipped with a single engine, delta wings, and a canard configuration. Known for its maneuverability and versatility, the J-10C offers advanced capabilities at a competitive cost, making it an attractive alternative to the American F-16V, which had been proposed as an upgrade for the Egyptian fleet.Developed by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation (CAC), the J-10C features advanced electronic warfare systems and an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. It supports multirole operations with targeting pods, laser-guided bombs, and air-to-air missiles. Officially entering service in December 2017, the J-10C is currently operated by China and Pakistan, and Egypt has expressed interest in acquiring a dozen units, primarily due to its lower cost compared to Western and Russian fighter jets.The J-10C is designed with a 'tailless delta-canard' aerodynamic layout, which improves its maneuverability and overall lift. It is powered by a Russian Lyulka-Saturn AL-31FN turbofan engine, capable of reaching a maximum speed of 2,200 km/h and a range of 3,200 km. Additionally, it is equipped with modern avionics, including an IRST sensor and various externally-mounted avionics pods for navigation, targeting, and electronic reconnaissance missions.This decision comes during a time of geopolitical realignment for Egypt, which recently joined the BRICS bloc alongside major players such as China, Russia, and India. In recent years, Egypt has also acquired defense equipment from Russia and France, including the MiG-29M and Dassault Rafale. The Chinese J-10C is set to become a key part of Egypt's diversified arsenal.This development also reflects the growing economic and strategic ties between Egypt and China. China's participation in the Egypt Air Show in El Alamein is part of its broader effort to strengthen its presence in the Middle East and North Africa. China’s military-industrial influence in the region has significantly expanded, supported by its growing economic relationships, particularly through energy imports. A Yun-20 and a J-10 fighter aircraft from the Chinese Air Force flew over the Pyramids during the 2024 Egypt International Air Show. (Picture source: PLA Air Force) Despite adopting Chinese fighters, Egypt continues to maintain defense relations with the United States, as evidenced by a recent agreement to acquire two C-130J Hercules transport aircraft through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. However, the transition to the J-10C represents a significant shift, as Egypt’s American F-16s, which have formed the backbone of the Egyptian Air Force since the 1980s, are now considered outdated in the face of modern air defense systems.Several factors likely influenced Egypt's decision, including the J-10C's cost-effectiveness and its advanced combat capabilities. Additionally, Egypt's concerns regarding U.S. policy in the region, particularly its support for Israeli operations in Gaza, may have played a role in the shift towards Chinese defense technology.With this acquisition, Egypt becomes the second country after Pakistan to operate the J-10C Vigorous Dragon. The Egyptian Air Force is expected to deploy these fighters to enhance its operational capabilities in North Africa and the Middle East, solidifying Egypt's position as a regional military power.Egypt’s interest in Chinese fighters extends beyond the J-10C, with the country also showing interest in the J-31, a fifth-generation stealth fighter. While the J-10C offers multirole capabilities at a reduced cost, making it competitive with Western and Russian aircraft, the J-31 is seen as a strategic asset to counter Israeli F-35s. The J-31’s advanced stealth features, radar evasion capabilities, and modern weapon systems make it a serious candidate for modernizing Egypt’s air capabilities and maintaining a balance of power in the region. Its ability to perform bombing, interdiction, and close air support missions further reinforces Egypt’s interest, particularly in a geopolitical context where it seeks to diversify its defense sources in response to sanctions on Russia and the U.S.-Israel relationship.The Egyptian Air Force (EAF) plays a central role in the country's defense strategy, with a diversified fleet of fighter jets from various sources. Egypt currently operates American F-16s, Russian MiG-29s, and French Rafales, reflecting its military diversification strategy. However, many of these aircraft, particularly the F-16s, are considered aging and less effective against modern threats. Egypt’s desire to acquire J-10Cs and J-31s demonstrates its commitment to strengthening its air fleet in the face of new regional challenges, including Israeli air superiority.The defense partnership between China and Egypt has a long history, dating back to the 1970s. Over the decades, this partnership has grown stronger with the supply of various Chinese military equipment, including submarines, destroyers, missile boats, and aircraft. China's non-interference policy and its strategic approach to arms exports, free from political conditions, make this cooperation particularly attractive to Egypt. Additionally, China offers competitive pricing and advanced technology transfers, facilitating joint production projects. This enables Egypt to continuously modernize its armed forces while diversifying its international partnerships in an ever-evolving geopolitical landscape.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/egypt-officializes-its-choice-of-chinese-j-10c-fighters-to-replace-american-f-16s	2024-09-10T06:11:57-07:00	
SaCo24: NATO Forces collaborate in mine-hunting operations to secure maritime routes	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by the Belgian MoD on September 9, 2024, the Sandy Coast 2024 (SaCo24) exercise brings together mine hunters from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Estonia in Belgian waters and the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The exercise's primary goal is to enhance the detection and neutralization of naval mines, a crucial challenge for ensuring the safety of maritime routes.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belgian Navy's Tripartite-class minehunter Lobelia and Archer-class patrol vessel HMS Exploit. (Picture source: Belgian MoD) The Belgian Navy has developed a deep expertise in mine hunting, becoming a key player in NATO's mine countermeasure (MCM) operations. With a history dating back to the 20th century, Belgium has consistently demonstrated its ability to tackle the threat posed by sea mines, which are a significant challenge for global maritime security. Belgium’s geographic position near the North Sea, a region with a high density of mines left over from both World Wars, has necessitated a focus on these operations, leading to the evolution of specialized techniques and equipment. This proficiency is reflected in Belgium's contribution to standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups, where it frequently deploys mine-hunting vessels and contributes personnel to joint operations. Mine hunting is a complex naval operation involving the detection, identification, and neutralization of sea mines, which are often small, difficult to locate, and capable of inflicting significant damage on ships. Belgian mine-hunting techniques have evolved to combine traditional methods with advanced technology. Specialized vessels designed for this purpose use sonar and other detection systems to locate mines. Once a mine is identified, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or divers are deployed to either neutralize or safely destroy the threat. This approach minimizes risks to both the vessels and their crews while ensuring that crucial shipping lanes remain open and secure. In terms of fleet composition, the Belgian Navy has traditionally relied on specialized minehunters that are designed with acoustic and electromagnetic stealth to minimize detection by the mines themselves. One of the notable aspects of Belgium’s mine-hunting efforts is the long-standing collaboration with the Dutch Navy. Both navies have coordinated on numerous mine-hunting missions, sharing resources and expertise. Belgium has played a significant role in the development of mine-hunting technology. Over the years, the country has been involved in numerous research and development initiatives aimed at improving MCM capabilities. These efforts have resulted in the adoption of new techniques and equipment that enhance the safety and effectiveness of mine-hunting missions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/saco24-nato-forces-collaborate-in-mine-hunting-operations-to-secure-maritime-routes	2024-09-10T05:29:16-07:00

Israeli-Designed Russian Drone Targets Ukrainian Positions in Kursk in Coordinated Strike	Since the onset of large-scale warfare, reconnaissance and attack drones have become pivotal in modern military strategies. The 'Forpost-RU' drone, a Russian-enhanced version of the Israeli IAI Searcher II, exemplifies this well. This device has proven effective in both reconnaissance and attack roles due to the integration of new light guided munitions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Forpost -RU flying with KAB-20 under wing ( top), Russian weapon specialist fixing KAB-20 under Forpost-RU UAV ( bottom) during coordinated strike on September 9th, near Kursk. (Picture source: Russian fighters) The Forpost-RU is a significant example of how military technology can evolve and adapt in response to a country's tactical and strategic needs. This reconnaissance and attack drone is based on the Israeli IAI Searcher II model, which has been widely used for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The Forpost-RU resulted from a licensing agreement between Russia and Israel, allowing Russia to acquire the Searcher II drone technology. In 2010, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) entered an agreement with Russia for the licensed production of these drones. This partnership was crucial for Russia, aiming to modernize and enhance its surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. Following the initial agreement, production was localized in Russia under the name Forpost, a version almost identical to the Israeli Searcher II. Localizing production allowed Russia to benefit from technology and skills transfer, leading to the adaptation and enhancement of the device to specifically meet the requirements of the Russian armed forces. The development of the Forpost-RU marked a significant evolution from its predecessor. By integrating more advanced technologies and armaments, such as adapting to carry light guided munitions like the KAB-20 bombs, the Forpost-RU has transformed into a more versatile platform capable of performing both reconnaissance and attack missions. The 'Forpost-RU' operates at a medium altitude, capable of staying airborne between 16 and 18 hours, allowing it to conduct extended surveillance and strike missions. Equipped with an 85 horsepower piston engine, the АПД-85, it can reach a maximum speed of 200 km/h, with a cruising speed ranging from 120 to 160 km/h. These characteristics make it ideal for various missions, ranging from reconnaissance to precise attacks. The recent adaptation of the 'Forpost-RU' to carry KAB-20 bombs marks a significant evolution in its combat role. These light guided munitions are designed for precise strikes, thus providing increased attack capability without the need for heavy aerial support. This integration represents a notable evolution in military strategy, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of strikes while minimizing risks to equipment and personnel. The KAB-20 is a light guided bomb specifically designed to be deployed from reconnaissance and attack drones, like the Forpost-RU. Weighing approximately 20 kilograms and measuring 1.2 meters long with a diameter of 130 mm, this munition is optimized for use on UAV platforms where payload capacity is limited. It is equipped with an advanced guidance system that combines GPS with inertial sensors to allow for increased precision in striking targets. This guidance technology makes the KAB-20 particularly suited for hitting mobile or semi-mobile targets with high precision, thereby minimizing collateral damage and enhancing the effectiveness of strategic strikes. The effective range of the KAB-20 primarily depends on the altitude from which it is dropped, but it is designed to precisely strike targets several kilometers away, allowing drones like the Forpost-RU to remain out of reach of enemy air defense systems while conducting effective strikes. The use of the 'Forpost-RU' in the Kursk region, particularly against the fortifications of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (FAU) in the village of Snagost, illustrates the tactical impact of this platform. The ability to conduct precise and sustained strikes from a distance is a major asset in the current context where control of the skies is paramount.

Russia proposes partnership with India for local production of Il-76MD-90A strategic airlifters	On September 9, 2024, the Indian Defence Research Wing (IDRW) reported that the Russian company, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), had proposed a partnership with India to locally manufacture the Ilyushin Il-76MD-90A strategic airlifter. This proposal aims to replace the Indian Air Force's (IAF) fleet of 17 Il-76MD heavy transport aircraft, which were acquired in the early 1980s.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The first production Il-76MD-90A aircraft began flying in October 2014, and the initial unit was delivered to the Russian Ministry of Defense in April 2019. (Picture source: RussianPlanes.net/Alexey Reznichenko) Introduced in 2012, the Il-76MD-90A is a variant of the Il-76MD, a Soviet-era heavy military transport aircraft that has been in service since 1971. The aircraft's payload capacity has been increased from 40 tons to 60 tons, and it offers enhancements in flight range and efficiency, along with a reduction in noise and emissions. Over 70% of the aircraft’s systems have been updated to improve flight safety. United Aircraft has suggested that local production in India could be beneficial by utilizing existing infrastructure and trained personnel, potentially leading to cost reductions and a faster procurement process. The similarity between the Il-76MD-90A and the IAF’s current Il-76MD fleet might facilitate a more straightforward transition. The Indian Air Force (IAF)’s current Il-76MD fleet is limited in its ability to operate on international civilian routes due to outdated navigation systems. The IAF is considering options to replace its aging AN-32 and IL-76 aircraft, which are integral to its transport capabilities, with a single platform. One consideration is the Airbus A400M, although its high cost and operating expenses may be problematic. Another potential solution is a multi-role transport aircraft (MTA) being developed through a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and UAC, which would feature a 19-ton payload capacity and could fulfill both military and civil aviation roles.

Singapore Army introduces Vesper tactical drone to use 3D view of battlefield	The Singapore Army, in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), has recently introduced a new tactical drone, the Vesper, developed by Vantage Robotics. This advanced quadcopter is designed to enhance the situational awareness of soldiers on the battlefield, marking a significant turn in tactical military operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Vesper UAV in service alongside 5th Bataillon of Singapore infantry Regiment (Picture source: Singapore Army ) During the recent Panther Strike exercise, troops from the 5th Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment (5 SIR) were the first to deploy the Vesper, highlighting its effectiveness and ease of use. Capable of flying in free or tethered mode for persistent surveillance operations, the Vesper is equipped with two low-light cameras and an infrared (IR) sensor with 4K resolution and 48x zoom, allowing for target detection even in low-light conditions. Thanks to a three-axis stabilized gimbal, the Vesper can transmit live Full HD (1080p) video streams to the Ground Control Station (GCS), ensuring high-quality image transmission even under challenging conditions. During the operation, this drone proved its worth by providing aerial surveillance just before the arrival of infantry forces, enabling commanders to modify their operational plans in real-time to maximize mission success. The drone can be deployed in less than 90 seconds from its carrying case and can fly at a maximum speed of 20 m/s (72 km/h) with an extremely low noise signature, comparable to a whisper (&lt;32 dBA at 25m), and a flight time of 50 minutes. Soldiers using the Vesper have been trained through the Basic Vertical Take-Off and Landing UAV Operator Course (BVOC), which has allowed them to quickly master the drone's intuitive controls. This ease of use, combined with magnetic snap-on components that facilitate quick replacement of parts in the field, makes the Vesper particularly suited to the evolving dynamics of the modern battlefield, especially in urban environments. The adoption of the Vesper underscores the Singapore Army's ongoing commitment to integrating the most advanced technologies to strengthen its operational capabilities. Particularly by bringing 3D vision into operational capabilities for detection and recognition, the Vesper incorporates identification technology that allows for the advanced detection and classification of personnel as friend or foe, providing a real advantage in reconnaissance, tailored for an army sized for local interventions. The Singapore Army is sized by the geographical and social conditions of the country, which today is an enclave close to Malaysia and Indonesia. Its army is not designed for interventionist operations but to maintain the nation's foothold in its maritime and terrestrial zones of influence. The Vesper drone thus fits into this logic as well.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/singapore-army-introduces-vesper-tactical-drone-to-use-3d-view-of-battlefield	2024-09-10T01:24:20-07:00	
Russian fiber-optic controlled FPV is not so Russian but Chinese	Ukrainian radio technology and drone pilot specialist since the Russian military action, Serhiy Beskrestnov (also known as Serhiy Flash), has challenged Russia's claim that it is developing a new fiber-optic controlled drone, suggesting that the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) might actually originate from China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link FPV drone with different Optic fiber length adaptable to mission. (Picture source: Russian Telegram channel ) Beskrestnov's allegations highlight Russia's reliance on foreign technologies for its military operations, despite official statements to the contrary. Several videos show heavy use of these drones since March 2024, with fiber optics as a control system for FPV drones presenting a solution to jamming and its effectiveness. The optical link is physical and thus limits drone movement and range, and previously negligible obstacles (buildings, windows, power lines, etc.) are now taken into account. It is not yet known if redundancy in case of a break is planned, nor if a radio link could serve as a backup system in case of fiber breakage. Despite these drawbacks, which involve a flight trajectory more 'ballistic' than a straight line close to the ground as with traditional FPVs, optical FPVs offer particularly interesting image quality. In the video at the end of the article, it is noted that there are over 50 constant FPS and very sharp resolution. This makes it easy to identify areas of interest and facilitates target designation. In a post on social media, Beskrestnov stated: 'There are discussions among enemy groups that the Russian optical fiber drone 'Vandal' does not exist. It is actually a Chinese drone purchased for $2,000.' He also claimed that these drones could be bought for Russian military use at a significantly inflated price of $17,000, but no information corroborates these statements. Russia has recently increased the use of optical fiber FPV drones in combat, with officials boasting that these drones are immune to electronic warfare (EW) countermeasures due to their lack of radio signals. Russian sources have already celebrated the launch of what they called the 'Prince Vandal of Novgorod' drone, developed by the NPC Ushkuy company based in Novgorod. Russian military sources have stated that 'no EW system can affect it, and the images captured are clear and intact.' According to Beskrestnov, this Russian innovation is actually a Chinese Skywalker drone, marketed and known for its fiber optic capabilities. Unlike traditional drones, which can be jammed by electronic warfare systems, fiber optic drones remain resistant to such interference, as they rely on a physical cable for control, rather than radio frequencies. Additionally, these drones are undetectable by most drone detectors due to the absence of radio command and video transmission signals. Russia's dependence on these drones and their components manufactured abroad further underscores the country's difficulties in developing cutting-edge technologies independently, despite public claims of innovation and self-sufficiency.

US Approves Sale of Advanced AIM-120C-8 Air-to-Air Missiles to Singapore	On September 9, 2024, the U.S. State Department approved a potential Foreign Military Sale to the Government of Singapore, including the delivery of advanced AIM-120C-8 air-to-air missiles and associated equipment. This sale, estimated at $133 million, was notified to Congress by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link RTX AIM-120C-8 Air-to-Air Missile (Picture source: Army Recognition) In this request, Singapore sought the purchase of fifty-four AIM-120C-8 missiles, an advanced version of the medium-range air-to-air missile (AMRAAM), along with two additional AMRAAM guidance sections. The sale also includes various unclassified equipment and services, such as spare control sections, missile containers, testing equipment, and technical and logistical support services provided by the U.S. government and its contractors. The primary contractor for this deal would be RTX Corporation, based in Tucson, Arizona. The AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM is designed for all-weather, beyond-visual-range aerial combat and is compatible with various U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft such as the F-15, F-16, F-22, and F/A-18. It features a sophisticated guidance system combining active radar terminal guidance with inertial mid-course navigation, enabling pilots to engage multiple targets simultaneously and perform evasive maneuvers. The AIM-120C-8, an improved version of the AIM-120C series, stands out with its extended range and enhanced resistance to electronic jamming, thanks to upgrades in its guidance system and sensors. Its range, estimated at over 100 kilometers, allows it to engage targets before they pose a threat to the launching aircraft. Introduced in 1991, this missile variant is a continuation of the AIM-7 Sparrow series but offers significant enhancements in speed, size, and target engagement capabilities. This sale is seen as key support for U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives, aiming to strengthen the position of a strategic ally in Asia. As a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific region, Singapore already benefits from close military relations with the U.S., particularly in terms of interoperability with U.S. and allied forces. According to the Military Balance 2023, Singapore has an operational fleet of 105 combat aircraft. Among them are 100 multirole fighters, including 40 F-15SG Eagles, 20 F-16C Block 52 Fighting Falcons, 20 F-16D Block 52 Fighting Falcons, and 20 F-16D Block 52+ Fighting Falcons, including reserve aircraft. These aircraft are equipped to fire the advanced AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM, thereby enhancing their air defense capabilities and ability to engage medium-range targets. The State Department emphasized that this agreement would not only improve Singapore’s operational capabilities but also help maintain regional stability in light of growing tensions in this strategic area. The introduction of these missiles will increase the effectiveness of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in both training and combat operations, thus reinforcing deterrence in this key region. The Singapore Armed Forces are considered the best-equipped in Southeast Asia. Their structure is largely modeled after the Israeli system, with the air force and navy primarily composed of professional personnel, while the much larger army relies mainly on conscripts and reservists, aside from a small core of career soldiers. The modernization of the SAF’s equipment continues, with a boost given by the 'SAF 2040' vision, launched in March 2022. This plan outlines acquisition and modernization priorities across all domains, including the creation of a fourth branch of the armed forces, the Digital and Intelligence Service, which was established in October 2022. Key acquisition projects include F-35 fighter jets, multi-role combat vessels, unmanned surface vessels, unmanned aerial vehicles, offshore patrol vessels, maritime patrol aircraft, and various land equipment. These efforts aim to maintain Singapore’s military edge over other Southeast Asian countries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-approves-sale-of-advanced-aim-120c-8-air-to-air-missiles-to-singapore	2024-09-10T00:58:43-07:00
