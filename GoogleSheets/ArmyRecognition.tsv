India Showcases Rafale Jet Capability to Intercept High-Altitude Chinese Spy Balloons	The Indian Air Force (IAF) recently conducted an exercise to demonstrate its ability to intercept targets representative of Chinese spy balloons at very high altitudes. Deploying one of its thirty-six Rafale jets, the IAF successfully engaged a simulated target at over 55,000 feet or approximately 16.7 km altitude. According to a source cited by the Times of India, this operation marks a significant milestone for India, proving its air force’s capability to destroy such targets in previously unexplored flight zones for these types of missions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) India’s Rafale, first delivered in 2020 under a contract signed with France in 2016, is a versatile combat aircraft designed for high-altitude operations, extended range, and high payload capacity. With a maximum operational ceiling of 55,000 feet, the Rafale enables the IAF to maintain heightened vigilance against potential aerial incursions, including in upper airspace. Equipped for air-to-air and ground attack missions, the Rafale can carry a broad array of guided and unguided munitions, offering substantial flexibility. This operation comes as interest in very high-altitude security intensifies, particularly since the downing of a Chinese spy balloon by the US Air Force over American waters in 2023. This incident highlighted the strategic importance of this layer of airspace, which remains under-regulated due to a lack of consensus on the boundary between airspace and outer space. The Chinese balloon, measuring nearly 60 meters in diameter and equipped with a 900 kg payload, demonstrated high-altitude intelligence-gathering capabilities. However, US authorities stated that no significant data was collected during its passage. To prevent further intrusions, NORAD recalibrated its radars in March, enabling the interception of an aerostat at over 43,000 feet above Utah. Although this object posed no direct threat, vigilance remains essential, and other Chinese balloons have been observed near Taiwan. Given its own tensions with China, particularly concerning the Arunachal Pradesh region, India has been preparing for potential incursions of Chinese balloons into its airspace, though no official comment was made on a similar sighting over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2022. During this recent operation, the Indian Rafale was armed with Meteor and MICA missiles, capable of striking targets at ranges of 200 km and 80 km, respectively. No details were disclosed on the tactics employed to intercept the target at such a high altitude, which represents the Rafale’s operational ceiling. This demonstration echoes the capabilities affirmed by General Stéphane Mille, Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, in 2022, who stated that France also possesses the capability to intercept such devices. Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. This mix of Russian, French, and indigenous technology enables the IAF to maintain diverse and robust intervention capabilities. India is also considering expanding its Rafale fleet, with plans to acquire an additional 26 aircraft, primarily for its navy, which would strengthen India’s maritime defense capabilities. This potential expansion demonstrates India’s confidence in the Rafale, which has proven effective in high-altitude exercises and national security scenarios. The international context underscores the growing importance of very high-altitude protection, a domain that major powers are actively exploring to ensure enhanced surveillance and counter emerging threats. Beyond the technical dimension, the IAF’s exercise shows India’s determination to defend its airspace from any form of unwanted surveillance, affirming its sovereignty and increasing control over an area of airspace that has so far been sparsely utilized.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/india-showcases-rafale-jet-capability-to-intercept-high-altitude-chinese-spy-balloons-2	2024-10-09T02:18:49-07:00	
US considers Taiwan for potential Stinger surface-to-air missile production amid rising China threats	On October 4, 2024, the 'Liberty Times Net' reported that the United States plans to send a specialized team to Taiwan to explore the possibility of producing American-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles locally. This development highlights Taiwan’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid rising regional threats, particularly from China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Army Soldiers from the 25th Infantry Division practice target acquisition on notional targets during stinger qualification, on Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, April 19, 2024. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Taiwan's Army and Navy had previously ordered 250 Stinger surface-to-air missiles each in 2019 and 2015, respectively, with delivery expected to be completed by 2025. However, the growing urgency for more effective countermeasures has led Taiwan's Army to order an additional 1,985 Stinger missiles from the U.S. The total value of this deal is estimated at approximately US$1.73 billion. According to the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense’s 2025 budget report, the Army will also procure 549 launch systems and 549 identification, friend or foe (IFF) systems. Deliveries of these systems are projected to continue through 2031, bolstering Taiwan’s air defense network. The Stinger missile, also known as the FIM-92 Stinger, is a highly advanced man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS) developed by Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense. It is designed to engage low-altitude aerial threats such as helicopters, drones, and low-flying aircraft. The Stinger is equipped with a passive infrared homing system, enabling it to lock onto the heat signatures of aircraft engines. This feature makes it highly effective in combat scenarios. The missile has an operational range of about 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) and can reach speeds of up to Mach 2.2, allowing it to strike fast-moving targets with precision. The missile carries a 3-kilogram high-explosive warhead with a proximity fuse, designed to detonate upon or near impact with the target. Weighing approximately 15 kilograms (33 lbs) with its launcher, the Stinger is highly portable, making it ideal for quick deployment in a wide range of combat environments. Additionally, the missile’s dual-mode infrared/ultraviolet seeker allows it to track both heat signatures and distinguish between targets and countermeasures, such as flares, making it a formidable air defense weapon. For Taiwan, acquiring more Stinger missiles is a critical part of its asymmetric defense strategy. With increasing pressure from Chinese military aircraft and drones near its airspace, these systems offer an affordable yet highly effective solution for Taiwan’s air defense. The addition of IFF systems ensures better coordination among various units and reduces the risk of friendly fire. Establishing local production would mark a significant step in Taiwan’s defense strategy, enhancing the island’s military industrial base and offering greater autonomy in replenishing and maintaining its missile systems. Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense, the manufacturer of the Stinger, is a key player in global defense and has provided this system to numerous countries over the years. As Taiwan continues to deepen its defense relationship with the U.S., Raytheon’s role in strengthening Taiwan’s air defense capabilities remains pivotal. With the geopolitical landscape in the Asia-Pacific region evolving rapidly, Taiwan’s procurement of additional Stinger missiles and the potential for local production underscore its commitment to enhancing its self-defense capabilities and maintaining peace through deterrence.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-considers-taiwan-for-potential-stinger-surface-to-air-missile-production-amid-rising-china-threats	2024-10-09T02:12:15-07:00

L3Harris Explores Maritime Version of Vampire Counter-Drone Defense System	Defense technology manufacturer L3Harris is exploring a maritime version of its Vampire counter-drone defense system to enhance naval protection against airborne threats. Initially designed as a truck-mounted platform to provide low-cost precision defense for ground forces, the Vampire gained recognition in 2022 as one of the first weapon systems supplied to Ukraine by the Pentagon. Simple and durable in design, the Vampire combines widely available 2.75mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Systems (APKWS) rockets from BAE Systems with an L3Harris Wescam MX-10D digital sensor equipped with a laser designator. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield (Picture source: L3Harris) L3Harris has announced the adaptation of this system into a version intended to provide an anti-drone solution for ships at sea. According to Jason Lambert, president of the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance division at L3Harris, demonstrations for maritime use are currently underway, with a version of the Vampire deployed on ships. These tests are taking place amid repeated drone and cruise missile attacks targeting U.S. warships in the Red Sea over the past year, described by Pentagon officials as the most intense naval combat involving the U.S. since World War II. Although combat vessels are equipped with multi-layered air defense systems, these systems primarily rely on costly missiles, of which ships can carry only limited quantities. Each Raytheon SM-2 missile used by the U.S. Navy costs approximately $2 million, while the larger SM-6 model exceeds $4 million. In contrast, the smaller and less expensive APKWS rockets used in the Vampire system offer a cost-effective option between long-range missiles and close-range defensive guns, optimizing cost per shot. The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield. By deploying, for example, four such autonomous vessels equipped with numerous rockets around a single main ship, L3Harris envisions an additional layer of protection against attacks. These Vampire units would be remotely controlled from the primary vessel, with human operators managing targeting and rocket guidance. The company is also examining the possibility of incorporating autonomy into the system to facilitate target identification. The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks (Picture source: L3Harris) The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks. Over the past year, U.S. warships have faced dozens of armed drone strikes conducted in saturation waves, which have been intercepted by naval air defenses and carrier-based fighters. Despite these efforts, civilian ships have been impacted, with some even sinking. Since deploying the Vampire in Ukraine, L3Harris has implemented several enhancements, including the addition of proximity fuses on APKWS rockets, eliminating the need for direct hits to neutralize targets. According to Lambert, feedback from Ukraine regarding the Vampire’s performance in combat has been 'extremely positive.' The Ukraine conflict has underscored the critical role of drones in modern warfare, with both sides deploying small drones extensively for reconnaissance, artillery adjustment, and anti-personnel and anti-armor strikes. Russia has also used waves of armed drones and cruise missiles to target Ukrainian civilian areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/l3harris-explores-maritime-version-of-vampire-counter-drone-defense-system	2024-10-09T01:30:49-07:00

The loan will primarily support the procurement of AH-64E Apache helicopters, significantly enhancing Poland's aerial combat capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Poland will soon be equipped with a fleet of Boeing 96 AH-64E attack helicopters. (Picture source: US DoD) This agreement marks the third FMF loan Poland has received in recent months, following a previous loan secured on July 1, 2024. Together, these arrangements bring the total U.S.-backed financial assistance for Poland's military to $7.08 billion. As the largest recipient of FMF loans in recent years, Poland is reinforcing its position as a leading NATO partner on the Eastern Flank amid regional tensions. The contract for the AH-64E Apache helicopters was signed on August 13, 2024. The newly secured loan is expected to expedite the delivery and integration of these state-of-the-art attack helicopters into the Polish Armed Forces. Known for their advanced targeting systems and combat capabilities, the Apaches will align Poland's military capabilities more closely with those of other NATO allies. American companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and General Electric are involved as offset providers in this program. They will transfer technologies to two aviation companies within the Polish Armaments Group (PGZ) domain. Execution contracts will be signed between these American companies and PGZ Capital Group entities, facilitating technology transfer and local industry participation. The contract is the largest in the history of the Polish Armed Forces and one of the most significant global procurement deals for attack helicopters. According to the U.S. Department of State's notification to Congress, the comprehensive package includes an extensive array of advanced equipment and weaponry designed to bolster Poland's military capabilities. This includes 37 AN/APG-78 Longbow fire-control radars, essential for enhancing the targeting precision of the Apache helicopters, and 96 AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency Interferometers (MRFI), which improve the helicopters' electronic warfare and threat detection abilities. In terms of armaments, the deal provides a substantial stockpile of munitions. Poland will acquire 1,844 AGM-114R2 Hellfire anti-tank missiles, renowned for their effectiveness against armored targets, and 460 AGM-179A Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM), which offer advanced multi-mode guidance for engaging a variety of threats. To strengthen air-to-air combat capabilities, the package includes 508 FIM-92K Stinger air-to-air missiles, allowing the helicopters to defend against aerial threats. Additionally, the agreement encompasses several thousand APKWS (Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System) guided rockets, which convert standard unguided rockets into precision munitions for greater accuracy and reduced collateral damage. Beyond weaponry, Poland has been approved to receive comprehensive logistic and training support packages, enhancing the operational readiness and sustainability of its new fleet. The inclusion of self-defense systems will improve the helicopters' survivability in hostile environments. Notably, the package also features Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) capabilities, enabling seamless coordination between manned helicopters and unmanned aerial systems for advanced reconnaissance and combat operations. The introduction of 96 AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters will significantly enhance the capabilities of Poland's Army Aviation but will also present training and logistical challenges. The offset program aims to assist Poland in maintaining the readiness of the Apache fleet. Training for Polish pilots and ground crews has already commenced, supported by the U.S. Army. Upon finalization, Poland will become the largest user of these helicopters within NATO. The AH-64E Apache Guardian, developed by Boeing, is the most advanced variant of the Apache attack helicopter series. It features significant upgrades in avionics, sensors, engines, and weapons systems. Powered by enhanced T700-GE-701D engines, the helicopter offers greater speed, agility, and payload capacity. Its advanced avionics suite includes data networking technologies that enable real-time communication and coordination with other aircraft and ground units, enhancing situational awareness and mission effectiveness.

Its versatile armament includes a 30mm M230 Chain Gun, up to 16 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, compatibility with the AGM-179A JAGM system, Hydra 70 unguided rockets, and AIM-92 Stinger missiles for air-to-air defense. This combination makes the AH-64E a highly effective platform for modern aerial warfare and reconnaissance missions. To support the operation and maintenance of the new helicopters, the Military Aviation Works No. 1 S.A. in Łódź will establish a Support Center capable of conducting maintenance at Organizational (O), Intermediate (I), and Depot (D) levels for selected helicopter components. A Center for the Operation of T700/CT7 family engines will be established at the company's branch in Dęblin, providing maintenance for engines used in the AH-64E and other helicopters in the Polish Armed Forces. Another PGZ Capital Group company, the Military Central Bureau of Construction and Technology S.A. (WCBKT S.A.) in Warsaw, will produce ground handling equipment for the aircraft. This equipment will be tested and certified by the manufacturer for compatibility with the AH-64E Apaches, enabling the use of locally produced equipment in operational processes. Poland's acquisition aligns with similar moves by other U.S. allies to bolster their fleets of AH-64E Apaches. South Korea recently approved a $3.5 billion purchase of 36 additional units. The United Kingdom has received 41 of its planned 50 helicopters, and Australia is preparing to introduce 29 AH-64Es into service. These developments highlight a growing reliance on the AH-64E within NATO and allied forces. Armed forces are increasingly interested in utilizing the AH-64E Apache to counter the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The helicopter's sophisticated sensors enhance its ability to detect, track, and engage small, fast-moving aerial targets like drones. Its agility and rapid response capabilities make it effective for intercepting UAVs that may pose threats to military assets or personnel, adding a critical layer to modern defense strategies. According to reports from The Military Balance and other sources, territorial defense and NATO membership are central pillars of Poland's defense policy. The primary focus of the 2017–2032 defense concept is to prepare the armed forces to deter Russian aggression, which is characterized as a direct threat to Poland and to a stable international order—a view intensified by Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Protecting the border with Belarus has also become an important mission for the Polish armed forces. To bolster its capabilities, Warsaw has increased defense spending to support modernization projects. The United States has significantly bolstered Poland's military capabilities through various arms sales and defense agreements in recent years. A cornerstone of this support is the acquisition of F-35A Lightning II stealth multirole combat aircraft. In January 2020, Poland signed a deal worth approximately $4.6 billion to purchase 32 F-35A fighters, with deliveries expected to begin in 2024. This acquisition aims to modernize Poland's air force by introducing fifth-generation aircraft with advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and network-centric capabilities, enhancing interoperability with U.S. and NATO forces. In addition to air capabilities, Poland has invested in strengthening its ground forces by procuring M1A2 Abrams main battle tanks. In April 2022, the U.S. approved the sale of 250 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks to Poland in a deal valued at up to $6 billion. These advanced tanks feature enhanced armor, upgraded communications systems, and improved firepower, significantly enhancing Poland's armored warfare capabilities. Delivery of these tanks is expected to begin in 2025. Poland has also enhanced its air and missile defense systems through the purchase of the Patriot air and missile defense system. In 2018, Poland signed a $4.75 billion agreement for the Patriot system, which includes the latest configuration with advanced radar technology and command-and-control systems. This system is a critical component of Poland's efforts to defend against ballistic and cruise missile threats. Furthermore, to augment its long-range precision fire capabilities, Poland acquired the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). In 2019, Poland signed a contract worth $414 million for 20 HIMARS launchers along with associated support and equipment. These systems enhance Poland's deterrence and defense posture on NATO's eastern flank by providing the capability to engage targets at extended ranges with high accuracy. Military cooperation between Poland and the United States has intensified, with the Polish government pursuing the goal of permanently stationing U.S. troops in the country. The U.S. Army's V Corps Headquarters (Forward) was established in Poznań at the end of 2020. A new coalition government may review ambitious plans to boost military personnel numbers to 300,000 by 2035 and to establish new divisions. Poland is one of the main European contributors to efforts supporting Ukraine, delivering a variety of defense equipment, including armor and anti-armor systems. These actions underscore the deepening defense partnership between Warsaw and Washington as Poland reinforces its defense posture facing Russia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/poland-to-become-europes-top-attack-helicopter-fleet-with-new-apache-ah-64e	2024-10-09T00:32:51-07:00

Greece purchases 592 US-made Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions for Special Forces	According to Doureios on October 10, 2024, Greece plans to acquire 592 units of Switchblade 300 Block 20 and Switchblade 600 loitering munitions from the United States. The Hellenic Parliament’s Special Permanent Committee on Armaments and Contracts approved this procurement on September 17, 2024, as part of a broader defense enhancement initiative.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Most of these Switchblade loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. (Picture source: AeroVironment) Greece's decision follows a series of strategic evaluations that began in December 2023, when the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA) approved a related study for the acquisition, upgrade, and modernization of military equipment. Initial considerations involved two companies: the Israeli firm Aeronautics, which offered the Orbiter 1K, and the American company AeroVironment, which manufactures the Switchblade. However, in late 2023, Greece opted solely for the Switchblade, a choice influenced by a shift in funding priorities. The initial plan to procure used AAV7A1 amphibious armored vehicles from the United States was 'frozen,' with the allocated funds redirected to the loitering munitions program. Specifically, $25 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) credits, provided under the U.S. European Recapitalization Incentive Program (ERIP), were repurposed to cover part of the Switchblade procurement costs. This funding was initially available to support Greece's transition away from its BMP-1 armored vehicles of Soviet origin. Additionally, Greece received a further $30 million in FMF credits as part of U.S. assistance for Greece’s support of Ukraine. Combined, these credits amount to approximately two-thirds of the €75.2 million total cost of the loitering munitions procurement, reducing Greece’s direct financial outlay. The acquisition involves both the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 models, which together total 592 units. Most of these loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 300 is a small, expendable loitering munition designed to provide platoon-sized infantry units with precision strike capabilities. This UAV assists units under enemy fire by engaging long-range targets, following a pre-programmed path, and allowing operators to redirect its course en route. It has been deployed to destroy light-armored vehicles and personnel, and it can detonate mid-flight if necessary. Utilizing a Ground Control Station (GCS) compatible with other AeroVironment UAVs, such as the Wasp, RQ-11 Raven, and RQ-20 Puma, the Switchblade 300 can be coordinated with other drones to locate and attack targets. Its forward-firing warhead minimizes collateral damage, with an option to adjust detonation height mid-flight. The system is considered a loitering munition rather than a UAV, as it is not recoverable and is controlled by a fly-by-radio frequency signal. Additionally, it has been paired with SRC Inc.’s software and counter-drone technologies, enhancing its capability to intercept hostile UAVs. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. With a gross weight of around 8 pounds, it supports land, sea, and mobile platforms, allowing rapid deployment in under two minutes. The Block 20 also features an improved Digital Data Link (DDL) for secure, encrypted communication, reducing signal interception risks, enabling concurrent operations of multiple Switchblade systems, and supporting extended range operations through additional UAVs. The Block 20 includes a Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL), which can remotely launch several units in configurations from 2 to 20 rounds, with reloading times of under 30 seconds per round. This configuration supports base defense and facilitates 'sensor-to-shooter' operations by transmitting mission plans from other AeroVironment UAVs. The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. It can travel up to 40 kilometers in 20 minutes, then loiter for another 20 minutes, giving it a total range of 80 kilometers. Its warhead is based on the Javelin anti-tank missile, and it operates at a speed of 185 kilometers per hour during the terminal phase of its flight. The Switchblade 600 is controlled through a tablet-based system with autonomous and manual modes, secured by encrypted data links and anti-spoofing GPS. It is also compatible with a pocket DDL module for longer-range engagements. As part of the Army's Single Multi-Mission Attack Missile development program, AeroVironment has been able to scale production to manufacture up to 6,000 Switchblade 600 units annually. This model can also be configured for a six-pack vehicle-mounted launcher or air-launch options, broadening its potential deployment scenarios. The agreement, valued at 3.47 billion euros, includes the procurement of 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters. (Picture source: US DoD) Greece’s procurement of these munitions is part of its larger ten-year defense spending strategy, which includes plans to acquire 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters, from the United States and a fourth Belharra frigate from France. The Switchblades are also intended to complement other weapons systems in Greece’s inventory, such as the Spike anti-tank missiles recently purchased from Israel, which will be stationed on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. In addition, Greece is developing its own drone and anti-drone technologies as part of a broader focus on modernizing its defense capabilities. The choice to procure Switchblade munitions directly from the United States rather than through domestic production has raised questions regarding the Greek defense industry’s capacity for developing similar technologies. While some efforts have been made to advance indigenous loitering munition projects, these remain at the initial design or early development stages. The Greek Armed Forces' reliance on foreign partners reflects current operational requirements that domestic capabilities have not yet met. This loitering munitions acquisition aligns with ongoing U.S.-Greece defense cooperation and has received approval from Greece's top foreign and defense decision-making body, the Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defense (KYSEA). The decision situates Greece’s defense procurement within the context of its relations with NATO allies and broader strategic objectives, as well as ongoing regional tensions with Turkey over maritime boundaries, airspace, and resource rights in the Aegean Sea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-purchases-592-us-made-switchblade-300-and-600-loitering-munitions-for-special-forces	2024-10-09T00:01:53-07:00

(Picture source: Sdelanounas) According to reports, the vessel sustained significant damage after water entered its engine compartment through what has been described as a 'mysteriously appeared hole in a gas duct.' The breach led to a critical malfunction, putting the ship out of service. This incident follows an earlier Ukrainian operation in April targeting the Russian missile ship Serpukhov in the same region, which involved the assistance of a Russian sailor opposed to the war. Minesweeper Aleksandr Obukhov The vessel has a displacement of 800 tons in standard load, which increases to 890 tons at full load. It measures 61.6 meters in length and 10.3 meters in beam at its widest point. The draft ranges from 2.6 meters at its shallowest to 3.6 meters at its maximum, with 3.1 meters at midship. Its propulsion system consists of diesel engines, specifically 2 M503B-1 'Zvezda' engines, alongside diesel generators including 2 ADGR-315/1500 OM4 units and 2 DGF2A 200/1500 units. The engines deliver a power output of 2,500 horsepower (1838 kW) each, with additional generators providing 315 kW and 200 kW respectively. The vessel uses two shafts, two controllable-pitch propellers (CPP), two bow thrusters (PU-100F), and two stern retractable azimuth thrusters (VPK-90F/70). The ship achieves an economical speed of 10 knots and a maximum speed of 16.5 knots, with a range of 1,500 nautical miles at 10 knots. It can remain at sea for 10 days and carries a crew of 44. The hull is made of fiberglass. For radar systems, the ship is equipped with the PAL-N radar. Its electronic warfare systems include the KS 'Ruberoid' system, Anapa sonar, the Structure-35 towed sonar array, and the Altyn-M navigation and surveillance system. It features one 30-mm AK-306 anti-aircraft gun, with 1,500 rounds of ammunition. Its missile defense consists of eight Igla-1 or Verba MANPADS, armed with 9M39 or 9K333 missiles. The ship's mine and torpedo systems include UDM, UDM-2, UDM-500, MTPK-1, MTPK-2, MRPK-1, PMR-1, PMR-2, OUKT, OUKT-B, PKT, PKT-B, SHAT-U, and the 'Gelatin' mine-towing simulator. It is also fitted with one 'Livadia-M' mine-hunting sonar. Additionally, the vessel operates an aviation group that includes Orlan-10 UAVs. Comments The incident occurred in Baltiysk, Kaliningrad—a strategic Russian exclave situated between Poland and Lithuania that serves as a crucial naval base hosting the Baltic Fleet and advanced military assets. The successful sabotage operation deep within Russian territory underscores several critical implications. Strategically, it exposes vulnerabilities in Russia's defense of key assets far from the immediate conflict zones. The disruption of a minesweeper like the Alexander Obukhov hampers Russia's ability to secure maritime routes in the Baltic Sea, potentially affecting both military operations and commercial shipping in the region. Psychologically, the incident demonstrates the reach and capabilities of Ukrainian military intelligence and special forces. This could lower morale within the Russian military and boost confidence among Ukrainian forces and their supporters. It reflects a shift towards asymmetrical warfare tactics, where unconventional methods are employed to target high-value assets, thereby altering the traditional dynamics of the conflict.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-baltic-fleet-minesweeper-disabled-in-ukrainian-sabotage-in-kaliningrad	2024-10-08T06:47:03-07:00	
Bundeswehr’s New Reconnaissance Vehicle Korsak Would Be Based on Piranha 6×6	The Bundeswehr is preparing to renew its fleet of reconnaissance vehicles for its military intelligence forces, with the Spähfahrzeug Next Generation project, or 'Korsak,' reportedly progressing on the Piranha 6×6 platform from General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS), as revealed by Hartpunkt. Selected over competitors including Rheinmetall’s Fuchs Evolution and KNDS’s Patria CAVS, the Piranha 6×6 outperformed its rivals during a rigorous bidding process. However, final vehicle approval will require the resolution of appeal periods followed by a parliamentary review of the '€25 million proposal.' If on schedule, the contract may be finalized by late 2024 or early 2025, marking it as a second Bundeswehr project involving the Piranha platform. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications (Picture source: GDELS) The Korsak project aims to partially replace the light, four-wheeled Fennek vehicles currently used by reconnaissance units. According to the Bundeswehr, up to 252 vehicles may be ordered, with an initial order of 92 units confirmed. The first two prototypes are anticipated by 2026, pending a swift contract conclusion. Production delivery of the remaining 90 vehicles would follow in 2027 and 2028, with an option for an additional 162 units. Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications. Compliant with Korsak project requirements, this version is expected to include amphibious capabilities, though it may reduce armored protection to STANAG 4569 Level 2, thereby optimizing mobility with a favorable power-to-weight ratio. The Piranha 6×6 features a unique engine configuration for a reconnaissance vehicle, placing the engine to the driver’s right, unlike the traditional rear placement. This design maximizes roof space for turret and sensor systems, enhancing weapon reach. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets, as showcased at Eurosatory 2024. This cannon provides variable firing modes and a rate of up to 600 rounds per minute. The initial version of the Piranha I 6×6 dates back to 1972, having been adopted by the Swiss Army and produced under license in Chile and Canada. The Canadian version is known as the AVGP and LAV I. Some Chilean Piranha I units were fitted with a 60 mm IMI HVMS (Hyper Velocity Medium Support) gun acquired in 1980, while Swiss Army models included the NM142 turret, capable of launching TOW anti-tank guided missiles. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets (Picture source: Swiss MoD) The latest model, Piranha V, was introduced in the early 2010s. Designed to protect against medium-caliber ballistic threats, it includes a modern electronic architecture for integrating various weapon systems, from medium-caliber automatic cannons to large-caliber fire-support guns. The Piranha V meets current mobility demands on challenging terrain, equipped with a powerful motor and independent suspension, allowing a top speed of 100 km/h and a range of 1,000 km. The Piranha V can transport up to 12 soldiers and is suitable for peacekeeping operations, infantry support missions, and complex interventions. Customization options include modular armor kits, active protection against RPGs and other anti-tank weapons, as well as an amphibious version. It has been adopted by forces in Denmark, Romania, and Switzerland. Korsak does not include anti-tank capabilities, which will instead rely on the troops’ portable weapons. Consideration is also being given to the future use of loitering munitions as an alternative. The vehicle will also include advanced communication systems for voice and data transmission across various frequency bands, enabling teams to relay reconnaissance information or request long-range fire support. The Bundeswehr’s mobility specifications require a maximum road speed of 100 km/h and a range of 1,100 km at a steady 60 km/h. While amphibious capability is preferred but not mandatory, the silent mode requirement remains flexible in terms of technology. Finally, the core reconnaissance mission of the Korsak will rely on an advanced sensor suite. The vehicle will be equipped with a range of optical, optronic, and acoustic sensors, as well as electromagnetic spectrum reconnaissance and self-defense tools.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/bundeswehrs-new-reconnaissance-vehicle-korsak-would-be-based-on-piranha-6-6	2024-10-08T06:11:55-07:00	
Japan JS Ariake and India INS Shakti conduct joint naval exercise in Bay of Bengal	According to information published by the Japanese MoD on October 8, 2024, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyer JS Ariake recently conducted a joint exercise with the Indian Navy replenishment ship INS Shakti in the Bay of Bengal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Murasame-class destroyer JS Ariake and Indian Deepark-class replenishment ship INS Shakti. (Picture source: Japanese MoD) India and Japan share growing concerns about the Chinese Navy's increasing presence in both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. These concerns are driven by China's aggressive territorial expansion, notably in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and its broader strategy to extend its influence across the Indo-Pacific region. For India, China's 'String of Pearls' strategy, which involves building partnerships and establishing naval facilities in countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Myanmar, is seen as an effort to encircle India and limit its influence in the Indian Ocean. China's increasing naval deployments, including submarines, in the Indian Ocean further fuel India's apprehensions. In response, India has been strengthening its maritime surveillance and increasing cooperation with allies, particularly Japan, to counter China's activities. Japan, similarly, faces direct threats from China, particularly concerning the disputed Senkaku Islands (known as Diaoyu in China). China’s assertive actions in the East China Sea and its growing military capabilities have led Japan to bolster its defense, particularly in its southwestern islands, and strengthen its security partnerships, notably through the Quad alliance, which includes India, Japan, the United States, and Australia. Both countries have responded to these threats by enhancing military cooperation. India and Japan recently signed a 10-year military pact that allows for greater coordination between their armed forces, particularly in naval operations. This pact is seen as a strategic move to counter Chinese assertiveness and is part of a broader effort to strengthen the Quad as a counterbalance to China in the region. The two nations regularly conduct joint naval exercises, such as the 'Malabar' exercises, to improve interoperability and readiness against potential Chinese threats. UNICORN India and Japan have recently strengthened their naval defense cooperation, focusing on key technology transfers and joint development projects. At the heart of these efforts is Japan’s decision to export the 'UNICORN' stealth antenna system to India, marking a significant step in their defense relationship. The UNICORN system, officially known as the Unified Complex Radio Antenna, integrates various communication and radar functions to enhance the stealth capabilities of naval vessels. This equipment, initially used on Japan’s Mogami-class frigates, will be installed on select Indian Navy ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-js-ariake-and-indias-ins-shakti-conduct-joint-naval-exercise-in-bay-of-bengal	2024-10-08T05:30:14-07:00

France Tests New Anti-Air Shield with Aster 30 B1NT to Strengthen Future SAMP/T-NG Defense System	On October 8, 2024, France conducted a pivotal air defense test within the Direction générale de l'armement (DGA) base in Biscarrosse. This strategic trial, part of Operation Mercure, marks the first launch of the Aster 30 B1NT missile against aerial targets simulating a complex threat scenario. The event was attended by French Minister of Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu and the General Delegate for Armaments, Emmanuel Chiva, underscoring the importance of this new generation missile for both French and Italian defense.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Aster 30 B1NT, a new-generation missile, is designed to upgrade the French-Italian SAMP/T NG air defense system and will also be used in naval defense within the PAAMS framework (Picture source: French MoD) The Aster 30 B1NT, referred to as 'new Technology,' is specifically designed to enhance the SAMP/T (Surface-to-Air Medium Range Land-based) NG ( New Generation) air defense system, a French-Italian collaboration. Additionally, it will be deployed in naval defense within the PAAMS (Principal Anti-Air Missile System) used by both nations. With this version, France aims to modernize its air defense capabilities to respond effectively not only to conventional aerial threats but also to more sophisticated ballistic missiles. During this test, targets were used to simulate a complex threat environment, demonstrating the system’s ability to react in high-stakes operational scenarios. The SAMP/T-NG marks an upgrade from the current SAMP/T, bringing enhanced interception capabilities for high-speed threats at ranges up to 150 kilometers and altitudes over 25 kilometers. Equipped with advanced radar and sensor systems, the SAMP/T-NG enables rapid detection and interception of threats, particularly hypersonic missiles, which pose specific challenges due to their high speed and maneuverability. This system is a critical component in European defense against modern missile threats. On September 23, 2024, France’s Air and Space Force announced an expedited timeline for the SAMP/T-NG’s deployment, now scheduled to begin in 2026. Developed in partnership with Italy, this advanced system reflects a joint commitment to counter evolving global security threats, including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. As part of the Eurosam consortium, defense companies MBDA and Thales played key roles in the project, supported by a €400 million contract awarded by the DGA in 2015 to develop the Aster 30 B1NT under the coordination of the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR).

North Korea has been increasingly investing in drone technology and advanced missile systems, which pose significant challenges to South Korea's security. By deploying the 'Cheongwang' system, South Korea can effectively counter these threats with precision and speed, strengthening its defensive posture and deterrence capabilities. Moreover, the high-energy laser system offers a cost-effective and efficient solution compared to traditional missile defense systems. Laser weapons have a virtually unlimited magazine, as they rely on electricity rather than physical ammunition, allowing for continuous operation against multiple incoming targets. This is particularly important in scenarios where North Korea might employ swarm tactics or saturation attacks to overwhelm conventional defenses. The 'Cheongwang' system's ability to engage numerous threats rapidly reduces the risk of successful attacks on South Korean territory and minimizes potential damage and casualties. In essence, the deployment of the HEL system is a strategic move to address the evolving nature of threats from North Korea, ensuring that South Korea remains resilient and prepared in the face of regional security challenges. The development of the 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system began as part of South Korea's efforts to bolster its defense capabilities against evolving aerial threats. Initiated in the early 2020s by the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), the project aimed to create an advanced laser weapon system capable of detecting, tracking, and neutralizing low-altitude aerial targets such as drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The Cheongwang HEL system represents a significant technological advancement in South Korea's defense arsenal, addressing the need for rapid and effective responses to modern warfare challenges posed by adversaries like North Korea. In terms of operational capability, the 'Cheongwang' high-energy laser is engineered for both precision and efficiency. Utilizing high-frequency laser beams, it delivers a rapid response against fast-moving threats with minimal collateral impact. The decision to opt for laser technology enables the system to operate effectively even in urban or high-density areas, where traditional interception methods might pose additional risks. The Block-I Cheongwang is a container-sized, land-based laser weapon system developed by South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) since 2019, with a budget of $63 million. Measuring 9 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 3 meters high (29.5 x 9.8 x 9.8 feet), it utilizes a 20 kW optical fiber laser capable of generating approximately 700°C heat during 10-20 second impulses. The system has an effective range of up to 3 kilometers and includes an integrated radar mast for target detection and tracking.

This decision marks a notable departure from Germany's previous stance, where arms exports to Turkey were drastically reduced in recent years due to concerns over Turkey's domestic policies under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and its increasingly strained relationship with NATO. Berlin had restricted weapons deals, citing Turkey's controversial foreign policy moves, including its alignment with Russia and China through initiatives like BRICS and its ties with Hamas. Türkiye - Germany relations One prominent area of cooperation has been Turkey's involvement in the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), a German-led project aimed at integrating Europe's missile defense systems. Turkey formally joined this initiative in early 2024. Additionally, discussions continue regarding Turkey's potential purchase of Eurofighter jets from Germany, though this deal remains subject to political negotiation. These defense ties are further supported by Germany’s strategic interest in strengthening NATO’s southern flank, particularly in the Black Sea region, where Turkey plays a pivotal role as a key NATO ally with significant naval capabilities​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/germany-resumes-major-arms-exports-to-tuerkiye-in-policy-shift	2024-10-07T07:29:27-07:00

The latest iteration occurred off South Africa's coast. Additionally, China and Russia’s naval engagements extend to collaborations with non-BRICS nations like Iran, conducting large-scale drills in the Gulf of Oman. These exercises showcase their growing ability to project power across the Indian Ocean, particularly in regions critical to global shipping routes. The focus of these drills has often been on anti-piracy operations, search and rescue missions, and broader maritime security.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-navys-frigate-neustrashimy-joins-south-african-navy-festival	2024-10-07T03:49:49-07:00	
US Army's 34-year-old unique ARES close air support aircraft still active for classified tests	On October 6, 2024, TaskForce23 observed a new flight of the unique Scaled Composites ARES (Agile Responsive Effective Support) aircraft near the Mojave Air and Space Port. This Close Air Support (CAS) concept demonstrator continues to serve as a research test bed for the US Army. Remarkably, it has done so for 34 years since its initial flight on February 19, 1990. The ARES maintains several features from its original design, including metallic leading edges, fairings, and a distinct patch of coating on the right tail.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link 34 years since its initial flight, the mysterious ARES maintains several features from its original design, including metallic leading edges, fairings, and a distinct patch of coating on the right tail. (Picture source: TaskForce23) The ARES (Agile Responsive Effective Support) was developed in response to a US Army request in the early 1980s for a Low Cost Battlefield Attack Aircraft (LCBAA), designed to fulfill roles requiring low-altitude, anti-tank battlefield support with long endurance and the ability to operate outside improved airfield environments. US Army aviators Jim Kreutz and Milo Burroughs initiated a study in 1981 to develop an aircraft with high maneuverability at low altitudes and stall resistance. Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites joined this effort, resulting in the development of the ARES under Model No. 151. The aircraft has a canard configuration, with a foreplane that provides pitch control. This foreplane is designed to stall before the main wings, enhancing safety during low-altitude operations. Although initially planned for a turboprop engine, the design was updated to use a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D-5 turbofan engine, producing 13.12 kN of thrust. This change addressed potential issues with debris ingestion during takeoffs and landings on unimproved surfaces. One notable feature of the ARES is its asymmetrical design. It mounts a GAU-12/U Equalizer 25 mm rotary cannon on the right side of the nose, with the engine intake located on the left. This layout minimizes the impact of the cannon's recoil on performance and prevents exhaust gases from entering the engine intake. The cannon is positioned in a concave recess beneath the cockpit to trap exhaust gases and balance recoil forces during firing. One notable feature of the ARES is its asymmetrical design, as this aircraft mounts a GAU-12/U Equalizer 25 mm rotary cannon on the right side of the nose, with the engine intake located on the left. (Picture source: Flickr/Corporate Flight Management) First flown on February 19, 1990, by Scaled Composites test pilot Doug Shane, the ARES has completed over 430 flight hours with the tail number/aircraft registration number N151SC. In November 1991, the ARES tested the GAU-12 Equalizer five-barrel 25 mm Gatling-type rotary cannon under a US Air Force contract, validating its Close Air Support (CAS) capabilities. This testing led to the cannon’s integration into various aircraft, such as the AC-130U Spooky gunship, the AV-8 Harrier II ground attack aircraft, and the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter. Despite its successful demonstrations, the ARES remained a private project as the military did not adopt it for operational use. However, it continues to function as a research test bed. After being stored in December 2000 at the Mojave Spaceport, the aircraft returned to flight on March 7, 2008, following Scaled Composites' acquisition by Northrop Grumman. The ARES remains active as a research test bed, providing services in conceptual design, aerodynamic analysis, structural design, systems integration, and experimental flight testing. In 2020, the ARES was observed flying alongside its successors, the Model 401 'Son of Ares' jets, over the Mojave Desert, showcasing a reflective metallic-like surface coating. This aligns with previous tests involving reflective coatings, possibly related to research on aircraft signatures against sensor systems such as infrared search and track technologies. The Proteus testbed platform by Scaled Composites has also conducted similar flights, equipped with large pods believed to house electro-optical systems.

(Picture source: The War Zone) Defense-related flight testing in the southwest U.S. desert has increased, with Scaled Composites' testbed jets actively participating. Observations of aircraft, such as F-15s equipped with infrared spectrum data-collection test pods, suggest research into infrared search and track systems or low-power laser technologies. Additionally, the ARES has also played the role of a fictional German jet, the ME-263, in the film 'Aces: Iron Eagle III' released in 1992. Specifications for the ARES include a length of 8.97 meters, a wingspan of 10.67 meters, and a height of 2.99 meters. Its wing area is 17.5 square meters, with an empty weight of 1,308 kilograms and a maximum takeoff weight of 2,767 kilograms. Equipped with a single Pratt &amp; Whitney JT15D turbofan engine, the ARES reaches a maximum speed of 750 kilometers per hour at 7,620 meters and has a service ceiling of 10,668 meters. Its combat range is 1,110 kilometers, with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.43 at maximum weight. The ARES is capable of carrying a 25 mm GAU-12/U Gatling cannon and has provisions for air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder or AIM-92 Stinger, as well as unguided rockets and other air-to-ground weapons. Its design emphasizes low-altitude performance and the ability to operate from unimproved airfields, meeting the goals of the original LCBAA program. The aircraft features twin boom-mounted vertical fins for directional stability and uses a canard for pitch control. The structure is composed primarily of fiberglass composite over a foam core, a fabrication technique developed by Scaled Composites. The flight controls are mechanical, and the engine includes a backup mechanical fuel control to maintain control in the event of electrical system failure.

Armenia Eyes South Korea's K2 Main Battle Tank Adapted for Mountainous Terrain	According to an article by the South Korean media outlet Chosun Biz, dated October 4, 2024, Armenian Defense Minister Suren Papikyan visited South Korea in September 2024 to explore the possibility of acquiring K2 Black Panther main battle tanks developed by Hyundai Rotem. This visit also allowed the Armenian minister to attend the 2024 High-Level Meeting on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence (REAIM), organized by South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 9 and 10.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: South Korea MoD) According to the Armenian Military Portal, Papikyan also used this visit to initiate discussions on the supply of South Korean weapons, with a particular interest in the K2 tank. Furthermore, the Armenian media outlet Caliban reports that Armenian Security Council Secretary Armen Grigoryan also traveled to South Korea on September 6 to hold several meetings focused on weapons procurement issues. The K2 main battle tank, currently used by the South Korean Army, features a semi-active pneumatic suspension system, an advanced technology that is especially well-suited to mountainous terrains. In Armenia, where nearly 86% of the territory is mountainous, this capability could provide a significant strategic advantage by enhancing the mobility and precision of troops in combat. Additionally, the tank is equipped with a sensor that automatically adjusts the suspension based on the terrain, further improving accuracy and crew comfort. Currently, according to Military Balance 2024, Armenia’s armored fleet comprises older models, including approximately 109 main battle tanks: 3 T-54s, 5 T-55s, around 100 T-72A/Bs, and 1 T-90A, all inherited from the Soviet era and modernized by Russia. However, it is important to note that these figures may be subject to caution due to losses sustained in the fighting since 2020 in Nagorno-Karabakh. Although these tanks remain in service, the acquisition of the K2 would enable Armenia to acquire state-of-the-art equipment to address persistent tensions with Azerbaijan, a neighboring country with which it has experienced repeated conflicts during the 2020s. In Europe, the K2 tank is already being deployed in Poland, where Hyundai Rotem has become a strategic defense partner. In August 2022, Poland reportedly signed a contract for the delivery of 180 K2 tanks, of which 46 have already been delivered this year, and a new agreement to supply an additional 180 units is under discussion. Romania is also reportedly considering the acquisition of this tank as part of a military modernization program. In competition with the German Leopard 2A8, the K2 has a price advantage, estimated at 26.2 billion won, compared to approximately 60 billion won for the Leopard 2A8, according to available estimates. South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: South Korea MoD) The K2 Black Panther tank was developed in South Korea to achieve self-sufficiency in defense production, replacing the aging M48 Patton tanks. Launched in 1995, this project aimed to create a tank suitable for fast, network-centric maneuver warfare. Hyundai Rotem spearheaded its development, and the tank officially entered service with the South Korean Army (ROKA) in 2014 after extensive testing and prototyping phases. To date, approximately 410 units have been produced across multiple production batches, securing the K2’s place in South Korea’s national defense framework. The K2 is armed with a 120mm 55-caliber smoothbore gun, capable of firing various munitions, including APFSDS rounds and HEAT shells. Thanks to its autoloading system, it can achieve a firing rate of 10 rounds per minute, with a total capacity of 40 rounds. It is also equipped with a Korean-developed munition, the KSTAM (Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition), designed for top-attack strikes against targets within a range of 2 to 8 kilometers. Secondary armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, enhancing its capabilities against both armored and soft targets. Powered by a water-cooled 12-cylinder diesel engine generating 1,500 horsepower, the K2 can reach a maximum speed of 70 km/h on roads and 50 km/h on rough terrain. It has an operational range of approximately 450 kilometers and can accelerate from 0 to 32 km/h in 7 to 9 seconds, depending on the engine model. Its advanced in-arm suspension unit (ISU) allows it to adjust its height and posture, improving its handling over various terrains and expanding its gun elevation range. The K2’s passive protection includes composite armor made of MIL-12560H steel and silicon carbide ceramic plates, supplemented by modular Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Non-Explosive Reactive Armor (NERA) packages. Additionally, the tank is equipped with an overpressure system to defend against chemical and biological threats, an automatic fire suppression system, and neutron shielding to protect the crew from radiation exposure. For active defense, the K2 is equipped with radar and laser warning receivers that detect threats such as anti-tank guided missiles. Upon detection, it can release multispectral smoke grenades, which obscure its position from enemy targeting systems. Under the K2 Product Improvement Program (PIP), future upgrades are planned, including a hard-kill active protection system capable of intercepting incoming projectiles before impact. Primarily operated by the South Korean Army, the K2 has also been acquired or adapted by countries such as Poland and Türkiye. Variants such as the K2GF, customized to Polish military specifications, and the Altay, developed for Türkiye with South Korean technological support, demonstrate this international expansion. Other proposed models, like the K2EX for global export, the K2ME for the Middle East, and the K2NO for Norway, offer specific modifications to meet regional conditions and operational requirements. South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: Army Recognition) According to Military Balance 2024, Armenia has significantly increased its defense budget, allocating USD 1.28 billion for 2023, marking a 46% rise from the previous year. This budget is expected to reach approximately USD 1.4 billion in 2024. Historically dependent on Russia for its military equipment, Armenia is now diversifying its suppliers, partly due to Moscow’s inability to fulfill deliveries agreed upon in 2021, as Russia has redirected resources to meet domestic needs driven by the conflict in Ukraine. To address this shortfall, Armenia has signed several major contracts with India, including the purchase of 90 ATAGS 155mm towed howitzers, an undisclosed number of Pinaka multiple-launch rocket systems, and Akash air defense systems. Armenia is also transitioning to Western defense standards, incorporating NATO-standard artillery, adopting Western military training methods, and embracing advanced command-and-control structures. As part of this shift, Defense Minister Suren Papikyan attended the Paris Air Show in June 2023, signaling Armenia’s growing interest in sourcing defense equipment from the West. France, in particular, has expressed openness to arms sales to Armenia. Before the escalation of hostilities with Azerbaijan in 2023, Armenia had already begun distancing itself from Russia as its primary security guarantor. This shift became evident in 2022 when Moscow declined to intervene during a significant border clash between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In response, Yerevan invited an EU monitoring mission while rejecting a similar proposal from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). The EU Mission in Armenia currently consists of 103 civilian personnel deployed until January 2025, with a possible extension. Furthermore, Armenia has effectively frozen its participation in CSTO activities, underscoring its move away from Russian-led security arrangements.

Turkish president sends off Oruç Reis seismic research ship on mission to Somalia	According to information published by the Turkish presidency on October 5, 2024, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attended a send-off ceremony for Turkey's domestically developed seismic research vessel, Oruç Reis, as it departed for a mission in Somalia. The vessel's deployment follows an agreement signed in March between Turkey's Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and Somalia's Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. This agreement covers onshore and offshore exploration blocks in Somalia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Turkish President Erdogan salutes the departure of the research ship Oruc Reis in Istanbul. (Picture source: Turkish presidency) Accompanying this vessel are two G-class frigates, TCG Gediz and TCG Gokova, which are providing vital naval protection throughout the mission. These frigates, modernized versions of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class, have been extensively upgraded with advanced systems, including the GENESIS combat management system, to enhance their operational capabilities in complex maritime environments. This deployment underscores Turkey's strategic interests in the Horn of Africa, where it has secured exploration rights in a 15,000-square-kilometer maritime zone off Somalia. The mission, expected to last around seven months, will see the Oruc Reis carrying out 3D seismic surveys in multiple license areas. The collected data will be critical in identifying potential drilling sites for future extraction operations. The presence of Turkish naval forces highlights Ankara’s commitment to safeguarding its energy interests, particularly in regions where security risks, such as piracy or regional conflicts, remain high. This operation not only supports Turkey's expanding influence in Africa but also demonstrates the country's broader ambitions to secure energy resources beyond the Mediterranean, where the Oruc Reis previously conducted controversial explorations. Background The Oruc Reis research vessel has been at the center of several contentious explorations, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey's energy ambitions have brought it into direct conflict with neighboring countries such as Greece and Cyprus. The disputes largely stem from overlapping claims to Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) in the resource-rich waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's controversial exploration missions began in 2020, when the Oruc Reis was deployed in areas around the Greek island of Kastellorizo, a region claimed by both Greece and Turkey under competing interpretations of maritime boundaries. Turkey argues that islands should not have full EEZs, a stance that diverges from the positions held by Greece and Cyprus, which rely on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Turkey is not a signatory to UNCLOS and insists on a more flexible interpretation of maritime boundaries to secure its interests in the region These operations escalated tensions between Turkey and Greece, prompting responses such as naval deployments, diplomatic protests, and calls for EU sanctions against Turkey. Several near-miss military encounters occurred during this period, including confrontations between Turkish and Greek naval vessels. The situation became so heated that NATO intervened to establish a deconfliction mechanism to prevent accidental clashes between the two NATO allies​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/turkish-president-sends-off-oruc-reis-seismic-research-ship-on-mission-to-somalia	2024-10-07T02:22:05-07:00

Leidos Successfully Tests Launch of Black Arrow Low-Cost Small Cruise Missile from AC-130J Ghostrider Gunship	On October 3, 2024, Leidos, an American company specializing in defense and advanced technology, unveiled the 'Black Arrow,' a small cruise missile designed to meet the growing needs for flexibility and versatility on the battlefield. Designed for both kinetic and non-kinetic missions, this new system stands out for its low cost and adaptability, offering a wide range of military applications. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Leidos Black Arrow Low-Cost Small Cruise Missile (Picture source: Leidos) Launched in 2021, this program builds on Leidos' experience with small munitions such as the GBU-69, used on AC-130 aircraft, as well as the X-61 Gremlins program developed in partnership with the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA). This project allowed Leidos to test an air vehicle capable of being launched from a C-130 and then recovered mid-flight, demonstrating its expertise in integrating innovative technologies on existing platforms. In 2022, Leidos signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) to advance the development of the Small Cruise Missile (SCM). The SCM is designed to be an economical, modular platform suited to the missions of various branches of the armed forces, with an architecture that facilitates future updates and responds to both kinetic and non-kinetic objectives. According to Leidos, this flexibility allows for a variety of launch options, including ramps, pallets, or conventional systems, depending on tactical needs. As part of its development, the Black Arrow recently completed a series of separation and captive-carry tests aboard an AC-130J Ghostrider, a support aircraft renowned for its firepower. These tests confirmed the weapon’s ability to safely detach from its launcher, as well as the reliability of its trajectory, flight software, navigation, and safety systems. These favorable results pave the way for guided flight tests scheduled for this fall, which will be critical for validating the Black Arrow's flight behavior under real conditions and finalizing necessary technical adjustments before its deployment. The competitive landscape also plays a role in the development of this missile, as other companies, such as Anduril Industries, are also working on low-cost, large-scale cruise missile solutions. This dynamic underscores the importance for Leidos to offer innovative, competitive solutions by integrating components from diverse sources to maintain its leading position in the defense industry. The growing popularity of munitions launched from transport aircraft, such as the AGM-158 JASSM and the Rapid Dragon system, also highlights the strategic interest in this launch type, an approach that could transform the projection capabilities of the U.S. Air Force. Indeed, projection capabilities are radically transformed by the introduction of small cruise missiles like the Black Arrow. Traditionally, missile strikes relied on specialized fighter aircraft, limited in number and range. However, with systems like the Black Arrow, transport aircraft can now serve as launch platforms using ramps or pallets. This innovation allows transport aircraft, such as the C-130 and C-17, to be converted into offensive platforms, significantly increasing the number of military vehicles capable of carrying out precision strikes. Adding this capability provides valuable tactical flexibility. Unlike fighter jets, often too visible in heavily monitored environments, transport aircraft can discreetly deploy missiles in high-tension areas. This gives military forces greater autonomy to strike remote targets quickly, even in the absence of forward bases. This flexibility is particularly strategic for close support missions or operations where surprise and speed are essential. Finally, this approach creates uncertainty for the adversary, who must now consider the possibility that transport aircraft may also be equipped for missile strikes. This new dynamic complicates enemy defense strategies, as it forces opposing forces to rethink their targeting priorities, knowing that an apparently harmless transport aircraft can also carry formidable strike capabilities. Consequently, small cruise missiles like the Black Arrow not only redefine military logistics but also the strategic projection of forces in contested environments, while optimizing engagement costs and flexibility. However, some analysts believe that, in the event of a major conflict, transport aircraft could be primarily mobilized for logistics missions, limiting their use for missile strikes. Mark Miller, Leidos’ Vice President of Missile and Aviation Solutions, highlighted that the rapid development of the Black Arrow benefited from the company’s experience with previous projects, such as the GBU-69 and the DARPA X-61 Gremlins program. These projects illustrate Leidos’ commitment to innovative initiatives, with a particular focus on agility and operational performance.

(Picture source: Canadian DoD) The HMCS Charlottetown (FFH 339) is one of twelve Halifax-class frigates designed for multi-role operations, particularly excelling in anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Technically, this frigate is equipped with advanced sonar systems and weapons that are critical for tracking submarines like the Russian Improved Kilo-class (Project 636.3). The Charlottetown utilizes the SQS-510 Hull-mounted sonar and SQR-501 CANTASS (Canadian Towed Array Sonar System), both of which allow for long-range passive detection of underwater threats. The ship also deploys the AN/SQR-19 towed array sonar, enhancing its capability to detect low-frequency noise emitted by submarines. Supporting these systems is the RUM-139 VL ASROC (Anti-Submarine Rocket) system, which delivers a lightweight torpedo via rocket to a target submarine's location, providing immediate engagement capabilities. The ship can also engage with Mk 46 torpedoes, fired from its twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo launchers. A critical advantage is the CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, which operates off the frigate's deck, extending its ASW range through the deployment of sonobuoys and its own dipping sonar. This combination makes the Charlottetown a formidable opponent in underwater tracking. On the other hand, the Improved Kilo-class submarine (Project 636.3) is among Russia’s most advanced non-nuclear submarines, known for its ultra-quiet operation, especially in shallow or coastal waters. This submarine’s stealth characteristics are enhanced by its MGK-400EM sonar suite and low-noise propellers. Equipped with six 533mm torpedo tubes, it can launch both standard torpedoes and Kalibr cruise missiles, giving it significant strike capabilities. The Kilo-class is designed for multiple mission profiles, including anti-shipping and intelligence-gathering, making it a considerable challenge for ASW forces.

About the propulsors The propulsors used in the Virginia-class submarines are a key component of their advanced stealth capabilities. Unlike traditional submarines that utilize open-bladed propellers, Virginia-class submarines are equipped with pump-jet propulsors. This modern propulsion system minimizes noise by reducing cavitation, the phenomenon where vapor bubbles form and collapse due to rapid changes in pressure around the blades of traditional propellers. These pump-jet systems are quieter because they operate with a ducted fan inside a nozzle, which shields the blades from direct contact with the water, preventing the loud popping sounds caused by cavitation. This makes the Virginia-class more effective in covert operations and in environments requiring stealth, both in deep-ocean and littoral (coastal) areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/bae-systems-secures-us-navy-contract-for-virginia-class-submarine-propulsors	2024-10-04T02:43:20-07:00

Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, Micheál Martin, described the budget as a reflection of the government’s commitment to meeting the recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the Independent Review Group, focusing on both the modernization of the Defence Forces and enhancing Ireland’s defense capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In terms of equipment and infrastructure, the Irish 2025 budget outlines several key projects, including the delivery of an Airbus C295W transport aircraft for the Air Corps. (Picture source: Airbus) The budget for 2025 includes €215 million in capital spending, the highest level of capital funding the Defence Forces have received to date, and €805 million allocated to current expenditure. A central focus of the budget is the recruitment of an additional 400 members to the Permanent Defence Forces. Despite this goal, the current force strength remains below the established target of 9,500 personnel, with approximately 7,500 members presently serving. The government has also set a longer-term objective to expand the force to 11,500 members by 2028. The budget provides €469 million for personnel pay, including salaries for new recruits, such as €49,552 for Graduate Cadets, €44,216 for School Leaver Cadets, and €40,297 for a Private 3 Star or Able Seaman. Additionally, €3.2 million will be allocated for advertising to support recruitment efforts. In terms of equipment and infrastructure, the 2025 budget outlines several key projects, including the delivery of an Airbus C295W transport aircraft for the Air Corps. This aircraft is intended to support transport and evacuation missions and may be supplemented by the potential acquisition of a third C295 airlifter. Other aviation-related allocations include €8 million to support the Air Corps in fleet maintenance, airfield operations, and training costs. The Irish government is also in the process of replacing two ex-UK Royal Navy offshore patrol vessels with decommissioned inshore patrol vessels from the Royal New Zealand Navy. (Irish MoD) Further capital spending will be directed toward enhancing Ireland’s air and maritime surveillance capabilities. One major project is the development of a military radar system to provide airspace monitoring. The radar project, which will involve multiple sites and is expected to cost more than €250 million, will proceed over several years. This system is intended to detect unauthorized aircraft in Irish airspace, though the budget does not include provisions for acquiring combat aircraft to intercept such threats. In addition, the budget includes funding for subsea monitoring systems to safeguard critical underwater infrastructure, such as data cables and energy interconnectors, an area that has been a growing concern due to international tensions. The government’s broader defense strategy aligns with the recommendations from the Commission on the Defence Forces, particularly its Level of Ambition 2 (LOA2) concept. This plan involves a proposed capital investment of €2.465 billion over the next decade, averaging €247 million annually. The LOA2 recommendations emphasize the need for heavier armored vehicles for the Army to replace the current fleet of MOWAG Piranha armored personnel carriers by 2030, as well as improvements in coastal radar surveillance and the replacement of three older vessels in the Irish Navy’s fleet. The government is also in the process of replacing two ex-UK Royal Navy offshore patrol vessels with decommissioned inshore patrol vessels from the Royal New Zealand Navy. Personnel support remains a key priority, with €329 million allocated for Defence Forces veterans' pensions and their dependents. There is also €6 million set aside for the Tribunal of Inquiry established to investigate allegations of sexual abuse and bullying within the Defence Forces. The inquiry, which stems from the Independent Review Group’s report, will continue its work through 2025 with this funding.

Although progress is being made with the construction of new ships like the Type 31 frigates and the Dreadnought-class submarines, these projects face significant delays and logistical bottlenecks. As a result, older ships must remain in service longer than anticipated, which increases maintenance costs and risks operational readiness​. Another critical challenge is funding. While the UK government has committed to expanding the fleet, a significant budgetary shortfall remains. For example, many programs, including the development of new frigates and support ships, are still unfunded. This creates a scenario where the Navy must carefully balance immediate needs with long-term investments, often leading to compromises that prioritize cheaper options over operationally optimal solutions​. The Navy also faces substantial workforce challenges. Recruitment and retention of skilled personnel have become increasingly difficult, particularly in technical fields. This problem is exacerbated by the push towards lean crewing and automation, which, while improving efficiency, also introduces cyber vulnerabilities and places additional strain on the workforce​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/hms-agamemnon-newest-astute-class-submarine-launched-by-royal-navy	2024-10-03T06:08:48-07:00	
KAI Poised to Secure Support Contract for Philippine FA-50PHs	The Philippines is set to sign a performance-based logistics (PBL) contract with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to support its fleet of FA-50PH light combat aircraft. This deal marks a first for KAI, as it is the first PBL contract awarded for an aircraft exported by South Korea. KAI has received a notice of award for this task, representing a new milestone in the defense cooperation between South Korea and the Philippines. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Introduced to the Philippines in 2013, the FA-50 Fighting Eagle is equipped with advanced ejection seats, sophisticated weapons control systems, and long-range detection and tracking capabilities (Picture source: PAF) The FA-50 is a light combat aircraft developed by KAI, derived from the T-50 Golden Eagle, originally designed as a supersonic advanced trainer and light attack aircraft. It is in service with several air forces, including those of South Korea, Poland, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. A cost-effective and capable platform, the FA-50 offers performance levels comparable to higher-end fighter aircraft. Equipped with advanced systems, the FA-50 features a tandem cockpit for two crew members, night vision imaging capabilities, modern avionics with inertial navigation and GPS, and a multifunction radar. It can carry up to 4.5 tons of weapons, including AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, JDAM precision-guided bombs, and a 20mm internal cannon. Powered by a General Electric F404-GE-102 turbofan engine, the aircraft can reach a maximum speed of Mach 1.5. The FA-50PH variant used by the Philippines enhances their air defense capabilities with similar features, making it a key asset for their air force. The initial agreement covers a one-year period, valued at approximately 27 billion won (around $20 million). It includes the supply of spare parts, maintenance, inventory management, and other essential services to support the Philippine Air Force’s 12 FA-50PH aircraft. This pilot phase is intended to serve as the foundation for securing longer-term, multi-year contracts in the future. The significance of this contract is reinforced by the high availability rates of the FA-50s during the recent Pitch Black exercise in Australia, thanks to the client support provided by KAI. This experience has allowed KAI to leverage its expertise in PBL contracts, developed over the years with similar programs for the South Korean military, including the T-50 series, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the KUH-1 Surion utility helicopter. KAI estimates that over a 30-40 year lifespan, the follow-up support costs of the aircraft could range from two to five times the original acquisition price. The performance-based support model is expected to benefit both parties by enhancing the operational capabilities of the aircraft while reducing long-term operating costs. KAI President Kang Koo-young stated that this contract with the Philippines could serve as the foundation for future international PBL contracts, enabling KAI to expand its maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services to other countries operating FA-50 or similar systems. In August 2024, KAI signed a memorandum of understanding with Thai Aerospace Industries to provide local support for the Royal Thai Air Force’s T-50TH advanced jet trainers. The company also hopes to secure a PBL contract for these aircraft. Introduced to the Philippines in 2013, the FA-50 Fighting Eagle is equipped with advanced ejection seats, sophisticated weapons control systems, and long-range detection and tracking capabilities. Measuring 13 meters in length and 9 meters in wingspan, the aircraft is powered by a General Electric turbofan engine, allowing it to reach a maximum speed of 1,852 km/h.

US Open to Selling F-15 Fighter Jets to Türkiye: A Possible Alternative if the Eurofighter Deal Fails	According to information from TurDef on October 3, 2024, defense relations between Türkiye and the U.S. could take a significant turn with the potential sale of F-15 fighter jets to Ankara. When asked about the possibility of Türkiye acquiring Boeing F-15C Eagle or F-15EX Eagle II fighters, U.S. sources expressed openness to the idea, stating, 'We would love to sell our jets to Türkiye.' However, the same sources clarified that no meetings or official requests have taken place regarding the potential sale of F-15s.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-15C Eagle assigned to the 44th Fighter Squadron returns from a training sortie at Kadena Air Base, Japan, Dec. 20, 2022 (Picture source: US DoD) Interest in the F-15s has emerged as Türkiye explores alternatives to its previous plans to acquire Russian fighter jets and its more recent focus on the Eurofighter Typhoon, a deal supported by the United Kingdom. However, reports indicate that Germany, a partner in the Eurofighter program, may oppose the acquisition behind the scenes, raising concerns that the deal could fail. In such a scenario, the F-15s could become a viable option for Türkiye. While the U.S. is open to the sale of these aircraft, any such transaction would likely be contingent on resolving the ongoing issue surrounding the S-400 air defense system, which Türkiye purchased from Russia in 2019. This acquisition led to the imposition of CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) sanctions and Türkiye’s removal from the F-35 program. Under U.S. law, specifically the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021 and Section 1241 of CAATSA, sanctions can only be lifted if Türkiye relinquishes the S-400 systems, removes Russian personnel involved in their maintenance, and guarantees that it will not attempt to reacquire them in the future. Without these assurances, progress in negotiations for F-15 sales would remain stalled. The S-400 issue continues to be a major obstacle in U.S.-Turkish defense relations. Recently, Greek media reported that the U.S. proposed stationing the S-400 systems at Incirlik Air Base in Türkiye to bypass the impasse. This suggestion was firmly rejected by Ankara, which refuses any relocation of the S-400 systems. U.S. sources confirmed that this idea would not resolve the underlying issue, as the U.S. requires full compliance with CAATSA and NDAA provisions to lift the sanctions. An F-15EX Eagle II from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron, 53rd Wing, takes flight for the first time out of Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., April 26, 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) Despite these challenges, there is cautious optimism about a possible post-CAATSA era in U.S.-Turkish defense relations. U.S. sources believe that, once sanctions are lifted, opportunities for cooperation could expand, particularly in the defense industry. 'There is a lot of potential for deeper cooperation in this field, as we know Turkish defense companies employ highly skilled engineers and produce excellent equipment,' one source noted. The source also mentioned potential interest in exploring the integration of Turkish products into U.S. platforms, depending on how the situation evolves. In the meantime, negotiations are underway for a $23 billion deal between Türkiye and the U.S. as part of a modernization program for the Turkish F-16 fleet. This deal includes the acquisition of AIM-120 C-8 AMRAAM missiles, AN/APG-83 AESA SABR radars, as well as other weapons such as GBU-39/B bombs, AGM-88B and AGM-88E missiles, AIM-9X Block II missiles, and JDAM kits. These discussions, initially expected to conclude in June, are still ongoing, partly due to the complexity of the CAATSA-related issues. Additionally, questions remain about the F-35 program, from which Türkiye was excluded. Six F-35 jets originally intended for Türkiye remain stored at U.S. air bases, where they are regularly maintained. U.S. sources have declined to provide details on the storage costs but confirmed that the jets are kept operational. Regarding the possibility of Türkiye rejoining the F-35 program, the option is still on the table, although current political and legal conditions have yet to allow progress in this direction.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-open-to-selling-f-15-fighter-jets-to-tuerkiye-a-possible-alternative-if-the-eurofighter-deal-fails	2024-10-03T05:23:21-07:00

(Picture source: Belgian MoD) REPMUS is not a typical naval exercise. It serves as an annual gathering of NATO members, scientists, and leading technology firms, all focused on experimenting with groundbreaking autonomous systems. This year’s exercise placed a particular emphasis on unmanned systems like drones and autonomous vessels, capable of tasks ranging from mine detection to drug interdiction and search-and-rescue missions. The 2024 edition saw participation from 26 navies, alongside over 30 scientific institutions and companies. Belgium's Very Shallow Water (VSW) team played a significant role in the exercise. Specializing in mine detection in shallow waters, the team used an underwater drone to locate hidden objects on the seabed. After conducting initial surveys, the team assessed the objects and investigated them further using drones with cameras or divers. The team also tested new technology to improve the efficiency of their operations, significantly speeding up tasks that once took hours of manual labor. During the exercise, emerging systems were also tested that will be deployed on Belgium’s future mine countermeasure vessels. In partnership with industry and academia, Belgium's defense forces are researching technologies for detecting floating mines, with earlier tests having been conducted on drones equipped with advanced sensor and camera systems. Given the differences between the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean—especially in terms of visibility, wind, and currents—REPMUS24 provided a critical opportunity to test floating mine detection in challenging conditions. Belgian Navy unmanned systems The Belgian Navy is advancing its use of unmanned systems, with particular emphasis on improving mine countermeasures and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) capabilities. Through the rMCM (replacement Mine Countermeasures) program, Belgium, in collaboration with the Netherlands, is replacing its older minehunters with new vessels that are equipped with a range of unmanned systems. These systems, which include underwater, surface, and aerial drones, are designed to enhance the detection and disposal of underwater mines.

The Mi-8 HIP helicopter serves as the primary launch platform for the FPV-equipped systems. Known for its robust performance and adaptability, the Mi-8 HIP offers the necessary mobility and payload capacity to support these advanced defense operations. The helicopter's ability to operate in diverse weather conditions and its extensive range make it an ideal asset for the Black Sea Fleet's new counter-USV initiatives. The Black Sea region has become a focal point for maritime security due to its strategic significance and the increasing presence of unmanned systems. The deployment of FPV technology-equipped Mi-8 HIP helicopters underscores the Black Sea Fleet's commitment to maintaining maritime dominance and ensuring the security of its naval operations against emerging threats posed by USVs. By leveraging FPV technology, the Black Sea Fleet aims to enhance its maritime security framework. The ability to swiftly identify and engage USVs minimizes the risk of hostile activities, including surveillance, sabotage, or potential attacks on naval assets. This proactive approach not only strengthens the fleet's defensive posture but also serves as a deterrent against adversarial maneuvers in the region. Black Sea Control of the Black Sea has become a critical issue in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The strategic importance of the Black Sea lies in its ability to influence military operations, economic activities, and the broader geopolitical landscape. Russia initially held the upper hand with its dominant Black Sea Fleet, especially following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. This move not only deprived Ukraine of a significant portion of its navy but also gave Russia greater control over the region's maritime activities. However, since the full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has employed innovative tactics to challenge Russian dominance. This has included the use of naval drones and long-range missile strikes, which have significantly impacted Russia's operations. The sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva and attacks on the Black Sea Fleet's headquarters in Sevastopol have forced Russia to reposition much of its fleet eastward, away from the reach of Ukrainian missiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/black-sea-fleet-deploys-mi-8-hip-helicopters-to-counter-unmanned-surface-vehicles-using-fpv-technology	2024-10-03T02:22:47-07:00

South Korea and Japan resume joint maritime resource talks after 40-year hiatus	According to information published by The Korea Herald on September 26, 2024, Seoul and Tokyo are set to reignite discussions on joint maritime resource development in the East China Sea, marking the first such dialogue in nearly 40 years.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The talks focus on undersea resource exploration beneath the continental shelf south of Jeju Island, an area that has long been contested for its untapped reserves of petroleum and other minerals. This significant development comes just months before Japan could potentially issue a termination notice for their 1974 agreement, which established a joint development zone (JDZ) covering 82,557 square kilometers of the East China Sea. The agreement, which was designed to mitigate disputes over maritime boundaries, is set to expire in June 2028 unless one party opts out with three years’ notice. The last formal discussions were held in 1985, with negotiations stalling due to economic and legal challenges. Japan, citing concerns about the viability of the resources in the JDZ, had resisted further engagement. However, pressure from South Korea and the looming deadline for potential termination have brought Japan back to the table. In this latest round of talks, both countries are expected to reassess the economic potential of the area and explore possibilities for new joint research initiatives. The discussions, however, will remain centered on the implementation of the existing agreement, rather than on its potential extension. The talks will be led by high-level representatives from both countries' foreign and energy ministries, with South Korea expected to emphasize the importance of continued exploration efforts, despite past setbacks. While Japan's stance remains uncertain, the resumption of dialogue signals a cautious willingness to revisit the long-dormant collaboration. The outcome of these talks could shape the future of resource development in the East China Sea, as both nations weigh their options ahead of the agreement’s possible termination. South Korea - Japan relations Naval relations between South Korea and Japan have seen notable improvement in recent years, largely driven by shared security concerns, particularly North Korea's growing nuclear threat. Both countries, along with the United States, have been increasingly involved in trilateral military exercises, which serve to enhance cooperation and interoperability among their naval forces. One key development has been the institutionalization of joint exercises, such as the 'Freedom Edge' drills, which involve complex, multi-domain operations spanning naval, air, and cyber domains. These exercises not only improve operational coordination but also signal a unified stance against regional threats, especially from North Korea, whose missile tests have escalated regional tensions. These trilateral exercises often involve advanced assets, including aircraft carriers and Aegis-equipped destroyers, underscoring the seriousness of the security environment. However, the historical tension between South Korea and Japan, stemming from Japan's colonization of Korea (1910-1945), continues to be a sensitive issue. Efforts to improve relations, such as resolving incidents like the 2018 patrol aircraft dispute, have been crucial for the countries to move forward in their defense cooperation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/south-korea-and-japan-resume-joint-maritime-resource-talks-after-40-year-hiatus	2024-10-03T01:13:58-07:00

Iranian Media Alleges Destruction of Israeli F-35 Fighters in Missile Strike	On October 2, 2024, a series of reports and videos began circulating on social media, particularly on Telegram and X, claiming that Iranian missiles had successfully targeted and destroyed Israeli airbases, including entire squadrons of Lockheed Martin F-35I Adir fighters. These claims, mostly propagated by Iranian state media, quickly gained traction among pro-Iranian supporters. The claims followed Iran’s largest missile attack on Israel to date, with more than 180 missiles launched. The strikes, involving Fattah-1 and Kheybarshekan missiles, were said to be larger and more complex than those carried out in April.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35I is a customized version of the F-35A, featuring Israeli-made modifications to its avionics, electronic warfare systems, and weapons. (Picture source: Israeli Air Forces) Israel was the first country to select the F-35 through the U.S. government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program after signing a Letter of Agreement in October 2010. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) named the F-35 'Adir,' meaning 'The Mighty One' in Hebrew. On June 22, 2016, the IAF received its first F-35 Adir. The Israeli F-35 fleet was declared operational in December 2017, marking the end of an intensive integration and training effort at Nevatim Airbase, Israel. Israel’s procurement of the Lockheed Martin F-35I 'Adir' began with a formal agreement in 2010, making it the first country to acquire this aircraft via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The first batch of nine F-35Is became operational with the IAF in December 2017. By November 2022, Israel had 36 F-35Is in service, including a unique testbed version for integrating Israeli-made systems. These aircraft, based at Nevatim Airbase, are part of three operational squadrons. The F-35I is a customized version of the F-35A, featuring Israeli-made modifications to its avionics, electronic warfare systems, and weapons. The stealth capabilities, advanced sensor systems, and versatility of the F-35I provide Israel with significant advantages in situational awareness, precision targeting, and combat effectiveness. In May 2018, Israel became the first country to use the F-35 in combat, demonstrating its operational capabilities. Despite these speculations, Israeli authorities quickly claimed that most of the missiles had been intercepted and destroyed, minimizing damage and avoiding any casualties in Israel. Iranian propagandists, however, insisted that significant damage was inflicted, particularly at Nevatim Airbase, home to two F-35I squadrons, claiming it had been completely destroyed. Videos showing missiles targeting Tel Aviv and footage purportedly showing damage to F-35s in Gaza further fueled the controversy. Satellite image of Nevatim Air Base before the Iranian strikes on September 19, 2024. (Picture source: Esry) The Israeli military acknowledged that some of its airbases were hit during Iran’s massive ballistic missile attack but clarified that the strikes did not impair the operational capacity of the IAF. Missiles caused minor damage to offices and maintenance areas at the bases, but critical infrastructure and aircraft remained unaffected. The attack involved about 200 ballistic missiles, but most were intercepted by Israeli and U.S. defense systems, limiting the damage. Several experts pointed out that these claims lack verifiable evidence. According to Dr. Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of public communication at American University, while it is possible that some missiles struck Israeli airbases, the claim that dozens of F-35s were destroyed appears to be fabricated. Braddock also referenced reports of a protest by Palestinian activists at a factory producing F-35 components, though this seemed to have little impact on production. Despite doubts, disinformation continued to spread on social media. Exaggerated claims of Iranian success were widely shared, lending further credibility to the initial reports. This resulted in a mix of misinformation and disinformation. According to Braddock, misinformation occurs when individuals share images or videos believing them to be true without critically evaluating the content. In contrast, disinformation involves a deliberate effort to spread false information for strategic purposes. Satellite image of Nevatim Air Base after the Iranian attacks with the various visible impacts, October 3, 2024 (Picture source: X Channel @ClashReport) In this case, it is likely that Iranian state media and its operatives engaged in a coordinated campaign to present a fictional narrative, using false or exaggerated claims to reinforce the perceived success of the missile strikes. Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor at the University of New Haven, emphasized that these campaigns aim not necessarily to convince the public of outright lies but to create confusion by flooding the media with contradictory information. This tactic aims to overwhelm individuals with data, making it harder to discern truth from falsehood. Even if Israeli authorities were to counter these claims by providing evidence of minimal damage, such as photos of largely intact airbases, there is a risk that this too would be dismissed as misinformation. In this way, Tehran could gain a short-term advantage by casting doubt on Israel's defensive capabilities and downplaying the ineffectiveness of its missile attack. In reality, reports indicate that while not all Iranian missiles were intercepted, those that reached their targets caused minimal damage, with no casualties in Israel. This outcome is likely embarrassing for Iran, whose missile attack failed to achieve the level of destruction it may have intended. However, by spreading exaggerated claims about the effectiveness of the attack, Iranian propagandists seek to shift the narrative in their favor, creating the perception that the strikes were far more successful than they actually were.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iranian-media-alleges-destruction-of-israeli-f-35-fighters-in-missile-strike	2024-10-03T00:47:11-07:00

Spain's UAV Navigation Joins European Future Combat Air System Program	Spanish company UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía has officially announced its participation in the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program, one of Europe's most ambitious defense initiatives. The FCAS program aims to develop a Next-Generation Weapon System (NGWS), integrating both manned combat aircraft and remotely piloted air systems, all connected through an advanced Combat Cloud. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía contributes to FCAS under Pillar 3, focusing on remote operators (Picture source: BAE Systems) This integration seeks to ensure air superiority in future conflicts by combining human and unmanned assets into a coordinated cloud-based network. The program was initially launched by France, Germany, and Spain to develop a new generation of combat aircraft that will replace current fighters such as the French Rafale and the German and Spanish Eurofighter by 2040. The core of the program is the development of a 6th-generation fighter, known as the New Generation Fighter (NGF), which will be integrated with drones and other remotely operated systems. FCAS was conceived in 2017 through the efforts of France and Germany, with Spain joining later. The main industrial partners are Dassault Aviation, Airbus Defence and Space, Thales, and Indra. Dassault is in charge of the NGF, while Airbus oversees the development of the Remote Carriers (drones) and the Combat Cloud to enable coordination between these systems. The overarching goal is to maintain Europe's air dominance while meeting the needs of future conflicts. UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía contributes to FCAS under Pillar 3, focusing on remote operators. The company collaborates with SATNUS Technologies SL, a consortium made up of GMV, Sener Aeroespacial, and Tecnobit-Grupo Oesía. SATNUS is responsible for maturing technologies and reducing risks related to the development of remotely piloted components of the NGWS. Airbus GmbH leads this pillar at the European level, while MBDA oversees French involvement, and SATNUS heads Spanish efforts. UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía's key contribution is providing its autopilot system for the Manned-Unmanned Teaming &amp; Common Systems Demonstrator (MCSD). This demonstrator, led by SATNUS, is crucial for advancing the Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUT) architecture, allowing for the integration of human and remotely piloted systems. The MCSD is part of the first phase of technology demonstrations within FCAS, testing and validating new technologies. Despite its ambitious scope, the FCAS program has faced challenges. Tensions between French and German industrial partners have led to significant delays. Dassault and Airbus have disagreed over task allocation, particularly regarding flight controls and stealth technology, pushing back the program's completion date from 2040 to possibly 2050. Additionally, disagreements over industrial workload, funding, and Germany’s reluctance to arm certain drones have caused further complications. These internal challenges are compounded by political differences among the participating countries. Germany, historically more pacifist and cautious about certain military aspects like nuclear deterrence, differs from France in its vision for the offensive capabilities of the future aircraft. Therefore, FCAS still faces political and industrial hurdles that must be overcome to ensure the success of this crucial European defense project. UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía's autopilot system will play a vital role in the technical development, integration, and operation of remotely piloted systems, helping them meet the stringent requirements of the FCAS program. This collaboration showcases the importance of European defense companies working together to develop cutting-edge solutions for future combat scenarios, which may help overcome some of the challenges currently faced by the program.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/spains-uav-navigation-joins-european-future-combat-air-system-program	2024-10-02T04:54:46-07:00	
Japan to unveil new submarine at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries naming and launch ceremony	According to information published by the Japanese MoD on October 2, 2024, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will host the naming and launch ceremony for the fifth Taigei-class submarine at its Kobe shipyard. The official name of the vessel will remain undisclosed until the conclusion of the ceremony.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Navy's Taigei-class submarine. (Picture source: Japanese MoD) The Taigei-class submarines represent a significant advancement in Japan’s undersea warfare capabilities, succeeding the Soryu-class within the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). Designed to improve stealth, endurance, and combat efficiency, these submarines showcase cutting-edge technology while maintaining a traditional diesel-electric propulsion system, supported by the innovative use of lithium-ion batteries. The shift to lithium-ion batteries allows the Taigei-class submarines to operate underwater for longer periods compared to their predecessors, without the need for an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. This is particularly important for enhancing the stealth profile, as it reduces the need to surface frequently, thus minimizing detection risks. Additionally, these batteries offer higher energy efficiency and are compact, allowing for more effective power management during extended missions. Structurally, the Taigei-class maintains a similar size to the Soryu-class but incorporates a redesigned pressure hull made from high-strength steel, enhancing its durability under extreme underwater pressure. The acoustic signature has been further reduced through the use of new sound-absorbing materials and a floating floor structure, ensuring quieter operations—critical for stealth missions in contested waters. On the operational side, the Taigei-class submarines are equipped with advanced sonar systems that improve detection capabilities, especially in tracking other submarines and vessels in complex maritime environments. The combat management systems have been upgraded to integrate various sensors and weapons more seamlessly. These submarines carry an array of armaments, including the Mitsubishi-built Type 89 torpedoes and UGM-84 Harpoon Block II missiles, providing both anti-submarine and anti-ship strike capabilities. The lead vessel, JS Taigei, entered service in 2022 and serves as a test platform for future JMSDF submarine technologies, while its successors like Hakugei and Jingei are fully operational units	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japan-to-unveil-new-submarine-at-mitsubishi-heavy-industries-naming-and-launch-ceremony	2024-10-02T04:22:12-07:00	
Lockheed Martin Given Authority to Choose Contractor for F-35 Fighter Jet’s Power and Thermal Management System Program	In an official statement released on October 1, 2024, the Joint Program Office (JPO) revealed that Lockheed Martin has been identified as the only entity capable of successfully leading the next phase of the Power and Thermal Management Upgrade (PTMU) program, following a 'comprehensive market research' conducted this year.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Power and Thermal Management Upgrade program, PTMU. (Picture source: Pratt &amp; Whitney) The JPO also specified that 'the contract award for the upcoming phase of the PTMU program is expected in Fall 2024.' In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, the goal will be to ensure that all available PTMU solution options are evaluated in terms of performance and economic feasibility for integration into existing aircraft, thereby maximizing fighter capability while taking budgetary constraints into account. However, the statement did not clarify whether Lockheed Martin will have the authority to choose the contractor responsible for the Power and Thermal Management System (PTMS). The current PTMS, manufactured by Honeywell, has shown limitations in meeting the growing needs of the F-35 program, particularly due to additional electronic upgrades associated with the Block 4 of the aircraft. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) had already raised concerns in a May 2023 report, indicating that the current PTMS is 'overtasked.' This forces the F135 engine to operate 'beyond its design parameters,' leading to increased engine wear and high maintenance costs. Over the projected 58-year lifespan of the F-35 program, these costs could reach up to $38 billion. Collins Aerospace, another company under RTX, has proposed an alternative solution with its Enhanced Power and Cooling System (EPACS). The company stated in 2022 that it would be ready to enter an engineering and manufacturing development phase for EPACS by mid-2024 if a tender was launched. Although Collins seems prepared to take on the challenge, the JPO's direction in selecting the new PTMS system remains to be seen. At the same time, the Pentagon made a significant decision regarding the future of F-35 propulsion. It opted not to adopt the engines developed under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) by Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE Aerospace. While these engines promised a 30% performance improvement over the F135 engine, they were not compatible with the F-35B variant used by the Marine Corps, which requires short take-off and vertical landing capabilities. Adapting them to the Navy's F-35C variant would have also posed technical challenges. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall expressed his regret last year that the service could not include the development and production of the AETP engines in the fiscal year 2025 budget request. However, the Pentagon insisted on maintaining compatibility among all F-35 variants for both U.S. and international users, leading to the choice of the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) as the preferred solution. Despite the abandonment of the AETP program, Pratt &amp; Whitney claims that the ECU will incorporate many innovations developed under AETP. A company spokesperson emphasized that 'over 1,200 F135 engines have been produced, with over 900,000 flight hours logged.' These figures highlight the significance of this engine for the global F-35 fleet. The PTMU program and the decisions surrounding the future of the F-35’s energy and cooling management system will play a crucial role in optimizing the aircraft’s performance and reducing long-term maintenance costs. Fall 2024 will mark a pivotal moment with the contract award and the start of the next development phase for the F-35, one of the most costly and strategic armament programs in the United States.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/lockheed-martin-given-authority-to-choose-contractor-for-f-35-fighter-jets-power-and-thermal-management-system-program	2024-10-02T03:30:38-07:00	
India set to finalize deal for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets after major price cut	According to information published by Times of India on September 30, 2024, India is on the verge of sealing a deal with France for the acquisition of 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets, which are expected to enhance the Indian Navy's operational capabilities aboard its aircraft carriers.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Rafale-M fighter aircraft. (Picture source: Dassault) After a series of negotiations spanning over a year, a final price has been reached, marking a considerable reduction from initial estimates. The agreement, anticipated to be signed soon, is closely modeled on the 2016 contract that saw the Indian Air Force acquire 36 Rafale jets. Discussions around the deal have gained momentum ahead of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval's visit to Paris, where talks will likely cover both the fighter jets and a separate order for three additional Kalvari class submarines to be constructed in Mumbai. These discussions are set within the framework of India and France's robust defense partnership. The Rafale Marine jets are intended to operate from India's aircraft carriers, addressing a critical requirement for 26 carrier-borne fighters. Following extensive evaluations of both Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and Dassault's Rafale M, the Indian Navy opted for the Rafale on technical grounds. The aircraft is seen as a suitable complement to the Air Force's fleet, and will be equipped with advanced anti-ship weaponry and long-range fuel tanks optimized for maritime operations. Additionally, the Rafale Ms will come equipped with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, one of the most advanced systems of its kind in the region. The acquisition is being conducted through the government-to-government route, similar to the previous deal for the Air Force. Recent amendments by the Defence Acquisition Council, led by Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, streamlined the process. This included the removal of plans to integrate Indian radar and weapon systems into the naval jets, a decision made due to the high costs and an estimated eight-year timeline for completion. While this purchase of Rafale Marine jets is seen as a temporary solution, it bridges the gap until India's Aeronautical Development Agency completes its indigenous twin-engine deck-based fighter project.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/india-set-to-finalize-deal-for-26-rafale-marine-fighter-jets-after-major-price-cut	2024-10-02T02:29:03-07:00	
Imminent Stationing of Nearly 100 Leopard 2 A8 Tanks in Lithuania: A New Force Against Russian Threat	On October 1, 2024, Lithuanian Minister of National Defense, Laurynas Kasčiūnas, reaffirmed in an interview with the television channel LRT the government's intention to order Leopard 2 main battle tanks by the end of the year. This statement marks a crucial step in a project that has been ongoing since the beginning of the year, initiated under the leadership of Arvydas Anušauskas, the previous Minister of Defense. Anušauskas had previously announced the formation of a Lithuanian tank battalion designed to be fully interoperable with German forces. During initial discussions, it was determined that the Leopard 2 A8 was the most efficient and suitable tank to meet the requirements of the Lithuanian Army.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) The Leopard 2A8 is the latest evolution in the Leopard 2 family of main battle tanks, developed by German companies KMW and Rheinmetall. This modern tank is equipped with a 120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun, capable of firing a variety of munitions, including the programmable DM11 for precise strikes. The Leopard 2A8 also features an advanced protection system, integrating next-generation multi-layered armor and the Israeli Trophy Active Protection System (APS), providing an effective defense against anti-tank missiles and rockets. The tank boasts impressive mobility thanks to its 1,600-horsepower engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 70 km/h and overcome various obstacles, with an operational range of 450 kilometers. In terms of crew protection and safety, the Leopard 2A8 is equipped with reinforced armor, particularly around the turret and hull, to enhance its resistance to mines and other modern threats. Its advanced fire control system allows for exceptional precision, even while on the move, and its optical systems, such as third-generation thermal imaging, ensure increased visibility in adverse conditions. Additionally, this tank is equipped with an NBC protection system against nuclear, biological, and chemical threats, ensuring the survival of the crew in hostile environments. Lithuania aims to build a powerful land division capable of addressing the region's growing security needs. In July, Kasčiūnas spoke about strengthening the heavy combat capabilities of the Lithuanian army, mentioning the possible acquisition of a tracked infantry fighting vehicle in addition to the Leopard 2. However, he also noted that the number of combat vehicles to be ordered would depend directly on available financial resources, indicating that the extent of the project would be contingent on the budget. The Leopard 2 A8, the latest version of the renowned German battle tank, was first presented to the public during the Eurosatory 2024 exhibition. Minister Kasčiūnas confirmed that the platform selected for equipping Lithuanian forces would undoubtedly be the Leopard. At the same time, Lithuania seeks to enhance its military arsenal with the acquisition of other vehicles and systems, including Boxer armored personnel carriers (known as Vilkas in Lithuania) and air defense systems. However, the current priority remains the establishment of this tank battalion, in close cooperation with Germany. Negotiations on the contract for these tanks are progressing rapidly. Kasčiūnas indicated that the Lithuanian National Defense Council would meet by the end of October to finalize decisions related to this acquisition project. The minister also hinted that negotiations with the KNDS consortium, responsible for producing the Leopard, were already well advanced. If the Council gives the green light, the contract could be signed as early as November 2024. Protection features of the Leopard 2A8 include multi-layered armor combining steel, tungsten, composite filler, and ceramic components, along with the EuroTrophy Active Protection System (APS) for 360-degree coverage against projectiles. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Cooperation with Germany involves two major aspects. Firstly, the Lithuanian tank battalion will be structured similarly to that of the German army, with 44 tanks divided into three companies. With a small reserve added, Lithuania's order would amount to around 50 tanks, a number previously discussed during preliminary talks. Secondly, Lithuania will acquire the same modernized version of the Leopard 2 A8, identical to the one that will equip the German tank battalion. On the German side, the tank battalion of the combat forces brigade, which is expected to reach full operational capacity by 2027, will also be equipped with Leopard 2 A8 tanks, with deliveries starting in 2025. This battalion will be outfitted with 44 Leopard 2 A8 tanks, ensuring a formidable strike force. Thus, by 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces. This strategic deployment is particularly critical in a sensitive area: the Suwalki Corridor, a narrow strip of land linking the Baltic states to the rest of Europe and separating Belarus from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. This region represents a crucial point in NATO's defense against potential threats from Russia. By strengthening its military capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment such as the Leopard 2 A8, Lithuania aims to increase its defense autonomy while reinforcing its integration into NATO's military framework. This project reflects the country's commitment to adapting to new security realities and being ready to respond effectively to any potential escalation of regional tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/imminent-stationing-of-nearly-100-leopard-2-a8-tanks-in-lithuania-a-new-force-against-russian-threat	2024-10-02T02:06:36-07:00

The Iron Dome uses radar to identify threats and assess if they are likely to hit populated areas. If a threat is confirmed, a Tamir interceptor is launched to neutralize it. The cost per interception is estimated between $40,000 and $50,000. IRON DOME, the most deployed air defense system, has intercepted 5000+ rockets with an over 90% success rate since 2011. (Picture source: Rafael) David’s Sling: This more advanced system covers medium to long ranges, intercepting short-range ballistic missiles and large-caliber rockets. Its Stunner interceptor can neutralize targets up to 300 kilometers away. Unlike the Iron Dome, the Stunner does not carry an explosive warhead but destroys its target through direct impact, increasing interception accuracy. However, the cost per interception is significantly higher, around $1 million per missile. Arrow 2 and Arrow 3: These systems are designed to intercept medium- to long-range ballistic missiles, including those reaching the exo-atmosphere. Arrow 3, in particular, can intercept missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere, neutralizing potential threats equipped with weapons of mass destruction. The cost of intercepting a missile with the Arrow 2 or Arrow 3 can reach up to $3.5 million per missile. Each layer of the system is designed to address specific types of threats, providing in-depth defense. Sophisticated radars and command and control centers coordinate efforts to ensure maximum coverage.

However, videos circulating show missiles hitting the ground, raising several questions: System Saturation: Iran launched nearly 200 missiles in a single wave over a few hours, potentially attempting to overwhelm Israel's defenses. Even with an advanced system, there is a limit to how many threats can be addressed simultaneously. Evolving Threats: Iran may have used hypersonic Fattah missiles, capable of maneuvering and traveling at speeds up to Mach 13-15, which present a significant challenge for current interception systems. These missiles are designed to be difficult to detect and intercept. While Arrow 3 is intended to counter such threats, hypersonic technology complicates early detection and interception efforts. Engagement Strategy: Israel’s defense systems prioritize threats based on their trajectory. If a missile is predicted to land in an unpopulated area, it may be left unintercepted to preserve costly interceptors for more critical threats. Operators may choose not to intercept certain missiles to conserve resources, especially if they do not directly threaten lives or critical infrastructure. However, reports of missiles hitting a military base in Nevatim may suggest otherwise. Video of the missile impacts in Israel pic.twitter.com/OZPLMe5zEn Cost and Logistics: Intercepting each missile carries a significant financial cost. In the context of a massive attack, decision-makers must balance the use of available resources with the need to protect the most sensitive areas. The presence of Iranian missiles that reached Israeli soil does not necessarily indicate a failure of the defense system. It may reflect the physical limitations of the system, which can only handle a certain number of missiles at a time due to reaction times and available interceptors. The Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, highlighted the challenges faced by Israel’s air defense system. While largely effective in intercepting the majority of the missiles, the system is not foolproof. The saturation effect from a large number of missiles, the introduction of new adversary technologies, and logistical and financial constraints are all factors that can allow certain threats to pass through the defense network. This situation underscores the importance for Israel to continue investing in research and development to improve its defense capabilities while adapting its strategies to evolving threats. Ongoing cooperation with international partners, such as the United States, also remains crucial to maintaining a technological and operational advantage, as well as participating in joint defense efforts during such events.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-under-iranian-fire-how-air-defense-withstood-wave-of-ballistic-missiles	2024-10-02T01:36:10-07:00	
Philippines Strengthens Its Defense with Indian BrahMos Supersonic Missiles and Twin-Missile Launchers	On September 25, 2024, BrahMos Aerospace unveiled for the first time at the ADAS event a model of the mobile BrahMos launcher that will be operated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

This configuration contrasts with the three-missile launchers used by the Indian Armed Forces. The displayed model also featured jungle camouflage, adopted by the AFP for its tropical operations. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BrahMos Supersonic Missile and its Twin-Missile Launcher (Picture source: Philippines MoD) According to the Twitter account Noise Alerts, the first batch of BrahMos supersonic missiles was delivered to the Philippines on April 19, 2024. Transported by an Indian Air Force IL-76TD aircraft, these missiles were delivered to the Philippine Marine Corps in Manila, accompanied by ground launch systems. This delivery, part of a $375 million agreement signed in 2022, marks the first time India has exported the BrahMos missile system. The Philippine Marine Corps confirmed that each BrahMos missile battery would consist of only two missile launchers. The BrahMos cruise missile, named after the Brahmaputra River in India and the Moscow River in Russia, is the result of a joint development between India and Russia. Based on the Russian SS-N-26 (3M55 Oniks/Yakhont/Bastion) missile, this supersonic missile is designed to engage land and sea targets with remarkable precision. BrahMos Aerospace, the company responsible for its development, was established in 1998 as a joint venture between India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyeniya. The BrahMos missiles will be operated by the Coastal Defense Regiment of the Philippine Marines. A BrahMos Aerospace representative stated to AMR that all deliveries are expected to be completed by next year. He also highlighted that India is considering replacing the imported Tatra vehicles with Indian-origin models for future deliveries. The BrahMos missile is equipped with a conventional warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kg, capable of delivering impact energy nine times greater than that of subsonic cruise missiles. The BrahMos missiles can be fitted with either a high-explosive semi-armor-piercing warhead or a submunition payload weighing between 200 and 300 kg. They can be launched from vertical or ramp launch systems, or in the case of the submarine version, from submerged vessels. In 2013, the missile was successfully tested from a submerged barge, demonstrating its capability to be deployed on missile-armed submarines. The Philippines announced the agreement with BrahMos Aerospace in January 2022 for the acquisition of three missile batteries. This contract, valued at $375 million, also includes operator and maintenance training as well as an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package. The requirement for this advanced weapon system was formally conceptualized in 2017 and approved by the Office of the Philippine President for inclusion in the Horizon 2 Priority Projects in 2020. In India, BrahMos Aerospace was also selected to supply next-generation long-range mobile coastal maritime batteries to the Indian Navy under an agreement signed in March 2023, valued at $200 million. The BrahMos missile, also designated as PJ-10, is a joint military project between India and Russia, combining the expertise of DRDO and NPO Mashinostroyeniya. In service since 2001, it can be launched from various platforms, including submarines, ships, fighter jets, and land-based mobile launchers. It can reach supersonic speeds between Mach 2 and Mach 3. Since India's induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 2016, versions of the BrahMos missile have achieved increased ranges of up to 900 km, compared to 290 km for the export version. With its stealth capabilities, advanced guidance system, and fire-and-forget mode, the BrahMos represents a major asset in modern arsenals. This phase of BrahMos deliveries to the Philippines not only strengthens military cooperation between India and Southeast Asian countries but also boosts the Philippines' coastal defense capabilities in the face of growing regional threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/philippines-strengthens-its-defense-with-indian-brahmos-supersonic-missiles-and-twin-missile-launchers	2024-10-02T00:58:37-07:00	
What Missiles Were Used in Iran's Strike on Israel?	On October 1, 2024, a large-scale attack orchestrated by Iran hit Israeli soil, marking a significant turning point in the ongoing conflict between the two nations. As part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' Iranian forces deployed a vast arsenal, including 120 ballistic missiles (including Emads), 170 drones, and 30 hypersonic missiles, among them the Fatah-2.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images of Emad MRBMs launched at Israel during Operation True Promise 2. (Picture source: Iranian Media) The 120 ballistic missiles used in this attack notably included the Emad, a medium-range missile capable of striking targets nearly 1,700 kilometers away with improved accuracy. Thanks to its terminal guidance system, these missiles can adjust their trajectory in the final phase of flight, thus increasing their effectiveness. This coordinated attack also saw the use of 170 drones, another crucial component of Iran’s military strategy. Drones have become indispensable weapons in modern warfare, and Iran’s attack on Israel featured a significant number of them. However, the most concerning aspect of this offensive lies in the deployment of 30 hypersonic missiles, a first in this conflict. Among them, the Fatah-2 was used for the first time in a conflict. This hypersonic missile, capable of flying at a speed of Mach 13, stands out due to its ability to evade conventional defense systems thanks to its high-speed maneuverability. With an estimated range of 1,400 kilometers, the Fatah-2 can not only reach its targets in record time but it is also designed to change course during flight, making interception extremely difficult. Its payload, tailored for precision strikes, makes it a formidable weapon for attacks on critical infrastructure. This coordinated offensive severely tested Israeli defense systems, notably the Iron Dome and Arrow anti-missile batteries. While these systems successfully intercepted part of the ballistic missiles and drones, the threat posed by hypersonic missiles like the Fatah-2 remains a significant concern. Current anti-missile defense systems struggle to keep up with these ultra-fast weapons, giving Iran a clear strategic advantage in its pursuit of deterrence against Israel. So far, no precise figures have demonstrated how effectively the Fatah-2 was intercepted, but Iranian officials have claimed that 90% of the means employed in the attack reached their targets. The October 1 attack thus marks an escalation in hostilities between Iran and Israel, not only due to the impressive quantity of weaponry deployed but also because of the advanced quality of these attack systems. Iran has demonstrated its ability to carry out a complex offensive, integrating drones, precision ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles, thereby pushing the limits of Israeli defenses. The drones disrupted detection systems and weakened rapid response capabilities, while Emad ballistic missiles and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles targeted infrastructure. The Emad-1, in particular, is a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) developed by Iran and used since 2015 by the Aerospace Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGCASF). It represents an important milestone in Iran’s ballistic capabilities, being one of the first weapons of its kind to incorporate an advanced guidance system, thus improving its accuracy compared to previous models. The Emad-1 missile is powered by liquid fuel, a technology that, while older than solid propellants, allows for greater flexibility in adjusting parameters before launch. With a diameter of 1.25 meters, the Emad is designed to carry a single warhead, enabling it to strike targets up to 1,700 kilometers away. This range allows it to hit targets across much of the Middle East, including Israel, with notable precision. Indeed, the missile boasts a circular error probable (CEP) of 50 meters, meaning its margin of error at impact is relatively small, a significant improvement over older ballistic systems. This makes the Emad a formidable weapon for targeted strikes on strategic infrastructure. The October 1, 2024, attack symbolizes a rise in tensions between Iran and Israel, with the use of a sophisticated and varied arsenal, including ballistic missiles, drones, and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles. This offensive, carried out as part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' highlights the evolution of Iranian military capabilities and raises new questions about Israel’s defense systems' ability to cope with these threats. While the international community calls for calm, this escalation serves as a reminder of the fragility of the situation in the Middle East and the inherent risks of increasingly technological warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/what-missiles-were-used-in-irans-strike-on-israel	2024-10-02T00:35:27-07:00	
Breaking News: US Navy aids Israel in missile defense amid major Iranian attack, Pentagon confirms	According to information published by the US DoD on October 1, 2024, the Pentagon has confirmed that the U.S. military coordinated closely with Israeli forces during a significant missile attack launched by Iran against Israel earlier. In a press briefing, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder detailed that Iran fired approximately 200 ballistic missiles, targeting various locations across Israel. In response, the U.S. provided critical defense assistance to its ally.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US Navy's Arleigh-Burke class destroyer firing RIM-161 Standard Missile 3. (Picture source: Dvids) U.S. Navy destroyers deployed in the region, including the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, actively participated in the missile defense operation. These ships launched a dozen interceptors in an effort to neutralize the incoming threat, offering key support to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The specifics regarding the type of interceptor ordnance used were not disclosed, despite questions about whether the Navy utilized SM-3 missiles, a standard defense against ballistic missiles. Maj. Gen. Ryder emphasized the close coordination between the U.S. military and Israeli forces during the attack but refrained from providing further details on the defense measures. The attack underscores the ongoing tensions in the region and the U.S.'s commitment to defending its allies. Technical analysis The coordination between the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole during the recent missile defense operation highlights the sophisticated capabilities of modern naval platforms and their integration with advanced missile systems like the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3). Both vessels, being Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, which serves as the cornerstone for their multi-mission versatility, particularly in ballistic missile defense (BMD). The Aegis system integrates powerful radar suites, such as the AN/SPY-1D multi-function radar, which provides the necessary detection, tracking, and discrimination of incoming ballistic threats. These destroyers leverage the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability, enabling them to engage and intercept ballistic missiles during various phases of their trajectory. The USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, outfitted with the Aegis BMD configuration, possess the requisite command and control infrastructure to process complex threat environments and coordinate defensive measures in real-time. The SM-3 is a key component of the Aegis BMD system, designed to engage short to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their midcourse phase outside the Earth’s atmosphere. The missile employs a hit-to-kill kinetic warhead, relying on precise guidance and propulsion systems to achieve successful interception. Its flight trajectory allows it to engage targets at ranges extending beyond several hundred kilometers, providing a robust defensive envelope against diverse missile threats. The propulsion and guidance systems of the SM-3 are engineered for high maneuverability and accuracy, essential for countering agile ballistic missiles. The missile’s two-stage design comprises a solid rocket booster for initial propulsion and a second stage equipped with a thrust vector control system, enhancing its ability to adjust flight paths dynamically during interception. Additionally, the SM-3’s active radar seeker provides terminal guidance, allowing for precise targeting and minimizing the risk of collateral damage. The interoperability between the U.S. Navy destroyers and Israeli defense systems likely involved the sharing of real-time data and coordinated engagement strategies. Such collaboration enhances the overall defensive posture, enabling both forces to leverage their respective technological strengths and operational expertise.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-us-navy-aids-israel-in-missile-defense-amid-major-iranian-attack-pentagon-confirms	2024-10-02T00:25:14-07:00

US Army Orders Retired M60 Machine Guns: Mystery Surrounds Recipient	This week, the U.S. Army Contracting Command in Newark, New Jersey, awarded a $14.96 million contract to U.S. Ordnance, a company based in Sparks, Nevada, for an unspecified number of M60E4 and M60E6 machine guns. The contract also includes spare parts, accessories, conversion kits, and training services, raising many questions within the defense community. The U.S. Army largely phased out the M60 machine gun decades ago, prompting speculation about the recipient and the operational needs for these weapons.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A United States Navy SEAL pictured holding a M60E4 machine gun. (Picture source: US DoD) The M60 machine gun, chambered in 7.62x51 mm, was developed in the late 1940s and entered service in the 1950s. Inspired by the German MG-42 and FG-42 automatic rifles from World War II, the M60 was widely used during the Cold War and became iconic during the Vietnam War. Over the years, several variants were introduced, adapted for infantry, vehicles, aircraft, and naval platforms. However, the M60 was gradually replaced by the M240B in U.S. Army service. The M60E4 and M60E6, also known as the MK43, are modernized versions of the original machine gun. These newer variants are lighter, shorter, and feature improvements such as accessory rails and an upgraded gas system for better reliability. Despite these enhancements, they have not been widely adopted by the U.S. Army and are primarily used by foreign forces, such as the Danish Army, which became the first user of the M60E6 in 2014. Some U.S. special forces and training units still utilize these models. Danish Army soldier armed with M60E6 general-purpose machine gun (Picture source: Danish MoD) The contract awarded to U.S. Ordnance does not specify the exact number of machine guns or conversion kits to be delivered, and the Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about the details. This secrecy has led to speculation that these weapons could be intended for a foreign ally, such as Ukraine, as part of military aid. The U.S. has already mentioned the possibility of using the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program to transfer surplus military equipment to partner countries, especially given the depletion of funds for new aid packages. It is also possible that the M60s are destined for other U.S. government entities or foreign allies. The origins of this contract remain unclear, but it reflects a renewed interest in a weapon that had largely been retired from active service in the United States. As the defense community speculates about the final destination of these machine guns, more details may emerge in the coming months, shedding light on the motivations behind this unexpected acquisition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-orders-retired-m60-machine-guns-mystery-surrounds-recipient	2024-10-01T04:49:52-07:00	
Greek military to acquire four Mark VI patrol boats for special operations in Aegean	According to information published by OnAlert on September 30, 2024, the Hellenic National Defence General Staff (GEETHA) is in advanced discussions with the U.S. to acquire four Mark VI patrol boats to strengthen Greece’s Special Amphibious Forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Patrol Boat Mk VI 1206, operating under Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron 3, moves into position to conduct boarding operations on the amphibious dock landing ship USS Comstock. (Picture source: US DoD) According to reports, the deal is progressing through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, which offers military support to U.S. allies. Notably, the U.S. government plans to cover most, if not all, of the costs, as part of its military cooperation with Greece, which has supported Ukraine by providing ammunition during the ongoing conflict. The four Mark VI boats will offer advanced capabilities for unconventional warfare, ideal for the Aegean's island-dense environment. Greece already operates four Mark V boats, delivered by the U.S. in 2020, which have proven highly effective as force multipliers in amphibious operations. The Mark VI, measuring 25.8 meters in length, can carry a crew of 10 plus eight additional personnel. For special operations, the crew size can be reduced to accommodate fully equipped commandos. With modern systems, including infrared and thermal cameras, the Mark VI boats can serve as mini-command centers, ideal for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. These patrol boats come armed with two remotely operated Mk 38 Mod 2 25mm guns and can carry up to six M2 .50 caliber machine guns, along with M240 and M134 machine guns, and Mk 19 grenade launchers. Their aluminum hull allows them to reach speeds of 45 knots (over 80 km/h) with a range of up to 750 nautical miles (1,400 km) at cruising speeds of 25 knots. The vessels also have the capacity to carry small rubber boats and drones, such as the Switchblade 600, which Greece plans to acquire soon. Aegean Sea The Aegean Sea is dotted with over 2,000 islands and islets, many of which are located near Turkey’s coastline. This creates a challenging operational landscape for the Hellenic Armed Forces, particularly for patrolling, defense, and logistical support. The islands vary in size and infrastructure, complicating efforts to defend them and respond to emergencies or threats. The scattered nature of these islands also presents difficulties in maintaining a rapid and coordinated military presence, especially in remote areas. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes in the Aegean over territorial waters, airspace, and the continental shelf. Turkey's frequent military provocations, including airspace violations and naval exercises near Greek islands, continuously challenge Greece’s sovereignty. The need to defend Greek airspace and territorial waters from encroachments requires constant vigilance, with the Hellenic Air Force and Navy often engaging in intercept missions. The Aegean is a vital maritime corridor, not only for Greece but for Europe. The region faces threats from illegal activities such as smuggling, human trafficking, and illicit fishing operations. The Aegean has also been a key route for migrants and refugees, putting additional pressure on the Hellenic Coast Guard and Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/greek-military-to-acquire-four-mark-vi-patrol-boats-for-special-operations-in-aegean	2024-10-01T04:44:30-07:00	
South Korea's new Hyunmoo-V monster missile promises nuclear-like destruction with nine-ton warhead	On October 1, 2024, South Korea unveiled its latest strategic missile, the Hyunmoo-V, during the Armed Forces Day parade commemorating the 76th anniversary of the military's founding. The event featured approximately 5,000 troops and nearly 100 pieces of heavy military equipment, marching through downtown Seoul. Streets were closed to accommodate tens of thousands of spectators, and a U.S. B-1B Lancer bomber made a rare flight over the capital, highlighting the close military ties between South Korea and the United States.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hyunmoo-V missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) Described by Seoul as a retaliatory weapon aimed at countering threats from North Korea, the Hyunmoo-V (nicknamed the 'monster missile' due to its capabilities) is capable of carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons. This substantial warhead is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. With a total weight of 36 tons and a thrust of 75 tons, the Hyunmoo-V follows a 'lofted trajectory,' flying through the exosphere to enhance its penetration capability before descending upon its target at speeds ten times faster than the speed of sound. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, noted that the missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. The missile employs a unique cold-launch system, using compressed gas to propel it before ignition. This technique minimizes damage to the launcher and increases operational stability due to the missile's powerful solid propellant. Referred to as 'High Power Missiles' (HPM) by Seoul, both the Hyunmoo-IV-1 and Hyunmoo-V are designed to penetrate deeply buried command centers by detonating above underground facilities, effectively burying them. The exact maximum range of the Hyunmoo-V remains undisclosed, but experts speculate it could potentially reach distances of up to 3,000 kilometers or more, placing it in the category of intermediate-range missiles. Comparisons have been drawn to the U.S. Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile in terms of warhead weight and thrust, although the Hyunmoo-V is believed to be a two-stage missile. Carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons, the Hyunmoo-V is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. (Picture source: South Korean MoD) Hanwha Aerospace is the manufacturer of the Hyunmoo missiles, which are all equipped with evasion systems to counteract enemy air defense systems. The South Korean Strategic Command plans to have more than 200 Hyunmoo-V missiles alone. In addition to the V-series, new variants of the Hyunmoo-II, III, and IV missiles are being developed and mass-produced. South Korea refers to these missiles as 'Extreme Precision, High Power Missiles' or 'Ultra-powerful ballistic missiles,' rather than using conventional designations like Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile or intercontinental ballistic missile. There are also plans to mount the Hyunmoo-V missiles on the Joint Support Ship, which is described as the world's first arsenal ship. In early 2024, South Korea announced that it had successfully tested the Hyunmoo-V missile. Information about missile tests is often disclosed through Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), which are notifications issued to ensure airspace safety during missile-related activities. Analyses of NOTAMs suggest that the Hyunmoo-V tests likely took place on December 26 or 27, 2023, near Jeongjuk-Ri village on the west coast. The tests targeted a group of islands approximately 185 kilometers south of the launch point, a distance comparable to that between Seoul and Pyongyang. The public unveiling of these missiles aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. This system comprises three components: the 'Kill Chain,' the Korean Air and Missile Defense system (KAMD), and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan (KMPR). The public unveiling of both the Hyunmoo and L-SAM missile launchers aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) The 'Kill Chain' component focuses on swift detection and engagement of North Korean missile threats, aiming to target nuclear and missile facilities before they can launch. It is said to have the capability to target mobile missile launchers within 30 minutes. The KAMD system is responsible for intercepting incoming missiles, providing a multi-layered defense for critical facilities and population centers. It employs the domestically produced Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) as an upper-tier interceptor capable of intercepting projectiles at altitudes up to 60 kilometers. The Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan serves as a deterrent strategy, assuming that a North Korean attack has already been initiated. In such an event, South Korea would retaliate with a combination of precision missiles, advanced aircraft, and potentially special operations forces. The objectives would include countervalue and counterforce targets, as well as leadership decapitation strikes. These defense systems integrate capabilities across different branches of the South Korean military. The Army's Strategic Missile Command operates the Hyunmoo family of missiles in both the 'Kill Chain' and retaliation roles. The Air Force employs PAC-3 systems, F-35A jets, and Global Hawk surveillance aircraft. The Navy utilizes 3,000-ton submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles and KDX-III Aegis destroyers with SM-2 missiles. Future plans include integrating military surveillance satellites, cyber warfare units, space-focused forces, and special forces units into the defense network.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-koreas-new-hyunmoo-v-monster-missile-promises-nuclear-like-destruction-with-nine-ton-warhead	2024-10-01T04:30:57-07:00

This contract also includes foreign military sales (FMS) to Japan, the Netherlands, Finland, and Poland, as part of a Pentagon effort to maximize the production of key munitions through multiyear procurements.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-35 Lightning II test pilot conducts flight test Sept. 9 to certify the carrier variant of the fighter aircraft for carrying the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) (Picture source: US DoD) In 2023, the Pentagon proposed using multiyear procurement authorities—usually reserved for ships or aircraft—to acquire munitions, with the aim of increasing industrial production capacity. Defense officials explained at the time that this initiative was intended to deter China and strengthen the US defense industrial base, while also addressing the need for arms to support Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. The contract is part of a broader strategy called the 'large lot procurement pilot program,' designed to accelerate production. Lockheed Martin stated that this agreement would allow the company to increase the number of JASSM and LRASM missiles produced annually. The company also noted that multiyear procurement of critical munitions like JASSM and LRASM is a key measure to enhance industrial resilience and ensure that production can be ramped up more quickly. The missiles will be manufactured at Lockheed Martin's facilities in Orlando, Florida, with the work expected to be completed by the end of July 2032. The US Air Force will provide $1.5 billion for missile production, along with an additional $2 million for operations and maintenance, while the US Navy will contribute $176 million. The Pentagon will allocate $752 million for foreign military sales under the contract. The JASSM is a cruise missile designed to allow aircraft to strike ground targets while maintaining a safe distance from enemy air defenses or hostile aircraft. The LRASM, based on the JASSM design, is intended to penetrate enemy air defenses and destroy ships from a standoff range. On the same day, the US State Department approved a potential sale to Australia of 100 Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missiles-Extended Range (AARGM-ER) and related equipment, valued at approximately $405 million. This sale, which aligns with US foreign policy and national security objectives, is intended to improve Australia's defense capabilities, a key ally in the Pacific region. The AARGM-ER missiles, manufactured by Northrop Grumman, will allow Australia to suppress or destroy land- or sea-based enemy radars, enhancing the survivability of allied aircraft in a conflict scenario. In conclusion, this new multiyear contract reflects the Pentagon's strategy to optimize the production of critical munitions while bolstering the resilience of the US defense industrial base. Lockheed Martin is positioned to increase production of JASSM and LRASM missiles, which play a key role in US military strategies. Additionally, the sale of AARGM-ER missiles to Australia strengthens cooperation between the two countries in the Pacific region and enhances Canberra’s defense capabilities against potential threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-air-force-signs-a-3-2-billion-contract-for-lockheed-martins-jassm-and-lrasm-missiles	2024-10-01T00:33:28-07:00	
Netherlands signs contract with Naval Group for four Barracuda-class submarines in major defense deal	According to a PR published by Naval Group on September 30, 2024, the Netherlands Ministry of Defense has signed a contract with Naval Group for the delivery of four Barracuda-class expeditionary submarines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Dutch Barracuda-class submarine. (Picture source: Naval Group) The agreement, formalized by Dutch State Secretary for Defence Gijs Tuinman and Naval Group CEO Pierre Eric Pommellet, took place at the Directie Materiële Instandhouding (DMI) in Den Helder, marking the official launch of the Orka-class program, which will replace the Royal Netherlands Navy’s aging Walrus-class submarines. The contract follows a rigorous evaluation and bidding process conducted by the Materiel and IT Command (COMMIT), which determined that Naval Group’s Orka-class submarines were the best solution for the Netherlands' future underwater capabilities. The program will enhance the Netherlands' strategic autonomy and deepen cooperation between the Dutch maritime industry and Naval Group, particularly in the development and maintenance of submarine systems over the next two decades. About the program Before Naval Group was selected, the Dutch government extensively evaluated the proposals from TKMS and Saab Kockums. TKMS, a German company, offered a design based on its Type 212/214 submarines, which are widely regarded for their advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. These submarines are noted for their ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing, making them ideal for covert operations in shallow waters such as the Baltic Sea. Saab Kockums, on the other hand, presented a modified version of its A26 submarine, which is designed with modularity in mind and includes an AIP system. The A26’s strength lies in its versatility, allowing it to be configured for a wide range of missions, including intelligence gathering, anti-submarine warfare, and special forces operations. Saab Kockums also promised to heavily involve Dutch industry in its proposal, which was a crucial requirement for the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Both TKMS and Saab Kockums had strong offerings, and their submarines are well-regarded in the global market. However, Naval Group's proposal was ultimately deemed to offer superior capabilities for the Netherlands’ specific needs. One of the decisive factors was the ability of Naval Group to deliver a blue-water, ocean-going submarine capable of extended missions far from Dutch waters, while also ensuring long-term cooperation with Dutch industry. From a strategic standpoint, the Dutch government viewed the Naval Group’s Barracuda-class submarines as the best fit for NATO’s broader requirements. The Barracuda design is well-suited to both high-end warfare and intelligence operations in distant waters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/netherlands-signs-contract-with-naval-group-for-four-barracuda-class-submarines-in-major-defense-deal	2024-10-01T00:04:14-07:00	
Taiwan warns of escalating Chinese military drills in Taiwan Strait	According to information published by Liberty Times Net September 30, 2024, the Chinese military has been conducting increasingly frequent exercises around Taiwan, with military aircraft and naval vessels regularly intruding near the island.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Tuo Chiang-class corvette Tuo Chiang. (Picture source: Taiwanese Ministry of Defense) In a recent report from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, officials warn that China aims to 'internalize' the Taiwan Strait by combining military actions with law enforcement operations, such as deploying Chinese coast guard vessels to patrol Taiwan's eastern waters. The report outlines four key tactics China has employed to pressure Taiwan. These include joint readiness patrols, gray zone tactics, large-scale targeted military drills, and coordinated training operations. Among these tactics, joint readiness patrols have been a recurring feature, with Chinese forces conducting combined air and naval operations three to four times a month. These actions, according to the Ministry of Defense, are intended to intensify the military threat against Taiwan. Following an incident in the waters near Kinmen and Xiamen earlier this year, Chinese coast guard patrols have also increased in the areas surrounding Taiwan's outlying islands, such as Kinmen and Matsu. Notably, during large-scale military drills held on May 23-24, China organized coast guard patrols in Taiwan’s eastern waters under the guise of law enforcement, furthering its goal of asserting control over the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese defense officials also foresee the integration of China's new 'Coast Guard Law,' which authorizes the use of force by Chinese coast guard units during maritime operations. They predict that China will increasingly resort to a combination of legal, cognitive, and gray zone warfare tactics to harass Taiwan. The report also highlights recent activities involving China's aircraft carrier Shandong, which completed its 36th training mission from June 22 to July 23, traversing the South China Sea and Western Pacific. The Shandong was accompanied by various warplanes, including the H-6K bomber, conducting joint training across the island chains stretching to Taiwan’s southwest and the Western Pacific. These activities are part of China’s effort to demonstrate its capabilities in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies through planned joint training. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has concluded that China is testing its ability to both invade Taiwan and counter potential foreign intervention by combining conventional and unconventional tactics. In response, Taiwan's military remains on high alert, employing intelligence and surveillance systems to monitor Chinese military movements.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-warns-of-escalating-chinese-military-drills-in-taiwan-strait	2024-09-30T07:22:01-07:00	
South Korean Intelligence Warns North Korea Capable of Building Double-Digit Nuclear Arsenal	According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), North Korea has accumulated enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to build a 'double-digit' number of nuclear bombs, as reported by Reuters. This information, revealed during a closed-door parliamentary briefing, has heightened concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities. The briefing followed recent public statements by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un regarding the expansion of his nuclear arsenal, as well as the rare disclosure earlier this month of a secret uranium enrichment facility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States (Picture source: KCNA) The intelligence report estimates that North Korea possesses around 70 kilograms of plutonium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons, along with a significant, though unspecified, amount of weapons-grade uranium. Combined, these materials would be sufficient to produce at least ten nuclear bombs. These developments align with North Korea’s broader goal of 'exponentially' increasing its stockpile of nuclear weapons, as recently stated by Kim Jong-un. North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic programs continue to advance, with significant improvements in terms of accuracy and power. The South Korean intelligence agency also highlighted North Korea’s progress in missile technology, particularly in developing more precise and powerful systems capable of targeting South Korea. The NIS has not ruled out the possibility of a seventh nuclear test, speculating that such an event could take place after the U.S. presidential election in November. Kim Jong-un’s visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute in September underscored North Korea’s ambitions to further expand its nuclear arsenal. This visit, which included an inspection of facilities producing military-grade nuclear materials, reinforced the regime’s commitment to strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities. These actions come despite long-standing international sanctions and diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. South Korea and its allies are closely monitoring these developments, concerned about the growing threat posed by North Korea’s expanding nuclear capabilities. This concern is heightened by Pyongyang’s continued missile testing and development, including those designed to carry nuclear warheads. In response to the increasing obsolescence of its conventional military capabilities, North Korea has focused for decades on developing asymmetric capabilities and weapons of mass destruction, including long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The country has a range of short- and medium-range missiles, such as the Scud and No-Dong missiles, along with more modern systems like the KN-23 and KN-25. Significant advancements include the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-14, with a range of 10,400 km, and the Hwasong-15, still in development, with an estimated range between 8,500 and 13,000 km. North Korea has also made progress in miniaturizing its nuclear weapons, allowing them to be integrated into its ballistic missiles. The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States. Continued development of ballistic missile and nuclear technologies remains central to Pyongyang’s strategy to deter external intervention and ensure the regime’s survival. The latest intelligence assessments suggest that North Korea now has the capacity to produce a significant number of nuclear weapons, with further advancements expected in the near future. As the regime continues to progress in both nuclear and missile domains, regional security dynamics are likely to face increasing pressure. The possibility of further nuclear tests and the expansion of North Korea’s arsenal remain key concerns for South Korea and the international community.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korean-intelligence-warns-north-korea-capable-of-building-double-digit-nuclear-arsenal	2024-09-30T06:56:03-07:00	
Taiwan adopts non-lethal ammunition to strengthen maritime law enforcement against gray zone tactics	According to information published by Liberty Times Net on September 28, 2024, Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) is adopting new measures to improve maritime law enforcement, in response to increasing gray zone tactics employed by Chinese forces, which include frequent incursions into Taiwan's air and maritime zones as well as the deployment of Chinese Coast Guard vessels.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Anping-class offshore patrol vessel. (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) Senior government officials have confirmed that the Executive Yuan has approved a three-year pilot program to procure non-lethal ammunition and equipment, aiming to boost enforcement capabilities. Starting in fiscal year 2025, the program will trial the use of non-lethal munitions, such as high-decibel shock rounds, which will be compatible with the Zhenhai rocket system aboard the CGA’s 600-ton vessels. These vessels are currently equipped with domestically produced 2.75-inch rockets capable of launching high-explosive, armor-piercing, and cluster munitions—powerful weapons deemed unsuitable for standard law enforcement operations in Taiwan's waters. The new non-lethal options, designed to deter rather than destroy, are intended to be safer alternatives during such operations. According to military sources, these shock rounds will emit a loud noise upon detonation, creating a psychological deterrent. Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology will work with the CGA to produce and supply these rounds according to the approved annual plan. The project has an allocated budget of NT$86.24 million (approximately USD 2.7 million) and is scheduled to be implemented over the next three years. Besides shock rounds, the procurement plan also includes 40mm flashbangs, single-shot 40mm grenade launchers, and other non-lethal firearms. Depending on the results of the trial, the program may be expanded in future years. The Zhenhai rocket system, developed by Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute, is a remotely controlled weapon platform with six launchers capable of firing various 2.75-inch rockets with an effective range of up to 5 kilometers and a maximum range of 10 kilometers. Currently, the system is configured to launch high-explosive, armor-piercing, cluster munitions, and flares for search and rescue operations. About the Anping class The Anping-class offshore patrol vessels have a displacement of 750 tons and measure 65.4 meters in overall length, with a waterline length of 60.7 meters. The vessels have a beam of 14.8 meters and a draft of 2.1 meters. Powered by two MTU 20V4000M93L engines driving four Hamilton HT900 waterjet propulsion systems, the ships produce a total output of 8,600 kW. Electrical power is provided by two MTU 16V4000M93L generators and an emergency generator, delivering a total output of 6,880 kW. These patrol vessels are capable of reaching a maximum speed of 44.5 knots and have a range of 3,250 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots. They carry a crew of 30 personnel and are equipped with two electro-optical fire control systems, as well as X-band and S-band navigation radars. The vessels are also fitted with a FLIR SeaFLIR 280-HD infrared camera for surveillance.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-adopts-non-lethal-ammunition-to-strengthen-maritime-law-enforcement-against-gray-zone-tactics	2024-09-30T06:23:18-07:00	
New stage in US military support for Taiwan $567 million to counter Beijing	U.S. President Joe Biden has approved $567 million in new support to strengthen Taiwan's defense, the White House announced. This decision aligns with Washington's commitment to support the self-governed island in response to growing tensions with China. Although the United States does not officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, it remains its most important international ally and arms supplier, a point of frequent contention with Beijing. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly demanded that Washington stop selling arms to Taipei, accusing the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Taiwanese Army's Third, Fourth, and Fifth Operational Zones conducted heavy artillery firing exercises in August 2024 (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) In a brief statement, the White House indicated that Biden had delegated authority to the Secretary of State 'to direct the provision of defense articles and services from the Department of Defense, as well as military education and training, for assistance of up to $567 million for Taiwan.' No further details were provided about the specific nature of this latest aid package. This initiative follows a previous military assistance package approved in April 2024, during a period when China intensified its political and military pressures on the island. That multi-billion-dollar aid aimed to bolster Taiwan’s defense capabilities amid increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing. Although U.S. support for Taiwan is informal diplomatically, it represents a major source of friction in U.S.-China relations. Taiwan has repeatedly expressed concerns over delays in the delivery of certain military equipment from the United States, including modernized F-16 fighter jets. Nevertheless, Washington continues to provide significant military aid to the island to enhance its ability to face a potential Chinese invasion. The approval of this new $567 million assistance reaffirms the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Taiwan's defense amid growing challenges posed by China. Before the approval of the $567 million aid package in September 2024, the United States had already sent several significant military deliveries to Taiwan. One of the most notable was a $345 million package approved in 2023, which included air defense systems such as Patriot PAC-3 missiles aimed at strengthening the island’s missile defense capabilities. In addition to these systems, Washington also provided munitions, including AGM-88 HARM missiles designed to target enemy radar, as well as long-range artillery munitions. The U.S. also delivered M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, which offer enhanced mobility on the battlefield, allowing Taiwan to improve its response to ground attacks.

As a reminder on August 24, 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a new hybrid missile-drone named Palianytsia against a Russian military base in Voronezh Oblast. This marked the first confirmed use of this new weapon system, which successfully targeted the base, causing a major fire and multiple secondary explosions. The attack is part of a broader strategy aimed at neutralizing Russian military assets deep within Russian territory, as Ukraine continues to develop indigenous capabilities in response to restrictions on the use of Western-supplied weapons. The Palianytsia missile-drone, designed to strike Russian military airfields, represents a critical advancement for Ukraine's military efforts. The weapon is intended to neutralize platforms used to launch thousands of missiles and glide bombs at Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the successful deployment of the Palianytsia during his Independence Day speech on August 24, stating, 'Today, we witnessed the first successful combat use of our new weapon, the Palianytsia missile-drone. This is a completely new class of weapon—our own Ukrainian innovation.' A video released on August 25 provided an overview of the Palianytsia's development and capabilities. This long-range attack drone, powered by a turbojet engine, is equipped with a JetCat P400-PRO micro-turbojet, weighing 4 kg and generating 43 kg of thrust. Its structure is primarily fiberglass with wooden frames, and it features a large fuel tank to maximize range. The Palianytsia is also armed with a 20 kg blast-fragmentation warhead. The drone has an aerodynamic design similar to traditional cruise missiles, with a central body, forward-positioned wings, and a tail section equipped with four control surfaces. The drone is designed for easy transport and storage, with detachable wings and tail, allowing for quick access to the engine and reducing space requirements during transport. The Palianytsia can strike long-distance targets, including two dozen Russian military airfields. The weapon was developed in a remarkably short time, just a year and a half. Additionally, the cost of the Palianytsia is reportedly lower than that of similar systems, making it a more sustainable option for Ukraine as the conflict continues. In conclusion, the United Kingdom’s initiative with Project Brakestop clearly demonstrates the strategic learning derived from the conflict in Ukraine. By observing the effectiveness of systems like the Palianytsia drone, the British were able to identify crucial needs and innovation opportunities within their own defense industry. This experience has not only accelerated the development of advanced technologies capable of addressing modern threats but has also strengthened the collaboration between the Ministry of Defence and the private sector to rapidly adapt military capabilities to the realities of the contemporary battlefield.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/uk-launches-project-brakestop-a-jet-powered-long-range-attack-drone-initiative-modeled-after-ukraines-palianytsia-owe-uav	2024-09-30T03:13:06-07:00

AUKUS advancing Indo-Pacific security with nuclear submarines and emerging tech, Austin reports	According to information published by the US DoD on September 26, 2024, the trilateral security alliance known as AUKUS, consisting of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, is rapidly advancing military capabilities and deterrence strategies in the Indo-Pacific region, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. During a recent meeting in London with his counterparts, British Defense Secretary John Healey and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles, Austin emphasized the progress made under the partnership.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Australian Minister for Defence Richard Marles, the UK Ministry of Defence John Healey and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. (Picture source: US DoD) One of AUKUS's key objectives is to equip Australia with conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Austin highlighted that over the past year, efforts have been accelerated, with more Australian sailors receiving specialized training at U.S. and U.K. nuclear reactor schools. Additionally, a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine made a port visit to Australia, marking an early milestone toward establishing Australia's sovereign submarine capability. Austin also outlined plans for a rotational deployment of U.S. submarines to Australia, which could begin as early as 2027. He reiterated the United States’ commitment to assisting Australia in developing the skilled workforce needed to operate and maintain these advanced submarines. The AUKUS partnership is structured around two main pillars. The first aims to ensure that Australia acquires nuclear-powered submarine capability by the early 2030s. The second pillar focuses on accelerating cutting-edge military technologies such as uncrewed maritime systems, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and hypersonics. Japan has committed to contributing to the development of maritime autonomy, while discussions with Canada, South Korea, and New Zealand are ongoing regarding their potential involvement in these emerging technologies. In addition to these advancements, the AUKUS nations have committed to easing export controls to enhance secure trade within the partnership. This includes the sale of U.S. Virginia-class submarines to Australia. Recent legislative changes under the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act have amended export regulations, providing exemptions for Australia and the United Kingdom, further facilitating defense cooperation. Background From a geopolitical perspective, China has been vocal in its opposition, framing AUKUS as a destabilizing move that exacerbates regional tensions and threatens to spark an arms race. This has added fuel to the existing rivalry between China and the U.S. over influence in the Pacific, with Beijing accusing the pact of adopting a 'Cold War mentality' that undermines the nuclear non-proliferation regime. This sentiment resonates with some Pacific nations, many of which are wary of nuclear-powered submarines in their waters, especially given the region's history of nuclear testing and its commitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone. Countries like Fiji and the Solomon Islands have expressed concerns, suggesting that the presence of such vessels contradicts the ideals of peace in the Pacific, raising further diplomatic hurdles for Australia in maintaining regional relations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/aukus-advancing-indo-pacific-security-with-nuclear-submarines-and-emerging-tech-austin-reports	2024-09-30T02:14:00-07:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Azerbaijan conducted a military operation on September 19, 2023, to gain control over the remaining parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a territory mainly inhabited by Armenians but located within Azerbaijan’s borders. The operation raised concerns about potential broader violence and led to a significant displacement of Armenians fearing reprisals. Russian peacekeepers were killed during the fighting, but Russia did not intervene. Azerbaijan's economic position, partly influenced by the Ukraine war's effects on natural gas exports to the European Union, has allowed it to expand its military capabilities. The country has acquired military equipment from Turkiye, such as upgrading Su-25 combat aircraft, and from Israel, acquiring a remote-sensing satellite and additional Barak air defense systems. Azerbaijan plans to increase military spending by around 6% in 2024, reaching approximately USD 3.8 billion. Armenia has also increased its defense spending, with a budget of USD 1.28 billion in 2023, a 46% rise compared to the previous year, and plans to expand it to about USD 1.4 billion in 2024. Due to delays in Russian arms deliveries, affected by Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, Armenia has sought alternative suppliers, including India, signing contracts for 155mm ATAGS towed howitzers, Pinaka multiple-launch rocket systems, and Akash air defense systems. Additionally, Armenia is transitioning toward NATO-standard artillery, incorporating Western military education systems and command approaches. Armenia has distanced itself from Russia's security role, as Moscow did not intervene during the 2022 border conflict with Azerbaijan. This led Armenia to invite an EU monitoring mission, comprising 103 civilian members, while Armenia has effectively halted its participation in CSTO activities. Azerbaijan's armed forces, consisting of 64,050 active personnel (57,800 in the Army, 1,750 in the Navy, and 8,650 in the Air Force) and 300,000 reservists, focus mainly on territorial defense. Azerbaijan maintains a conscript-based system, with service terms of 18 months (12 for graduates). The country has shifted from reliance on Russian military support to establishing defense ties with Israel, Turkiye, and Pakistan, signing agreements such as the 2021 'Shusha Declaration' with Turkiye and engaging in joint exercises like the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk-2023 in October 2023. Additionally, Azerbaijan signed bilateral defense cooperation agreements with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 2023 and has developed limited but expanding domestic defense-industrial capabilities through its Ministry of Defence Industry. Azerbaijan has acquired various military equipment from Israel, including dozens of Plasan Sandcat armored vehicles, a remote-sensing satellite, and Barak air defense systems.

Heavy Air Transport: DARPA Seeks a Drone with Twice Lifting Power of CH-53K King Stallion	The U.S. Department of Defense, through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), has recently launched an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing heavy air transport. This initiative, named 'Cost Efficient Cargo,' explores the design of an autonomous drone capable of carrying up to 31.75 tons of cargo, which is double the lifting capacity of the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter, currently in service with the U.S. Marine Corps. Unlike the King Stallion, this drone would not be designed for long-range missions but rather for moving heavy loads between ships and beaches or crossing rivers and other natural obstacles inland.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marines with Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron (VMX) 1 transport a Light Armored Vehicle 25 with a CH-53K King Stallion helicopter over Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, April 27, 2022 (Picture source: US-DoD) DARPA recently issued a Request for Information (RFI), seeking innovative proposals for uncrewed heavy-lift systems capable of carrying a 70,000-pound payload (around 35 tons). This RFI specifies that the drone must utilize existing engine and transmission technologies while deviating from systems currently employed by traditional helicopters. The intended operational range for this drone would be 25 miles (40.23 km), flying at an altitude of 500 feet between the cargo pickup point and its destination, with a return trip to the base. This project is driven by the growing logistical needs of the U.S. military, particularly in high-intensity conflict scenarios against adversaries with significant anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, such as China. Amphibious and airborne operations, where troops and equipment must be rapidly moved from sea to land, increasingly face natural or artificial obstacles such as ravines, rivers, or destroyed bridges. Currently, these barriers are often overcome through engineering solutions like floating bridges or amphibious vehicles, but these methods are time-consuming and provide adversaries with the opportunity to mount counterattacks. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project aims to address the urgent need for faster and more efficient heavy-lift transport, particularly in scenarios where swift execution is critical to establishing a beachhead or crossing contested areas. Although the CH-53K can lift an impressive 36,000 pounds (16.33 tons), it remains costly, with a unit price of approximately $118 million. Additionally, current solutions, while effective, are limited in range, cost, and vulnerability to enemy defenses. The CH-53K King Stallion prepares for take-off during sea trials in June 2020 on the USS Wasp (LHD-1) (Picture source: US DoD) DARPA is considering a variety of configurations for this future heavy-lift drone, including hybrid propulsion systems powered by internal combustion engines, electric motors, or a combination of both. While autonomous capabilities are desired, they are not the immediate focus of this RFI. The main goal is to identify groundbreaking concepts and mitigate risks through scaled-down prototypes before investing in full-scale development. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the importance of overcoming obstacles and rapidly maneuvering forces, underscoring the vulnerabilities of static infrastructure like temporary bridges, which are often exposed to precision strikes and real-time surveillance. Similarly, in a potential conflict with adversaries like China, U.S. amphibious capabilities could be hampered by anti-ship missiles, limiting the proximity of landing ships to shore. The heavy-lift drone proposed by DARPA is designed to overcome these challenges by facilitating the rapid transfer of cargo from ships at sea to land or across obstacles such as rivers and canyons inland. The concept includes the possibility of transporting 40-foot ISO containers (12.19 meters) or even armored vehicles like the M2 Bradley. However, while the Bradley's combat weight is approximately 80,000 pounds (36.29 tons), which slightly exceeds the drone’s projected capacity, DARPA anticipates that these vehicles could be transported empty, without ammunition or fuel, reducing their weight. The logistical challenges facing the U.S. military, particularly in the rapid transport of heavy equipment in contested environments, have prompted the exploration of solutions such as this drone project. DARPA acknowledges that this program could significantly change how the U.S. military deploys its forces and equipment, especially in distributed operations at sea and on land, where flexibility and speed are essential. While questions remain about the actual efficiency of a fleet of high-lift drones, particularly in terms of cost and their ability to meet operational demand, this project reflects the growing need for innovative logistical solutions in the U.S. armed forces. In the long term, this drone could integrate into the future air mobility ecosystem of the U.S. military, addressing increasingly complex operational requirements. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project marks a significant step in the development of the U.S. military’s heavy-lift air transport capabilities. This drone, capable of lifting twice the load of the King Stallion, offers an opportunity to enhance military maneuvers by increasing the speed, flexibility, and resilience of U.S. ground and amphibious forces in the face of increasingly sophisticated adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/heavy-air-transport-darpa-seeks-a-drone-with-twice-lifting-power-of-ch-53k-king-stallion	2024-09-30T00:24:17-07:00

China Unveils Cutting-Edge ZTZ-99 Tank Upgrade with Advanced Active Protection System	The ZTZ-99 is the latest generation of Chinese main battle tanks, representing the most advanced armor technology produced domestically by China. It stands as a symbol of China's military modernization, equipped with cutting-edge systems for firepower, mobility, and protection. A recent development, as shared by 'David Wang' on X (formerly Twitter) on September 19, 2024, reveals that China is currently developing a variant of the ZTZ-99 outfitted with an advanced Active Protection System (APS). This APS includes two projectile launchers and four fire control radars, similar to the GL-6 system, first revealed in 2022.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New Chinese-made ZTZ-99 MBT Main Battle Tank fitted with APS Active Protection System. (Picture source: X account David Wang) The ZTZ-99 main battle tank, also named Type 99, was developed in the 1990s by China as part of its broader effort to modernize its armored forces. Its design was influenced by earlier Soviet tank models, particularly the T-72, but it incorporates advanced technologies, making it one of the most sophisticated tanks in China’s arsenal. Development of the ZTZ-99 began in the late 1980s, and the first prototype was completed by 1993. After rigorous testing and refinements, the ZTZ-99 officially entered service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1999. It made its public debut during the National Day parade in 1999, signaling China’s commitment to fielding a modern, competitive armored force. Regarding combat capabilities, the ZTZ-99 is equipped with a 125mm smoothbore cannon, capable of firing APFSDS rounds, HEAT shells, and ATGMs, enabling it to engage heavily armored vehicles at various ranges. The tank is protected by advanced composite armor and explosive reactive armor (ERA), designed to defend against high-explosive and kinetic threats. Recent variants of the ZTZ-99 have integrated an Active Protection System (APS), like the GL-6, which offers hard-kill protection by intercepting incoming missiles or projectiles. The tank is powered by a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 80 km/h, ensuring excellent mobility on diverse terrain. This combination of firepower, protection, and speed solidifies the ZTZ-99's role as a highly capable and modern main battle tank​. The GL-6 Active Protection System (APS) is a hard-kill defense system developed by China, primarily designed to protect armored vehicles from incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. It is similar in function to other APS like Israel's 'Iron Fist.' The GL-6 system is integrated into vehicles such as the VT-4A1 main battle tank and offers advanced interception capabilities. It uses radar to detect and neutralize threats by launching countermeasures that destroy or deflect incoming missiles before they can strike the vehicle. The GL-6 is a significant upgrade over earlier models like the GL-5, offering better performance and modular features that allow it to be adapted to various platforms. The system effectively counters anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and high-explosive projectiles, making it a valuable asset in modern armored warfare. In terms of performance, the GL-6 can intercept multiple types of threats from various angles, adding a layer of survivability for vehicles like the VT-4A1 and potentially the VN-22 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), although its functionality on the latter is still debated and may be limited to experimental or demonstration purposes Adding the APS to the ZTZ-99 tank is a game-changer for its defensive capabilities. An APS is designed to provide 'hard-kill' protection, which means it actively intercepts and destroys incoming anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and other high-velocity projectiles before they can hit the tank. The two APS projectile launchers and radar system work in tandem to detect and neutralize threats, providing 360-degree coverage. This level of protection enhances the tank's survivability in both offensive and defensive operations, especially in environments where advanced anti-tank weaponry is deployed. By adding this advanced APS, the ZTZ-99 becomes far more resistant to modern anti-armor threats, ensuring it can remain operational on the battlefield even when facing the latest missile and projectile systems. The GL-6 system, in particular, is known for its efficiency in intercepting multiple threats simultaneously, further increasing the tank's durability in combat. These improvements make the ZTZ-99 not only a powerful offensive machine, with its 125mm smoothbore gun capable of firing various munitions, but also a highly resilient vehicle, able to withstand a wide range of battlefield threats. This development aligns with China's strategic focus on enhancing the survivability and effectiveness of its armored forces, allowing the ZTZ-99 to maintain its cutting-edge position among global main battle tanks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-unveils-cutting-edge-ztz-99-tank-upgrade-with-advanced-active-protection-system	2024-09-27T10:18:47-07:00

China's newest nuclear submarine reportedly sank at dock earlier this year, say U.S. officials	According to information published by CNN on September 26, 2024, China's latest nuclear-powered submarine, the first of its Zhou-class attack vessels, reportedly sank earlier this year while docked.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a Chinese Navy submarine. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The submarine, under construction at a shipyard near Wuhan, is believed to have gone down in the spring. Chinese authorities have attempted to keep the incident out of public view. The Zhou-class submarine, distinguished by its unique X-shaped stern designed for enhanced maneuverability, was seen docked in satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on March 10. By June, however, further imagery indicated the submarine was no longer at the pier, raising questions about its fate. An unusual concentration of cranes at the shipyard during that period, spotted by Tom Shugart, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, hinted at ongoing recovery efforts. Shugart noted this level of activity was atypical for the site. Beijing has prioritized modernizing its submarine fleet as part of broader efforts to enhance the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy). The PLA currently operates a mix of nuclear-powered ballistic missile and attack submarines, alongside a significant fleet of diesel-powered submarines. Despite this modernization, the PLA Navy’s transparency on incidents such as this remains limited. When asked about the situation, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., said they had no information to provide. U.S. defense officials have not confirmed whether nuclear fuel was loaded onto the submarine at the time of the sinking, leaving critical details about the incident unknown. The loss has prompted questions about the oversight of China’s defense industry, which has historically been troubled by issues of corruption and accountability. The PLA Navy, currently the world’s largest by the number of ships, is expected to expand its submarine fleet in the coming years, with projections suggesting 65 submarines by 2025 and 80 by 2035. This growth comes as the U.S. identifies China as its principal strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in naval power.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinas-newest-nuclear-submarine-reportedly-sank-at-dock-earlier-this-year-say-u-s-officials	2024-09-27T00:46:55-07:00

Exclusive: Iran mediating talks for Russian missile transfer to Yemen's Houthis	According to information published by Reuters on September 24, 2024, Iran has facilitated secret negotiations between Russia and Yemen's Houthi rebels, aiming to transfer advanced anti-ship missiles to the militant group. The ongoing discussions, which have yet to result in a confirmed transfer, focus on supplying the Yakhont missile, also known as the P-800 Oniks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian P-800 Oniks missile. (Picture source: Wikipedia/ Boevaya mashina) Seven sources have indicated that while Moscow has not finalized the decision, the Yakhont missile would significantly enhance the Houthis' ability to target vessels in the Red Sea. Experts warn that this could increase the threat to U.S. and European warships, as well as disrupt global maritime trade further. The Wall Street Journal had reported in July that Russia was considering this missile transfer, but Iran's involvement in brokering the talks had not been previously disclosed. The Houthis have intensified their drone and missile strikes on ships in the Red Sea since November, partly in solidarity with Palestinians during the ongoing Gaza conflict. Their actions have already caused significant disruptions, sinking two ships and seizing another, forcing shipping companies to reroute cargo and prompting rising insurance costs for vessels navigating the area. Despite retaliatory strikes by the U.S. and Britain on Houthi positions, the group’s attacks continue. Two regional officials revealed that Russian and Houthi representatives have met in Tehran at least twice this year, with further meetings expected soon. These talks reportedly include plans to supply the Houthis with dozens of Yakhont missiles, which have a range of approximately 300 kilometers. Russia has previously provided Yakhont missiles to Iran-backed Hezbollah, and the current discussions, which began under Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, reflect a growing alignment between Moscow and Tehran. Western intelligence sources emphasize that Iran is mediating the talks but seeks to avoid direct involvement in the transfer. Some sources suggest that Russia's willingness to arm the Houthis may be linked to Western military aid to Ukraine. The transfer of Yakhont missiles, regarded as highly advanced, would represent a significant shift in regional security dynamics. Experts believe that the Houthis could use these weapons not only against Western naval forces but also as land-attack missiles, potentially threatening Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have raised the issue with Saudi Arabia, which shares concerns over the missile transfer. Russia's potential involvement has drawn alarm across the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/exclusive-iran-mediating-talks-for-russian-missile-transfer-to-yemens-houthis	2024-09-26T05:11:06-07:00

Japan's first warship passage through Taiwan Strait signals growing regional tensions	According to information published by Al Jazeera on September 26, 2024, Japan has reportedly sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time, signaling increased naval activity in a region marked by growing tensions with China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Takanami-class destroyer JS Sazanami. (Picture source: JMSDF) The destroyer, Sazanami, made the passage through the 180-kilometer strait, sailing alongside vessels from Australia and New Zealand. This transit, reported by Japanese media, comes as China intensifies its military presence near Japan. The Sazanami entered the strait from the East China Sea, taking more than 10 hours to complete its southward journey. The operation, conducted ahead of joint drills in the contested South China Sea, saw participation from New Zealand’s HMNZS Aotearoa and Australia’s HMAS Sydney. This move follows a recent passage by China’s aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, between two Japanese islands near Taiwan. Japan, which described this activity as 'totally unacceptable,' remains on alert over China's expanding military footprint. Tokyo recently reported a Chinese spy plane violating its airspace near islands off its southwestern coast, heightening concerns over Beijing’s growing assertiveness. Japan’s government has refrained from confirming details of the warship's passage, but spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi voiced concern over the increasing frequency of military actions in the region, particularly airspace violations. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reportedly ordered the Taiwan Strait transit in response to fears that Beijing’s actions could escalate if left unchecked. Taiwan Strait The Taiwan Strait is a strategically significant body of water that separates Taiwan from mainland China. It is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) wide at its narrowest point and connects the East China Sea to the north with the South China Sea to the south. This region has long been a focal point of geopolitical tension due to its critical location, historical claims, and military significance. One of the most pressing issues surrounding the Taiwan Strait is the status of Taiwan itself. Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates as a self-governing democracy but is claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a breakaway province. The PRC views reunification with Taiwan as a core national objective and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal, especially in light of Taiwan's growing international partnerships and the evolving dynamics of global defense alignments. The Taiwan Strait is crucial to global shipping, as many of the world's largest container ships pass through it. This waterway is a major conduit for goods moving between Asia and the rest of the world, particularly energy supplies like oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-first-warship-passage-through-taiwan-strait-signals-growing-regional-tensions	2024-09-26T04:05:54-07:00	
Brazilian Air Force receives new Saab F-39 Gripen fighter jet from Sweden	On September 24, 2024, the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) announced the arrival of another Saab F-39 Gripen aircraft in Brazil, registered as 4108. This aircraft arrived on September 23, completing a journey of approximately 20 days. It was shipped from Norrköping, Sweden, to the port of Navegantes on the Catarinense coast. After its arrival, the aircraft was transferred to Navegantes International Airport, where the necessary technical procedures will be conducted to prepare it for its flight to Anápolis Air Base (BAAN).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link After its arrival, the Saab F-39 Gripen was transferred to Navegantes International Airport, where the necessary technical procedures will be conducted to prepare it for its flight to Anápolis Air Base. (Picture source: Força Aérea Brasileira) The F-39E Gripen’s arrival is part of the FAB’s modernization program, aimed at enhancing Brazil’s air combat capabilities. The transition comes after the prolonged use of older fighter jets, particularly the American-made Northrop F-5, which became the primary fighter jet following the retirement of the Mirage 2000 in late 2013. The Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) acquired a total of 79 F-5s over the years, with the initial purchase consisting of 42 new units in 1973 (including 6 two-seat B training units and 36 one-seat E units). In 1988, another 26 new units were acquired (comprising 4 B training units and 22 E units), followed by the acquisition of 11 used units from Jordan in 2000, as the production of F-5s had ended in the United States in 1987. Currently, approximately 50 of these jets remain in active service. To ensure the continued service of the F-5 fleet, a modernization program began in 2005 and was completed in October 2020. Embraer managed the modernization, upgrading the F-5s with new avionics systems, multifunctional displays, Italian Grifo F multimode radars, electronic countermeasures, and compatibility with modern missiles and laser-guided bombs. The modernization project, known as the FX project, resulted in the F-5s being designated as F-5EM/F-5FM variants, with contributions from Israeli companies ATL and Elbit Systems. The final modernized F-5M fighter was delivered to the FAB on October 14, 2020, concluding the 15-year program and resulting in a total of 49 fighters being upgraded. The shift towards the Gripen began in 2013 with the Brazilian Gripen Program, when Saab was selected for the F-X2 contract to replace the aging fleet. In October 2014, a contract was signed with the Brazilian government for the development and production of 36 Gripen NG aircraft, consisting of 28 single-seat F-39Es and eight dual-seat F-39Fs, along with two flight simulators, with a total value of SEK38.9 billion (USD4.25 billion). The shift towards the Gripen began in 2013 with the Brazilian Gripen Program, when Saab was selected for the F-X2 contract to replace the aging fleet of 79 American-made F-5s. (Picture source: Saab) As the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) operates both F-5 and Gripen-E fighters, Brazilian Air Force Commander, Lieutenant Brigadier Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno, emphasized that Brazilian regulations require the fleet to consist of at least two but not more than three fighter types, suggesting the Indian Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) could serve as the second or third type alongside the Gripen-E once the F-5 is phased out. This consideration was confirmed in a meeting with Indian defense officials, including Air Chief Marshal V.R. Chaudhari and Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi, on September 11, 2024. On November 24, 2021, the FAB formally received its first four series-production Saab F-39Es, Brazil's designation for the single-seat Gripen E variant. These jets were accepted at the Saab Aeronautics plant in Linköping, Sweden, and later shipped to Brazil to join the Jaguar Squadron at Wing 2 in Anápolis, Goiás. These fighters joined a single-seat F-39E Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) aircraft that had been delivered to Brazil on September 11, 2019, for testing in both Sweden and Brazil. The entire delivery schedule for the Gripen fleet is structured in multiple phases, with the last two fighters expected to be delivered by 2026. The Gripen program includes Embraer as the main Brazilian partner, receiving about 60 to 70% of the technology transfer and offset packages. The FAB currently operates nine F-39Es and has another 27 Gripen E/Fs on order, scheduled for delivery from 2019 to 2026. This will create a total fleet of 36 F-39E/Fs, operated by the 'Jaguar' Squadron of the 1st Air Defense Group.

The Gripen, designed as a multirole fighter, had its first flight in 1988 and entered service in 1996. The Gripen E, also referred to as Gripen NG (Next Generation), represents a significant redesign, with deliveries starting in 2019. The Gripen E features a General Electric F414-GE-39E turbofan engine, producing a maximum thrust of 98 kN with an afterburner. The aircraft can achieve speeds of Mach 2 (approximately 2,100 km/h) at an altitude of 15,240 m and sustain supercruise at Mach 1.25 without an afterburner. It has a combat range of approximately 1,500 km in an air-to-ground configuration and a ferry range of up to 4,000 km with external fuel tanks, operating within a service ceiling of 16,000 m and a g-force range of +9/-3. Equipped with ten hardpoints, the Gripen E can carry a payload of up to 7,200 kg, including a variety of armaments such as a 27 mm Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon (120 rounds on single-seat models), air-to-air missiles (IRIS-T, AIM-9 Sidewinder, MBDA Meteor), and air-to-surface weapons (AGM-65 Maverick, RBS-15F anti-ship missile).

Russian spy ships suspected of espionage in Baltic and North Seas	According to information published by Suddeutsche Zeitung on September 24, 2024, alarming activity by Russian ships in the Baltic and North Seas has raised suspicions of espionage and sabotage of critical infrastructure.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 865 Hydrographic survey vessel Sibirykov. (Picture source: Сделано у нас) The investigation, which involved journalists from six countries, revealed that Russian research ships, often equipped with military technology, have been spying on gas pipelines, data cables, wind farms, and military infrastructure in the region. One incident from October 2023 highlights the concern. The containership Newnew Polar Bear abruptly slowed down while crossing the Balticconnector pipeline, causing severe damage to the pipeline with its anchor. This came just months after the Russian seabed survey ship Sibiryakov was observed performing suspicious maneuvers, at least once directly over the pipeline, sparking suspicions that it might have been preparing for sabotage. Ships like the Sibiryakov are part of a broader network of Russian vessels conducting surveillance missions in the area. These research ships are said to be under the control of the Russian Ministry of Defense and are fitted with sophisticated equipment, including military-grade radar systems. The investigation tracked 72 Russian research vessels, which have made 428 voyages since the start of the war in Ukraine. Analysis of over 1,000 Morse code transmissions and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data points indicate that these activities have increased in recent months. Ships have been detected entering the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of several EU countries at low speeds, often below 5 knots, a tactic experts associate with espionage missions. Many of these incursions were in close proximity to vital infrastructure like gas pipelines and offshore wind farms. In Germany alone, over 2,600 Russia-affiliated vessels have reportedly made 'area visits' in German territorial waters since the Ukraine conflict began, with 143 of them flying the Russian flag. This prompted German authorities to increase their surveillance efforts, with government figures confirming that since 2023, 107 escort missions by police and navy frigates have been conducted to monitor suspicious activity in the country’s EEZ. One notable case involved the Yevgeniy Gorigledzha, a Russian vessel that loitered for more than eight hours near Fehmarn Island, a known NATO submarine diving area. The ship’s erratic zigzag movements raised concerns of potential espionage, leading to intervention by both a German police ship and a navy vessel. NATO experts warn that these activities could be preparatory steps for sabotage. Many of these Russian ships are believed to carry advanced military equipment, such as mini-submarines and underwater drones, which could be used to disrupt or damage critical infrastructure in the event of heightened geopolitical tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-spy-ships-suspected-of-espionage-in-baltic-and-north-seas	2024-09-25T05:45:54-07:00
