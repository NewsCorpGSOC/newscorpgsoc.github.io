The 'Palestine 2' missile’s capacity to evade interception makes critical infrastructure and population centers like Tel Aviv particularly vulnerable. The psychological impact of this new threat cannot be overstated. Israel’s reputation for maintaining an impenetrable defense network has been a cornerstone of its security doctrine. Yemen's successful deployment of hypersonic technology undermines this perception, potentially eroding public confidence and emboldening adversaries. Furthermore, the threat of coordinated attacks involving Yemen, Hamas, and Hezbollah stretches Israel’s military resources, increasing the likelihood of defensive oversaturation and failure to address all threats effectively. The risks extend far beyond Israel’s borders. The 'Palestine 2' missile also introduces significant challenges for the United States and its allies, particularly naval forces operating in the region. Hypersonic missiles are a game-changer for maritime warfare, capable of targeting large and mobile assets such as aircraft carriers, destroyers, and amphibious ships. Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons combine extreme speed with unpredictable flight paths, rendering existing ship-based defenses, such as the Aegis Combat System, less effective. The potential for Yemen to target U.S. vessels not only threatens military operations but also undermines the perception of American dominance in the region. In addition to naval assets, Yemen’s hypersonic capabilities threaten key maritime chokepoints, including the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden. These waterways are critical for global commerce and military logistics. A strike or even the credible threat of disruption in these areas could have catastrophic economic consequences, affecting trade routes and energy supplies worldwide. U.S. allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are also at significant risk. Their naval forces and offshore energy infrastructure remain particularly vulnerable, given their relatively limited defensive capabilities compared to those of the U.S. Navy. On a broader scale, the emergence of hypersonic missile technology in Yemen reshapes the balance of power in the Middle East. Hypersonic missiles combine speed, precision, and maneuverability, making them extremely difficult to counter. Their deployment undermines traditional deterrence frameworks, heightens the risk of miscalculation, and complicates military planning for nations dependent on conventional defense systems. The proliferation of such technology to smaller states and non-state actors like Yemen, often through Iranian support, accelerates the destabilization of an already volatile region. Yemen’s deployment of 'Palestine 2' missile underscores its commitment to the Palestinian cause and its role in the broader anti-Israel alliance. Its use of advanced technology highlights a growing willingness to engage directly in regional conflicts, challenging Israel and its allies both strategically and militarily. For the United States and its partners, this development necessitates urgent investment in next-generation defensive technologies, such as directed-energy weapons, enhanced early-warning systems, and hypersonic interception capabilities. As tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate, the strategic, economic, and military implications of Yemen’s actions are profound. By introducing hypersonic missiles into the theater, Yemen has reshaped the contours of conflict, setting a precedent that will likely influence regional and global security strategies for years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-yemen-targets-israel-with-palestine-2-hypersonic-missile-posing-new-threats-for-us-and-allies	2024-12-18T02:00:13-08:00

Saab prepares Gripen jet successor with stealth fighters and AI-powered drones	As reported by SVT Nyheter on December 12, 2024, Saab is advancing preparations for Sweden's next-generation fighter jet as the JAS 39 Gripen nears the end of its operational service life, with the deployment of a replacement envisioned around 2050. Saab’s proposal focuses on a mix of manned and unmanned platforms, including a low-cost subsonic uncrewed platform under one ton, a supersonic uncrewed platform over five tons, a subsonic uncrewed platform under five tons, and a new manned fighter. These will incorporate technologies such as artificial intelligence, networked operations, and stealth capabilities, which are considered necessary for future air combat requirements.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Saab's future fighter will retain key elements from the Gripen, including its engine, vehicle systems, and avionics, while introducing a stealthier airframe, a new digital backbone, advanced communication systems, and AI integrations. (Picture source: Saab via SVT Nyheter) According to available visuals, Saab's future fighter will retain key elements from the Gripen, including its engine, vehicle systems, and avionics, while introducing a stealthier airframe, a new digital backbone, advanced communication systems, and AI integrations. The future design will omit the canards featured on the current Gripen. A key part of Saab’s approach includes 'loyal wingman' drones—uncrewed aerial systems designed to operate alongside manned fighters. These drones could serve as decoys to absorb enemy fire or conduct surveillance and precision strikes in high-risk environments. Peter Nilsson, head of Saab’s Advanced Programs business unit, stated that certain platforms might be designed for expendability to fulfill these roles. Saab is also incorporating stealth technologies, including radar-absorbing materials and improved aerodynamic designs, to enhance low observability. Stealth has become a critical feature in air warfare, enabling aircraft to reduce radar detection. The proposals are part of Saab’s Future Combat Aircraft Concept (KFS) study, launched in mid-2023. The program prioritizes low observability, autonomy, and electronic warfare capabilities. Technology validation efforts have included wind tunnel testing and computer simulations. Saab presented its supersonic stealth drone concept at the 33rd International Congress of Aeronautical Sciences in September 2022, featuring internal weapons bays and low-drag aerodynamic design. The KFS program, running until 2030, focuses on demonstrators for both manned and unmanned systems. The program gained further momentum in March 2024 when Försvarets materielverk (FMV), Sweden’s Defence Materiel Administration, awarded Saab a contract for concept studies. These studies cover manned and unmanned platforms, technology demonstrators, and system-level developments. Saab is collaborating with the Swedish Armed Forces, the Total Defense Research Institute, and GKN Aerospace, with studies expected to conclude by the end of 2025. The work coincides with ongoing upgrades to the Gripen C/D fleet and the introduction of the Gripen E, which will enter service in Sweden and Brazil in 2025. Saab has stated that the Gripen E platform may serve as a testbed for emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence. Saab is testing AI integration under 'Project Beyond,' a collaboration with AI software company Helsing. The project includes embedding AI agents in beyond-visual-range combat scenarios directly into operational systems. According to Saab’s head of Gripen, Johan Segertoft, developments in AI and uncrewed systems could also improve manned fighter performance. Saab is exploring additional technologies, such as radar modules integrated within composite structures to enhance radar performance, and it is preparing to test its 3D-printed UAV 'Ruby' under the Rainforest accelerator program. Ruby, powered by a GE Aerospace J85 engine from a Saab 105 trainer, will be tested at the Vidsel range in northern Sweden for defense and civilian applications, including wildfire monitoring. Saab’s proposals aim to integrate manned and unmanned systems, stealth, and AI technologies, with tested platforms like the Gripen E supporting the development process. (Picture source: NATO Air Command) Geopolitical developments, including Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, have increased Sweden’s focus on air defense modernization. Sweden’s 2025–2030 defense strategy addresses these security concerns while aligning with NATO requirements. The strategy increases defense spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2028, allocating 170 billion SEK (€14.9 billion) for military defense and 35.7 billion SEK (€3.1 billion) for civil defense. Sweden has contributed €4.2 billion in military aid to Ukraine, highlighting the importance of stockpiling resources and enhancing logistical readiness for prolonged conflicts. Lessons from Ukraine’s war emphasize the need for technological adaptability, layered air defense, and long-range strike capabilities. Sweden has maintained an independent defense approach, while other Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, and Denmark) have procured US-made F-35 fighters. Sweden’s air defense strategy retains six Swedish Air Force squadrons equipped with JAS 39 Gripen aircraft, including both JAS 39E and older JAS 39C/D variants, to meet NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) requirements. Infrastructure upgrades are planned to improve airbase dispersal and mobilization, and pilot training programs will expand with international opportunities. Between 2025 and 2030, the fighter divisions will integrate long-range strike capabilities and unmanned aerial systems for reconnaissance and security. In December 2022, Sweden exited the UK-led Tempest program, now part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), due to misalignment with its priorities and timeline. Meanwhile, other European nations, including France, Germany, and Spain, are advancing the FCAS sixth-generation fighter program. Analysts such as Lars Peder Haga from the Norwegian Defense Academy point to the financial and technological challenges of independent fighter development. However, Sweden has previously developed advanced aircraft, such as the Viggen and Gripen. Peter Hultqvist, defense spokesperson for the Social Democrats, emphasized the importance of retaining Sweden’s domestic fighter development capability due to its industrial and strategic value. Addressing concerns about development costs, Peter Nilsson referenced the successful JAS 39 Gripen program from the 1980s, which faced similar financial skepticism. Saab’s approach involves sourcing approximately 85% of components internationally while retaining control over design and system integration as a cost-effective solution. The decision on Sweden’s future combat aircraft, expected by 2030, will determine the country’s airpower capabilities and defense industrial strategy. Saab’s proposals aim to integrate manned and unmanned systems, stealth, and AI technologies, with tested platforms like the Gripen E supporting the development process. Sweden’s options include domestic development, international collaboration, or procuring foreign-built systems, with implications for Saab’s workforce, which includes 6,000 engineers in Linköping. The outcome will influence Sweden’s long-term defense readiness and industrial landscape.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/saab-prepares-gripen-jet-successor-with-stealth-fighters-and-ai-powered-drones	2024-12-17T07:19:16-08:00

(Picture source: Aselsan) Aselsan appears to have specifically developed the Kalkan-050G for this new 8x8 air defense system. The Kalkan-050G is a multifunctional air defense radar equipped with a two-axis Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna operating in the S-band. It has a detection range of 25 kilometers and is designed to identify and track aerial targets, including fighter jets, helicopters, UAVs, and ballistic munitions. The radar features high-resolution target acquisition, automatic classification, and multi-target tracking. It integrates with Aselsan systems such as the AKREP 100-G and is compatible with next-generation armored platforms and layered air defense networks. Imagery in the Kalkan-050G brochure introduces a new wheeled air defense system, distinct from the earlier Korkut self-propelled anti-aircraft gun system. Unlike the Korkut’s twin-barrel configuration, the new platform uses a single-barrel system. Its design resembles the German Skyranger system and may include MKE’s 35 mm Revolver cannon, currently under development. Expected modifications, such as updates to the KDC-002 turret and weapon systems, suggest performance improvements and efforts to address previous limitations. The platform, informally referred to as a 'Turkish Skyranger,' is identified as an evolution of the earlier Korkut air defense system. It could incorporate a 3D AESA radar for target acquisition, two banks of four smoke grenade launchers for defensive measures, and modular weapon configurations. The system also highlights the potential integration of MKE’s 35 mm Revolver cannon. These updates reflect Türkiye's active development of new air defense systems to enhance national security and achieve self-reliance in defense technology. This effort is driven by the need to protect airspace from various aerial threats, including missiles, drones, and advanced aircraft, while reducing dependence on foreign defense systems. The development of indigenous air defense capabilities aims to address emerging security challenges and strengthen Türkiye's strategic autonomy. Concrete examples of these developments include the Hisar-A and Hisar-O missile systems, which provide low and medium-altitude air defense against threats such as helicopters, fighter jets, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Additionally, Türkiye is working on the Siper long-range air defense system, designed to counter higher-altitude threats and enhance the country's layered air defense strategy. These systems reflect Türkiye's commitment to developing indigenous solutions to meet modern defense requirements. The Korkut system, initially designed for low-altitude air defense, features twin 35 mm cannons with a combined rate of fire of 1,100 rounds per minute and an effective range of 4,000 meters. Mounted on an ACV-30 tracked vehicle, the system offers amphibious capabilities suitable for various terrains. In response to challenges such as high-speed targets and large-scale drone swarms, Aselsan has developed the Korkut 110/35S, a single-barrel 35 mm variant optimized for very low-altitude air and ground defense. Key additions include FPV jamming capabilities, Very Short Range Air Defense (VSHORAD) missiles, and an automatic linkless ammunition feed mechanism that enables switching between ammunition types within 15 seconds. The stabilized turret supports accurate firing while on the move, and fire control radars with electro-optical sensors provide automatic target tracking. The Boxer Skyranger 35, developed by Rheinmetall, is a comparable short-range air defense system mounted on an 8×8 wheeled Boxer armored vehicle. It is equipped with a 35 mm revolver cannon that can fire up to 1,000 rounds per minute with an effective range of 4,000 meters. The system uses AHEAD airburst ammunition for improved effectiveness against drones and aerial targets. The Boxer Skyranger’s wheeled platform emphasizes on-road mobility, whereas the Korkut’s tracked chassis offers amphibious capabilities and superior off-road performance, although there is also a wheeled version. The Skyranger’s modular design also allows for future integration of guided missiles and high-energy lasers. The advancements reflected in the Kalkan-050G radar and the 'Turkish Skyranger' indicate efforts to adapt existing air defense systems to modern battlefield requirements. Key updates, including FPV jamming capabilities, VSHORAD missiles, and 3D AESA radar integration, provide increased versatility against loitering munitions, drones, and other aerial threats. These updates, combined with weapon system adjustments such as the integration of the MKE Revolver cannon, align with ongoing trends toward more adaptable and modular air defense solutions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/tuerkiye-develops-new-8x8-air-defense-system-to-compete-with-german-boxer-skyranger-35	2024-12-17T03:31:29-08:00

Black Sea The Black Sea remains a vital and contested maritime domain, with the navies of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia all navigating evolving challenges and roles in the region. Russia's Black Sea Fleet, once dominant, has faced severe disruptions. Ukrainian attacks, particularly with drones and long-range missiles, have significantly reduced Russia’s operational freedom. The loss of the Moskva cruiser and repeated strikes on Sevastopol have forced Russia to reposition much of its fleet to Novorossiysk and further into the Sea of Azov. While it retains submarines and missile-capable corvettes, Russia’s ability to project power in the Black Sea has been hampered, forcing it into a more defensive posture. The Ukrainian Navy, though diminished in conventional strength, has revolutionized naval warfare in the Black Sea. With innovative use of unmanned surface vessels and domestically produced Neptune missiles, Ukraine has inflicted disproportionate damage. This asymmetric strategy has not only targeted major Russian vessels but has also disrupted supply lines to Crimea, diminishing Russia's naval control. Turkey, as the most significant naval power in the Black Sea, carefully manages its position. Its navy, which operates advanced frigates, corvettes, and submarines, focuses on safeguarding Turkish interests while balancing its geopolitical relationships. Turkey’s strict enforcement of the Montreux Convention limits external naval intervention in the Black Sea, ensuring it remains a regional actor with considerable influence. Romania’s naval forces are modest but active. While relying on aging Type 22 frigates and smaller patrol vessels, Romania has increasingly focused on modernization programs to enhance its capabilities. This includes upgrading its fleet for better coastal defense and mine-clearance operations, vital for maintaining the safety of Black Sea shipping lanes. Georgia does not maintain a formal navy. Its Coast Guard remains responsible for maritime security, focusing on territorial water patrols and countering smuggling. Heavily reliant on external support, Georgia continues to upgrade its patrol capabilities through assistance programs.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/bulgarias-naval-modernization-second-patrol-vessel-successfully-launched	2024-12-17T01:43:55-08:00

15th Khordad Air Defense Systems: Iran’s Response to Growing US-Israel Strike Threats	According to information published by Russian sources on December 15, 2024, Iran has begun deploying its 15th Khordad air defense systems near critical nuclear facilities, a move aimed at countering escalating threats from the United States and Israel. The latest reports confirm the presence of these systems around the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear site in Natanz, a key location in Iran’s uranium enrichment efforts situated in Isfahan Province.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Iran fortifies its nuclear facilities with advanced 15th Khordad air defense systems, signaling preparedness against potential U.S. and Israeli strikes. (Picture source: Defa Press) The Natanz facility, one of Iran’s key nuclear sites, has long been under international scrutiny due to allegations by the U.S. and Israel that it plays a central role in Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Both nations claim that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities, a charge Tehran vehemently denies, asserting its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Despite these denials, Israel and the U.S. have reiterated their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, with Israel in particular warning of preemptive military action if diplomatic efforts fail. The 15th Khordad air defense system, introduced in 2019, represents a significant leap in Iran’s ability to defend its airspace. As a domestically designed and manufactured platform, it symbolizes Iran’s push for self-reliance in military technology, especially under the weight of international sanctions that limit its access to foreign arms. This advanced system is capable of detecting and engaging a wide range of aerial threats, including fighter jets, drones, and stealth aircraft. It can identify targets at a distance of up to 150 kilometers, track them within a 120-kilometer radius, and engage at ranges of up to 75 kilometers. For stealth targets, the system offers detection capabilities at 85 kilometers and interception at 45 kilometers. The 15th Khordad is also capable of simultaneously tracking and intercepting six targets, making it a formidable tool against coordinated aerial attacks. One of its standout features is its rapid deployment time, requiring less than five minutes to become operational, allowing Iranian forces to quickly respond to potential threats. The system is equipped with Sayyad-3 missiles, which are designed for medium- to long-range engagements. These missiles enhance the system’s capacity to neutralize advanced aerial threats, including those posed by modern fighter aircraft and high-altitude surveillance platforms. The system’s maximum operational altitude is 27 kilometers, enabling it to engage targets across a broad vertical range. The placement of the 15th Khordad systems near the Natanz nuclear facility signals Iran’s intent to shield its most sensitive sites from potential airstrikes. This move comes amid heightened tensions with Israel, which has a history of targeting Iranian-linked assets in Syria and is widely believed to have carried out sabotage operations against Iranian nuclear sites in the past. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasized that his country will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability, and Israeli military officials have reportedly developed operational plans for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. U.S. rhetoric has also been strong, with Washington maintaining that all options remain on the table to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program. However, the Biden administration has so far prioritized diplomatic efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. Despite these efforts, the lack of progress in negotiations has fueled speculation that military action by either Israel or the U.S. remains a possibility. The deployment of the 15th Khordad systems also reflects Iran’s broader strategy to counter increasing Israeli activity in the region. Over recent years, the Israeli Air Force has conducted numerous strikes in Syria, targeting Iranian-aligned forces and infrastructure. These operations, facilitated by the limited air defense capabilities in Syria, demonstrate Israel’s ability to project power across the region. Analysts suggest that these missions could serve as a precursor to strikes on Iran, as they test Israel’s operational readiness and tactics. Iran’s deployment of the 15th Khordad systems adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile Middle East. While Tehran views these measures as defensive, their strategic implications are likely to alarm its adversaries.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/15th-khordad-air-defense-systems-irans-response-to-growing-us-israel-strike-threats	2024-12-16T05:27:35-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belarus notably possesses Russian Iskander-M launchers and missiles capable of being equipped with nuclear warheads (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) This nuclear deployment aligns with a significant revision of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, which now explicitly includes Belarus under Moscow’s 'nuclear umbrella.' This marks a historical shift for Minsk, which relinquished its nuclear arsenal following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. At that time, Belarus transferred its nuclear weapons to Russia and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear state. However, recent events, including a 2022 constitutional referendum that removed Belarus’ nuclear-free status, have paved the way for this return to hosting nuclear capabilities. President Lukashenko stated that these weapons were transferred discreetly, avoiding detection by Western intelligence agencies. He emphasized their defensive role against potential threats, particularly from Belarus’ borders. This strategy relies on Iskander ballistic missiles, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, as well as fighter jets equipped with nuclear bombs. These systems enable rapid targeting of potential positions in Ukraine or NATO member states, enhancing the deterrence capabilities of the Russo-Belarusian alliance. In addition, Lukashenko revealed preparations are underway for the deployment of the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile in 2025. Capable of carrying multiple warheads and reaching speeds exceeding Mach 10, this system is designed to evade missile defense systems, offering Russia an unparalleled strategic advantage. Russian President Vladimir Putin has highlighted the conventional power of the Oreshnik, stating its destructive capability rivals that of nuclear strikes. While control of these weapons will remain with Moscow, Minsk will be involved in selecting targets, further integrating the military strategies of the two nations. The Oreshnik missile represents a notable development in Russia's strategic arsenal. With hypersonic capabilities and an estimated range of 1,000 to 5,500 kilometers, it can strike critical infrastructure across Europe and parts of Asia. Equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), it can deliver conventional or nuclear warheads to several targets simultaneously with precision. First used operationally in November 2024 during the conflict in Ukraine, the missile demonstrated its strategic potential in a strike against an industrial facility. Although the warheads used were inert, the kinetic energy generated by the hypersonic speed caused significant damage, showcasing its effectiveness as both a tactical weapon and a tool of strategic deterrence. Lukashenko also noted that Belarus has retained dozens of Soviet-era sites suitable for deploying such systems. These facilities, combined with local production of transport vehicles for ballistic missiles, underline Minsk’s commitment to strengthening its role within its strategic partnership with Moscow. This alliance, formalized through a recently signed mutual security treaty, aims to deter any external aggression, particularly from NATO. The deployment of these systems, however, raises international concerns about regional stability and the risk of military escalation. While Moscow and Minsk assert that the measures are purely defensive, they represent a substantial increase in strategic pressure on Eastern Europe. Additionally, the recent lowering of Russia’s threshold for nuclear weapon use amplifies fears of potential conflict involving weapons of mass destruction. The hosting of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus and the planned deployment of Oreshnik missiles mark a significant evolution in regional security dynamics. For Minsk, these developments strengthen its strategic position alongside Moscow but also pose questions about its long-term sovereignty and security. As Belarus becomes an integral part of Russia’s nuclear strategy, these actions underscore growing tensions among major powers, signaling considerable challenges for international stability and security. Belarus’ interest in hosting advanced missile systems such as the Oreshnik lies in its strategic value. By accommodating these advanced systems, Belarus enhances its military alliance with Russia, securing stronger defense guarantees amid growing tensions with NATO and Western nations. These weapons provide Minsk with a deterrent against potential foreign intervention and bolster its geopolitical leverage in international negotiations. For European nations and NATO, the deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus represents a significant escalation of threats near their eastern borders.

Breaking News: British Army Deploys Laser Weapon from Wolfhound Armored Vehicle for First Time to Counter Drones	The British Army has successfully deployed a laser weapon system mounted on an armored vehicle, marking the first operational use of such technology in the field. The High Energy Laser (HEL) demonstrator, developed through a collaboration between Defence Equipment &amp; Support (DE&amp;S), the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and Raytheon UK, was successfully tested in October 2024 at Radnor Range in Wales. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The British Army has successfully deployed a laser weapon system mounted on an armored vehicle, marking the first operational use of such technology in the field. (Picture source: British DoD) This test, a key step in the development of directed energy weapons, saw the laser mounted on a Wolfhound vehicle, an armored troop-carrying platform used by the British Army. Soldiers from the 16th Royal Artillery Regiment tracked and destroyed a series of drones in flight, demonstrating the HEL system’s effectiveness against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in real-world conditions. The ability to engage and neutralize aerial threats using a directed energy weapon marks a turning point in the Army’s approach to countering fast-moving and mobile targets like drones. The test was made possible through collaboration between DSTL, DE&amp;S, and Raytheon UK. Together, they developed the system as part of the UK Ministry of Defence’s efforts to explore advanced, cost-effective, and scalable technological solutions to protect military assets against growing drone threats. This success is part of Project Swinton, a demonstrator for the Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) system, which showcases the viability of lasers as a future solution for countering uncrewed aerial systems (C-UAS). The rise of drones during the Ukrainian conflict has marked a turning point in modern warfare, with thousands of drones used by both sides for reconnaissance, attack, and intelligence missions. These devices, often small and inexpensive, have allowed Ukrainian forces to conduct targeted strikes on strategic objectives while bypassing traditional defense systems. At the same time, drones have proven effective tools for harassing and disrupting enemy lines, offering an excellent cost-to-effectiveness ratio compared to larger conventional weapons. In the face of this growing threat, it has become imperative for armies to have access to low-cost, efficient solutions to counter drones, including loitering munitions and surveillance UAVs. Technologies such as directed energy weapons, capable of destroying drones in flight with a much lower cost per shot compared to traditional munitions, have thus become essential for ensuring the protection of armed forces against this new form of asymmetric warfare. The LDEW system works by directing an intense beam of infrared light in the form of energy toward its target using advanced sensors and tracking systems, which maintain real-time accuracy and lock-on. For security reasons, it has not been revealed how long the beam must stay in contact with the target before it is destroyed. Stephen Waller, the Directed Energy Weapons Team Leader at DE&amp;S, noted, 'This is still an emerging technology, but the world has changed, and we are seeing more drones in the battlespace. This requires a more cost-effective solution to protect our troops.' Indeed, cheaper drone technologies are now available on the market thanks to advancements in the commercial sector. These drones can be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, but as inexpensive loitering munitions, they present a significant cost gap compared to the larger armored vehicles they disable. This is particularly evident in Ukraine, where defense officials have confirmed that Ukrainian forces have deployed over 1.2 million drones in the last 11 months against invading Russian forces. By the end of 2024, they added, another 100,000 units are planned for delivery. In light of this reality, solutions like the LDEW system present a critical potential response to the growing drone threat. The successful test at Radnor Range is not only a technical victory but also a strong signal of the British Army’s intention to continue investing in advanced defense technologies. By integrating directed energy weapon systems into armored vehicles like the Wolfhound, the Army is preparing for the future of defense vehicles, where the emphasis will be placed on advanced weapons and active defense solutions. The trials at Radnor Range are part of a larger program aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of these technologies in real combat scenarios. The deployment of laser weapons could indeed revolutionize the way armies around the world respond to emerging aerial threats while reducing the costs and risks associated with traditional defense methods. The British Army, through partnerships such as those between DSTL, DE&amp;S, and Raytheon UK, continues to demonstrate its commitment to staying at the forefront of defense innovation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-british-army-deploys-laser-weapon-from-wolfhound-armored-vehicle-for-first-time-to-counter-drones	2024-12-13T02:45:15-08:00

Syria's Navy Neutralized: Israeli Forces Target Missile Boats in Mediterranean	According to information published by the Israeli MoD on December 10, 2024, the Israeli Navy launched a large-scale offensive yesterday targeting Syrian naval assets at the Port of Latakia and Minet el-Beida Bay in Northwestern Syria. The operation, described by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Katz as a 'decisive strike,' reportedly resulted in the complete destruction of the Syrian Navy's Mediterranean fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Israeli Navy strikes Syrian naval assets in Latakia and Minet el-Beida Bay, claiming total destruction of the Syrian Navy's Mediterranean fleet. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) Footage released by the Israeli Navy captures the intensity of the operation, which focused on neutralizing strategic assets of the Syrian Navy. Among the targets were six Osa I and six Osa II-class missile boats, vessels armed with potent sea-to-sea missile systems. These Soviet-designed fast attack crafts, renowned for their speed and firepower, have been a cornerstone of Syrian maritime defense for decades. However, their destruction represents a critical blow to Syria's naval capabilities in the region. The Israeli Navy employed precision-guided munitions, electronic warfare measures, and coordinated strikes to neutralize these vessels. The operation reportedly involved advanced missile systems, potentially launched from Israel's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes and Dolphin-class submarines. The Port of Latakia, Syria's principal seaport, and Minet el-Beida Bay, a strategic maritime location near the Turkish border, were key focal points of the offensive. Latakia has been a hub for Syrian naval operations and has seen increased activity due to its proximity to Russian military installations. The targeting of this port underscores Israel's intent to disrupt Syrian maritime operations and its broader strategic partnerships. Minet el-Beida Bay, though less prominent, holds strategic value due to its location and potential use as a covert operational base for Syrian forces. By striking these locations, Israel aims to limit any future resurgence of Syrian naval power in the Mediterranean. The offensive comes amid heightened tensions in the region, with ongoing conflicts and shifting alliances complicating the geopolitical landscape. The Syrian Navy's reliance on aging Soviet-era vessels, coupled with limited resources for modernization, had already placed it at a disadvantage compared to Israel's naval fleet. This operation further solidifies Israel's maritime dominance. Meanwhile, regional observers suggest the operation could have far-reaching implications for maritime security in the Eastern Mediterranean. The destruction of Syrian naval assets not only weakens Damascus but also sends a warning to other adversaries in the region. This operation aligns with Israel's long-standing policy of preemptive strikes against perceived threats. While previous actions have primarily targeted land-based missile sites and arms depots, this marks one of the most significant naval operations by Israel in recent years. As tensions remain high, the Eastern Mediterranean is likely to see increased militarization and potential for further confrontations. For Israel, the success of this operation reinforces its strategic deterrence, though the broader regional fallout remains uncertain. Israel’s readiness and ability to conduct such a comprehensive maritime operation underscore its focus on maintaining security and supremacy in the face of regional threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/syrias-navy-neutralized-israeli-forces-target-missile-boats-in-mediterranean	2024-12-12T02:19:34-08:00

Japan selects US-made T-6 Texan II as new trainer aircraft to replace locally-made Fuji T-7	Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on November 29, 2024, the selection of the Textron Aviation Defense Beechcraft T-6 Texan II turboprop aircraft, proposed by Kanematsu Corporation, as the next-generation primary trainer for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). This selection is part of the replacement program for the Fuji T-7 trainers, which have been in service since 2003 and are approaching the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The selection process commenced on August 21, 2024, when the MoD issued requests for proposals. Evaluations were conducted in two stages. The first stage assessed compliance with performance, ground training systems, logistical support, and operational requirements. Out of four proposals, only the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II and the PC-7MKX, proposed by Subaru Corporation, advanced to the second stage. The Turkish Hurkus, proposed by Daihyaku Shoji, did not meet critical requirements, while Shintoa Trading’s proposal was disqualified due to the absence of a required aircraft component. In the second stage, a scoring system was used to evaluate performance, cost, and operational factors. The T-6 Texan II achieved the highest score and was selected. The total program cost for the T-6, including six simulators and other ground training equipment, is estimated at JPY 133.65 billion ($882.09 million). Each aircraft is projected to cost JPY 1.21 billion ($7.99 million). The FY2025 budget includes an allocation of JPY 21.2 billion ($139.92 million) for two aircraft and related systems. Japan plans to procure 36 aircraft in total, all to be imported, with deliveries scheduled through FY2030 to align with the planned retirement of the Fuji T-7 fleet. The selection of the T-6 Texan II did not include trial flights, relying instead on document-based evaluations. This methodology, while less common, reflects the MoD’s focus on cost-effectiveness and operational compliance. The decision builds on Japan’s historical use of earlier T-6 variants, including the T-6D/F/G and SNJ-5/6, operated by the JASDF and Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) from 1955. These earlier variants were replaced by jet-powered trainers in the 1960s, though some are preserved in museums, and one remains operational at Shizuhama Air Base. The MoD’s selection of the T-6 Texan II is part of a broader modernization of Japan’s pilot training infrastructure. The program is designed to prepare pilots for advanced fighter aircraft while addressing operational requirements. It remains uncertain whether the T-6 could also replace other training platforms, such as the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s T-5 trainer or the Kawasaki T-4 advanced trainer. The T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Japan’s acquisition of the T-6 aligns with international trends toward standardization in training systems. Deliveries are set to begin in 2027, marking the first step in Japan’s phased approach to upgrading its training fleet. The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II is equipped with a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-68 turboprop engine generating 1,100 horsepower. Its specifications include a maximum speed of 586 km/h, a climb rate of 1,372 meters per minute, a service ceiling of 9,500 meters, and a range of 1,574 kilometers. Compared to the T-7, which has a maximum speed of 376 km/h and a ceiling of 7,620 meters, the T-6 provides increased performance metrics. The aircraft incorporates a digital glass cockpit with multi-function displays, a head-up display, and navigation systems. Safety features include ejection seats capable of zero-zero operations and a pressurized cockpit. It also supports synthetic air-to-ground and air-to-air training capabilities. The Fuji T-7, developed by Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru), has served as the JASDF’s primary trainer since 2003, replacing the T-3. Its design is derived from the Fuji T-3, which was influenced by the Beechcraft T-34C Turbo Mentor, highlighting the historical use of American aircraft designs in JASDF training. Officially adopted in 2003, the T-7 introduced the Rolls-Royce 250-B17F turboprop engine for improved operational reliability. It was selected over the Pilatus PC-7, despite procurement-related controversies. Key features include a low-wing monoplane design, tandem seating, and cockpit modifications, with cost efficiency achieved through component reuse from the T-3. Of the 49 units produced, all remain in use at JASDF training bases. Their retirement is scheduled to begin in 2030 as the T-6 Texan II is phased in. The T-7 has not been exported due to political considerations rather than technical constraints.

Greece Prioritizes M113 Modernization Over US Bradleys and French VBCIs	According to information published by the specialized website OnAlert on December 9, 2024, the Greek military has decided to modernize its fleet of M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) rather than acquire new vehicles like the American M2 Bradleys or the French VBCIs. This decision, driven by budgetary constraints and operational requirements, represents a significant move in Greece's efforts to upgrade its armored vehicle fleet while addressing its military needs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Army soldiers conducted a convoy operation to an objective during force-on-force training at Petrochori Range, Triantafyllides Camp, Greece, as part of Olympic Cooperation 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) For years, the Greek General Staff has sought to modernize its mechanized infantry, which has faced growing obsolescence in its equipment. The Kentauros Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) project, launched in the 2000s, was abandoned, leaving Greece without a viable replacement for its aging vehicles. In 2020, a proposal was made to acquire M2A2/M2A2OD Bradleys from the United States. Although approved in 2023 for the transfer of 300 units, the refurbishment costs of the vehicles proved prohibitive. Even an offer involving 62 Bradleys free of charge and 102 more under favorable financial terms was deemed unaffordable by Athens due to budgetary limitations. Simultaneously, France proposed a compelling alternative: the immediate delivery of 120 VBCIs, with an additional 250 units to be co-produced with Greek industry. However, this option was also considered too costly. A competing offer from Rheinmetall for its KF-41 Lynx failed to secure interest for similar reasons. Ultimately, the Greek military opted for a more economical solution by modernizing its M113 fleet. This program, a collaboration between the Israeli company Rafael and the Greek firm METKA, involves upgrading over 500 M113 vehicles. The modernization includes the installation of remote-controlled weapon stations with 30mm cannons, enhanced armor, a new, more powerful propulsion system, advanced communication systems, and modern optronic sensors. The upgrades will be conducted at METKA’s facility in Magnesia, with costs significantly lower than the alternatives proposed, making this option particularly attractive for Athens. However, M113s remain APCs with a weight of 12 tons, which is significantly lighter than modern IFVs like the Bradley and VBCI, which weigh nearly twice as much and offer superior firepower. The standard M113 armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun, suitable for defense against infantry and lightly armored threats. In contrast, the VBCI is equipped with a 25mm cannon mounted on a remote turret, while the Bradley boasts a 25mm M242 cannon and can be fitted with TOW anti-tank missiles, providing substantial offensive capabilities against heavily armored targets. Regarding protection, the M113 features aluminum armor designed to withstand small arms fire and shell fragments but remains vulnerable to modern anti-tank weapons. By contrast, the VBCI and Bradley provide more robust protection against ballistic threats and improvised explosive devices. Both IFVs also incorporate advanced detection and communication systems, enhancing their battlefield efficiency. While the M113 fulfills its primary role as a troop carrier, the VBCI and Bradley surpass it in firepower, protection, and operational versatility. This choice reflects a pragmatic approach by Greece to extend the lifespan of existing equipment while addressing immediate operational needs. Modernizing the M113 fleet offers a cost-effective alternative to acquiring modern IFVs, especially considering the purchase, maintenance, and training costs associated with new vehicles. Moreover, the program supports local industry through partnerships like that with METKA, contributing to the Greek defense economy. Modernizing the M113 allows Greece to respond swiftly to operational demands. While these vehicles do not match the capabilities of Bradleys or VBCIs, upgrades such as remote weapon stations, improved armor, and advanced communication systems enhance their battlefield utility. This approach also enables Greece to deploy a larger number of modernized vehicles, reinforcing its mechanized forces quantitatively, even if qualitatively they remain behind modern IFVs. Currently, the Greek military possesses approximately 2,900 M113 APCs, including various variants acquired over decades to meet operational requirements. The decision to modernize these vehicles underscores Greece’s commitment to strengthening its military capabilities within strict budgetary limits. Although economical, this strategy raises questions about its long-term viability in addressing evolving threats and operational challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-prioritizes-m113-modernization-over-american-bradleys-and-french-vbcis	2024-12-10T23:53:47-08:00	
Analysis: With Fewer Forces Than Cold War British Army Could Collapse in 6 Months of Ukraine-Style War	Veterans Minister Al Carns, a former Royal Marine colonel, has issued a grave warning about the readiness of the British Armed Forces. He cautioned that in a conflict of the scale and intensity of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the British Army could be 'expended in six months to a year.' This stark assessment underscores significant limitations in the UK’s capacity to sustain prolonged, high-intensity military engagements, raising pressing questions about its ability to fulfill national defense obligations and meet NATO commitments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British soldiers during training exercises, highlighting efforts to maintain readiness as the Army faces historic reductions in troop numbers and challenges in sustaining prolonged high-intensity conflicts. (Picture source: British MoD) Data released earlier this year by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) lends weight to these concerns. British troop numbers have plummeted to their lowest levels since the early 1800s, with a 38% decline in recruits over the past two decades. Total personnel in the armed forces has dropped from 207,000 in 2000 to just 131,000 in 2024. The British Army now fields approximately 73,000 regular soldiers—the smallest force in its modern history—while the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force stand at 29,000 and 33,000 personnel, respectively. This dramatic erosion contrasts sharply with the Cold War, when the UK maintained robust military forces designed to counter large-scale threats such as the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the British Army was one of NATO’s strongest and most capable forces. Though smaller than the U.S. military, the UK played a pivotal role in the alliance’s defense strategy, particularly in Europe. Its reputation rested on a combination of highly trained personnel, modern equipment, and strategic positioning, bolstered by its independent nuclear deterrent. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), stationed in West Germany, exemplified this strength, consisting of four armored divisions equipped with over 800 Chieftain and Challenger 1 tanks, advanced artillery, and air defense systems like the Rapier missile. The UK’s global reach further enhanced its military power. The Royal Navy operated over 130 combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and a formidable submarine fleet. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force fielded more than 850 aircraft, including Tornado, Harrier, and Jaguar fighters, alongside robust reconnaissance and transport capabilities. Today, this once-formidable capability has been significantly diminished. The British Army now operates only 227 Challenger 2 tanks, with upgrades to Challenger 3 underway. Artillery inventories have been severely reduced, and the British Army’s ability to sustain high-volume, long-range firepower in prolonged engagements falls short of modern requirements. The Royal Navy, once boasting 130 vessels, now operates just 73, including two Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but with only 19 frigates and destroyers to escort them. Similarly, the Royal Air Force’s fleet has declined to around 500 aircraft, even as advanced platforms like the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II have entered service. The war in Ukraine vividly illustrates the resources and resilience required for sustained, high-intensity conflict. Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia has depended on continuous supplies of tanks, artillery, drones, and ammunition, much of it provided by NATO allies. If the UK faced a similar-scale conflict, the British Armed Forces would likely struggle to sustain operations beyond a few months. Insufficient ammunition stockpiles, aging equipment, and gaps in critical systems such as air defense are significant vulnerabilities. British ammunition reserves, in particular, would be quickly exhausted, given the consumption rates observed in Ukraine, where thousands of artillery rounds are fired daily. Logistical endurance remains a critical challenge. The lack of robust air defense systems capable of countering drones and precision missile strikes further exposes vulnerabilities in prolonged engagements. These deficiencies underscore the UK's challenges as it seeks to modernize its forces and rebuild its capacity. Efforts to address these issues are underway. The Future Soldier initiative aims to restructure the British Army into smaller, agile Brigade Combat Teams with enhanced digital capabilities. Procurement projects, including upgrades to Challenger 3 tanks, the acquisition of Archer self-propelled howitzers, and investments in counter-drone technologies, represent steps in the right direction. However, the pace of modernization has been slow, and the gap between current capabilities and the demands of high-intensity warfare remains substantial. Financial constraints further complicate these efforts. The UK’s defense budget for the 2023/24 fiscal year was £53.9 billion, with planned increases to £56.9 billion in 2024/25 and £59.8 billion in 2025/26. This represents an annual real-terms growth rate of 2.3%. While former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030—potentially delivering an additional £75 billion—specific plans to achieve this target remain unclear. Current allocations may be insufficient to address existing capability gaps and modernization needs. The warnings from Veterans Minister Al Carns, coupled with British MoD data and lessons from the Ukraine war, highlight the urgent need for a reassessment of the UK’s defense priorities. The sharp decline in personnel, equipment, and logistical endurance underscores a critical challenge in maintaining a credible deterrent. Heavy weaponry, robust air defenses, and sustained logistical support are essential areas for investment if the British Armed Forces are to remain effective in modern warfare. Without decisive action and adequate funding, the UK risks further erosion of its military capabilities and its standing as a global military power.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-with-fewer-forces-than-cold-war-british-army-could-collapse-in-6-months-of-ukraine-style-war	2024-12-10T09:38:27-08:00

In total, over 200 Tomahawk missiles will be integrated into the RAN’s fleet, including the Hobart-class destroyers and future platforms such as the Virginia-class submarines and, pending feasibility studies, the Hunter-class frigates. This successful test follows earlier firings of the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) and the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), showcasing a suite of modern capabilities designed to fortify Australia’s maritime security. Together, these systems represent the most advanced naval strike and missile defense capabilities in the RAN’s history. The integration of these systems is part of a broader effort to strengthen the alliance between Australia and the United States. Analysis HMAS Brisbane, a Hobart-class Air Warfare Destroyer, is a highly advanced platform centered around the Aegis Combat System. Equipped with the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar and the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS), the ship is capable of deploying a range of missiles, including the Tomahawk. This adaptability highlights the destroyer’s multi-mission flexibility, integrating robust air and missile defense capabilities with long-range strike options. The Tomahawk cruise missile, with a range exceeding 1,500 kilometers, significantly extends the RAN’s operational reach. Designed for precision, the missile leverages GPS guidance and terrain-following flight capabilities to effectively strike high-value targets while minimizing the risk of interception. This precision, combined with the ability to reprogram the missile mid-flight, makes it an exceptionally versatile weapon for both preemptive and retaliatory missions. By introducing this capability, HMAS Brisbane can now engage targets far beyond the ship’s visual horizon, including strategic assets deep inland. The integration of Tomahawk missiles into the Hobart-class destroyer fleet required sophisticated updates to the Aegis Combat System, ensuring seamless command and control of this advanced weapon. Crew readiness also played a crucial role, with extensive training required to familiarize personnel with the missile’s operational and maintenance demands. This process reflects the RAN’s growing technological acumen and ability to incorporate cutting-edge systems into its existing platforms. Strategically, the deployment of Tomahawk missiles aligns with Australia’s broader defense posture. It enhances the RAN’s interoperability with allied navies, particularly the United States, which has long fielded Tomahawks as a cornerstone of its maritime strategy. This shared capability strengthens collective security frameworks like AUKUS, bolstering Australia’s position as a key contributor to regional stability. The implications of this capability are profound. The RAN’s ability to conduct precision strikes at long distances reshapes the regional power balance, signaling a shift from purely defensive maritime operations to a more proactive, deterrence-focused approach. This capability, when combined with other emerging assets such as nuclear-powered submarines, ensures that Australia remains equipped to address escalating security challenges in contested waters like the South China Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/historic-moment-australia-joins-elite-group-to-test-tomahawk-cruise-missiles	2024-12-10T08:30:02-08:00

Equipped with an AESA radar and modern electronic warfare systems, the Gripen offers a compelling balance between cost and performance. Peru has a long history of acquiring combat aircraft, influenced by its geopolitical and economic environment. The last major purchase was in the 1980s, when the country became the first export customer of the Mirage 2000, a multirole fighter developed by Dassault Aviation. This acquisition, aimed at modernizing the Peruvian Air Force (FAP) amid regional tensions, cemented Dassault’s reputation as a key supplier to Peru. Since then, the Mirage 2000 has remained the backbone of Peru’s air capabilities, but these aircraft are now approaching the end of their operational lifespan. For reference, Peru acquired 12 Mirage 2000s in the 1980s, divided into 10 Mirage 2000P versions for combat missions and 2 Mirage 2000DP versions for training. These aircraft remain a central element of the Peruvian Air Force, though their growing obsolescence necessitates modernization or replacement. Additionally, Peru is seeking to replace its aging Soviet-origin aircraft with more modern South Korean models. This initiative aims to enhance the operational capabilities of the Peruvian Air Force (FAP) while diversifying its sources of military procurement. Among the options considered is the KF-21 Boramae, a next-generation fighter developed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). This choice is driven by the KF-21’s advanced performance and the technology transfer opportunities offered by South Korea, a partnership that could foster local production and strengthen Peru’s industrial capabilities. Peru is also exploring the KF-1 Halcón, another aircraft developed by KAI. This lightweight fighter was designed to meet the needs of emerging nations, combining competitive performance with reduced acquisition and operational costs. The KF-1 could complement or replace the MiG-29s currently in service, providing a more budget-friendly solution for the FAP. Seman Perú SAC, a local company, is already preparing to produce parts for this model, demonstrating South Korea’s commitment to integrating Peru’s industry into its defense projects. In the long term, the KF-1 could play a key role in Peru’s fleet modernization strategy, coexisting with a frontline fighter like the KF-21 Boramae. Historically, the FAP has operated aircraft such as 21 MiG-29s and 18 Sukhoi Su-25s, acquired in the 1990s. While effective in their time, these aircraft now face increasing challenges in maintenance and parts availability. Replacing them with South Korean jets represents a strategic advance, enabling Peru to reduce dependence on Russian military equipment and strengthen national defense against contemporary threats. Furthermore, Peru-South Korea military cooperation is not new. In 2010, South Korea boosted the FAP’s capabilities by donating eight Cessna A-37B Dragonfly light attack aircraft. These historical ties provide a solid foundation for future agreements, including potential acquisitions of the KF-21 and KF-1 Halcón. These projects are part of a broader strategy to modernize Peru’s defense forces while promoting international technological partnerships and local development. In recent years, Peru has intensified its efforts to modernize its land and naval capabilities, adopting a clear strategy to enhance national defense and diversify international partnerships. In November 2024, the Peruvian Army signed a major agreement with Hyundai Rotem to acquire K2 Black Panther tanks and K808 armored vehicles, replacing decades-old T-55 tanks. While the exact cost of the deal was not disclosed, it includes technology transfer and the possibility of local production, thereby boosting the national defense industry. These new assets will improve the mobility, protection, and firepower of Peru’s ground forces, addressing urgent modernization needs. The Peruvian Navy has also undertaken ambitious initiatives to strengthen its capabilities. In November 2024, an agreement was signed with Hyundai Heavy Industries for the design and construction of a new submarine to modernize its underwater fleet. This strategic project aims to enhance maritime deterrence and power projection, essential for securing the country’s territorial waters and maritime resources. Concurrently, significant investments are being made in naval infrastructure: $2.67 million has been allocated to modernize the SIMA Callao shipyard, while $3.85 million will be invested to enhance the operational capabilities of the Callao Naval Air Base. For 2025, the Peruvian Ministry of Defense’s budget was set at 8,893.1 million soles (approximately $2.371 billion), a 2.8% increase from the previous year. These investments reflect an ambitious modernization strategy aimed at equipping Peru with armed forces prepared to address contemporary security challenges. In 2024, Peru’s gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated at approximately $250 billion, underscoring the significance of these projects as a national priority. Through these initiatives, Peru is progressively strengthening its military capabilities on land and sea while establishing strategic international partnerships. These projects combine technological modernization with local industrial development, highlighting a clear intent to bolster the country’s armed forces in response to current security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/rafale-gripen-or-f-16-whats-the-future-of-perus-combat-air-fleet	2024-12-10T06:53:46-08:00

China Develops a Near-Light-Speed Radar System to Counter Submarine Stealth	Chinese scientists have developed a 'ghost' radar capable of emitting electromagnetic waves at speeds close to the speed of light, enabling submarine detection. This innovation is based on the advanced use of the Doppler effect and high-energy microwave synthesis, as detailed in a study published on November 28, 2024, in the Chinese academic journal Modern Radar. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chinese Academy of Sciences designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky that generates continuously moving extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic capable of penetrating seawater and effectively detecting submarines several hundred meters below the surface. (Picture source: China Military) The team, led by Li Daojing of the National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky. This constantly moving source continuously generates extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves capable of penetrating seawater to detect submarines several hundred meters below the surface. These ELF signals, with wavelengths exceeding 100 meters, allow for effective submarine detection due to their interaction with the aquatic environment. The researchers describe this technology as capable of transforming underwater detection. When ELF signals at 100 Hz interact with a nuclear submarine, its radar cross-section (RCS) can reach up to 88 square meters, enabling identification using standard magnetic detectors. Compact detectors mounted on drones could achieve gradient detection across wide areas, providing extensive and precise coverage. Traditionally, ELF signals required massive antennas, such as the ELF facility in central China, which spans over 100 km. Li Daojing's team has significantly reduced the size of these structures. Their new transmitter, measuring only 100 meters in length, is compact enough to be installed on Chinese naval ships. The high-frequency, high-power microwaves emitted by these antennas converge in the sky to form a virtual radio source. As one source dissipates, another is instantly generated, creating a continuous flow of ELF signals. This technique employs a network structure to simulate high-speed motion using Doppler signals in space. It reduces signal frequency while widening pulse width. The Doppler effect—where wave frequency changes based on relative motion between the source and observer—is a fundamental principle of this development. The perceived frequency increases as the source and observer approach each other and decreases as they move apart. Beyond submarine detection, the technology has potential applications for communication between surface ships and submarines, with an estimated range of 6,000 kilometers. Following successful ground-based trials, the team plans to reduce the transmitter's size to about 30 meters, making it more adaptable for various uses. This development was achieved with contributions from institutions such as the China Electronics Technology Group and Northwestern Polytechnical University, both key players in advanced military technologies for the People’s Liberation Army. The research highlights the integration of scientific innovation with strategic application to enhance underwater detection and communication capabilities. The innovation aligns with China's strategic priorities amid Sino-American rivalries, particularly regarding Taiwan and regional maritime security. While still in development, the technology could bolster China's ability to monitor and control its maritime zones, potentially affecting the strategic balance with the United States and its allies. By improving submarine detection, China aims to safeguard its territorial interests and assert its presence in the South China Sea, a region of heightened tensions surrounding Taiwan. This technological progress could reshape maritime security dynamics and influence submarine operations by external forces, reinforcing China's regional claims.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-develops-a-near-light-speed-radar-system-to-counter-submarine-stealth	2024-12-10T05:30:54-08:00

Taiwan ramps up Wanjian cruise missile production to strengthen the country’s naval and air capabilities	As reported by the Liberty Times on December 7, 2024, Taiwan has completed the mass production of its domestically developed Wanjian air-to-ground cruise missile, providing new capabilities for preemptive strikes on key Chinese military positions. Over 150 units of the Wanjian-1 bomb, with a range of 200 kilometers, have been produced, and the development of an extended-range version, the Wanjian-2 with a range of 400 kilometers, is now being carried out under the Ministry of National Defense's annual budget for further testing and small-batch production.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. (Picture source: Twitter/Taepodong) The development of Taiwan's Wanjian missile, also known as the Wan Chien or the 'Ten Thousand Swords Bomb,' began in the early 2000s as a response to the growing threat posed by China's military advancements. Initiated under the codename 'Project Divine Axe' by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the missile was designed to neutralize strategic targets such as airstrips, radar installations, and troop concentrations on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Drawing inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the Storm Shadow, its development incorporated advanced features like GPS and inertial navigation guidance, as well as a turbofan engine for extended range. The missile first underwent testing in the mid-2000s, achieved combat readiness in 2010, entered service in 2011, and entered mass production in 2015 after system integration with Taiwan’s AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter jets. Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. Live-fire exercises by F-CK-1 units in Tainan and Taichung demonstrated its effectiveness, targeting simulated installations on the southeastern coast of China, including strikes targeting facilities in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces from positions near the midline of the Taiwan Strait. It supports Taiwan’s defensive strategy by enabling precision strikes on key installations beyond the reach of short-range defenses. The Wanjian bomb is integrated with the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, with each aircraft capable of carrying one missile under each wing. The missile is guided by GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain recognition (TERCOM) systems for mid-flight adjustments, along with terminal guidance technologies such as image infrared (IIR) and digital scene matching area correlation (DSMAC). The missile’s design features a square body, foldable wings for compact storage and aerodynamic performance, an X-shaped rudder for directional control, and a turbofan engine that allows subsonic speeds up to Mach 0.8. It carries a 350-kilogram warhead containing submunitions equipped with delayed fuzes. These submunitions are engineered to penetrate surfaces and detonate underground, maximizing damage to hardened targets. The development of the Wanjian-2, also known as the Extended-Range Wanjian Bomb, is now being carried out to realize precision strikes at ranges up to 400 km. Also designed for the F-CK-1 fighter, it features a cluster munition warhead capable of targeting runways, radars, and troop concentrations. The missile utilizes GPS and inertial navigation with advanced terminal guidance for enhanced accuracy. Its design includes foldable wings, an X-tail configuration, and a turbofan engine for subsonic flight. It seems that small-scale production of the Wanjian-2 variant is set to continue under Taiwan's annual defense budget to bolster long-range strike capabilities. This extended-range version will enhance strike capabilities by allowing deeper penetration into adversary-controlled areas. However, it remains in the development phase under the Ministry of National Defense’s regular budget allocations. The Wanjian draws inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the British Storm Shadow. (Picture source: NCSIST) Despite its capabilities, the Wanjian missile's reliance on a non-stealthy design and subsonic speed makes it vulnerable to modern air defense systems, particularly during low-altitude flight paths needed for accurate targeting of runways or other fixed installations. The missile's effectiveness is further constrained by the limited range and survivability of its carrier platform, the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter, which risks interception before launch in contested airspace. Additionally, dependence on civilian GPS navigation rather than military-grade systems reduces its accuracy under electronic countermeasure conditions. These factors could collectively undermine the Wanjian's operational potential in high-threat environments. In addition to its existing applications, the feasibility of adapting the Wanjian bomb for use on helicopters was proposed by Kuomintang legislators in 2019. The proposal emphasized the need to overcome the dependency on operational runways during a conflict, addressing the expected asymmetry in air force readiness caused by immediate damage to airfields. However, a feasibility assessment by the Air Force concluded that adapting the Wanjian bomb for helicopter deployment is both technically challenging and impractical. The assessment cited the size and weight of the missile, the limited payload capacity of helicopters, and the need for U.S. approval for modifications to American-made rotorcraft as significant obstacles. While the suggestion aimed to reduce dependency on runways, the Air Force stated that the Wanjian bomb’s current integration with AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo aircraft remains the optimal approach. In recent years, Taiwan has been enhancing its cruise missile capabilities through the development and deployment of several systems. For instance, the Ching Tien (擎天) supersonic cruise missile, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, has entered mass production and is being deployed by the Air Force, enabling it to reach targets north of Beijing. The Hsiung Sheng, an extended-range variant of the Hsiung Feng IIE land-attack cruise missile, is planned for deployment in 2024, offering a range of up to 1,200 kilometers to target critical sites such as the People's Liberation Army's Eastern and Southern Theater Command bases. With the production of the Wanjian missile system, these missiles are part of Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid regional security concerns. Taiwan is responding to increased military pressure from China by enhancing its defense capabilities through various measures. The United States has approved arms sales to Taiwan, including a $2 billion package featuring the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Taiwan has increased its defense budget by 7.7% for 2025, with allocations for new fighter jets and missile production. Domestically, Taiwan launched its first indigenously built submarine, the Haikun, to strengthen naval deterrence. The US Department of Defense is also working with Taiwan on deploying drone swarms aimed at deterring potential Chinese actions. These measures reflect Taiwan’s efforts to address regional security tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/taiwan-ramps-up-wanjian-cruise-missile-production-to-strengthen-the-countrys-naval-and-air-capabilities	2024-12-10T02:15:20-08:00	
Breaking News: Taiwan Launches Combat Readiness Exercises Following China's Deployment of 90 Warships	China's recent deployment of approximately 90 naval and coast guard vessels near Taiwan represents a large escalation in regional tensions, prompting a robust response from Taiwan. On December 9, 2024, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense announced the launch of combat readiness exercises to counter this unprecedented show of force, the largest in recent months. The deployment spans waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas, surpassing previous military activities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan has raised its alert level following the sighting of over 90 Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the region. However, the defense ministry has not officially classified the movements as drills. (Picture source: Taiwanese Media TV screenshot) The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has also established an emergency response center to monitor the situation closely and address all 'gray zone' incursions—non-traditional military operations designed to exert pressure without open conflict. This escalation coincides with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's recent visit to Guam, a move Beijing views as provocative due to its opposition to official interactions between Taiwan and the United States. China's actions align with its broader strategy to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, potentially through military force. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has undergone rapid modernization and expansion, significantly enhancing its power projection capabilities. Beijing's possible plans for a naval assault include several scenarios. One potential strategy is a large-scale amphibious invasion, requiring substantial lift capacity and coordination to transport troops and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. However, China's current amphibious fleet may fall short of the requirements for a full-scale invasion, potentially necessitating the use of civilian vessels. While increasing transport capacity, these vessels are more vulnerable to Taiwan’s asymmetric defenses, such as missile-armed fast attack boats and stealthy corvettes. Another strategy could involve imposing a maritime blockade to sever Taiwan's critical supply lines, aiming to force political concessions without direct confrontation. Taiwan's heavy reliance on maritime trade makes it particularly susceptible to such a strategy. Additionally, China might continue to employ gray zone tactics, such as deploying maritime militias and conducting frequent incursions into Taiwanese waters and airspace, designed to test Taiwan’s responses and exert sustained pressure without triggering outright conflict. Taiwan's Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is a critical component of its defense strategy, tasked with countering these potential threats. As of 2024, the ROCN comprises approximately 40,000 personnel and a diverse fleet. The navy operates four Kee Lung-class guided-missile destroyers, which are former U.S. Navy vessels serving as the backbone of Taiwan's surface combatants. It also operates 22 frigates, including eight Cheng Kung-class frigates (based on the U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry-class) and six Kang Ding-class frigates, offering versatile capabilities for maritime defense. Two Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvettes have been commissioned, designed for high-speed operations and equipped with advanced anti-ship missiles. The ROCN maintains four submarines, including two Hai Lung-class and two older Hai Shih-class vessels, focused on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Taiwan has launched an ambitious program to construct seven new diesel-electric submarines over the next decade, significantly bolstering its undersea capabilities. Additionally, the navy operates eight amphibious ships, including tank landing ships and a recently commissioned Yushan-class amphibious transport dock, as well as various support vessels for logistics and replenishment. Recent efforts to develop asymmetric warfare capabilities focus on smaller, stealthier vessels equipped with precision-guided weaponry to offset the PLAN's numerical superiority.The Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC), Taiwan's elite amphibious warfare unit, plays a critical role in the defense of the island nation. With a strength of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 personnel, the ROCMC is trained for specialized missions, including amphibious assaults, coastal defense, and the protection of Taiwan's offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. Equipped with a diverse array of weapons and platforms, the Marine Corps fields modern assault rifles, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers for ground operations. For amphibious missions, they rely on vehicles like the AAV-7A1 amphibious assault vehicles, capable of transporting troops from ships to shore under combat conditions. The ROCMC also trains extensively in urban warfare, jungle operations, and joint exercises with other branches of Taiwan's military to ensure interoperability. These forces are prepared to respond swiftly to invasions or incursions, emphasizing the defense of Taiwan's sovereignty and the recovery of occupied territory in a conflict scenario. China's naval forces have seen rapid growth, making the PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy - Chinese Navy) the world's largest navy, with over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface combatants. The PLAN’s modern arsenal includes advanced warships such as the Type 055 destroyers and the aircraft carrier CNS Fujian, reflecting China’s ambition to project power and assert its maritime claims. China’s shipbuilding capacity, which is over 230 times greater than that of the United States, has enabled this rapid expansion. The current developments mark a critical juncture in cross-strait relations, with China's substantial military presence near Taiwan heightening regional tensions. Taiwan's proactive defense measures and calls for international support reflect its determination to safeguard its sovereignty amidst growing external pressures. The evolving naval capabilities of both Taiwan and China will play a pivotal role in shaping the future security dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-taiwan-launches-combat-readiness-exercises-following-chinas-deployment-of-90-warships	2024-12-10T02:03:37-08:00

Kuzmin) The delivery of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets is part of Russia’s broader strategy to leverage its allies to counter international pressures. While the exact number of aircraft to be transferred remains unclear, their inclusion in North Korea’s fleet would significantly bolster Pyongyang’s military capabilities. However, these jets are technically inferior to fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. This agreement comes as North Korea’s air force, historically reliant on Soviet and Chinese support, struggles with decades of stagnation and international sanctions. Its current fleet is largely composed of Soviet-era aircraft from the 1980s, many of which are no longer operational. The MiG-29, developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich, is a twin-engine, fourth-generation fighter designed for air superiority. It is equipped with a Phazotron N019 radar capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' operations. The jet’s armament includes a 30mm cannon and air-to-air missiles such as the medium-range R-27 and short-range R-73. Renowned for its exceptional maneuverability, the MiG-29 features advanced aerodynamics and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, reaching speeds of Mach 2.3 and operating at altitudes up to 17,000 meters. The Su-27, designed by Sukhoi, is a long-range air superiority fighter equipped with a Phazotron N001 Myech radar, also capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' targeting. It is armed with a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 30mm cannon and up to ten hardpoints for air-to-air missiles like the R-73 and R-27. Known for its agility, the Su-27 incorporates advanced fly-by-wire controls and can execute complex maneuvers such as the 'Cobra.' It achieves speeds of Mach 2.35 and operates at altitudes up to 18,500 meters. For North Korea, this agreement addresses a major strategic gap. Its air force currently includes over 400 combat aircraft, but a significant portion belongs to the second generation, such as the Chinese-made J-5 and J-6, copies of the Soviet MiG-17 and MiG-19. Adding MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters from the 1980s would represent a considerable technological upgrade. These jets, equipped with relatively modern radars and weapon systems for their era, would enhance Pyongyang’s defensive capabilities against advanced South Korean forces. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The deal also underscores Pyongyang’s broader interest in advanced military technologies. In addition to fighter jets, North Korea may seek Russian expertise in ballistic missile re-entry vehicles, modern submarines, and air defense systems. This cooperation could help North Korea counter South Korea’s 'three-axis' doctrine, which focuses on neutralizing North Korean threats through preemptive, defensive, and offensive measures. This exchange occurs amid heightened regional tensions between the two Koreas. In June 2024, North Korean soldiers crossed into South Korea before retreating under warning shots from South Korean forces. More recently, in October 2024, North Korea destroyed sections of roads symbolizing reunification efforts and bolstered defensive structures along the border. These incidents highlight escalating tensions, marked by border clashes and military threats. Integrating MiG-29 and Su-27 jets into North Korea’s air force could improve its air defense and air superiority capabilities. However, these aircraft remain outclassed by fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. Additionally, the operational effectiveness of these jets will depend on pilot training and maintenance, areas where North Korea faces significant challenges. While this agreement strengthens North Korea’s air fleet quantitatively, it is unlikely to shift the aerial power balance significantly in the Korean Peninsula. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China. Recently, Iran received Su-35 jets and Mi-28 helicopters, while China has benefited from increased Russian technological support in sensitive areas like submarines and missiles. These partnerships reflect Russia’s growing reliance on allies to sustain its military capabilities under international sanctions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-may-exchange-mig-29-and-su-27-fighter-jets-for-north-korean-troops-deployed-in-ukraine	2024-12-10T01:55:42-08:00	
Russia to receive newest nuclear submarine Arkhangelsk with Kalibr Missiles in summer 2025	According to information published by Russian sources on December 6, 2024, the Russian Navy is preparing to enhance its underwater warfare capabilities with the addition of the Arkhangelsk, a multipurpose nuclear-powered submarine, slated for delivery in the summer of 2025. This submarine, part of the modernized Project 885M Yasen-M class, is being constructed by Sevmash, a division of the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Arkhangelsk, Russia's advanced Yasen-M class nuclear-powered submarine, is set to join the Navy in 2025, equipped with Kalibr and Oniks missiles. (Picture source: Paluba Media) Currently undergoing state trials, the Arkhangelsk represents the latest in naval engineering and technology. The submarine entered sea trials in June 2024. It was launched on November 29, 2023, from Sevmash's shipyard in Severodvinsk for final outfitting and floating completion. In the event of a military conflict between NATO and Russia, the Arkhangelsk submarine, as part of the modernized Yasen-M class, could play a pivotal role in shifting the balance of power in the maritime domain and beyond. Its advanced capabilities make it an asset capable of addressing several strategic and tactical objectives: The Arkhangelsk is equipped with Kalibr-PL cruise missiles, capable of striking NATO targets at long distances, including critical infrastructure, command centers, and military bases. This capability serves as a strong deterrent, as the threat of precision strikes can dissuade adversaries from escalating conflict. Additionally, its ability to launch Oniks supersonic missiles provides a credible countermeasure to NATO surface fleets, including aircraft carrier strike groups. Operating in key maritime regions such as the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, or the Arctic, the Arkhangelsk could enforce sea denial strategies, restricting NATO's freedom of movement. Its stealth capabilities enable it to approach high-value targets undetected, posing a constant threat to NATO naval operations. By deploying near NATO maritime chokepoints, the submarine could effectively challenge or block naval reinforcements. With its advanced sensors, weaponry, and stealth design, the Arkhangelsk would likely be a formidable opponent in undersea warfare. It could hunt NATO submarines, including those tasked with deploying ballistic or cruise missiles, thus undermining NATO’s strategic deterrent capabilities. The submarine’s ability to operate covertly in the Atlantic could allow it to disrupt NATO's vital maritime supply routes between North America and Europe. Striking supply convoys and transport vessels would complicate NATO’s logistical efforts, potentially delaying reinforcements and resupply operations. The Kalibr-PL missiles on board the 'Arkhangelsk' are capable of precision strikes on land-based targets. In a conflict, the submarine could launch coordinated missile barrages against NATO military installations, communication hubs, or missile defense sites, potentially neutralizing critical components of NATO’s operational network. Given its Arctic-capable design, the 'Arkhangelsk' could support operations in the increasingly contested Arctic region. Control over this region is crucial for both Russia and NATO, as it holds strategic sea lanes and natural resources. The submarine could patrol under the Arctic ice, undetected, projecting power and securing Russian claims in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-to-receive-newest-nuclear-submarine-arkhangelsk-with-kalibr-missiles-in-summer-2025	2024-12-10T01:32:35-08:00	
US Army Explores PrSM Inc. 5 Missile for Autonomous Launchers Exceeding 1000 km	The US Army is advancing its technological capabilities in long-range precision strikes with plans to develop a fifth iteration of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), designed to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers. During a December 3, 2024 event hosted by the Association of the US Army, two senior military officials shared insights into this project, which could significantly enhance the Army's strike range capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Major General Winston Brook, commander of the Fires Center of Excellence, presented a slide that identified the PrSM Increment 5 as a prospective future capability. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, explained that preliminary work on this fifth version of the PrSM has commenced, with a formal science and technology development initiative scheduled for fiscal year 2026. According to Brig. Gen. Crooks, the primary goal of Increment 5 is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous platform, departing from traditional systems like the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS. This innovation involves creating a launcher without a cab, allowing for potentially larger and longer-range munitions. 'If you’re familiar with an MLRS pod, it’s about 13 feet long. With an autonomous system, you might be able to use something longer,' Crooks noted, suggesting the possibility of achieving ranges currently deemed unrealistic. Although the program has received initial funding for science and technology research, Crooks clarified that there is no definitive timeline for formal competition or development. This highlights the program's exploratory nature, with its future depending on results from these early stages. For several years, the Army has been developing earlier versions of the PrSM to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and ensure compatibility with current launch systems like HIMARS and the M270A2 MLRS. Currently, Increment 1 missiles, produced by Lockheed Martin, are being fielded and are capable of striking targets at distances of at least 500 kilometers. Subsequent increments include Increment 2, which features a multimode seeker known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and Increment 3, which is designed to incorporate enhanced lethality payloads. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team are working on competing designs for Increment 4, which aims to double the range of earlier versions, surpassing 1,000 kilometers. The development of Increment 5 represents a pivotal step toward integrating autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, the initiative underscores the Army’s commitment to extending the boundaries of precision long-range strikes. If successful, the PrSM Increment 5 could offer substantial strategic advantages in future military scenarios. Though the PrSM Increment 5 remains conceptual, it reflects the Army's clear ambition to modernize its arsenal through innovative technology. The program's trajectory will depend on the progress achieved in the coming years, with potential implications for the future of warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-explores-prsm-inc-5-missile-for-autonomous-launchers-exceeding-1000-km	2024-12-10T01:16:48-08:00

This new order builds on Qatar’s 2017 purchase of 24 Typhoons and complements its diverse fleet, which also includes French Rafales and American F-15QAs. The integration of the Typhoons into the joint No. 12 Squadron, operated by the Qatari Air Force and the British Royal Air Force, underscores their strategic role in strengthening bilateral military collaborations. Qatar has significantly enhanced its military air fleet over the past decade by adopting a strategy of supply diversification to ensure its security and operational independence. In 2017, Doha signed a €5.6 billion contract for the acquisition of 24 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters from the Eurofighter consortium (BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo), reinforced by an additional order for 12 units announced in December 2024, valued at an estimated £2.8 billion. These aircraft are integrated into the joint No. 12 Squadron with the British Royal Air Force, symbolizing strengthened military cooperation between Qatar and the United Kingdom. In December 2024, during the state visit of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to the United Kingdom, the two nations strengthened their defense partnership by signing agreements to extend their collaboration on joint squadrons of Typhoon and Hawk aircraft. On this occasion, two Typhoon fighters from the joint No. 12 Squadron escorted the Emir’s aircraft as it entered British airspace, illustrating their operational synergy. This visit highlights the deepening military ties between the United Kingdom and Qatar, based on their historical relationship and shared commitment to regional security. The Typhoon offers Qatar’s armed forces a modern and versatile combat platform capable of meeting diverse operational needs. With its advanced avionics, high-speed performance (Mach 2), and exceptional maneuverability, it is perfectly suited for air-to-air combat and ground attack missions. Equipped with the AESA Captor-E radar and a wide array of precision-guided munitions, including Meteor and Brimstone missiles, the Typhoon enhances Qatar’s air superiority and strike capabilities. Additionally, its integration into the joint No. 12 Squadron between the United Kingdom and Qatar provides valuable training, NATO-standard interoperability, and a strategic partnership with a key ally, further strengthening Qatar’s defensive posture and regional influence. In parallel, Qatar has also invested in French Rafale fighters, signing an initial contract for 24 aircraft in 2015, followed by an additional order for 12 units in 2017, bringing the total cost to approximately €6.3 billion. These Rafales are expected to be upgraded to the F4 standard, adding enhanced capabilities such as advanced connectivity systems and next-generation armaments. Finally, Qatar purchased 36 American F-15QA fighters under a $12 billion contract signed in 2017. These acquisitions reflect a pragmatic strategy, balancing strategic alliances and military enhancement, with a fleet combining the strengths of major aviation powers. While the announcement surprised France, where negotiations for additional Rafales and other military equipment were ongoing, it illustrates Qatar’s delicate balance between maintaining operational readiness and developing strong relationships with major defense suppliers. This agreement is particularly significant as the Typhoon had not received recent export orders before Qatar’s renewed interest, positioning the United Kingdom as a key strategic partner for Doha in a competitive regional landscape. This development also reflects changes in Qatar’s defense procurement strategy, including its exploration of joint infantry mechanisms with the United Kingdom, potentially centered on ARTEC’s Boxer armored vehicle. By diversifying its defense assets and partnerships, this Typhoon agreement highlights Qatar’s commitment to a robust and versatile military posture aligned with NATO standards and adapted to an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Qatar’s decision not to opt for additional Rafales, despite the aircraft’s excellent performance, can be attributed to several strategic and political reasons. Firstly, Qatar already has 36 Rafales in its fleet, which may limit the immediate appeal of a new order, especially with existing aircraft undergoing upgrades to the F4 standard. In contrast, the Typhoon provides an opportunity to further diversify operational capabilities and strategic partnerships, strengthening the already solid military cooperation with the United Kingdom, particularly through the joint No. 12 Squadron. Additionally, the purchase of new Typhoons can be seen as a political decision aimed at balancing relationships with multiple major defense suppliers, avoiding over-reliance on France, which has already supplied Rafales and various military equipment. Furthermore, support for the British industry, facing challenges with the Typhoon in the international market, may have influenced the decision. This strategic choice also allows Qatar to leverage the specific advantages of the Typhoon, such as its enhanced air superiority through the Captor-E radar and Meteor missile, complementing the capabilities already offered by the Rafale. In summary, this decision seems driven more by diplomatic and strategic considerations than by any technical shortcomings of the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon operated by Qatar is a high-tech multirole fighter equipped with the most advanced technologies. It features the AESA Captor-E radar for superior target detection and tracking, along with the advanced Defensive Aids Subsystem (DASS) for enhanced survivability and modern avionics that ensure high operational versatility. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines, the Typhoon reaches a maximum speed of Mach 2 and has a combat range of over 1,500 km. Its armament systems include a wide range of air-to-air missiles, such as the Meteor, precision-guided munitions, and the Brimstone missile for ground-attack missions, making it a formidable force in modern aerial combat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/qatar-increases-air-combat-power-with-additional-order-of-twelve-new-typhoon-fighters	2024-12-09T07:28:26-08:00	
Breaking News: Dutch F-35 Fighter Jets Conduct First Interceptions of Russian Spy Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	Dutch Air Force F-35 fighter jets stationed in Estonia have successfully conducted their first operational interceptions over the Baltic Sea, showcasing the Netherlands’ commitment to NATO’s collective defense. On Friday, December 6, two Dutch F-35s were scrambled twice under the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) protocol to intercept and monitor Russian aircraft operating near NATO airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During an interception mission, a Dutch Air Force F-35A Lightning II escorts a Russian SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea, demonstrating NATO's vigilance in safeguarding its airspace. (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) During the first interception, the Dutch F-35 fighter jets identified a Russian Antonov AN-73/74 'Coaler' transport aircraft and a Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance jet. The SU-24MR specializes in electronic intelligence gathering, highlighting the persistent surveillance activities conducted by Russian forces near NATO territory. Later in the day, the QRA was activated again, with the F-35s intercepting an Ilyushin IL-20 'Coot A,' an advanced surveillance aircraft equipped for electronic monitoring. The Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' is a specialized variant of the SU-24, a supersonic, all-weather tactical bomber developed by the Soviet Union. The SU-24MR is configured specifically for reconnaissance missions, equipped with advanced sensors and electronic intelligence-gathering systems. Although the Russian planes remained in international airspace, the Dutch F-35s closely monitored and escorted them to the edge of NATO’s area of responsibility. These interceptions demonstrate NATO’s operational readiness and ability to secure its airspace amid increased tensions in the Baltic region. The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Estonia is part of NATO’s Air Policing mission, which aims to protect the airspace of its eastern members. Since December 1, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) has operated four F-35A Lightning II fighters from Ämari Air Base. This deployment underscores the Netherlands’ dedication to NATO and the security of its allies in Eastern Europe. The F-35 program has been a cornerstone of the Netherlands’ air defense modernization strategy. The acquisition process began in the early 2000s when the Netherlands joined the Joint Strike Fighter program as a Level 2 partner, contributing significantly to the aircraft’s development. The first operational F-35A arrived in the Netherlands in October 2019 at Leeuwarden Air Base. By December 2021, the RNLAF declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its fleet, signaling readiness for limited combat operations. Initially, the Netherlands planned to acquire 85 F-35As to replace its aging F-16 fleet, but budget constraints later reduced the order. As of 2022, the Ministry of Defence expanded its plans, increasing the total to 52 aircraft. The first operational deployment of Dutch F-35s occurred in April 2022 when four jets were stationed in Bulgaria to support NATO’s enhanced Air Policing mission. The F-35A’s advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and electronic warfare capabilities have made it an essential component of NATO operations. Its introduction has significantly enhanced the RNLAF’s ability to detect, monitor, and respond to threats, particularly in high-tension areas like the Baltic. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans praised the rapid response of Dutch forces during the recent interceptions. 'This is why our people are there: to protect our collective airspace against Russian threats. As was once again evident on Friday, Russian forces are active in various ways near NATO airspace. Our allies in the Baltic states are pleased with our efforts. I am proud of our people who were able to immediately demonstrate their value to our security,' he said. The Baltic region remains a hotspot for military activity, with frequent incursions by Russian aircraft testing NATO’s readiness. These incidents underscore the importance of the QRA protocol, which allows NATO fighter jets to scramble within minutes to intercept and identify potential threats. The successful interception mission by Dutch F-35s highlights NATO’s resolve to protect its members and affirms the Netherlands’ role as a critical player in the alliance’s defense strategy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-dutch-f-35-fighter-jets-conduct-first-interceptions-of-russian-spy-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2024-12-09T06:59:02-08:00	
Peru Modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean 4x4 K808 IFVs and K2 Tanks to Replace Soviet-Era Vehicles	On December 9, 2024, in Lima, the Peruvian Army unveiled the K808 'White Tiger' armored personnel carrier during the celebrations of the Battle of Ayacucho and Army Day. In May 2024, Hyundai Rotem and STX were selected to supply 30 K808 'Baekho' wheeled armored vehicles to Peru under a contract valued at $60 million. This order marks the first export of South Korean armored vehicles to Latin America. Initially planned for 30 units, the contract could expand to a total of 120 vehicles depending on the future needs of the Peruvian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Peruvian Army modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean K808 'White Tiger' IFVs. (Picture source: Peru MoD) On November 16, 2024, also in Lima, Hyundai Rotem signed a second memorandum of understanding with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian Army’s weapons and ammunition factory, for the supply of K2 'Black Panther' main battle tanks. Although financial details and the exact number of tanks have not been officially disclosed, sources suggest that Peru plans to acquire approximately 100 K2 tanks to replace its aging fleet of T-55 tanks. This initiative is part of a broader modernization program for the Peruvian Armed Forces, aimed at strengthening their operational capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment. On December 9, 2024, three K808 'White Tiger' vehicles paraded, proudly displaying the Peruvian and South Korean flags, symbolizing South Korea's growing importance to the Peruvian Armed Forces and Peru’s commitment to modernizing its aging fleet. The fleet, still largely composed of Soviet-era vehicles such as the T-55 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), demonstrates the need for modernization. The BMP-1, developed in the 1960s, is equipped with a 73mm cannon and anti-tank missile launcher but is outdated in terms of armor and weaponry by current standards. This reliance on aging equipment underscores the necessity for Peru to upgrade its armored fleet to meet the demands of modern battlefields and provide better protection and operational effectiveness for its troops. Peru has shown an increasing willingness to diversify and modernize its armed forces by turning to Western partners. This trend was reinforced in September 2024 when the government included funding for 24 new fighter jets in the 2025 budget. Among the options considered, the French Rafale emerged as a favorite, outpacing competitors like the American F-16 and Swedish Gripen. In November 2024, this shift continued with the Peruvian Congress authorizing the entry of 600 U.S. military personnel to assist with security preparations for the 2024 APEC meetings, further strengthening military ties with the United States. This shift represents a notable departure from Peru’s historical reliance on Russian military equipment. In the 2010s, the country had considered acquiring T-90 tanks to replace its aging T-55s. However, in 2023, significant challenges in obtaining spare parts for its MiG-29 fleet highlighted the limitations of cooperation with Russia. While relations with Moscow persist, decisions made between 2023 and 2024 demonstrate Peru’s growing commitment to strengthening partnerships with Western nations to meet the demands of modernizing its armed forces and aligning with contemporary military standards. Discussions about the South Korean agreements began several years ago, supported by consistent diplomatic efforts. In 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sent a letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, celebrating 60 years of bilateral relations and emphasizing the potential for increased defense cooperation. Between 2023 and 2024, Peruvian military delegations visited South Korea to witness demonstrations of the K808’s capabilities in scenarios simulating mountainous operations and counterterrorism missions. The K808, also known as 'Baekho' (White Tiger), was designed in 2003 and has proven its reliability in the South Korean Army, with over 500 units delivered. Capable of overcoming 40cm obstacles, crossing 1.5-meter trenches, and navigating waterways with its jet propulsion system, it is well-suited to Peru's challenging geography. Its central tire inflation system (CTIS) and advanced mobility make it a strategic asset for the Peruvian Armed Forces. This contract is part of a broader modernization program for Peru's armored fleet, which is still heavily reliant on outdated main battle tanks such as the T-55 and AMX-13 from the 1950s. With this initial order, the long-term outlook is promising. STX and Hyundai Rotem are already in discussions for additional orders and expanded technical collaboration with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian state arms manufacturer. This partnership, which could span several years, enhances South Korea’s strategic presence in the Latin American defense market. A Hyundai Rotem representative reaffirmed the company’s commitment to leveraging its technological expertise to ensure the success of this collaboration and support Peru’s defense objectives in the years ahead. The partnership between Hyundai Rotem and FAME S.A.C. aims to establish a lasting collaboration, paving the way for future contracts and supporting Peru’s defense modernization efforts. This agreement also solidifies South Korea’s position as a competitive player in the Latin American defense market, aligning with its global strategy for growth in the defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-modernizes-armored-fleet-with-south-korean-4x4-k808-ifvs-and-k2-tanks-to-replace-soviet-era-vehicles	2024-12-09T06:51:39-08:00	
Royal Malaysian Navy starts Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 construction in Türkiye	On December 4, 2024, the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) officially commenced the construction of its Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) at Istanbul Shipyard in Türkiye. Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. This corvette is already operational in the navies of Türkiye and Pakistan, with additional ships currently under construction for the Ukrainian Navy. The Ada-class design supports multi-role operations, including anti-surface warfare (ASuW), anti-air warfare (AAW), asymmetric warfare (ASYW), and electronic warfare (EW).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. (Picture source: STM) Other options, including South Korea's HDC-2000 design by Hyundai Heavy Industries and Italy's FCX15 design by Fincantieri, were considered for the LMSB2 program. However, the Turkish Ada-class corvette design was ultimately selected for its operational performance, compatibility with Malaysia’s requirements, and its ability to integrate future naval subsystems from over 50 Turkish defense companies. STM, the project's main contractor, is responsible for all phases, including design, project management, material procurement, assembly, testing, and integrated logistics support (ILS). This marks Malaysia's first defense acquisition through a government-to-government memorandum of understanding (G2G) with another country. STM’s previous experience with Ada-class corvettes for Türkiye, Pakistan, and Ukraine likely influenced this decision. The Ada-class corvette was originally developed under Türkiye’s MILGEM program to meet requirements for anti-submarine warfare, patrol, and maritime surveillance. It features stealth technology, a low radar cross-section, and distributed sensors and weapons systems. The LMSB2 configuration integrates these capabilities while incorporating modifications to meet RMN’s operational needs. The LMSB2 project is a significant component of RMN’s efforts to enhance maritime capabilities, providing flexible operational capacity and effective security for Malaysia’s extensive maritime domain. The ships will feature a lot of systems from Turkish defense companies. Aselsan will supply the 3D surveillance radar, fire control radar, electronic support measures (ESM), and chaff decoy systems. Havelsan will provide the combat management and gun fire control systems. Surface-to-surface missiles (SSMs) will include Roketsan’s Atmaca, while the ships will also be equipped with two quad-packed vertical launch systems (VLS) for 16 Haegung surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) from South Korea’s Lig NEX1. Armament will include a 76mm main gun, a 30mm secondary gun, and decoy launcher systems. Other equipment includes navigation systems, electronic plotting tables, and communication systems. Each Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) vessel will measure 99.56 meters in length, have a displacement of approximately 2,500 tons, and accommodate 111 personnel. They will use a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion system with four diesel engines, providing a top speed of 26 knots, a cruising speed of 14 knots, and an operational range exceeding 4,000 nautical miles. The vessels will have an endurance of 14 days and feature a helipad and hangar for a 10-ton helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicles. Construction and outfitting are expected to conclude by the end of 2027, with delivery to RMN anticipated shortly thereafter. This project aligns with Malaysia’s naval modernization program, guided by the '15 to 5' Transformation Programme, which aims to consolidate RMN’s fleet from 15 classes to five core classes for improved operational and cost efficiency. Key acquisitions include Maharaja Lela-class frigates, Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels, Littoral Mission Ships (LMS), Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), and Scorpène-class submarines. The Maharaja Lela-class program advanced with the launch of KD Maharaja Lela in June 2024. RMN recently updated its transformation plan to address current maritime security challenges and regional threats. Malaysia's extensive maritime zones, including the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, and the Sulu Sea, are critical to its national security and economic prosperity. These waters, rich in natural resources, also serve as vital trade routes but face challenges such as territorial disputes, illegal fishing, smuggling, and piracy. RMN has identified a growing mismatch between its naval capabilities and the demands of effectively securing these areas. Many RMN vessels date back to the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in increased maintenance issues and reduced readiness. To address this, RMN plans to acquire 18 LMS to bolster patrol and surveillance across its maritime zones. These ships will support diverse missions, including anti-surface warfare, mine warfare, hydrography, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. In the South China Sea, Malaysia asserts its rights over its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and conducts oil and gas exploration through Petronas, despite objections from China. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has confirmed that these operations will continue alongside diplomatic discussions with China. RMN monitors the region and reports the situation as secure, according to Admiral Datuk Zulhelmy Ithnain. In the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia collaborates with regional partners through initiatives like the Malacca Straits Patrol to counter piracy and smuggling. In the Sulu Sea, Malaysia conducts joint patrols with Indonesia and the Philippines to combat transnational crimes such as piracy and kidnapping. These efforts combine diplomacy, security measures, and regional cooperation to manage Malaysia’s maritime zones effectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-malaysian-navy-starts-littoral-mission-ship-batch-2-construction-in-tuerkiye	2024-12-09T05:44:59-08:00

The delivery of equipment and support systems will continue until 2028, the year planned for the complete program completion and operational integration of the NGJ-MB within the U.S. and Australian naval forces. Additionally, other companies are developing electronic warfare systems similar to Raytheon's NGJ-MB. In 2020, Lockheed Martin launched the Advanced Electronic Warfare System (AEWS), designed to effectively interfere with enemy radars and communications, and integrated on F-35 Lightning II fighter jets. In 2021, Northrop Grumman introduced the Multi-Role Jammer (MRJ), offering advanced jamming capabilities tailored to various aerial platforms such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F-15 Eagle. Moreover, in 2022, Thales developed the JASS (Jamming and Signal Suppression), intended for European forces and integrated on aircraft like the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale, to enhance their electronic defenses. These systems, like the NGJ-MB, aim to improve the electronic superiority of armed forces by disrupting enemy detection and communication systems, thereby contributing to the protection and effectiveness of modern military operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/next-gen-raytheon-ngj-mb-system-empowers-us-ea-18-growlers-fighter-jet-with-superior-radar-jamming	2024-12-09T03:02:12-08:00	
South Korea deploys Skylight laser weapon to protect Seoul capital from North Korean drones	As reported by Mason on December 8, 2024, South Korea has initiated the deployment of the Laser-Based Anti-Aircraft Weapon Block-I, a stationary 20kW-class fiber laser system capable of neutralizing drones within a range of 2–3 kilometers, to frontline units and selected urban locations, including Seoul. Globally, laser systems like the British Dragonfire and Israeli Iron Beam remain under development, but South Korea is the first to announce large-scale production and deployment of such a system to complement its existing air defense layers against North Korean drones. However, deployment to the broader metropolitan area may face delays.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Laser-Based Anti-Aircraft Weapon Block-I, also known as Skylight or Cheongwang, is a stationary 20kW-class fiber laser weapon designed to neutralize small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at an estimated firing cost of $1.45 per shot. (Picture source: DAPA) Developed since 2019 by Hanwha Aerospace in collaboration with the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), the Laser-Based Anti-Aircraft Weapon Block-I, also known as Skylight or Cheongwang (天光), is a stationary 20kW-class fiber laser weapon designed to neutralize small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and multicopters within a range of 2–3 kilometers at an estimated firing cost of KRW 2,000 ($1.45) per shot. Production began in July 2024 under a KRW 100 billion ($72.5 million) contract signed in June, supervised by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). During live-fire tests in April 2023, the system achieved a 100% success rate against its intended targets. While effective against short-range threats such as drones and multicopters, Skylight is not designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) or high-output swarm drone attacks. Future iterations of the Skylight system aim to expand its capabilities. The Block-II variant will be mobile, based on the K239 Multiple Rocket Launcher System chassis, offering increased range and power. The Block-III is envisioned to intercept larger threats, such as ballistic missiles and aircraft, through naval and aerial configurations with outputs exceeding 100kW. These upgrades are expected to strengthen South Korea’s layered air defense system. In addition to Skylight, South Korea is deploying the Intelligent 40mm Automated Air Defense System. Also developed under DAPA’s rapid development program, this system features dual-barreled 40mm cannons that may use munitions compatible with the K21 Infantry Fighting Vehicle.

(Picture source: Russian social network) According to Sergey Lagodyuk, the Deputy Chief of the Belarusian General Staff, the Oreshnik system's deployment is a response to NATO's increasing military presence in Eastern Europe, particularly the planned stationing of U.S. and German missiles. Moscow and Minsk perceive these actions as an escalation of Western military encroachment, prompting them to bolster their defense posture. The Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile system is a relatively new and advanced addition to Russia's strategic missile arsenal. While full technical specifications are not fully disclosed, the system is expected to possess several key capabilities that make it a significant threat. First, it is an intermediate-range missile capable of striking targets between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, covering much of Europe and NATO's infrastructure. This range allows it to potentially target military installations, airfields, supply chains, and key government facilities across Europe, including NATO bases in the region. The missile system is designed for precision strikes, with capabilities akin to other advanced Russian missiles, such as the Iskander and Kalibr systems, but with a much longer reach. This increased accuracy makes the Oreshnik effective against high-value targets such as command centers, radar sites, and air defense installations. Additionally, the system is expected to be deployed on mobile launch platforms, which makes it more difficult to track and counteract by enemy forces. The mobility of the system allows it to be relocated quickly, reducing the likelihood of a successful preemptive strike by adversaries. The Oreshnik is also expected to have dual-warhead capabilities, meaning it can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. This flexibility adds a strategic dimension to its deployment, offering Russia and Belarus a powerful tool for both tactical and strategic deterrence. It could be employed for conventional warfare scenarios or, in the event of heightened tensions, as a nuclear deterrent, thereby increasing its significance in Russia's military strategy. Moreover, it is believed that the Oreshnik missile system will be integrated with Russia's existing defense network, which includes advanced air defense missile systems like the S-400 and S-500, enhancing the system’s coordination and effectiveness within the broader Russian military framework. The deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus presents a significant escalation in the ongoing security challenges facing both Ukraine and Europe. For Ukraine, the proximity of Belarus means the Oreshnik system would be capable of targeting critical military positions, supply lines, and infrastructure deep within Ukrainian territory. This is especially concerning given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where Russia and Belarus are already highly involved. The deployment of such a system further solidifies the strategic alliance between Moscow and Minsk, increasing the threat to Ukraine’s defense capabilities. The system's presence also raises the specter of further Russian provocations, as it provides a powerful tool for deep-strike capabilities against Ukraine. The Oreshnik missile represents a new threat for Europe, with its intermediate range capable of striking key NATO military sites across the continent. The decision to deploy this missile system will likely be seen as a direct challenge to NATO, particularly as the United States and Germany move forward with their own plans to deploy intermediate-range missiles in the region. This growing missile presence on both sides could lead to heightened tensions and a renewed arms race in Europe. NATO’s immediate response may involve bolstering its missile defense systems and enhancing its military deterrence measures to counter the Russian threat. Another critical concern raised by the Oreshnik missile’s deployment is its nuclear capability. As the system can be equipped with both conventional and nuclear warheads, it could increase the likelihood of nuclear escalation in the event of conflict. This threat is particularly pertinent given the proximity of Belarus to NATO member states, which would place European countries and the U.S. within potential striking distance of the missile. Belarus, as a staunch ally of Russia, may become a key forward base for Russia’s nuclear deterrence strategy, further raising concerns over the stability of European security. The presence of such a weapon in Belarus could also lead to calls for NATO to adjust its nuclear posture, potentially leading to a new arms race between Russia and the West. The deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus is a strategic maneuver that will significantly impact the military dynamics in Europe and the broader geopolitical landscape. The growing missile capabilities of Russia and Belarus pose an increasing threat not just to Ukraine, but to the entire European security architecture. In response, NATO and its allies may be forced to take stronger measures to counter these new capabilities, further complicating an already tense security environment. As the Oreshnik missile system is slated to be deployed in 2025, this development will likely become a central issue in European defense policy, driving both military preparedness and diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-new-threat-to-europe-and-ukraine-with-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-deployment-in-belarus-by-2025	2024-12-08T02:50:50-08:00

Focus: US-made F-35 Stealth Fighter Demonstrates Unmatched Combat Capabilities in Israeli Strike Against Iran	Citing a report from the Simple Flying website, British Admiral Tony Radakin spoke at a Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) lecture in London about how Israel showcased the impressive performance and capabilities of the American-made stealth F-35 fighter jet during the recent airstrikes on Iran. This operation, which targeted over 20 key Iranian military sites, underscored the extraordinary combat capabilities of Israel's fleet of F-35I aircraft, confirming the jet’s role as an unparalleled asset in modern air combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Israeli Air Force F-35 stealth fighter jet demonstrates advanced capabilities in the recent strike on Iranian targets. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The raid, which took down missile-manufacturing facilities and critical air-defense systems, highlighted the F-35’s stealth, precision, and long-range strike abilities—key factors that allowed Israel to execute a high-stakes operation with minimal exposure to risk. Israel has now received around 40 of the 75 F-35I aircraft it ordered, and these advanced jets have proven pivotal in enhancing Israel's air superiority. The F-35I, an Israeli-specific variant of the F-35 Lightning II, has been customized with Israeli avionics, software, and systems, enabling the Israeli Air Force to carry out missions with exceptional precision and efficiency. With its combination of stealth technology, cutting-edge sensors, and advanced munitions, the F-35 has set a new standard for military airstrikes, as demonstrated in the operation that Radakin described. Israel’s F-35Is were central to the success of this high-stakes operation, showcasing the fighter’s advanced stealth features, which allowed Israeli jets to penetrate Iranian airspace without being detected by the country’s sophisticated air-defense systems. The F-35's low-observable design—featuring radar-absorbing coatings, advanced shaping, and internal weapons bays—made it virtually invisible to radar, even to Iran's advanced air-defense missile systems, such as the Russian-made S-300s. This allowed Israel to strike key targets deep inside Iranian territory without exposing their aircraft to the kind of risks that conventional fighter jets would face in a similarly contested environment. The F-35’s radar and sensor systems, particularly the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, also played a critical role in the operation. These sensors allowed Israeli pilots to detect and track targets from long distances, far beyond the range of many conventional radar systems. Combined with the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), which offers a 360-degree view of the battlefield, Israeli pilots could identify targets with remarkable accuracy and engage them from a safe distance. The precision of the airstrike was made possible by the F-35’s ability to carry out precision-guided strikes on a variety of targets. With its advanced weapon systems, such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and StormBreaker bombs, the F-35 can accurately strike even highly protected or deeply buried targets. These munitions are guided by GPS, infrared, and laser systems, ensuring they hit their targets with near-perfect accuracy. In this raid, Israel used fewer than 100 munitions to take out more than 20 military sites, emphasizing the high efficiency of the operation. This operational precision stood in stark contrast to other air campaigns, such as Russia’s strikes in Ukraine, where inefficiency and missed targets have been commonplace. The F-35’s stealth and precision capabilities were crucial in executing a mission where each strike needed to count. No aircraft got within 100 miles of the target in the first wave, yet nearly the entirety of Iran's air-defense system was dismantled. This highlights the F-35’s stand-off strike capability, where weapons can be deployed from a safe distance without compromising the safety of the aircraft or pilots. Beyond its combat and strike capabilities, the F-35’s advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems were pivotal in degrading Iran’s air-defense networks. These EW systems allow the F-35 to disrupt enemy radar, communication, and targeting systems, effectively blinding or misleading adversary defenses. As Admiral Radakin noted, the strike took down 'nearly the entirety of Iran’s air-defense system,' likely facilitated by the F-35’s ability to disrupt and neutralize these defenses before they could respond effectively. Iran’s acquisition of S-300 systems from Russia posed a significant threat to any aircraft attempting to strike Iranian targets. However, Israel’s F-35s used their superior electronic warfare capabilities to target and degrade these systems, making it possible to carry out the mission with minimal risk to the aircraft. The success of this operation also speaks to the multi-role versatility of the F-35. While primarily an air-to-air and air-to-ground combat aircraft, the F-35 also serves as a platform for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). During the strike on Iran, Israeli F-35s likely performed a variety of roles, from gathering intelligence to ensuring that each target was hit with precision and efficiency. The aircraft's ability to switch between strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare roles is a key reason for its operational effectiveness in high-stakes missions like this. The F-35’s ability to carry out surgical strikes on critical infrastructure while maintaining air superiority and disrupting enemy defenses makes it the ideal platform for modern military operations, especially in hostile environments where the enemy possesses advanced air-defense capabilities. The recent Israeli operation against Iranian targets has once again demonstrated the unparalleled combat capabilities of the F-35. With its combination of stealth, precision strike systems, advanced munitions, and superior electronic warfare capabilities, the F-35 has redefined the standards for modern air combat. Israel’s use of this advanced fighter jet highlights its significant technological edge and ability to project power with minimal risk and maximum precision. As Israel continues to expand its fleet of F-35Is, the aircraft will undoubtedly play a central role in future operations, setting a new benchmark in modern military aviation. The F-35’s performance in this operation serves as a clear demonstration of how advanced technologies—stealth, precision, and electronic warfare—are transforming military air operations and ensuring that air forces can meet the complex challenges of the modern battlefield with unprecedented effectiveness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-demonstrates-unmatched-combat-capabilities-in-israeli-strike-against-iran	2024-12-06T08:51:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukraine Intel Reveals Russia Can Produce 25 Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles Annually	On December 4, 2024, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine provided an important update regarding Russia's missile production capabilities, particularly focusing on the RS-26 Rubezh, the country’s intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia can now produce up to 25 units of RS-26 Rubezh each year, including its new Oreshnik variant. This new development highlights the growing production capacity of Russia's missile forces and their focus on strengthening their medium-range missile arsenals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Test fire at Kapustin Yar: Russia's RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik variants undergo critical testing at the Astrakhan region missile launch site, enhancing Russia's strategic missile capabilities. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The RS-26 Rubezh, at the heart of Russia's modern missile capabilities, represents a strategic shift in Moscow's approach to missile warfare. Its production plays a significant role in Russia’s efforts to counter NATO's missile defense systems. The Oreshnik, a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh, has been shrouded in controversy, particularly following its use in an attack on Ukraine's Dnipro River on November 21, 2024. The RS-26 Rubezh is a crucial missile for Russia’s defense strategy. Classified as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the RS-26 is designed to carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and has a range of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 km (2,175 to 2,485 miles). This puts it within the category of medium to long-range missile systems capable of striking targets across Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Russia has invested heavily in producing the RS-26 Rubezh and its variants. The missile is manufactured at high output and can produce up to 25 units per year, a significant increase from earlier periods. This production surge follows the technical experience gained from Russia's previous RS-24 Yars ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile) program, which has informed the development of the RS-26’s advanced features, including hypersonic speed and maneuverability designed to defeat modern missile defense systems. The controversy surrounding Russia’s missile capabilities deepened after an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on November 21, 2024. During the attack, Russian forces used what they claimed to be a 'new medium-range system' that President Vladimir Putin referred to as the Oreshnik. At the time, Ukrainian officials initially identified the missile used in the strike as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), but Putin contradicted this, announcing that the missile was a new addition to Russia’s missile arsenal, designed specifically for medium-range strikes. In contrast, American officials labeled the missile as 'experimental,' suggesting that while it may have been deployed operationally, the Oreshnik was still in an advanced testing phase. According to U.S. officials, the missile appears to be a non-nuclear, hypersonic ballistic missile, a designation that aligns with previous reports of its high-speed and maneuvering capabilities. These features make the missile extremely difficult to intercept, as it travels at speeds greater than Mach 5 (over six times the speed of sound) and can follow unpredictable flight paths to bypass missile defense systems. Despite these claims of a new missile type, the Oreshnik is widely regarded as a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh—with enhancements aimed at improving its hypersonic capabilities and range. The missile's inclusion in Russia’s operational arsenal is seen as part of a broader strategy to bolster its missile forces, specifically in response to NATO’s missile defense systems in Europe. Both the RS-26 Rubezh and its Oreshnik variant undergo testing at Russia’s key missile testing sites. These include Kapustin Yar, located in the Astrakhan region, which has long been a central hub for developing and testing Russia’s missile systems, including the RS-26 and its variants. Additionally, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk region plays a critical role in missile testing. Though better known for space launches, Plesetsk is integral to Russia’s missile development and operational readiness. The international community has responded with heightened concern over the deployment of the Oreshnik missile. The United States, in particular, has expressed its reservations, labeling the missile 'experimental' and underscoring the potential escalation of tensions. The missile’s hypersonic nature and non-nuclear profile make it a versatile tool for Russia’s military, capable of striking with precision while circumventing most conventional missile defense systems, including THAAD and Aegis. The attack on Dnipro has further fueled worries that Russia may be advancing its missile technology with a focus on bypassing traditional defense mechanisms. With its ability to target high-value military and infrastructure assets over a long distance, the RS-26 Oreshnik represents a serious threat in a region already facing significant instability. For NATO and the West, the growing production of intermediate-range ballistic missiles like the RS-26 Rubezh, and the operational readiness of the Oreshnik, highlight the urgent need to adapt and modernize missile defense capabilities to respond to Russia's evolving missile threats. Russia’s ability to ramp up production of the RS-26 Rubezh, including its Oreshnik variant, signals a major shift in the strategic landscape. With up to 25 units of the RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik expected to roll out annually, Russia is significantly enhancing its missile arsenal, increasing its ability to project power over long distances. As the Oreshnik variant enters the operational phase, the growing concern about its hypersonic and maneuverability features will continue to shape global security dynamics. The missile’s potential to bypass missile defense systems, along with its strategic and tactical flexibility, makes it a formidable asset in Russia’s military planning. For the West, this development calls for reevaluating defense strategies and missile deterrence capabilities as Russia’s missile forces continue to evolve rapidly. The geopolitical implications of this missile advancement will likely influence future arms control talks and shape the future trajectory of global missile defense systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-ukraine-intel-reveals-russia-can-produce-25-medium-range-ballistic-missiles-annually	2024-12-06T08:12:52-08:00

The deal includes 184 missiles, four of which are designated as fly-to-buy for testing, and 30 Lightweight Command Launch Units (LWCLUs). This acquisition is set to complement Tunisia’s existing anti-tank capabilities, which currently rely on systems such as the Milan and TOW missile platforms and vehicle-mounted launchers like the M901 ITV TOW. The introduction of the Javelin system is expected to significantly enhance Tunisia's ability to counter armored threats and bolster its overall infantry effectiveness.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Javelin anti-tank missile system is a modern addition to Tunisia’s arsenal, offering capabilities that significantly surpass its current inventory. (Picture source: US DoD) Tunisia’s current anti-tank arsenal includes man-portable missile systems and older platforms, such as the Milan, that have been in service for decades. These systems are supplemented by vehicle-mounted TOW launchers, which provide additional firepower against both armored vehicles and fortifications. While effective, these systems are aging and have limited operational flexibility compared to newer technologies like the Javelin. The Javelin's fire-and-forget capabilities and extended range provide a modernized edge, aligning with Tunisia’s broader efforts to modernize its defense forces. Tunisia is navigating a multifaceted geopolitical landscape, with internal political challenges and regional instability shaping its defense priorities. The consolidation of power by President Kais Saied in 2021 led to strained relations with Western allies due to perceived democratic backsliding. Nevertheless, Tunisia has maintained critical partnerships, including those with the United States, which designated it as a major non-NATO ally in 2015. Additionally, Tunisia's defense modernization is shaped by its strategic need to counter threats from neighboring Libya, where ongoing instability continues to pose risks to national security. In terms of its foreign policy, Tunisia is striking a balance between traditional alliances and new partnerships. While maintaining ties with the European Union, particularly on migration and economic issues, Tunisia has expanded cooperation with countries like China, seeking to diversify its security and economic alliances. This dual-track strategy aims to enhance sovereignty and reduce reliance on any single bloc, reflecting Tunisia’s adaptation to evolving global dynamics. The Javelin missile system is a modern addition to Tunisia’s arsenal, offering capabilities that significantly surpass its current inventory. Designed as a man-portable fire-and-forget anti-tank system, the Javelin uses advanced infrared homing to engage targets effectively from distances of up to 4,000 meters. Its tandem-charge warhead is capable of defeating modern armor, including vehicles equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA), by employing a precursor charge to neutralize the ERA before the primary warhead penetrates the base armor. The Javelin’s lightweight design and advanced LWCLU enhance operational flexibility, allowing for deployment in various environments with minimal setup time. Its fire-and-forget capability ensures greater safety for operators, as they can relocate immediately after launch. These features make the Javelin particularly suited to Tunisia’s evolving defense needs, providing its forces with a modern and versatile tool to address a wide range of armored and fortified threats. This acquisition underscores Tunisia’s commitment to advancing its military capabilities in alignment with regional security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-supports-tunisias-military-modernization-through-strategic-javelin-anti-tank-missile-deal	2024-12-06T05:51:25-08:00	
Japan Increases Defense Ties with Coastal Radars and Patrol Vessels Supplies Under OSA Program	On December 2, 2024, a Japanese government source revealed that Japan would supply specific defense equipment to the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Djibouti under its Official Security Assistance (OSA) program. This program, launched in April 2023, aims to strengthen the defense capacities of nations that share Tokyo's strategic values. For the 2024 fiscal year ending in March, the government allocated a budget of 5 billion yen ($33 million) to support these four priority countries. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mitsubishi J/FPS-3 Coastal Surveillance Radar (Picture source: Mitsubishi) In 2024, Japan decided to allocate a significant portion of this aid to the Philippines, which faces escalating Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. Tokyo plans to provide advanced maritime surveillance radar systems to Manila to enhance detection and control capabilities in this strategic area. These systems will complement the J/FPS-3 coastal surveillance radar developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, delivered in 2023, which significantly improved the security of the Philippines' territorial waters. Amid recurring confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels, these new radars aim to ensure better preparedness and a swift response to incursions. Mongolia, due to its strategic location between China and Russia, is expected to receive systems including Primary Surveillance Radars (PSR) produced by NEC Corporation, capable of detecting aircraft without transponders, and Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSR), which identify equipped aircraft and provide precise data on their altitude and trajectory. These systems will enable Mongolia to enhance its airspace monitoring capabilities and guard against potential intrusions. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Djibouti could receive Shikishima-class patrol vessels, built by Japan Marine United Corporation (JMU), or equivalent models designed to ensure maritime security and protect strategic trade routes. These vessels aim to counter illegal maritime activities in Indonesian waters and strengthen security in Djibouti's vital maritime corridor. Since its launch in April 2023, the OSA program reflects a strategic shift in Japan's international security policy. This proactive initiative aims to bolster the defense capacities of its partners in the face of growing threats, particularly China's military expansion. Through this targeted assistance, Tokyo reaffirms its commitment to promoting a free and stable Indo-Pacific while consolidating regional alliances in an increasingly tense geopolitical context. Japan's arms policy, long defined by a strict pacifist stance, is rooted in Article 9 of its 1947 Constitution adopted after World War II. This article prohibits Japan from using war as a means of resolving international conflicts and restricts its military capabilities to strictly territorial defense. For decades, this approach translated into stringent restrictions on arms exports and an exclusively defensive role for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). However, the evolving regional security environment has gradually pushed Tokyo to reassess this policy. Faced with China's growing military power, North Korea's nuclear threats, and the rising strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, several key changes have marked this transition. In 1967, the 'Three Principles on Arms Exports' established a strict ban on selling arms to communist countries, nations under UN embargo, or those involved in armed conflicts. These restrictions began to ease in 2014 when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe adopted the 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment,' allowing limited exports to countries sharing Japan's democratic values. A major turning point occurred in 2015 with the adoption of the collective security law, allowing the SDF to intervene to defend allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked. This change broadened the strictly defensive framework of Japan's military action. In 2023, Tokyo launched the OSA program, designed to provide non-lethal defense equipment to allied countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, or Mongolia. This program aims to strengthen the defense capacities of partner nations while stabilizing the region amid China's military expansion. In parallel, Japan significantly increased its military budget, reaching 2% of its GDP in 2024, in line with commitments outlined in its 2022 updated national defense strategy. This record budget marks a paradigm shift for a country that traditionally capped its military spending at around 1% of its GDP. These transformations reflect Japan's intention to play a more active role in regional and international security while asserting its commitment to ensuring a free and stable Indo-Pacific. This strategic shift marks a break from its historical pacifist stance while remaining aligned with contemporary geopolitical challenges. Outside the OSA framework, Japan has also supplied defense equipment to several countries through bilateral cooperation or specific loans. In 2016, the Philippines received TC-90 training aircraft, initially leased and later transferred permanently in 2018, to bolster maritime surveillance in the contested waters of the South China Sea. In 2020, Japan delivered patrol vessels to Vietnam via a low-interest loan, followed by a 2021 agreement to expand the export of maritime surveillance systems. In 2022, Japan concluded an agreement with Thailand for technology transfers in the defense sector, though specific systems have not been disclosed. Regarding Ukraine, while Japan has not supplied lethal military equipment, it delivered civilian drones, bulletproof vests, and other non-lethal support equipment in 2022 and 2023, underscoring its commitment to supporting Kyiv within the constraints of Japan's constitutional restrictions. These initiatives demonstrate Tokyo's intent to contribute to international security while adapting to the specific needs of its strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/japan-increases-defense-ties-with-coastal-radars-and-patrol-vessels-supplies-under-osa-program	2024-12-06T05:44:38-08:00	
First capture of intact Podlet-K1 radar by Syrian rebels could threaten Russia's air defense effectiveness	As reported by Clash Report on December 4, 2024, Syrian rebels have achieved the first recorded capture of an intact Russian 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, taken during an offensive near Hama at the headquarters of the Assad regime's 25th Special Forces Division. The system, valued at approximately $5 million and integral to the S-300PMU-2 and S-400 air defense networks, could pose a significant threat to Russian air defense effectiveness if its technology is analyzed by adversaries.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. (Picture source: Clash Report) Similar systems lost in Ukraine, such as those destroyed in Kherson and Crimea, were not seized intact. While operational use by the rebels is unlikely due to technical complexity, the most effective way to exploit its capabilities would be through detailed analysis, which could reveal vulnerabilities in Russian air defense systems, an eventuality which raises concerns among Russian analysts about its potential transfer to entities like NATO or Ukraine. Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. This information could advance the development of countermeasures, refine electronic warfare tactics, and highlight weaknesses in Russian air defense systems. The Podlet-K1's ability to detect low-altitude cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and R-360 Neptune, underscores its strategic importance. The capture occurred during a broader offensive by opposition forces in Hama province, following their takeover of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. This offensive, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), marked the first opposition control of Aleppo since 2016. After capturing several military installations, including the 87th Brigade base and a tank school, HTS forces advanced toward Hama. Although they temporarily breached the city's defenses, counterattacks by pro-Assad forces, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias, forced the rebels to retreat. The offensive resulted in significant equipment losses for both sides. Rebels reportedly seized 31 Russian-made tanks, including T-72 and T-90 models, 20 BMP armored personnel carriers, and 12 122mm artillery pieces. Additionally, they captured a Pantsir-S1, a Strela-10, and an S-125 air defense system. These acquisitions have enabled expanded drone and missile attacks on regime targets. However, intense fighting led to the destruction of other equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, though specific figures remain unverified. Among the abandoned systems was a ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures, left by the regime’s 4th Armored Division on the Khanasir-Ithrya road. This system, one of two upgraded in the Adra workshop, was filmed after its abandonment. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, rebels captured eight L-39 Albatros light training and attack jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The MiG-23, powered by a Tumansky R-29B turbojet engine, can reach speeds of up to 2,500 km/h and is designed for interception and air-to-ground missions. While these aircraft represent strategic assets, their operational potential is constrained by maintenance needs, a lack of skilled pilots, and vulnerability to airstrikes. Ground tests were attempted, but technical issues and attacks on captured bases hindered further use. The Podlet-K1 system can detect aerial targets at ranges of 10 to 300 kilometers and altitudes up to 10 kilometers, tracking up to 200 targets simultaneously. Its modular design comprises three components mounted on a KamAZ-6350 8x8 chassis: an antenna post, a mobile command post, and a power generator. It employs a phased-array S-band radar and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) technology, enabling operations against low-flying and high-speed targets. The system's deployment and pack-up can be completed within approximately 20 minutes. The capture of the Podlet-K1 radar system has drawn comparisons to a 2020 operation in Libya, where U.S. forces, in cooperation with Türkiye, extracted a Russian Pantsir-S1 system. Speculation suggests the radar could be transferred to Türkiye, given its use of Russian S-400 systems. Alternatively, Russian airstrikes might target the radar to prevent its analysis, similar to actions taken in Ukraine following the loss of a Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UAV. Despite logistical challenges, the radar’s intact condition could facilitate technical study and aid in developing countermeasures against similar systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/first-capture-of-intact-podlet-k1-radar-by-syrian-rebels-could-threaten-russias-air-defense-effectiveness	2024-12-06T05:08:14-08:00

Australia Establishes a Coastal Defense System to Enhance Strategic Capabilities	On December 6, 2024, the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, announced the development of a new coastal defense and long-range strike system for the Australian Army. This initiative aligns with the priorities outlined in the 2024 National Defense Strategy, which emphasizes securing Australia’s northern approaches amid evolving geopolitical complexities. This marks a significant step for the Australian Defense Force (ADF), introducing coastal strike capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Naval Strike Missile (NSM), developed by Kongsberg, is a stealth cruise missile for anti-ship and land-attack missions, designed to be mounted on the mobile and adaptable StrikeMaster vehicle for coastal operations (Picture source: Kongsberg) The program considers two advanced technological options. The first is the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), launched from the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Known for its mobility and capability, HIMARS can deliver strikes over 500 kilometers with the latest PrSM. The second option is the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), developed by Kongsberg, a stealth cruise missile designed for anti-ship and land-attack missions. The NSM, mounted on the StrikeMaster vehicle, offers a mobile and adaptable solution for coastal operations. A competitive evaluation is scheduled for 2025 to determine the most suitable technology for Australia’s strategic needs.

(Picture source: Thales) Under Project LAND 8113 Phase Two, the Federal Government has initiated a tender process to compare the StrikeMaster with the American-made M142 HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System). The HIMARS can deploy the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which has a range exceeding 400 kilometers. The government has highlighted the StrikeMaster as a less expensive and locally produced alternative, emphasizing its potential to strengthen domestic production capabilities. Despite its prioritization by the Albanese government, there has been internal resistance within the Army regarding the system's adoption. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM), developed by Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace in Norway, entered service in 2012 as the successor to the Penguin missile. It is constructed with materials designed to reduce radar visibility and features a titanium-cased warhead for precise targeting. Originally integrated into Norway’s Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates and Skjold-class corvettes, the NSM has also been adopted by Poland’s Coastal Missile Division, the United States, and Australia. The missile’s flexibility has enabled its use across a variety of platforms, including naval vessels and land-based systems. The NSM’s operational range exceeds 250 kilometers, and it employs GPS guidance, terrain-following technology, and an imaging infrared seeker for autonomous target identification and engagement. The missile is designed to fly at low altitudes to avoid detection and countermeasures. In Poland, the Coastal Missile Division deploys the NSM using mobile launchers supported by radar and command vehicles, enabling a networked defense system. The missile has also been adapted for land operations, as demonstrated by the U.S. Marine Corps' Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS), which employs unmanned vehicles for increased flexibility and range. The integration of naval missile systems onto land vehicles enhances coastal defense by enabling land-based forces to engage maritime targets. This capability allows rapid repositioning along coastlines, complicating adversary planning and operations. Using existing platforms to deploy naval missile technology reduces development costs while maintaining operational effectiveness. The NMESIS, for instance, successfully demonstrated this concept during a 2021 exercise, striking a target ship from a ground-based launcher. Similarly, the Australian Army is exploring the StrikeMaster system as a mobile coastal defense solution using the NSM, providing strike capabilities over 250 kilometers. Australia’s interest in long-range precision strike systems aligns with the 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR), which calls for a response to changing security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region, including the expansion of China’s military activities. The DSR recommends strengthening the Australian Defence Force (ADF) by acquiring more advanced strike systems across ground, air, and maritime domains to address vulnerabilities in conventional defenses. The ADF’s approach includes plans for domestic production of Kongsberg's NSM and Joint Strike Missile (JSM) and collaboration with the United States on the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) program to enhance ground-based strike capabilities. In the aerial domain, Australia has expressed interest in acquiring the B-21 Raider stealth bomber from the United States, citing previous experience with Canberra bombers and F-111 aircraft. In the maritime domain, the AUKUS agreement includes plans for the development of nuclear-powered submarines to increase operational capabilities in the region.

The test, conducted by the Department of Defense’s Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, marks a significant milestone in the U.S. pursuit of hypersonic technologies. The MACH-TB is designed to advance the testing and development of hypersonic systems, providing crucial insights into the performance of cutting-edge weapons that could dramatically enhance U.S. military capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Testing the future of warfare: The MACH-TB hypersonic flight test accelerates the development of advanced weapons capabilities for the U.S. military. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The MACH-TB is a next-generation hypersonic flight test vehicle developed to accelerate the testing process for hypersonic systems across multiple branches of the U.S. military and other federal agencies. Its primary purpose is to provide a reliable, commercially launched platform capable of simulating and testing hypersonic conditions in real-world flight scenarios. By employing commercial launch services, the DoD aims to reduce the costs and time associated with testing hypersonic components while simultaneously increasing the testing frequency. Mr. George Rumford, Director of the TRMC, emphasized the value of this approach: 'Leveraging commercial launch services allows our Nation to test components early and frequently, accelerating hypersonic development affordably.' This approach not only helps expedite testing but also enables rapid feedback on the performance of hypersonic technologies, making it a critical enabler for developing advanced capabilities for U.S. forces. Hypersonic weapons are defined as those that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. These weapons are particularly notable because of their ability to maneuver while traveling at extreme speeds, making them highly difficult to track or intercept with current missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability creates significant strategic advantages for any military force capable of deploying them. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare is undeniable, as they offer a range of benefits. First, their speed and precision enable hypersonic weapons to strike targets at extreme distances in a fraction of the time compared to conventional missiles, potentially rendering existing defense systems obsolete. Second, unlike ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic weapons are capable of maneuvering in flight, further complicating interception efforts. Finally, their ability to penetrate heavily defended airspace provides a significant deterrent and strategic advantage during combat situations. The development of hypersonic technologies is, therefore, seen as a crucial part of the evolving global arms race, as nations seek to gain a technological edge on the battlefield. While the United States has made significant strides in hypersonic weapons development, it is far from alone in pursuing this advanced technology. China and Russia have emerged as key competitors, each heavily investing in hypersonic systems to bolster their own military capabilities. China has made rapid progress in developing hypersonic glide vehicles, such as the DF-17, which is capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. The Chinese military has also been investing in advanced launch platforms and testing mechanisms, with a focus on increasing the speed and range of their hypersonic systems. Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has aggressively pursued hypersonic weapons as part of its military modernization program. The country has already deployed hypersonic missiles like the Avangard, which is reportedly capable of reaching speeds up to Mach 27. Additionally, Russia has developed the Zircon missile, a sea-launched hypersonic weapon intended to target both naval and land-based targets at extreme speeds. Both China and Russia have demonstrated their capabilities through successful test flights, creating a sense of urgency in the U.S. military to advance its own hypersonic development programs. In addition to China and Russia, countries such as India, France, and Australia are also pursuing hypersonic technologies, each working to integrate these systems into their defense strategies. For the U.S. military and its allies, hypersonic weapons represent a paradigm shift in the way warfare could be conducted. The strategic advantages they offer are clear. Hypersonic weapons allow for near-instantaneous strikes, significantly shortening the response time to emerging threats and providing a new tool for rapid deployment of military force. They also can penetrate traditional missile defense systems. Systems like the U.S.-developed Aegis or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) are optimized for intercepting slower ballistic missiles, but hypersonic weapons, due to their high speed and unpredictable flight paths, present a much more difficult challenge for these systems to defend against. Additionally, hypersonic systems can be adapted to various platforms, from ground-based launchers to submarines and aircraft, allowing military forces to deploy these weapons in a variety of operational scenarios. Given their speed and range, hypersonic weapons could be used in a variety of theaters, from deterring regional conflicts to countering more sophisticated threats posed by adversaries with advanced air-defense systems. Therefore, the U.S. military's focus on hypersonics is not just about keeping pace with China and Russia but also about ensuring that it retains a technological edge that will be decisive in future conflicts. The MACH-TB test represents one critical step in this ongoing race to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, which will be a core element of the U.S. military’s arsenal in the years to come. The success of the MACH-TB flight test is a major achievement in the U.S. Department of Defense's quest to accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies. By leveraging commercial launch services, the DoD is setting the stage for more frequent and cost-effective testing, ultimately leading to faster deployment of these advanced weapons. With global competitors like China and Russia intensifying their own hypersonic development programs, the need for the U.S. to lead in this domain has never been more pressing. Hypersonic weapons are poised to revolutionize military strategies worldwide, and initiatives like MACH-TB are essential for ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-us-successfully-tests-mach-tb-hypersonic-flight-to-accelerate-weapons-development	2024-12-06T01:29:30-08:00
