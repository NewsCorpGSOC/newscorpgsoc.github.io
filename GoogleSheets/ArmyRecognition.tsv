Volkswagen Ready to Enter Military Production Exploring Defense Equipment Supply	According to information reported by The Telegraph on March 11, 2025, Volkswagen is considering entering the production of military equipment for the German army, marking a potential diversification of its activities amid Europe's rearmament efforts. This statement comes from Oliver Blume, CEO of Europe’s largest car manufacturer, who stated that the company is open to exploring new concepts but has not yet received concrete proposals from potential partners. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg (Picture source: WikiCommons) This development coincides with Germany’s efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities, driven by concerns over a possible disengagement of the United States under President Donald Trump. Uncertainty about U.S. commitments is prompting Europe to bolster its defense industry, with increased investments and industrial restructuring. Several manufacturers, including Rheinmetall and KNDS Group, have already begun converting their automotive component production facilities to manufacture military equipment in response to growing demand. According to economic analysts, German car factories currently have surplus capacity due to a sharp decline in vehicle exports, which have halved from pre-pandemic levels. This drop is partly due to increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers, now the world’s leading car exporters, as well as a European market shifting toward electrification, which is reshaping traditional automotive production. In Germany, annual vehicle exports have fallen from 2.4 million to around 1.2 million units, forcing manufacturers to rethink their economic model. Asked about Volkswagen’s potential involvement in military equipment production, Oliver Blume emphasized the need for increased security investments in Europe. He clarified that no concrete steps had been taken so far but did not rule out the possibility of Volkswagen playing a role in the sector. He noted that the group has extensive expertise in the automotive industry and could provide consulting and technological support if needed, without immediately committing its production facilities. Rising demand for defense equipment has already had a significant impact on financial markets, with strong stock growth among German defense companies expanding their production capacity. Some automotive factories, initially designed for internal combustion engine production or light vehicle components, are now being converted to meet military sector needs. The industrial flexibility of these facilities could enable rapid adaptation to new defense market requirements, particularly for armored vehicles or aerospace components. Oliver Blume’s statements come as Volkswagen reports a 15% drop in profit, totaling €19.1 billion in 2024 compared to €22.5 billion the previous year. The company is facing challenges related to its transition to electric vehicles, which requires significant investment in new technologies, as well as the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on vehicles manufactured in Canada and Mexico. To remain competitive against Chinese manufacturers, Volkswagen has launched a major restructuring plan that includes cutting 35,000 jobs, reducing costs, and optimizing production lines. This potential diversification into the defense sector could present a strategic opportunity for the company. In addition to strengthening Germany’s and Europe’s defense capabilities, it could help Volkswagen offset losses in the traditional automotive market. However, the company remains cautious and is waiting for initiatives from the defense sector before committing further to this direction. The evolution of the geopolitical situation and the policies of European governments will be key factors in shaping this industrial strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/volkswagen-ready-to-enter-military-production-exploring-defense-equipment-supply	2025-03-12T08:16:09-07:00	
Poland Receives New Batch of 12 South Korean K2 Tanks Aiming to Become Europe’s Leading Tank Power	Poland has received a new batch of 12 K2 Black Panther main battle tanks (MBTs) from South Korea, bringing the total number of units delivered to 110 out of an initial order of 180 tanks. This marks a significant milestone in Poland's modern military upgrade program, which aims to enhance its armored forces with cutting-edge technology and greater firepower in the coming years. The information was published on March 11, 2025, via the 1Star X account.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Polish army K2 Black Panther tank was displayed at the MSPO Defense Exhibition in Kielce, Poland, on September 2024. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The first contract for the K2 tanks was signed on July 27, 2022, and was part of a broader effort to overhaul Poland's armored capabilities in the wake of increasing security concerns in the region. Under this agreement, Poland is slated to receive a total of 180 K2 MBTs, marking one of the largest foreign military purchases in the nation's history. The most recent batch of 12 tanks delivered in March 2025 further cements the strong defense ties between Poland and South Korea, with the full delivery expected to be completed within the next few years. Furthermore, Poland is exploring the possibility of acquiring additional K2 tanks in the future, potentially increasing the fleet to a total of 1,000 units, in line with its long-term military modernization goals. The K2 Black Panther brings a significant leap forward in terms of firepower, protection, and mobility compared to Poland's existing tank fleet, which includes the Soviet-era T-72 and PT-91 Twardy (an upgraded version of the T-72), as well as the German-made Leopard 2A5 and Leopard 2A4 models. The K2 is equipped with a 120mm smoothbore gun capable of firing a wide range of ammunition types, including advanced kinetic energy penetrators and programmable high-explosive shells. This is a step up from the 125mm gun on the T-72 and PT-91, which is less capable in terms of accuracy and firepower against modern armored threats. The Leopard 2A5 and 2A4, both with 120mm smoothbore guns, have similar capabilities, but the K2 features more modern stabilization and ammunition technology. In terms of protection, the K2’s composite armor, combined with advanced reactive armor modules and active protection systems (APS), provides a high level of survivability against both kinetic and shaped-charge projectiles. The T-72 and PT-91, while heavily armored, lack some of the more advanced features seen in the K2, such as the APS, which enhances defense against anti-tank missiles. The Leopard 2A5, on the other hand, is equipped with the renowned 'Chobham' armor, providing excellent protection, but the K2’s overall protection system is seen as superior in terms of active defense measures. The K2's sophisticated suspension system and powerful engine provide exceptional mobility, even in rough terrain, allowing it to operate effectively across Poland's diverse landscape. It is also equipped with state-of-the-art battlefield management systems, digital fire control, and an advanced crew comfort system, ensuring maximum efficiency in operational environments. The T-72 and PT-91, while functional, are somewhat outdated in terms of electronics and suspension systems. The Leopard 2A5 and 2A4 offer robust mobility but are not as agile as the K2 in specific conditions, particularly in terms of operational ease and advanced sensors. Poland’s ongoing acquisition of the K2 tanks is part of a broader strategy to modernize its armed forces, particularly its armored corps, and to prepare for future defense challenges. Poland has made it clear that it intends to significantly increase its tank strength over the coming years, with the goal of positioning itself as one of the most powerful armored forces in Europe. In addition to the K2, Poland has also been negotiating contracts for the K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers and FA-50 fighter jets from South Korea, further expanding its defense capabilities in line with NATO requirements. This strategy is closely aligned with the modernization of Poland’s defense infrastructure and its desire to build a rapid-response military capable of addressing potential threats along its eastern border. The goal of Poland is not only to replace outdated Soviet-era equipment but to position itself as a key military power in the region, capable of quickly mobilizing and deploying advanced armored units in the event of a crisis. With the K2 Black Panther tanks, Poland is taking a significant step toward achieving this ambitious objective, setting the stage for a more agile, modern, and lethal military in the near future. As Poland continues to receive deliveries of the K2, the country is expected to complete the integration of the full 180-unit order over the next few years, ensuring that its tank fleet remains at the forefront of military technology and readiness. Furthermore, discussions are ongoing to expand this number to 1,000 tanks potentially, securing Poland's place as a dominant armored force in Europe for decades to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-receives-new-batch-of-12-south-korean-k2-tanks-aiming-to-become-europes-leading-tank-power	2025-03-12T07:25:29-07:00

South Korea Offers Submarines to Canada as Relations with Washington Deteriorate	As Canada reassesses its strategic partnerships, South Korea is positioning itself as a reliable defense supplier capable of delivering advanced military equipment efficiently. A recent visit by a South Korean delegation to Ottawa highlights this initiative at a time when political instability in the United States is prompting several allies to diversify their sources of military procurement, as reported by the Ottawa Citizen on March 10, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A key element of this proposal is the KSS-III, a next-generation submarine developed by Hanwha Ocean (Picture source: ROK Navy) A group of twelve representatives from South Korea’s defense industry and government met with Canadian officials on March 5 and 6 to promote a range of military systems, including howitzers, training aircraft, rocket launchers, and submarines. The offer includes commitments to support Canadian industry by establishing local maintenance facilities and providing full access to onboard technology, an advantage that U.S. suppliers do not always guarantee their partners. A key element of this proposal is the KSS-III, a next-generation submarine developed by Hanwha Ocean. According to retired South Korean Admiral Steve Jeong, now vice president of the company, the platform aligns with the requirements of the Canadian Armed Forces. He emphasized that three units are already in service, and that South Korea could deliver a submarine within six years of signing a contract. With the capability to remain submerged for over three weeks without surfing and a range exceeding 7,000 nautical miles, the KSS-III is particularly suited for Arctic operations. South Korea is becoming an increasingly prominent player in the global arms market. Its defense exports have grown significantly in recent years, particularly in Europe, where several countries are seeking to reduce their reliance on the United States. Poland has signed a contract worth over $10 billion for South Korean tanks, self-propelled howitzers, light aircraft, and missile systems, while Romania has secured a $1 billion deal for howitzers. These agreements include provisions for local production, supporting job creation and industrial cooperation. The growth of South Korea’s defense industry is partly driven by past challenges with US suppliers. According to Jeong, South Korea previously faced rising costs and technological dependence that limited its autonomy. In response, the country developed its own defense systems, enabling it to provide NATO-compatible equipment while avoiding certain restrictions associated with U.S. exports. This shift comes at a time when Canada is increasingly scrutinizing its dependence on U.S. technology. The F-35 fighter jets ordered for $19 billion remain under American control in terms of software and hardware updates. Similarly, the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) warship program, which could cost up to $80 billion, incorporates key systems controlled by the United States, potentially restricting Canada’s operational sovereignty over its own naval fleet. Despite these concerns, the Canadian government has maintained its procurement strategy with the US, signing nearly $30 billion in military equipment contracts in 2023, including an $8 billion agreement with Boeing for surveillance aircraft and a $2.5 billion deal for drones. This approach aimed to address American criticism over Canada’s defense spending levels but has not prevented the Trump administration from increasing pressure on Ottawa. The issue of military and economic integration with the U.S. remains a divisive topic among Canadian policymakers and defense experts. Some former high-ranking officials, such as General Rick Hillier, advocate for closer ties with Washington, while others, like retired Vice Admiral Mark Norman, warn against excessive reliance and have suggested economic countermeasures in response to U.S. pressures. Against this backdrop, South Korea’s proposal aligns with a broader trend in which U.S. allies are exploring alternative defense suppliers. If Canada seriously considers this offer, it could mark a shift in its procurement policy, favoring partners that provide competitive and technologically accessible solutions without imposing excessive restrictions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/south-korea-offers-submarines-to-canada-as-relations-with-washington-deteriorate	2025-03-11T01:52:48-07:00	
Tenth Russian Project 12700 Alexandrit-class minesweeper Polyarny approaches the final construction phase	On March 9, 2025, the Telegram channel Military Russia shared an image of the tenth hull of the Project 12700 minesweeper, named Polyarny, indicating that the vessel is approaching the final stages of its construction at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard (SNSZ) in Saint Petersburg. This development is part of the ongoing expansion of Russia’s mine countermeasure fleet under the Alexandrit-class program, as initial plans called for the construction of ten ships, but later statements mentioned a total of up to 40 units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The classification of the Project 12700 has changed multiple times, alternating between base and sea minesweepers, though the Polyarny is officially designated as a base minesweeper, as indicated on its keel-laying plaque. (Picture source: Telegram/MilitaryRussia) The Polyarny was laid down on June 12, 2022, following a contract signed by the Russian Ministry of Defense on August 25, 2021, during the Army-2021 International Military-Technical Forum. The ship, designated with factory number 530, is intended for service with the Northern Fleet. Project 12700 ships are designed for mine countermeasure operations in both coastal and deep-sea environments. The classification of these ships has changed multiple times, alternating between base and sea minesweepers, though the Polyarny is officially designated as a base minesweeper, as indicated on its keel-laying plaque. The Project 12700, known as the Alexandrit-class, was developed by the Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau to modernize the Russian Navy’s mine countermeasure capabilities. The lead ship, named Aleksandr Obukhov, was laid down in 2011 and entered service in 2016. The project was initiated to replace aging Soviet-era minesweepers from the Gorya and Sonya classes with vessels utilizing composite materials and updated mine-hunting technology. Initial plans under the State Armament Program for 2018–2027 called for the construction of ten ships, but later statements mentioned a total of up to 40 units. A primary feature of the Alexandrit-class is its monolithic fiberglass hull, produced using vacuum infusion technology. The SNSZ is the only shipyard in Russia with this capability and the only one globally capable of producing monolithic hulls up to 80 meters in length. This construction method reduces the vessel’s magnetic signature, improving survivability against magnetic mines, while also providing higher structural strength compared to steel hulls. The fiberglass composition increases service life beyond that of low-magnetic steel hulls while reducing overall weight. The shipyard implemented advanced equipment and software to develop this technology. This construction method reduces the vessel’s magnetic signature, which improves survivability against magnetic mines. The composite hull also provides resistance to corrosion and extends its operational lifespan compared to traditional steel-hulled designs. The propulsion system consists of two 42-cylinder, star-configured Zvezda M503B-1 diesel engines, each producing 2,500 horsepower, supported by two ADGR-315/1500 OM4 diesel generators (315 kW each) and two DGF2A 200/1500 diesel generators (200 kW each). The ships are also equipped with two bow thrusters (PU-100F) and two stern retractable azimuth thrusters (VPK-90F/70), providing high maneuverability. The maximum speed is 16.5 knots, with an operational range of 1,600 nautical miles at 10 knots. The Alexandrit-class is equipped with a range of mine countermeasure systems, including the Livadia-M mine detection sonar, the Pall-N navigation radar, and the Ruberoid communications suite. The mine countermeasure system integrates high-performance hydroacoustic stations, deployed both onboard and via remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles, for mine detection and neutralization in coastal and deep-sea environments. The ships also feature an integrated bridge system and an automated mine countermeasure control system, allowing centralized management of all detection and neutralization operations. Defensive armament includes a six-barrel 30mm AK-306 close-in weapon system, a 14.5mm MTPU heavy machine gun mount, and eight man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), either the 9K38 Igla or the 9K333 Verba. The Aleksandr Obukhov (n°507), the lead ship of the Alexandrit-class (which became the most numerous type of sea minesweeper in service within the Russian Navy), was commissioned on December 9, 2016, and assigned to the Baltic Fleet. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The ships have a standard displacement of 620 tons, increasing to 890 tons at full load. They measure 61 meters in length, with a beam of 10.2 meters and a draft of 2.68 meters. Their maximum speed is 16.5 knots, with an operational range of 1,600 nautical miles at 10 knots. These vessels are designed for ten-day missions without resupply and have a crew complement of 45. Mine countermeasure capabilities are supported by unmanned mine-hunting systems, including the Skanda unmanned surface vehicle and the Alexandrit-ISPUM mine disposal system. The ships also retain the capability to operate traditional sweeping equipment, as well as using the Orlan-10 UAV. The onboard electronic suite features the Diez automated control system, the Anapa sonar, the Struktura-35 mine detection sonar, and the Altyn-M integrated sonar system for underwater navigation and detection. Production of the Alexandrit-class is centralized at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard, the sole facility currently manufacturing these vessels. Early production faced delays, particularly with diesel engine procurement from Zvezda, but shipbuilding capacity has since increased. While there were considerations to expand production to the Amur Shipyard, all orders remain with SNSZ. In 2021, official statements indicated that an additional ten ships were under consideration following the initial production run. Several ships from this class have been delivered to different Russian fleets, becoming the most numerous type of sea minesweeper in service within the Russian Navy. The Aleksandr Obukhov (n°507), the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on December 9, 2016, and assigned to the Baltic Fleet. For its part, the Black Sea Fleet operates the Ivan Antonov (460), commissioned on January 26, 2019, the Vladimir Yemelyanov (466), commissioned on December 28, 2019, and the Georgiy Kurbatov (464), which entered service on August 20, 2021. The Pacific Fleet has received the Yakov Balyaev (701), commissioned on December 26, 2020, the Pyotr Ilyichev (721), which entered service on November 16, 2022, and the Anatoly Shlemov (757), delivered on December 29, 2022. The most recently delivered unit, the Lev Chernavin (660), was assigned to the Baltic Fleet on December 25, 2023. Additional ships are currently in various stages of construction. The Afanasy Ivannikov (hull n°529), which was laid down on September 9, 2021, was launched on August 9, 2024, and is expected to enter service in 2025. The Polyarny (530), laid down on June 12, 2022, is nearing the final stages of construction and is also planned for commissioning in 2025. The Dmitry Lysov (531), laid down on June 19, 2023, and the Semyon Agafonov (532), laid down on January 18, 2024, are still under construction, with expected service entry in 2026 and 2027, respectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/tenth-russian-project-12700-alexandrit-class-minesweeper-polyarny-approaches-the-final-construction-phase	2025-03-11T01:48:31-07:00

(Picture source: Tajikistani MoD) Tajikistan unveiled its newly acquired HQ-17AE short-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) system for the first time during a parade marking the 32nd anniversary of its Armed Forces. The display of four combat vehicles and two transporter-loader vehicles underscores the country’s efforts to modernize its air defense and highlights its growing military cooperation with China. The HQ-17AE is a short-range surface-to-air weapon system designed to operate in all weather conditions and capable of intercepting targets flying at low and medium altitude. Developed by the Second Academy of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), it is an export version of the HQ-17A, itself derived from the Russian Tor system. Like all members of the HQ-17 family, the HQ-17AE is primarily intended to counter SHORAD ('Short-Range Air Defense') threats such as aircraft, helicopters, and drones, as well as precision-guided munitions (guided bombs, cruise missiles, and air-to-surface missiles). Chinese official sources indicate that it can also engage more challenging targets such as stealth aircraft, supersonic cruise missiles, and certain types of rockets. The HQ-17 range includes multiple variants: tracked versions (HQ-17) and 6×6 wheeled versions (HQ-17A), both operated by the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force, as well as an export version called the FM-2000, revealed for the first time at the 2018 Airshow China defense exhibition. It remains unclear whether the HQ-17AE is simply a new designation for the FM-2000 or whether it is a distinct variant featuring a launcher-radar vehicle more closely aligned with the HQ-17A. In any case, the difference between the HQ-17A and the FM-2000 mainly lies in the 6×6 chassis, although both systems use the same firing turret. In addition to Tajikistan, the HQ-17 series has been exported to countries including Serbia and Saudi Arabia, reflecting China’s growing footprint in the global defense market. This acquisition is part of a broader regional trend: neighboring Uzbekistan has also procured Chinese-made air defense systems such as the FM-90 and the KS-1C. By adding the HQ-17AE to its arsenal, Tajikistan signals a shift toward Chinese defense technology to strengthen its national security and enhance its overall deterrence posture.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/tajikistan-debuts-chinese-made-hq-17ae-air-defense-system-during-armed-forces-anniversary-parade	2025-03-11T01:28:50-07:00	
Czech Republic Conducts Tests on Caesar 8x8 Self-Propelled Howitzer in France Ahead of Military Integration	The Czech Republic is advancing its artillery modernization with the first tests of the Caesar 8x8 self-propelled howitzer in France.

Europe Strengthens Air Defense with Massive Aster Missile Order from France Italy and UK	France, the United Kingdom, and Italy are set to announce a new strategic order for nearly 220 Aster 15 and 30 missiles, as reported by La Tribune. This acquisition, to be officially confirmed early next week by the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), aims to enhance the missile defense capabilities of the three nations while reinforcing European industrial sovereignty in this critical sector. The contract, awarded to the industrial consortium Eurosam, reflects European efforts to address evolving aerial threats, including next-generation fighter aircraft, hypersonic missiles, and long-range armed drones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles form the backbone of air and missile defense systems for several European nations, equipping both naval and ground-based platforms (Picture source: OCCAR) The contract has been granted to Eurosam, a Franco-Italian economic interest group (GIE) comprising MBDA France, MBDA Italy, and Thales, key companies in the European defense industry. This longstanding partnership plays a major role in the development of naval and land-based air defense capabilities through widely deployed and proven systems. Beyond this latest order, Paris, London, and Rome have emphasized the need to accelerate production and delivery schedules, not only for these additional missiles but also for previously contracted units. The objective is to ensure the timely availability of Aster missiles for their respective armed forces, addressing operational readiness requirements in a geopolitical context marked by increasing military tensions. The Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles form the backbone of air and missile defense systems for several European nations, equipping both naval and ground-based platforms. Designed to provide effective protection against a broad range of aerial threats, they are integrated into key defense systems, including PAAMS (Principal Anti-Air Missile System), which is deployed on the UK Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers, the French and Italian Horizon frigates, and the SAMP/T system used by the French and Italian armies. The Aster 15, developed for short- to medium-range air defense, reaches speeds of Mach 3 and has an interception range exceeding 30 km, making it well-suited for countering multiple and simultaneous threats. The Aster 30 is designed for long-range engagements, with an operational range exceeding 120 km and a speed of Mach 4.5, enabling it to intercept short-range ballistic missiles and maneuver aerial threats. The missiles employ an advanced guidance system integrating an active radio frequency (RF) seeker and inertial navigation, ensuring high-precision target tracking. Their maneuverability is enhanced by a hybrid control system combining aerodynamic surfaces with thrust vector control, known as PIF-PAF, which enables rapid trajectory corrections. This design ensures a high interception success rate, even against supersonic targets executing complex evasive maneuvers. Due to these capabilities, Aster missiles are effective against a wide range of threats, including stealth aircraft, low-flying cruise missiles, and short-range ballistic missiles. With growing international tensions and the emergence of new threats, Aster missile production capacity has become a strategic concern. In December 2022, France and Italy had already placed an order with Eurosam for nearly 700 Aster missiles, highlighting the program’s significance for European armed forces. The current priority is to shorten production times and expand industrial capacity to meet operational requirements more effectively. MBDA, a key industry player, has set an objective to reduce production time significantly. In 2022, the average production time for an Aster missile was 42 months, but the goal is to bring this down to under 18 months by 2026. To achieve this, MBDA and its partners are implementing an industrial optimization strategy, including facility expansions and automation of certain manufacturing stages. The Selles-Saint-Denis site, which plays a key role in final assembly and missile integration, is undergoing investment initiatives to enhance production capacity and ensure a steady increase in output. The acceleration of deliveries and increased production capacity align with broader European efforts to strengthen strategic autonomy. As asymmetric and conventional threats continue to evolve, ensuring a secure and independent supply of essential defense systems is becoming a priority for European nations. This joint order reflects the commitment of Paris, London, and Rome to maintaining interoperability among their armed forces while reducing reliance on non-European suppliers. By modernizing industrial infrastructure and optimizing manufacturing processes, Europe is positioning itself as a key player in next-generation defense systems. This strategy extends beyond the Aster missile program and is part of a broader effort to enhance collective defense capabilities, including initiatives such as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and new missile defense programs within NATO and the European Union. The official confirmation of this order for more than 200 Aster missiles marks a new step in strengthening European air defense capabilities. By reinforcing industrial cooperation and accelerating the deployment of these critical systems, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy aim to enhance the protection of their strategic assets and military units. In a constantly evolving security landscape, this initiative underscores the importance of a proactive approach to addressing modern air defense challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/europe-strengthens-air-defense-with-massive-aster-missile-order-from-france-italy-and-uk	2025-03-10T07:39:24-07:00	
North Korea Builds Two New Frigates Simultaneously as It Expands Naval Capabilities with Russian Assistance	North Korea is undergoing an unprecedented modernization of its naval fleet with the simultaneous construction of two distinct frigates at the Nampo shipyard. These new surface vessels mark a strategic shift in Pyongyang’s maritime doctrine, aimed at strengthening its power projection and defense capabilities in response to regional threats. During an inspection visit on March 8, 2025, Kim Jong-Un reviewed the progress of these projects and reaffirmed the importance of naval power in national defense, emphasizing the need for a fleet capable of operating under modern naval warfare conditions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images released by state media show two ships under construction, each in a different section of the shipyard (Picture source: KCNA) Images released by state media show two ships under construction, each in a different section of the shipyard. The first, which appears to be at an advanced stage, features a large superstructure with a design seemingly intended to reduce radar signature. It is expected to integrate modern systems, including a fixed-panel radar, a configuration not previously seen in the North Korean Navy, and a vertical launching system (VLS) capable of deploying both cruise missiles and advanced guided surface-to-air missiles. With an estimated displacement of over 3,000 tons, this frigate would be the largest surface combatant ever built by North Korea. Its design suggests an effort to align with the technological standards of more developed navies while enhancing the country's blue-water capabilities. The second frigate, still under construction in another hall of the same shipyard, appears to be part of a separate program. The installation of a new clad structure in this section, identified by analysts in the previous year, indicates that construction on this vessel has recently accelerated. Its design and configuration are less advanced than those of the first ship, suggesting that it may be a more conventional variant, likely designed for patrol and coastal defense missions. However, it also incorporates modernized elements, reflecting a broader effort to enhance the North Korean surface fleet. This ambitious naval program is part of a wider modernization initiative, which also includes the construction of a 7,000-ton nuclear-powered strategic submarine. Currently being assembled at Sinpo South, this submarine is expected to carry up to ten ballistic missiles, providing Pyongyang with a more difficult-to-detect underwater strike capability. The commissioning of this submarine would significantly strengthen the country's nuclear deterrence strategy and mark a turning point in its submarine capabilities. The simultaneous acceleration of these naval projects is partly attributed to growing cooperation with Russia. Historically, North Korea has received technological transfers from China and the former Soviet Union to develop its naval capabilities. Today, presumed Russian involvement in these projects could explain the rapid integration of advanced technologies, particularly the VLS and modern radar systems. This development suggests an intensification of ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, reinforcing North Korea’s navy amid rising geopolitical tensions. Currently, the Korean People’s Navy relies primarily on an aging fleet dominated by Najin- and Nampo-class frigates. The Najin-class frigates, introduced in the 1970s, have undergone partial modernizations, including the integration of Kh-35 anti-ship missiles on certain units. However, with a displacement of around 1,500 tons, these ships exhibit clear technological limitations against modern threats. The Nampo-class frigates, more recent but produced in limited numbers, remain largely undocumented due to the secrecy surrounding North Korea’s naval programs. In comparison, the new frigates under construction represent a significant technological leap, enhancing the country's ability to conduct more effective naval operations. Alongside these developments, North Korea has also integrated a modernized frigate into its fleet, Patrol Ship No. 661, part of the Amnok-class. This vessel, among the most advanced in the North Korean Navy, features a design inspired by foreign models and a diversified weapons system. It is equipped with eight anti-ship missiles, six short-range surface-to-air missiles, a 76mm naval gun, two rapid-fire anti-aircraft systems, and anti-submarine rocket launchers, providing North Korea with improved maritime and coastal operational capabilities. The commissioning of this frigate coincided with North Korea’s participation in Russia’s 'Ocean-2024' naval exercises, an event that marked the country's first such involvement and highlighted a growing military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang. The simultaneous development of these frigates and the strategic nuclear submarine comes at a time of rising regional tensions, particularly with the United States and South Korea increasing their joint military exercises. Ahead of the Freedom Shield drills, North Korea appears to be signaling its ability to modernize its navy despite international sanctions and diplomatic pressures. This accelerated naval modernization marks a break from Pyongyang’s traditional military doctrine, which has historically focused on land-based and submarine deterrence. The commissioning of these new warships represents a major transformation for the Korean People’s Navy, which has long been limited to asymmetric and coastal operations but now appears to be shifting towards a broader enhancement of its blue-water capabilities. With these frigates and its submarine program, North Korea is moving beyond a purely defensive posture to establish a more diverse and sophisticated naval fleet. This evolution, combined with technical and strategic support from Russia, could alter the regional naval balance and force the United States and South Korea to reassess their maritime defense and presence strategies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/north-korea-builds-two-new-frigates-simultaneously-as-it-expands-naval-capabilities-with-russian-assistance	2025-03-10T06:45:06-07:00

The CGR-080 is a guided missile utilizing GPS/INS (Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System) technology, ensuring high accuracy with an operational range of 30 to 80 kilometers and a Circular Error probability (CEP) of just 15 meters. Its explosive warhead is designed to effectively neutralize a variety of targets, including military infrastructure, lightly armored vehicles, and fortified positions. Unlike traditional unguided rockets, the CGR-080 provides precision strike capability, reducing collateral damage and improving the effectiveness of targeted bombardment, particularly in urban or complex environments. Compared to similar systems, the Homar-K equipped with the CGR-080 exceeds the performance of the U.S. HIMARS system armed with the M31 GMLRS missile, which has a maximum range of 70 kilometers. This increased range allows Polish forces to engage targets at greater distances while remaining beyond the reach of enemy counter-battery systems. The extended range, combined with the modularity of the Homar-K, provides greater operational flexibility and an enhanced deterrence capability on the battlefield while maintaining interoperability with allied artillery systems. A key advantage of the Homar-K system is its ability to fire a wide range of munitions, increasing its adaptability for various mission types. In addition to the CGR-080, it is compatible with the CTM-MR guided missile, which has a range of 50 to 160 kilometers and a penetration-fragmentation warhead designed for destroying fortified positions and strategic infrastructure. The CTM-290 missile can strike targets up to 290 kilometers away, further extending the Polish military’s deep-strike capability. The Homar-K can also deploy a guided anti-ship missile equipped with GPS/INS/IIR (Imaging Infrared) guidance, capable of engaging naval targets at ranges between 50 and 160 kilometers, enabling operations across multiple theaters. The success of this first CGR-080 launch demonstrates the increasing operational proficiency of Polish artillery crews in handling advanced systems. The K239 Chunmoo, from which the Homar-K is derived, is currently the second most-produced modern multiple launch rocket system globally after U.S. systems and is in service in significant numbers in South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Poland, and Saudi Arabia. Hanwha Aerospace, Poland’s partner in this project, has demonstrated its ability to provide solutions tailored to local requirements by integrating its systems with national components. The successful integration of the CGR-080 missile could also pave the way for the Homar-K system’s export to other countries, including Norway, the Philippines, and Malaysia, which may be interested in a multiple-launch rocket system offering modularity and compatibility with advanced munitions. This development strengthens the international appeal of the Homar-K program and could mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation between Poland and other strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-releases-video-of-first-successful-cgr-080-missile-launch-from-homar-k-mlrs	2025-03-10T05:48:22-07:00

Construction of these ships will take place at the Irving Shipbuilding yard in Halifax, incorporating lessons learned from the British Type 26 and Australian Hunter programs. The project plans for the construction of 15 units to replace the decommissioned Iroquois-class destroyers and the Halifax-class frigates, with the first ship, HMCS Fraser, expected to enter service in the 2030s. However, the estimated total cost of between CAD 31 billion and CAD 43 billion raises concerns about the program’s long-term financial viability. Nonetheless, the River-class destroyers will offer enhanced flexibility through a modular design that allows for the integration of future systems and operational upgrades. Designed to replace the four retired Iroquois-class destroyers and twelve Halifax-class frigates, these ships will feature advanced underwater sensors, state-of-the-art radar, and modern weapon systems, enabling them to operate in both deep-sea and complex coastal environments. Their missions will include naval combat operations, surveillance, counter-piracy and counter-terrorism efforts, maritime interdiction, and support for humanitarian operations. The construction of these ships falls under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS), which aims to strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding industry by enhancing its capabilities and supporting workforce development. ISI, based in Halifax, is responsible for their construction and has received an investment of CAD 871.7 million to modernize its infrastructure and improve production efficiency. This program is expected to contribute CAD 719.3 million annually to Canada’s GDP and generate or maintain approximately 5,250 jobs per year between 2025 and 2039, with significant economic benefits for the Atlantic region. To support the commissioning and long-term maintenance of the new destroyers, the Department of National Defence is constructing a land-based testing facility in Halifax, scheduled for completion in 2027. Additionally, CAD 463 million has been allocated to upgrading shipyard facilities to ensure delivery timelines are met. Canada is also applying its Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) policy to this project, requiring contractors to reinvest amounts equivalent to the contract value into the Canadian industry, with a focus on workforce development, technological innovation, and industrial expansion. Spending on the acquisition of River-class destroyers plays a key role in Canada’s goal of increasing defense expenditures to 2% of GDP, in line with NATO commitments. These investments are also expected to help exceed NATO’s guideline that at least 20% of defense spending be allocated to major military equipment programs. With this contract, the Government of Canada confirms its commitment to equipping the Royal Canadian Navy with a modern and operational fleet while supporting the domestic shipbuilding industry. The commissioning of the first ships will be a significant milestone in renewing the country’s naval capabilities, strengthening Canada’s maritime security and its ability to operate alongside international partners.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/canada-invests-in-naval-power-with-river-class-destroyers-for-anti-submarine-warfare-and-air-defense	2025-03-10T01:07:55-07:00

Exclusive: US Army Integrates Israeli Spike Missile on AH-64 Apache Helicopter for Enhanced Precision Strikes	On March 5, 2025, a significant milestone in U.S. Army aviation took place as the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) successfully piloted an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter integrated with Spike Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) missiles. This event marks the first-ever flight of training Spike NLOS missiles by a conventional Army unit in the U.S. Central Command area of operations, setting the stage for future operational combat use of the system. The successful flight represents a critical step in the Army's ongoing efforts to enhance its precision strike capabilities, bringing the Spike NLOS closer to becoming a fully integrated weapon system for the Apache fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), successfully conducts a flight of an AH-64 Apache helicopter equipped with training Spike Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) missiles at Erbil Airbase, Iraq, on March 5, 2025. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The U.S. Army's decision to adopt the Israeli-made Spike NLOS missile system for its Interim-Long Range Precision Munition (I-LRPM) program in 2020 significantly bolstered the firepower and operational flexibility of its AH-64 Apache helicopters. Developed by Lockheed Martin, Spike NLOS enables the Apache to engage targets beyond visual range (BVR), extending the attack helicopter’s operational range to up to 32 kilometers. This long-range capability allows Apache pilots to neutralize high-value targets at distances far greater than traditional missiles, providing more effective standoff and reducing the risk of exposure to enemy air defenses. Spike NLOS is part of the broader Spike family of missiles, which was originally developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The Spike family, known for its precision and versatility, includes a variety of missile variants designed for different platforms and target engagement scenarios. The NLOS (Non-Line of Sight) version stands out by allowing the missile to be fired at targets that are not directly visible to the operator or the launch platform, thanks to its sophisticated guidance systems and the use of real-time sensor data from the Apache. This technology is a key feature that sets Spike NLOS apart from traditional missiles, making it ideal for modern combat environments where traditional line-of-sight targeting may not always be possible or effective. Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) technology enables the Spike missile to strike targets hidden behind obstacles such as buildings, terrain, or dense foliage. This capability is made possible by integrating the missile with advanced targeting and guidance systems, which allow the operator to launch the missile based on precise coordinates or sensor inputs, even if the target cannot be directly seen. In combat, where visibility may be limited due to weather conditions, smoke, or geographic features, this technology offers a significant advantage in striking high-value targets without exposing the platform to unnecessary risk. Spike NLOS is equipped with an advanced motor system that enhances its range and accuracy, two crucial elements for precision strikes in modern warfare. The missile’s long range allows Apache crews to engage distant targets from a safe standoff distance, minimizing exposure to hostile air defenses and ground fire. In addition to its extended range, the missile also incorporates a 'man-in-the-loop' control system. This feature provides Apache pilots with the ability to adjust the missile's trajectory during flight, giving them greater control over the missile’s path as it engages its target. The ability to make real-time adjustments is especially valuable in dynamic combat environments, where targets may move or change positions rapidly. The integration of Spike NLOS enhances the Apache’s precision strike capabilities. The man-in-the-loop feature enables the pilot to guide the missile to its target with greater accuracy, even if the target is moving or positioned in challenging terrain. This flexibility allows Apache crews to engage targets more effectively, particularly in complex combat situations where the environment is constantly changing, and precision is key to mission success. In addition, the ability to control the missile mid-flight ensures a high probability of hitting the target, even if it is not in direct line of sight from the helicopter. Moreover, the compatibility of Spike NLOS with the Apache’s existing suite of sensors and avionics systems ensures that the Apache will maintain situational awareness while executing precision strikes. The Apache’s onboard sensors can track and identify targets at long distances, and the integration with Spike NLOS allows the helicopter to launch a missile and strike with pinpoint accuracy, even when those targets are obscured by terrain or obstacles. This added capability is vital in modern warfare, where minimizing collateral damage and ensuring mission success are of paramount importance. The introduction of Spike NLOS onto the AH-64 Apache represents a significant enhancement of the U.S. Army’s precision strike capabilities, providing a new tool for a wide range of combat operations, including counter-terrorism, force protection, and conventional warfare. Previously, the AH-64 Apache’s primary missile system was the AGM-114 Hellfire, a laser-guided missile that has been in use for decades. While the Hellfire remains an effective weapon, its range and line-of-sight limitations have made it less suitable for certain modern combat scenarios. The Spike NLOS missile, with its extended range, non-line-of-sight capability, and advanced guidance systems, gives the Apache a significant tactical advantage. By integrating Spike NLOS into its weaponry, the Apache can now strike targets up to 32 km away, extending its operational reach and providing greater flexibility in combat. The ability to engage targets beyond visual range also enhances the safety of Apache crews, allowing them to remain at a standoff distance and reducing the risk of retaliation from enemy air defenses or ground forces. The precision targeting capabilities of the Spike NLOS, combined with its extended range, make the Apache a more formidable platform in modern, high-intensity conflicts. Looking ahead, the U.S. Army plans to continue testing and refining the Spike NLOS missile system, with the goal of fully integrating it into Apache units around the world. As the Army refines its use of Spike NLOS in real-world combat scenarios, it will be able to build on the Apache's already impressive capabilities, ensuring that it remains a key asset in the U.S. military’s arsenal for years to come. With its enhanced range, precision, and flexibility, the Spike NLOS missile system is set to play a critical role in the Army’s ability to conduct effective and efficient operations in a wide range of conflict zones. As the U.S. military continues to adapt to evolving threats, the integration of Spike NLOS on the Apache attack helicopter represents a key step in maintaining air superiority and providing critical support to ground forces. The system will provide Apache crews with the tools needed to tackle a wide range of targets, from enemy combatants to high-value assets, while minimizing risks and maximizing the effectiveness of each strike.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-army-integrates-israeli-spike-missile-on-ah-64-apache-helicopter-for-enhanced-precision-strikes	2025-03-08T11:26:02-08:00

This deployment marks a pivotal moment in the U.S. military’s strategy for strengthening its presence and operational flexibility in the increasingly contested Indo-Pacific region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II aircraft from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 214, Marine Aircraft Group 13, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, taxi along the flight line after arriving at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, on March 8, 2025. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) VMFA-214 (Marine Fighter Attack Squadron), based out of MCAS Yuma, is one of the most distinguished and historic squadrons in the U.S. Marine Corps. It was originally established during World War II and has since earned a reputation for exceptional combat readiness. In March 2022, the squadron made the transition to the F-35B fighter jet, the U.S. Marine Corps' version of the fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II. The F-35B is a short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the F-35, designed specifically for operations in environments where traditional, long runways may not be available. The aircraft's ability to land vertically or take off in short distances allows it to operate from small, austere locations, including aircraft carriers, forward-deployed bases, and even makeshift airstrips in contested environments. This capability is critical in the Indo-Pacific, where regional geography often requires flexibility in military operations, particularly on small islands or disputed areas with limited infrastructure. This deployment represents the first time a U.S.-based F-35 squadron has been stationed in the region under the UDP. The F-35B’s arrival in Japan provides the U.S. military with an immediate, flexible airpower capability that is unmatched by older aircraft in terms of stealth, sensors, and interoperability with allied forces. The F-35B’s cutting-edge stealth, sensor fusion, and combat capabilities make it an ideal platform for operations in the contested environment of the Indo-Pacific. The aircraft can operate in any weather condition, with sophisticated avionics providing real-time data that enhances situational awareness across the battlespace. The strategic importance of the F-35B's deployment is also reflected in its role within the larger U.S. military network in the region. According to Lieutenant Colonel Robert F. Guyette, the commanding officer of VMFA-214, the focus of the squadron during this deployment is threefold: to integrate seamlessly with Marine forces, joint forces, and regional allies, to improve warfighting readiness as a combined force, and to refine the ability to operate from austere locations. These goals align with key U.S. Marine Corps concepts like Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations, which are designed to maximize survivability and airpower projection in contested environments. The additional F-35B squadron further enhances the operational capacity of Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) 12, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), which already maintains two fully operational F-35B squadrons in the region. Colonel Kyle B. Shoop, commander of MAG-12, emphasized the unique contribution of VMFA-214’s deployment to joint and allied operations. 'An additional F-35B squadron increases Marine aviation’s contribution to operations in the Indo-Pacific with joint forces, allies, and partners alike, from established and scantily developed locations for distributed operations,' Shoop noted. The F-35B's capability to operate in austere conditions, integrate with joint networks, and provide enhanced battlespace awareness makes it a critical asset for any coalition force operating in the region. Furthermore, the deployment of the F-35B is a clear sign of the U.S. military’s ongoing transition from fourth-generation aircraft, like the F/A-18 Hornets and AV-8B Harriers, to fifth-generation platforms. The February 2025 Marine Aviation Plan laid out this transition as essential to maintaining superiority in modern combat environments. The F-35B's stealth capabilities, advanced sensors, and interoperability with allied forces ensure that the U.S. remains ahead of potential adversaries technologically, with a platform that can operate effectively across a range of missions in increasingly complex and contested environments. The Unit Deployment Program, under which VMFA-214 is operating, has long been a crucial element in maintaining a rotational presence in the Indo-Pacific. The program ensures that U.S. forces gain invaluable experience in the region while maintaining a visible and continuous presence. This ongoing rotation of forces is particularly important given the geopolitical instability in the region and the need for the U.S. to remain agile in its response to evolving threats. The F-35B’s capabilities in areas such as networked warfare, sensor fusion, and rapid mobility further solidify the strategic value of the UDP, offering the U.S. the flexibility to respond quickly to contingencies, wherever they may arise. The F-35B's deployment also carries broader geopolitical and diplomatic significance. By reinforcing its military presence in Japan, the U.S. signals its unwavering commitment to the security of its allies in the Indo-Pacific. Japan, a critical partner in the region, plays a key role in the U.S.'s strategy for containing Chinese expansionism and ensuring regional stability. The presence of advanced American airpower strengthens Japan’s defense capabilities while reinforcing the bilateral defense relationship between the two nations. As China continues to expand its military presence and assert its influence in the South China Sea, the U.S. must ensure that its forces remain capable of meeting emerging threats head-on. The F-35B’s deployment to Japan provides the U.S. with an additional layer of defense and a powerful tool for maintaining peace and stability in the region. The deployment of VMFA-214’s F-35B squadron to Japan is more than just a tactical maneuver—it represents a major shift in U.S. military operations in the Indo-Pacific. The integration of fifth-generation aircraft like the F-35B enhances the U.S. Marine Corps' ability to project power across the region, collaborate with allied forces, and maintain air superiority in an increasingly contested environment. The flexibility and advanced capabilities of the F-35B ensure that U.S. forces remain at the cutting edge of modern warfare, ready to meet any challenge that arises in the region. As the U.S. continues to adapt to the changing security landscape, this deployment stands as a clear signal of its resolve to maintain its strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific, reinforce its commitments to its allies, and ensure regional stability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-us-marine-corps-deploys-first-f-35b-fighter-squadron-to-japan-to-boost-airpower-in-indo-pacific	2025-03-08T11:10:01-08:00

This submarine is expected to enhance North Korea’s nuclear deterrence, providing it with a powerful second-strike capability.Military experts from South Korea suggest that the new nuclear-powered SLBM submarine is likely to be a 6,000-ton or 7,000-ton class vessel, capable of carrying around 10 ballistic missiles. According to Moon Keun-sik, a South Korean submarine expert from Seoul’s Hanyang University, the term 'strategic guided missiles' used by North Korean officials indicates that these missiles would be nuclear-capable. This makes the submarine a crucial element of North Korea's growing nuclear arsenal, capable of delivering long-range, devastating retaliatory strikes even after a preemptive attack on land-based assets. North Korea’s new nuclear-powered SLBM submarine marks a significant evolution in its naval forces, which have long relied on smaller, diesel-powered submarines. As of Military Balance 2024, the North Korean Navy boasts a fleet of 71 submarines, which include various models designed for different strategic and tactical roles. Notable among these are the SSB 1 8.24 Yongung (Gorae), a submarine involved in SLBM trials, and several others with specialized capabilities, such as cruise missile submarines (SSC) and attack submarines (SSK). The North Korean fleet includes several key types of submarines designed for distinct operational needs. The SSB (Strategic Submersible Ballistic) class submarines, such as the Gorae-class, are specifically designed to carry and launch submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Gorae-class, for instance, has been used in trials for North Korea's Pukguksong-1 SLBM. North Korea also operates SSK (attack submarines), like the Type-033 (Romeo-class), which are equipped with torpedo tubes for anti-ship and anti-submarine warfare. In addition, the country fields SSC (cruise missile submarines), which are equipped to launch cruise missiles, with some variations carrying 533mm torpedo tubes or 53-65E heavy-weight torpedoes. Lastly, North Korea also operates SSW (specialized or small submarines), such as the Yugo and Yeono-class, which are often used for specialized missions and can carry various types of torpedoes. The addition of the nuclear-powered SLBM submarine will significantly enhance North Korea's ability to conduct strategic deterrence operations. Unlike diesel-electric submarines, nuclear-powered submarines can remain submerged for much longer periods, making them harder to detect and therefore improving their survivability in a potential conflict. The SLBM capability also gives North Korea a second-strike nuclear deterrent, ensuring the ability to launch a devastating retaliatory attack even if its land-based nuclear assets are destroyed in an initial strike. The term SLBM (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile) refers to a missile launched from a submerged submarine. These missiles are essential for any nation aiming to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent, as they provide the ability to retaliate against adversaries from beneath the ocean’s surface. This ensures a secure second-strike capability, even if other nuclear assets are neutralized. North Korea’s Pukguksong-1 SLBM, tested from its Gorae-class submarine, is an example of the technology Pyongyang has developed. These SLBMs, capable of striking distant targets, give North Korea a powerful and mobile nuclear deterrent. The new nuclear-powered SLBM submarine will further enhance the effectiveness of North Korea’s deterrent force, increasing its operational range and survivability in a potential conflict. Experts suggest that Russia may have played a significant role in helping North Korea advance towards developing nuclear-powered submarines. Moscow has long been a key supplier of military technology to North Korea, including missile systems and nuclear technology. The assistance of Russian-designed nuclear reactors and submarine systems is believed to have been instrumental in overcoming the technical challenges associated with creating a nuclear-powered submarine capable of launching SLBMs. The introduction of a nuclear-powered SLBM submarine represents a pivotal development in North Korea's military strategy. It allows the country to expand its reach and resilience, providing a reliable and mobile platform for nuclear retaliation. This capability ensures North Korea can survive and strike back even in the highly contested waters of the Pacific. With SLBMs, the new submarine strengthens North Korea’s strategic deterrence, presenting new challenges for regional powers, especially the U.S. and South Korea, who must now account for this enhanced capability in their defense planning. This move also signals North Korea's growing ambitions in undersea warfare, as the nation continues to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal. The integration of SLBMs into a nuclear-powered submarine brings North Korea closer to parity with other nuclear powers possessing similar capabilities, further solidifying its position as a formidable military presence in the Pacific and beyond. North Korea's unveiling of its nuclear-powered SLBM submarine is a significant step in its ongoing efforts to bolster its nuclear deterrence and strengthen its naval capabilities. With technological assistance from Russia and an expanding fleet of advanced submarines, this new vessel will play a crucial role in North Korea's ability to project power and maintain strategic stability in the region. As these developments continue, the potential for increased tensions in the Pacific region grows, with North Korea’s enhanced ability to deter and retaliate against adversaries through its nuclear-powered submarine and SLBM capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-north-korea-unveils-first-locally-made-nuclear-powered-submarine-posing-threats-to-us-asia	2025-03-08T10:08:25-08:00

(Picture source: British MoD) The Type 83 is expected to be larger and more advanced than its predecessor, and serve both as a conventional guided-missile destroyer and an air defense destroyer. Its primary mission will be to provide integrated air and missile defense against various threats, including hypersonic missiles. Government updates have described FADS as a multi-domain initiative designed to enhance UK defense capabilities across air, land, and maritime operations. In December 2024, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) conducted a Market Engagement Event (MEE) to collect industry input on the project’s direction, evaluating marketplace capabilities and challenges. Further industry engagement is scheduled for 2025 as the Royal Navy refines its requirements. Concept images released in 2023 suggest the Type 83 may be larger than the Type 45, with a size comparable to the US Navy’s Zumwalt-class or China’s Type 055 destroyers. Although exact specifications remain undisclosed, the Type 83 is anticipated to incorporate next-generation radar and sensor systems, possibly including an advanced phased array radar suite. The ship is also expected to be equipped with Mk 41 vertical launch systems (VLS) for air defense, land attack, and anti-ship missiles. Additionally, it may feature a power generation system capable of supporting directed energy weapons such as high-energy lasers or railguns. The projected timeline for the Type 83 indicates an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in the late 2030s or early 2040s. The exact number of ships to be built remains uncertain, as past UK defense procurement programs have often resulted in fewer vessels than initially planned. Future decisions regarding fleet composition are expected to be determined through a Strategic Defence Review later in the decade. The location of the Type 83’s construction is another unresolved factor. While the government has expressed support for domestic shipbuilding, no official confirmation has been made regarding the shipyard responsible for the program. Minister Maria Eagle stated that the decision remains subject to commercial considerations, but she noted that the project will sustain employment in the UK defense sector until at least the mid-2040s, depending on the number of ships constructed. The MoD has committed to analyzing supply chain involvement and social value aspects during the concept phase to ensure the support of UK-based defense manufacturing. Several design concepts have been proposed, including a large cruiser-like vessel with an expanded missile payload, an arsenal ship with a reduced crew requirement, and an air-warfare variant derived from the Type 26 frigate. Each approach presents trade-offs in terms of cost, capability, and operational flexibility. Parallel developments in sensor technology, such as the potential integration of the Aegis combat system or UK-developed radar systems, could influence final design decisions.

(Picture source: British MoD) The Type 45 destroyers currently serve as the Royal Navy’s primary air defense platform, with plans for their retirement by 2038. To maintain operational effectiveness until the Type 83 enters service, the Type 45s are undergoing upgrades, including the integration of the Sea Ceptor missile system. However, concerns remain over whether the replacement schedule will maintain the required number of air defense platforms. Historically, UK naval procurement programs have seen reductions in planned fleet numbers, and similar risks could impact the Type 83 program. The Future Air Dominance System (FADS) is designed as a system-of-systems, with Type 83 destroyers expected to operate alongside NATO allies, the Queen Elizabeth-class carrier air wing, and other maritime and land-based assets. Preliminary discussions have indicated that the ships may act as motherships for new sensors and autonomous vessels, potentially expanding their role beyond traditional air defense. The MoD has also confirmed that the Type 83 will be equipped to counter hypersonic missile threats. Former Chief of the Defence Staff General Nick Carter has previously highlighted the necessity of these destroyers, emphasizing that the Type 45s currently provide the UK’s only long-range air defense capability against cruise and ballistic missile threats. The final number of Type 83s to be constructed is yet to be determined and will be influenced by the upcoming Strategic Defence Review. Uncertainty also surrounds the industrial strategy for the Type 83 program. Multiple UK shipyards are competing for the contract, and the MoD has yet to decide whether the vessels will be constructed at a single facility or distributed across multiple sites. The government has reaffirmed its commitment to sustaining domestic shipbuilding jobs, with officials indicating that the program will generate employment opportunities through at least the mid-2040s. Challenges related to recruitment and resource management within the Royal Navy have raised concerns about whether the number of Type 83s procured will be sufficient to maintain current operational capabilities. Previous trends suggest that projected fleet sizes often decrease over time, which could lead to capability gaps in the UK’s air defense structure if the Type 83 program does not meet planned targets.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/focus-british-type-83-destroyer-moves-towards-the-development-phase-to-strengthen-naval-air-defense	2025-03-06T05:10:34-08:00

Unlike previous unmanned surface vessels, which were often modified versions of existing crewed ships, this vessel was designed from the ground up without any provisions for human presence. It lacks berths, kitchens, or survival equipment, freeing up significant space for payloads while reducing construction and operational costs. This design focuses on hydrodynamic efficiency, operational stealth, and resilience against environmental conditions and adversarial threats. Initiated in 2020, the NOMARS program aims to develop a medium unmanned surface vessel with a reliability rate of 90 percent over a one-year deployment period. Defiant is scheduled to begin dockside evaluations in spring 2025 before embarking on a multi-month sea demonstration. These trials will assess its endurance, navigational autonomy, and ability to be refueled at sea, a critical factor for long-duration missions. In September 2024, a previous test involving the Mariner and Ranger unmanned vessels demonstrated Serco’s capability for autonomous refueling, a key feature for extended operations in contested environments. Serco was awarded the NOMARS contract in 2022 over Leidos Gibbs &amp; Cox as part of the Pentagon’s broader effort to expand unmanned naval capabilities. Interest in these platforms has grown, particularly in the Pacific theater, where the U.S. Navy is considering their deployment in potential conflict scenarios. Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, has outlined a strategic concept known as 'Hellscape,' in which swarms of unmanned vessels would be used to disrupt military operations, particularly in the Taiwan Strait. Technologically, the Defiant is designed to support modular payloads, including potential weapons systems. While DARPA has only released images of the ship covered with a tarp, conceptual models from Serco indicate that it could be equipped with a BAE Adaptable Deck Launcher and a modular payload container. A larger variant, envisioned for future large unmanned surface vessels, could include four modular launchers with up to sixteen Mark 41 vertical launch cells, significantly enhancing its operational flexibility. One of the key challenges of autonomous systems has been cost, as uncrewed platforms have often remained as expensive as their manned counterparts despite removing the need for personnel. The NOMARS program seeks to address this issue by developing a vessel that is not only autonomous but also cost-effective in production and deployment. Ryan Maatta, Serco’s chief marine engineer and deputy program manager for DARPA, highlighted in an interview that Defiant is designed to lower mission costs while increasing payload capacity, making it a more efficient alternative to traditional manned platforms. The absence of a crew also raises new considerations for safety and maintenance. In case of fire, for example, the ship could be equipped with an automated gas-based fire suppression system, a method unsuitable for manned vessels but effective on unmanned platforms. This approach aligns with the NOMARS program’s objective of redefining naval architecture with solutions optimized for autonomous operations. With the launch of the Defiant, DARPA and Serco are entering a critical phase of the NOMARS program. The upcoming months will be decisive in validating the concept and proving its operational viability. If the trials are successful, this technology could lay the groundwork for a new class of cost-effective unmanned vessels capable of sustained operations with unprecedented availability, potentially reshaping the U.S. Navy’s maritime strategy in response to future challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/darpas-first-fully-autonomous-usx-1-defiant-vessel-enters-testing-phase	2025-03-05T06:09:00-08:00

North Korea to soon deploy its first airborne early warning aircraft based on a Russian IL-76	As reported by 38 North on March 4, 2025, North Korea appears to be nearing completion of its first airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft, representing an expansion of its air force capabilities. Satellite imagery analysis indicates that a modified Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft has been stationed at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport, with a large radome mounted on its fuselage.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Converting an IL-76 into an AEW platform requires expertise in radar integration, airborne networking, and electronic warfare, areas in which North Korea has limited experience. (Picture source: Airbus Defence &amp; Space and 38 North via Decker Eveleth/Twitter) The radome features a triangular shape, a design seen on Chinese KJ-2000 and KJ-500 AEW aircraft, which typically house three fixed phased array radars covering 120-degree sectors each. While this configuration suggests a possible Chinese influence, there is no definitive evidence confirming direct external support. The IL-76 was previously part of Air Koryo’s cargo fleet before being transferred to a maintenance facility in October 2023, where security fences were installed around it. Structural modifications began in November 2023, prompting speculation regarding its conversion into an AEW platform. By late 2024, visible progress had been made, and the aircraft was moved into an adjacent hangar. In February 2025, it reappeared with a mounted radome, providing the clearest indication yet of North Korea’s efforts to develop an AEW system. However, state media has not acknowledged the project. According to Decker Eveleth, the development of an AEW aircraft would allow North Korea to detect low-flying threats such as cruise missiles, which its existing Soviet-era ground-based radar systems struggle to track due to the country’s mountainous terrain and the curvature of the Earth. Airborne radar coverage would improve North Korea’s situational awareness and potentially enhance its air defense network. However, the effectiveness of such a system depends on its integration with existing command and control infrastructure. AEW platforms require advanced networking capabilities and real-time data-sharing systems, the availability of which in North Korea remains uncertain. Analysts have raised questions regarding possible foreign involvement in the modification process. Satellite imagery from late 2023 revealed structural changes that resemble AEW modifications observed in Russian and Chinese aircraft. No conclusive evidence exists to confirm Russian assistance, but reports indicate increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. Since North Korea began supplying artillery shells and other military aid to Russia during the Ukraine conflict, speculation has grown that Pyongyang could be receiving technical support or surplus military equipment in return, including components relevant to AEW capabilities. North Korea’s use of the Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft began in 1993 when Air Koryo acquired three IL-76TDs for freight transport to and from China and Russia. These aircraft remain in service and are registered as P-912, P-913, and P-914. Air Koryo’s Il-76s have been cited in reports alleging their involvement in transporting cargo associated with North Korea’s military programs, including missile components, in violation of United Nations sanctions. In 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated 16 Air Koryo aircraft, including its Il-76s, for their association with North Korea’s transportation sector and potential links to weapons proliferation. North Korea’s use of the Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft began in 1993 when Air Koryo acquired three IL-76TDs for freight transport to and from China and Russia. (Picture source: LiuXiaHui/RussianPlanes.net) While primarily operated for cargo transport, at least one Il-76 has been photographed in a military camouflage scheme, leading to speculation about its use beyond commercial freight operations. Despite international restrictions, these aircraft remain an integral part of North Korea’s air logistics capabilities, particularly given the country’s reliance on Soviet-era aircraft and its limited access to newer models due to sanctions. Recent reports suggest that Russia has agreed to supply North Korea with MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets in exchange for the deployment of North Korean personnel to Russia. According to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel Paparo, approximately 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, though they have not yet participated in combat operations. This agreement aligns with broader patterns of increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, with indications that Pyongyang may also seek additional technological transfers, including missile re-entry vehicles, submarine technologies, and upgraded air defense systems. North Korea’s air force operates a fleet of aging Soviet-era aircraft with limited modernization due to sanctions and resource constraints. The inventory primarily consists of MiG-21s, MiG-23s, Su-25s, and a small number of MiG-29s. The acquisition of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters would expand its air force’s capabilities, though it would still remain behind South Korea’s technologically advanced air fleet, which includes F-35 and F-15K fighters. North Korea’s AEW initiative aligns with its broader intelligence-gathering objectives, which include increased investments in space-based reconnaissance through satellite deployments. A functional AEW platform would complement these efforts by providing airborne surveillance, potentially improving Pyongyang’s ability to monitor foreign military activities and coordinate its own operations. Significant challenges remain in fully operationalizing an AEW aircraft. Converting an IL-76 into an AEW platform requires expertise in radar integration, airborne networking, and electronic warfare, areas in which North Korea has limited experience. Additionally, AEW platforms require continuous operation to maintain surveillance coverage, and a single modified IL-76 would provide only intermittent capability. Expanding the AEW fleet would require additional modifications or foreign assistance to sustain operational readiness. The introduction of an AEW system in North Korea has implications for regional security. While it may enhance Pyongyang’s ability to track military activities, it also raises concerns about potential misinterpretation of intelligence and an increased risk of escalation. Analysts caution that while an AEW system could improve situational awareness, it might also lead to miscalculations if North Korea interprets routine military exercises as a threat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/north-korea-to-soon-deploy-its-first-airborne-early-warning-aircraft-based-on-a-russian-il-76	2025-03-05T03:48:40-08:00

One of the central themes of AMPHIBEX is the enhancement of interoperability between different military forces. Each participating nation brings its unique capabilities and equipment, making coordination vital. For example, the Republic of Korea Army’s K-55 howitzer, which was showcased in the amphibious exercise, is a key asset for providing indirect fire support during amphibious landings. Its integration into the exercise exemplifies how modern military platforms, despite coming from different countries, can work together seamlessly. Moreover, Thailand's naval and air forces, combined with the U.S. Marines' amphibious assault vehicles and the Singaporean artillery support, demonstrate the importance of multinational coordination in operations that could involve large-scale humanitarian aid or military intervention in conflict zones. This is particularly important in a region that remains vulnerable to flashpoints, ranging from territorial disputes to larger power struggles. The interoperability forged in exercises like Cobra Gold is not limited to military engagements. These drills also foster a deeper understanding between armed forces, enabling more effective disaster relief operations in the event of natural disasters, which are frequent in the region. This multifaceted collaboration enhances not only military capability but also collective resilience to non-combat challenges. The Asia-Pacific region is facing increasing geopolitical and security challenges, particularly with respect to territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the broader competition for influence between global powers. Exercises such as AMPHIBEX and Cobra Gold are key to strengthening military alliances and enhancing the ability of U.S. and regional forces to respond to aggressive actions and humanitarian crises alike. The region's reliance on maritime trade makes it a strategic crossroads for the global economy and security. For this reason, ensuring that regional partners can perform joint amphibious operations effectively is paramount.

Russia restarts TVD-10 engine production to modernize the An-2 biplane aircraft in service since 1947	As reported by TASS on February 27, 2025, Russia has announced plans to restart production of the TVD-10 turboprop engine, originally developed in the Soviet Union, to support the modernization of the Antonov An-2 Kukuruznik biplane aircraft, which was introduced in 1947. Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Anton Alikhanov confirmed the decision, stating that these engines will be used to re-engine An-2 aircraft, with potential future applications for additional modernization.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The An-2, a single-engine biplane, was developed in response to a Soviet Ministry of Forestry requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Polikarpov Po-2 and made its first flight on August 31, 1947. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Siberian Scientific Research Institute of Aviation (SibNIA) plans to have a prototype An-2 equipped with the TVD-10B engine by the summer of this year, while the production of the engine is set to be re-established in Omsk. The decision follows delays in the availability of the VK-800 engine developed at UZGA, which led to the continuation of the older TVD-10 model to ensure aircraft operability at least until 2030, when the LMS-901 Baikal light multipurpose aircraft is expected to enter full-scale production. Originally, the VK-800 project began in 2008 to power various Russian aircraft, including the Ansat and Ka-226 helicopters, but faced numerous challenges, leading to a near halt in progress for about a decade. A renewed effort commenced around 2018-2019 to adapt the engine for the Baikal aircraft. Despite these efforts, the engine's certification is now anticipated by the end of 2025, with serial production expected to begin in 2026. These delays have impacted the timeline for the Baikal aircraft's mass production, which was initially planned for early 2024 but has been postponed. The postponement is further complicated by a substantial increase in the aircraft's projected cost, rising from an initial estimate of 120 million rubles to approximately 445 million rubles per unit. The TVD-10 turboprop engine was developed in 1965 by the Omsk Engine Design Bureau (OMKB) based on the GTD-3F engine used in the Ka-25 helicopter. The engine was designed for regional passenger aircraft and features a free turbine and a remote gearbox. Its takeoff power is 1,025 horsepower, with a propeller power output of 960 horsepower. The engine's fuel consumption rate at takeoff is 0.255 kg/hp per hour. Serial production of the TVD-10 began in 1969, with the engine primarily installed on aircraft such as the Beriev Be-30. In the 1980s and 1990s, the TVD-10 was produced in Poland at the VSK-Rzeszow and VSK-Kalisz plants, with approximately 500 units manufactured. Since 1992, OMKB has conducted maintenance and overhaul operations, repairing 190 engines by 2004 under AP-145 and FAP-145 certification standards. The TVD-10B is a modification of the TVD-10, designed for re-engining the An-2. It retains the same structural features as its predecessor, with a takeoff power of 1,025 horsepower and a dry weight of 230 kilograms. The engine is designed to operate for up to 10,000 hours, with an inter-repair resource of 2,000 hours and a time between overhauls of 1,500 hours. In Poland, the TVD-10B was produced in serial quantities, and with its reintroduction in Russia, it will continue to be used for maintaining and modernizing An-2 aircraft. The Siberian Scientific Research Institute of Aviation (SibNIA) plans to have a prototype An-2 equipped with the TVD-10B engine by the summer of this year, while the production of the engine is set to be re-established in Omsk. (Picture source: Russian social media) The An-2 has been used by Russian military forces since its introduction, fulfilling roles in transport, airborne training, and other logistical operations. During the Soviet period, it was widely utilized by the Airborne Troops, with dedicated squadrons assigned to divisions such as the 106th, 105th, 104th, 7th, 103rd, 76th, and 31st Guards Airborne Divisions. The aircraft remained in military service following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, continuing its role in airborne training. In 2024, Russian conscripts of the Airborne Troops conducted jumps from an An-2 at the Klokovo airfield in the Tula region. The personnel used D-10 main parachutes and Z-5 reserve parachutes, jumping from a height of 1,000 meters at a speed of approximately 160 km/h with a three-second separation interval. The exercise, which included parachute training and tactical drills, resulted in over 500 jumps by the Tula Guards Airborne Unit. The An-2, known as 'Annushka' and 'Kukuruznik' in Russia and designated 'Colt' by NATO, was developed in response to a Soviet Ministry of Forestry requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Polikarpov Po-2. The Antonov Design Bureau, under the direction of Oleg Antonov, designed the aircraft, with the prototype, initially designated SKhA-1, making its first flight on August 31, 1947. Testing continued through 1947 and 1948, and the aircraft was formally accepted into service as the An-2. It was produced for applications in agriculture, transport, aerial firefighting, and airborne operations. Some aircraft have accumulated flight hours exceeding 20,000. Production of the An-2 occurred in multiple locations, with more than 18,000 units built between 1947 and 2002. Initial manufacturing took place at Plant No. 473 in Kyiv, followed by large-scale production at WSK PZL-Mielec in Poland, where approximately 11,915 units were produced between 1960 and 2002. Additional production was conducted in China under the designation Yunshuji Y-5, with some sources indicating continued manufacturing. The aircraft was exported to 26 countries and remains in service in Russia, China, and other states. As of 2012, 1,580 An-2 aircraft were listed as operational in Russia, with 322 considered airworthy. Other fleets included 290 aircraft in Kazakhstan, 135 in Ukraine, 143 in Uzbekistan, 89 in Turkmenistan, 82 in Belarus, 63 in Azerbaijan, 30 in Kyrgyzstan, 13 in Moldova, and 6 in Armenia.

US Pennsylvania National Guard to receive 324 new Stryker Double V-hull vehicles to increase crew protection	On March 3, 2025, the Pennsylvania National Guard began receiving upgraded Strykers double-V hull (DVH) and Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs) as part of a modernization effort for the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT). The 56th SBCT is scheduled to receive 324 upgraded Stryker vehicles and 300 JLTVs to replace its flat-bottom-hull Strykers and M1097 HMMWVs with models that provide improved protection and operational capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The double-V hull (DVH) upgrade was developed to address vulnerabilities observed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where underbody improvised explosive device (IED) attacks posed a significant threat. (Picture source: Pennsylvania National Guard) The first batch of 25 Strykers has arrived at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, where they will be used for training before being assigned to units. All JLTVs will be received at Fort Indiantown Gap before distribution. The final allocation of the remaining Strykers is still being determined. A 'train-the-trainer' program is planned for March to familiarize personnel with the new vehicles, alongside a field-level maintenance course focused on sustainment and servicing requirements. The double-V hull (DVH) upgrade was developed to address vulnerabilities observed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where underbody improvised explosive device (IED) attacks posed a significant threat. The design incorporates a modified lower hull that redirects blast energy away from the vehicle to reduce structural damage and the likelihood of casualties. Combat data from Afghanistan indicated that DVH-equipped Strykers were more resistant to these threats compared to flat-bottom models. Col. Christopher Costello, commander of the 56th SBCT, noted that the DVH configuration resulted in a measurable decrease in injuries among vehicle occupants following IED incidents. The DVH configuration includes structural reinforcements, blast-attenuating seats, an armored driver’s station, and upgraded armor protection. Additional modifications involve an improved suspension and driveline to compensate for the increased vehicle weight. Testing and analysis have confirmed that the DVH offers enhanced protection against IEDs and blast threats while maintaining mobility and operational effectiveness. The design improvements stem from lessons learned in previous deployments, where flat-bottom Strykers exhibited higher casualty rates. The revised hull shape is engineered to dissipate explosive forces more effectively to mitigate damage. The double-V hull serves as the basis for multiple Stryker variants, including the Infantry Carrier Vehicle-Scout (ICVV-S), Mortar Carrier Vehicle (MCVV), Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEVV), and Anti-Tank Guided Missile Vehicle (ATVV). The Army has not procured DVH versions of the Mobile Gun System or Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle but continues to field a range of configurations to enhance Stryker Brigade Combat Team capabilities. Classified evaluations have validated that the DVH provides increased protection against underbody threats while preserving mission effectiveness. Additional improvements under the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) program include a 450-horsepower engine, a 910-amp alternator for increased electrical output, and a reinforced suspension to support heavier vehicle loads. Enhanced situational awareness systems and networking capabilities have been integrated to meet evolving operational requirements. The Army aims to implement the DVH-A1 standard across all Stryker Brigades, incorporating new weapon systems such as the M153A4 CROWS-J and the 30mm XM813 Chain Gun-equipped turrets. The modernization effort is planned to continue into the 2030s to sustain the Stryker’s role in the Army’s combat vehicle fleet.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-pennsylvania-national-guard-to-receive-324-new-stryker-double-v-hull-vehicles-to-increase-crew-protection	2025-03-05T01:39:41-08:00

Japan to Establish Second F-35B Fighters Squadron by 2030 Strengthening Amphibious Cooperation with US Marines	According to a Japanese Ministry of Defense document reported by USNI News on March 4, 2025, Japan will establish a second F-35 B squadron by the end of the decade. This initiative includes adjustments to the training schedule due to a three-year delay in the completion of the planned airbase on Mageshima Island, which is intended to serve as the fleet's primary training facility. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-35B Lightning II executes a vertical landing aboard Japan Maritime Self-Defense Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga during a developmental test on November 2, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Last week, the Kyushu Defense Bureau of the Ministry of Defense released an explanatory document outlining revisions to the training plan. The ministry’s regional offices regularly provide such updates when military activities may impact local populations. A detailed table outlining the expected number of monthly vertical landing training sessions at Nyutabaru Air Base, located on Kyushu's main island, confirms the formation of a second F-35B squadron by fiscal year 2029, bringing the total number of stationed aircraft at the base to approximately 30. Japan currently plans to establish a temporary F-35B squadron at Nyutabaru by the end of March while awaiting the delivery of the first batch of six aircraft from the planned total of 42. The F-35B Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole fighter equipped with short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability, enabling operations from small ships, roads, and remote bases. Developed for the US Marine Corps as well as the British and Italian forces, it combines stealth, supersonic speed, and operational versatility. Its propulsion system features a Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine and a shaft-driven LiftFan, allowing vertical landing maneuvers while maintaining high flight performance. With a maximum speed of 1,600 km/h and a range of 1,667 km, the F-35B is designed for rapid deployment in conflict zones, reducing reliance on traditional airbases and increasing operational tempo. In terms of armament, the F-35B carries more than 15,000 pounds of ordnance, with an internal weapons bay optimized for stealth or external pylons for maximum payload. It is equipped with the GAU-22/A 25mm cannon and a range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Its advanced avionics include the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, the AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system, and the MADL secure communication system, ensuring effective battlefield connectivity. Protection is enhanced by the AN/AAQ-37 DAS, providing 360-degree threat awareness. These features make the F-35B a key asset for naval and amphibious operations. While the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force operates fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) will be responsible for the F-35Bs, complementing the F-35A fleet already in service. Japan’s acquisition plan includes 105 F-35A and 42 F-35B aircraft. According to projections, eight F-35Bs will be operational by 2025, increasing to 30 with the establishment of the second squadron in 2029. By 2031, the fleet is expected to comprise 40 F-35Bs. Initially, the plan was to station the F-35Bs at Nyutabaru Air Base without conducting vertical landings except in emergencies. However, a review determined that the Mageshima airbase would not be completed until the end of fiscal year 2029. Due to the inability to conduct training there as planned, the Ministry of Defense revised its decision to allow vertical landing training at Nyutabaru. Mageshima, uninhabited since 1980, is located approximately 40 kilometers south of Kyushu’s main island. The Japanese government purchased it in 2019 to develop an airbase for the JASDF, which will also serve as a facility for US Navy and Marine Corps aircraft to conduct simulated carrier landing practice, replacing the current site at Iwo Jima. Additionally, it will function as an operational base for the defense of Japan’s southwestern islands. Construction began in January 2023 and was initially expected to be completed in 2027. However, in September 2024, the Ministry of Defense announced that completion had been pushed back to March 2030 due to material shortages and labor constraints. At a press conference last Friday, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that the ministry had informed local authorities through the Kyushu Defense Bureau and planned to hold explanatory meetings with residents. Military installations and activities in Japan are frequently located near populated areas, often leading to concerns among residents. Regarding the F-35B training at Nyutabaru, local concerns primarily relate to noise pollution. The explanatory document noted that noise from vertical landings would last for three minutes, citing a 2013 US study that measured a peak noise level of 130 decibels at 75 meters from the landing point and 110 decibels at 300 meters. Japan’s F-35B vertical landing training program includes four types: emergency landings, aircraft type conversion, and proficiency maintenance, landings on non-ship surfaces, and simulated carrier landings. The first three will be conducted at Nyutabaru, while the fourth will only take place at Mageshima once the necessary shipboard landing simulation infrastructure is in place. As Japan integrates the F-35B, other branches of its military are familiarizing themselves with its operations, particularly amphibious units. From February 3 to 6, the commanding officers of the three Amphibious Rapid Deployment Regiments (ARDB) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force observed flight operations aboard the USS America (LHA-6). This visit was part of a broader engagement with the America Amphibious Ready Group and the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. The objective of this cooperation is to enhance interoperability between US and Japanese forces. Several briefings and planning sessions were held between the commanders of the respective units to strengthen coordination for joint operations. This initiative is part of a larger effort to bolster military ties between the US Marine Corps, the US Navy, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Colonel Chris Niedziocha, commander of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, highlighted the significance of the visit, noting that the simultaneous presence of all three ARDB regiment commanders underscored Japan’s commitment to cooperation with US Marines. He also emphasized the strategic importance of such coordination in the Indo-Pacific, stating that joint actions send a clear signal against coercive or destabilizing activities in the region. As Japan continues to expand its fifth-generation air combat capabilities, the integration of the F-35B into its air force and its coordination with amphibious units represent a strategic shift. The delay in the completion of Mageshima presents logistical challenges, but the Ministry of Defense has adjusted training plans accordingly. Intending to deploy 40 F-35Bs by 2031 and enhance interoperability with US forces, Japan is positioning itself to strengthen its defense posture in response to regional security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-to-establish-second-f-35b-fighters-squadron-by-2030-strengthening-amphibious-cooperation-with-us-marines	2025-03-05T01:20:43-08:00	
US Air Force to deploy the OA-1K Skyraider II as the new primary light attack aircraft for special operations	On February 27, 2025, the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) designated its newest light attack aircraft, the AT-802U Sky Warden, as the OA-1K Skyraider II. Developed under the U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Armed Overwatch program, the aircraft is based on the Air Tractor AT-802 and modified by L3Harris for close air support, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The designation references the Cold War-era A-1 Skyraider, widely used during the Vietnam War.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The OA-1K Skyraider II is derived from the Air Tractor AT-802U Sky Warden, a militarized version of the AT-802 agricultural and firefighting aircraft. (Picture source: AFSOC) Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, AFSOC commander, announced the designation at the Global SOF Foundation’s Special Air Warfare Symposium in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Conley stated that the OA-1K Skyraider II is designed for multiple mission sets, including ISR, close air support, and precision strikes. He emphasized the aircraft’s modularity, allowing it to be reconfigured for different missions. He also noted its capability for rapid deployment, as it can be disassembled for transport inside a C-17 cargo aircraft and reassembled within a day. Conley highlighted that as operators gain experience with the aircraft, its role may evolve beyond initial mission requirements. Brig. Gen. Craig Prather, AFSOC’s director of Strategic Plans, Programs, and Requirements, explained that while the Skyraider II is not intended to engage advanced fighter aircraft, it provides support to special operations forces in low-threat environments. Addressing criticism of its propeller-driven design, he stated that the aircraft’s long loiter time, maneuverability, and adaptability make it effective for its intended role. The OA-1K is equipped with precision-guided munitions, air-to-ground missiles, and electro-optical/infrared sensors. Prather also pointed out that its lower operating cost and ability to provide immediate fire support make it a practical asset for missions requiring persistent overwatch. SOCOM originally planned to procure 75 OA-1K aircraft under a $3 billion contract awarded to L3Harris in August 2022. However, following a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review, the procurement target was reduced to 62 aircraft. The GAO questioned the necessity of such a large fleet after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, where persistent air support was a key requirement. SOCOM officials maintain that the aircraft remains essential for operations in environments where modern jet fighters are unnecessary. The Armed Overwatch program aims to provide sustained ISR and close air support capabilities in regions where higher-cost platforms may be less efficient. AFSOC expects to receive its first operational OA-1K at Hurlburt Field, Florida, in the coming weeks. Two unmodified AT-802 aircraft were delivered in 2024 for pilot familiarization. The 17th Special Operations Squadron is conducting training at Will Rogers Air National Guard Base in Oklahoma. The OA-1K is expected to replace the U-28A Draco, enhancing endurance and operational flexibility for special operations missions. It is scheduled to achieve initial operational capability in 2026, with full fleet delivery expected by 2029. The introduction of the Skyraider II aligns with the Air Force’s plan to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt II, a long-serving close air support aircraft. While the A-10 is known for its survivability and firepower, its phase-out has been contested by those who argue that modern jets cannot fully replace its role. AFSOC officials indicate that the OA-1K can fill a niche in providing close air support in low-threat environments at a lower operational cost. The aircraft is expected to complement other platforms in missions that require rapid deployment to austere locations. The original A-1 Skyraider was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company, introduced in 1946, and was extensively used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. (Picture source: US DoD) L3Harris is exploring additional capabilities for the Skyraider II beyond its light attack and reconnaissance role, including electronic warfare and signals intelligence. The aircraft’s ability to operate from short and unimproved airstrips allows for rapid deployment and crisis response missions. L3Harris has demonstrated that the OA-1K can be disassembled within six hours for transport inside a C-17, enabling global deployment with minimal logistical requirements. Interest in the Skyraider II has extended beyond the U.S., with L3Harris confirming export approval for 22 potential foreign buyers and an additional 15 countries under review. This indicates demand for a cost-effective armed overwatch capability. The OA-1K Skyraider II is derived from the Air Tractor AT-802U Sky Warden, a militarized version of the AT-802 agricultural and firefighting aircraft. The AT-802U was designed for ISR and strike missions in permissive airspace, particularly for counter-insurgency operations. Its rugged construction allows it to operate from austere airstrips with minimal logistical support, a key requirement for special operations forces. The aircraft was selected under the Armed Overwatch program to provide persistent, armed ISR capability while reducing reliance on higher-maintenance platforms. The Skyraider II is equipped with ten external hardpoints capable of carrying a range of precision-guided munitions, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and APKWS laser-guided rockets. It has a maximum speed of 245 miles per hour at 10,000 feet and a range of 1,500 miles at 8,000 feet. The aircraft features a reinforced steel cockpit, self-sealing fuel tanks, and a five-point harness system with airbags. It does not include ejection seats. Its armor protection consists of lightweight composite ballistic shielding around the engine and cockpit, and the airframe is built for an extended operational lifespan with low maintenance requirements. The original A-1 Skyraider was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company and introduced in 1946. It was extensively used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. As a carrier-based attack aircraft, it was designed to carry heavy ordnance loads and provide close air support. The A-1 was particularly noted for its ability to escort search and rescue missions and remain over a battlefield for extended periods. It was eventually replaced by jet-powered platforms. The OA-1K Skyraider II continues this operational concept by adapting similar capabilities for modern special operations requirements, ensuring sustained ISR and close air support in permissive environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-air-force-to-deploy-the-oa-1k-skyraider-ii-as-the-new-primary-light-attack-aircraft-for-special-operations	2025-03-05T01:06:13-08:00

The drone is equipped with a jet engine, enabling it to achieve high speeds and conduct precision strikes. The IRGC considers it a significant addition to its aerial capabilities, complementing its existing fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles. The JAS 313 underwent its first test flight on February 6 aboard the Martyr Baqeri, a drone carrier that joined the IRGC Navy fleet last month. This warship was designed as a mobile maritime platform for deploying drones and helicopters across various operational areas. Iranian authorities have stated that the vessel is equipped with two models of the pilotless version of the Qaher (Conqueror) stealth fighter jet, an aircraft originally unveiled in 2013 and described as being capable of taking off and landing on short runways. The two JAS 313 versions that launched from the Martyr Baqeri on February 6 differ in size. The larger model features a jet engine that enables high-speed operations. According to Rear Admiral Tangsiri, the JAS 313 has a flight endurance of one hour and is designed for both reconnaissance and bombing missions within the IRGC Navy. However, some Iranian social media users mocked the drone’s small size, with one commenting that a more effective model could be found on an online shopping platform. Despite such remarks, Iranian officials continue advancing drone development, considering it a key component of national defense strategy. The unveiling of the JAS 313 comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and Western nations, particularly due to U.S. sanctions imposed on entities based in Hong Kong and mainland China. These entities are accused of supplying critical components for Iran’s drone program.

It can carry up to 1,000 troops, 30 amphibious landing craft, and 6 to 8 helicopters, allowing it to launch coordinated assaults using both air and sea assets. The ship's ability to carry heavy artillery and mechanized forces makes it an ideal platform for sustained amphibious operations. Additionally, its large flight deck supports heavy-lift helicopters like the Z-8, enabling rapid troop deployment and providing crucial air support for ground forces. These capabilities make the Hainan an indispensable asset in any large-scale amphibious assault, particularly one involving difficult-to-reach or heavily defended coastal areas, such as Taiwan. The Chaganhu, a comprehensive supply ship, also played a crucial role in the exercise by conducting replenishment-at-sea operations. This logistical support is vital for extending the operational reach of both the Jinggangshan and the Hainan, ensuring that they can remain on station for extended periods without the need to return to port for resupply. The Chaganhu is designed to carry fuel, ammunition, food, and other supplies, allowing the flotilla to operate continuously in maritime environments, even in areas where access to shore-based logistics would be limited or contested. This capability is particularly important for maintaining a sustained military presence in regions like the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. This joint operation underscores the PLA Navy’s increasing focus on integrating its amphibious assets for a wide range of operations, from initial landings to sustained occupation. By combining the capabilities of the Jinggangshan, Hainan, and Chaganhu, the PLA demonstrates its growing ability to conduct complex amphibious assaults, with a focus on rapid deployment, heavy equipment insertion, and logistical sustainment. The timing of the exercise, conducted just months before the release of these images, is highly significant. Tensions over Taiwan remain at the forefront of China’s military planning. The South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait are areas of intense geopolitical competition, with Beijing asserting its territorial claims in the region. As such, the PLA’s emphasis on amphibious warfare is seen as part of its broader strategy to prepare for a potential conflict over Taiwan. The ability to launch a swift, large-scale amphibious assault could be critical in any scenario involving the island, where the PLA would need to quickly establish control over coastal areas, while preventing intervention from foreign powers like the United States. The PLA Southern Theater Command, responsible for operations in the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and surrounding areas, has been at the forefront of these preparations. With an increasing focus on amphibious training and operational readiness, the command aims to enhance China’s ability to rapidly respond to any escalation in the Taiwan Strait. The release of these images further highlights Beijing's commitment to ensuring its military forces are prepared for a range of contingencies, including amphibious landings in contested areas. China's ongoing investment in amphibious warfare capabilities is reshaping the regional security landscape. The presence of ships like the Jinggangshan and Hainan enables the PLA to project power in critical maritime regions, particularly in scenarios involving Taiwan. These exercises also send a clear signal to Taiwan and its allies about China’s growing military capabilities and its readiness to enforce its territorial claims. While Beijing maintains that military action would only occur in response to Taiwanese moves toward independence or foreign intervention, the frequency and scale of these exercises raise concerns about the potential for conflict in the Taiwan Strait. As tensions in the region continue to rise, the PLA's focus on amphibious warfare and its ability to conduct large-scale operations is likely to be a key factor in future security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific. The growing capabilities of China’s amphibious forces highlight the importance of maintaining a military edge in these contested waters, particularly as the geopolitical balance continues to shift. The PLA Navy’s enhanced readiness for amphibious operations could significantly influence the future trajectory of China-Taiwan relations, with far-reaching implications for regional and global security.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/china-demonstrated-its-capabilities-to-conduct-large-scale-amphibious-operations-during-february-2025-exercise	2025-03-04T05:02:18-08:00

Their presence in Iran underscores the growing military cooperation between the two nations, further strengthened by a 20-year military pact signed in January. This strategic alliance has already impacted the conflict in Ukraine, with Russia deploying Iranian-designed Shahed-136 drones in attacks targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. At the same time, Tehran has supplied Moscow with several hundred Fath-360 ballistic missiles, capable of striking targets up to 120 kilometers away. These missiles, derived from precision-guided rocket technology, can be launched from mobile platforms, offering greater operational flexibility. Reports indicate they have been used against Ukrainian cities such as Dnipro, Odesa, and Kharkiv, increasing pressure on Ukrainian defensive lines. These arms transfers are not isolated incidents. Intelligence sources suggest that Iran may also provide Russia with Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles, which have a range exceeding 300 kilometers. This would further expand Moscow’s arsenal against critical Ukrainian infrastructure. In response to these deliveries, the United States and the European Union have voiced concerns, describing them as an escalation of the conflict. Consequently, new sanctions have been imposed on Iran, targeting its national airline and other entities involved in these transfers. These military interactions take place in a complex international landscape, marked by sanctions and concerns over arms proliferation. The Moscow-Tehran axis appears to be strengthening, driven by shared strategic interests in the face of Western economic and military pressures. The deepening of this military partnership could have significant geopolitical consequences, particularly by intensifying tensions in the Middle East and reshaping alliance dynamics against the United States and its partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/russian-missile-experts-allegedly-inspected-iranian-facilities-during-rising-tensions-with-israel	2025-03-04T02:10:35-08:00

This approach also reduces supply chain risks by incorporating multiple suppliers. The Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT) is a subsonic, long-range cruise missile with an expected range exceeding 800 km (500 miles). It is priced at approximately $150,000 per unit. According to Scott Callaway, Director of Affordable Mass at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, CMMT is positioned between low-cost standoff glide weapons and more expensive cruise missiles such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), which costs over $1.5 million per unit. If procured by the U.S. Department of Defense, the production capacity could reach 2,500 units per year to support the U.S. military’s effort to sustain a stockpile of cost-effective weapons for potential conflicts, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, while managing budget constraints. The CMMT has two primary configurations. The first is an air-launched variant designed for deployment from U.S. Air Force airlifters, fighters, and bombers, extending strike range. The second is a shorter-range version for rotary-wing aircraft. The system's modularity allows for customization across multiple environments, including maritime strike applications. Lockheed Martin has indicated that CMMT can be deployed in swarms and can integrate varied seeker technologies to optimize targeting efficiency. It is also worth noting that the CMMT is the third missile unveiled by Lockheed Martin in just a few months, following the JASSM-XR and the Mako, highlighting the company's strategic effort to diversify the U.S. armed forces' stockpile. CMMT is part of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division under Project Carrera, which seeks to develop a flexible autonomy framework for integrating crewed and uncrewed aircraft in collaborative operations. The initiative includes the creation of AI-driven control systems for autonomous drones to operate collaboratively with piloted aircraft such as the F-35, rather than serving as supplementary assets. Early testing has included integrating the Speed Racer drone, a modular payload testbed using digital engineering that has influenced the CMMT design approach, with F-35 fighters to refine operational capabilities. Digital engineering has also allowed Lockheed Martin to reduce the time required to reach the preliminary design review milestone by 50%. Furthermore, Project Carrera builds on previous initiatives, including Skyborg and the X-44A program, which explored AI-driven control systems for uncrewed combat aircraft. In these initiatives, the Skunk Works division tested autonomous drones in combat scenarios, supporting piloted fighters in strike and reconnaissance missions. Early trials have included AI-assisted route planning, sensor integration, and automated threat response. Project Carrera also incorporates Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO) battlespace multipliers, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for beyond-line-of-sight sensing in contested environments and forward-survivable platforms with enhanced sensor capabilities. Integration with Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (JADC2) is a core component, ensuring bi-directional data exchange with command nodes to enhance operational effectiveness. With structured investments of $20 million in crewed and uncrewed assets, $42 million in teaming enablers, and $38 million in battlespace multipliers, Project Carrera is designed to enhance distributed warfare capabilities through networked, AI-enabled systems.

Russian destroyer Severomorsk could become the new flagship of the Baltic Fleet to strengthen its anti-submarine capabilities	According to MilitaryRussia on March 2, 2025, the Baltic Fleet appears to have a new flagship, as the Russian Navy has left the Severomorsk, a Udaloy-class destroyer, in the Baltic Sea following its 14-month technical restoration and combat training, rather than returning it to its home fleet. This decision appears to be related to the status of the Baltic Fleet’s former flagship, the Nastoichivy, which has likely been decommissioned and is awaiting disposal, as suggested by the cessation of its sea deployments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The decision to keep the Severomorsk in the Baltic is driven by the need to enhance the fleet’s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities and support sea trials for new diesel-electric submarines under construction in St. Petersburg. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Baltic Fleet has historically maintained limited anti-submarine warfare (ASW) assets compared to the Northern and Pacific Fleets, with a greater emphasis on surface combatants and smaller multi-role vessels. The removal of the Nastoichivy from operational duty necessitated a replacement, and the ASW-focused Severomorsk could improve the fleet’s ability to detect and engage submarines, as its gas turbine propulsion offers increased reliability and sustained deployment capability compared to the steam-powered Nastoichivy. The Severomorsk is a Project 1155 Udaloy-class destroyer commissioned on January 24, 1988, after being built at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad. Originally laid down as Simferopol, it was renamed Severomorsk in 1996. The ship has served extensively in the Northern Fleet, taking part in various naval exercises, including joint drills with the United States and Norway. It has conducted long-range deployments in multiple theaters, including the Arctic, Mediterranean, and the Gulf of Aden, where it carried out convoy escort missions and counter-piracy operations. It has also been involved in Arctic naval operations, including a mission to the New Siberian Islands and participation in the Northern Sea Route transit. The ship’s armament includes two quadruple launchers for URK-5 Rastrub-B anti-submarine/anti-ship missiles, two Kinzhal surface-to-air missile systems with a total of 64 missiles, and 24 RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers. It is also equipped with two AK-100 naval guns, four AK-630 close-in weapon systems (CIWS), and eight 53-65K 533mm torpedoes. It also carries two Ka-27PL helicopters, which enhance the ship's ability to detect, track, and engage submarines beyond the range of its onboard sonar systems. Its sensor suite includes the Polynom sonar system, which provides long-range submarine detection, and the Frigate radar system, which offers air and surface surveillance. The Severomorsk has a standard displacement of 6,840 tons and a full-load displacement of 7,480 tons. It is 163 meters long, 19 meters wide, and has a draft of 7.8 meters. The ship is powered by four gas turbine engines, each generating 20,000 horsepower, for a total of 80,000 horsepower. This propulsion system allows the ship to reach a maximum speed of 29.5 knots and an operational range of 6,882 nautical miles at economical speed. The ship can remain at sea for up to 30 days without resupply. Compared to earlier Soviet destroyers, its gas turbine propulsion system is more reliable than the steam turbines of the Sovremenny-class, reducing maintenance demands and improving operational availability. The hull design incorporates an extended forecastle for improved seaworthiness, and its dual helicopter hangar provides additional ASW capabilities. The Udaloy-class destroyers, developed under Project 1155 in the 1970s, were designed as specialized ASW ships to operate alongside the missile-armed Sovremenny-class destroyers. Soviet naval doctrine at the time emphasized role specialization, with the Udaloy-class optimized for ASW operations and equipped with long-range sonar, missile-torpedoes, and rocket launchers for engaging submarines. The class was introduced to counter NATO submarine threats, particularly those from the United States and the United Kingdom. While early Udaloy-class ships had limited anti-ship and air defense capabilities, later modifications incorporated improved missile systems and gun armament, making them more versatile. The Nastoichivy, a Project 956 Sovremenny-class destroyer, was among the last of its class to be built in the late 1980s and served as the flagship of the Baltic Fleet. Unlike the Udaloy-class, which was designed primarily for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations, Nastoichivy was optimized for surface warfare, armed with Moskit anti-ship missiles and AK-130 dual naval guns. Its air defense capabilities were based on the Uragan missile system, but its ASW capability was limited, relying only on torpedoes and depth charges. The ship was powered by a steam turbine propulsion system, which required extensive maintenance and had operational limitations compared to gas turbines. The Sovremenny-class, developed under Project 956, was designed in response to NATO’s emphasis on surface warfare in the late 1970s. The class prioritized speed and firepower, equipping each ship with long-range anti-ship missiles and rapid-firing artillery. Built between the late 1970s and early 1990s, these destroyers were initially a key part of the Soviet Navy’s surface strike force. However, their lack of strong ASW capabilities and reliance on steam turbine propulsion reduced their long-term viability. Many units have since been retired or transferred to China, with only a few remaining in service with the Russian Navy. The Nastoichivy, a Project 956 Sovremenny-class destroyer, was among the last of its class to be built in the late 1980s and served as the flagship of the Baltic Fleet.

This initiative is part of a broader plan to modernize Sweden’s air force, which includes the gradual phase-out of 45 Gripen C/D aircraft from the current fleet of 105. These will be replaced with newly built Gripen E/F variants and 60 upgraded Gripen C/Ds. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 on the Gripen C is expected to reach initial operational capability by 2028, with its integration on the Gripen E to follow at a later stage (Picture source: Saab) The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 on the Gripen C is expected to reach initial operational capability by 2028, with its integration on the Gripen E to follow at a later stage. Saab, one of the development partners of the missile alongside MBDA Germany, has previously showcased the KEPD-350 as part of the Gripen’s weapon package, though it remains unclear whether it has been live-fired from the aircraft. As a NATO member, Sweden might also consider alternatives such as the AGM-158 JASSM, already acquired by other alliance members, including Poland. The Taurus KEPD-350 is a long-range cruise missile designed for precision strikes against fortified targets. It has a range of 500 km and flies at an altitude of only 35 meters above the ground, reaching a speed of Mach 0.95 (approximately 1,170 km/h). Its 481 kg MEPHISTO warhead features a dual-charge configuration, allowing it to penetrate heavily protected structures. Comparable to the British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG, it provides deep-strike capability for strategic targets. Interest in this missile in Europe has grown, particularly due to its potential deployment in Sweden. In operational scenarios, Gripen aircraft could use Agile Combat Employment (ACE) tactics, utilizing roads and highways as temporary runways to quickly reposition in the Scandinavian terrain. This approach would enhance Sweden’s air force resilience in case of an attack while taking advantage of gaps in Russian defenses to conduct long-range strikes against key targets. South Korea has also demonstrated the effectiveness of the Taurus KEPD-350, integrating it into its fleet of F-15K Slam Eagles in 2016. The missile was used in live-fire exercises in 2017 and, more recently, in October 2024. Its adoption by other air forces further establishes it as a reliable cruise missile capable of operating in modern threat environments. Alongside the Taurus KEPD-350 integration, Sweden is upgrading 60 Gripen C/D aircraft as part of an obsolescence management program. These aircraft will be upgraded to the MS20 Block 3 standard starting in 2026, followed by the MS20 Block 4 upgrade in 2028. The modification process, which began in 2024, will continue until 2027, ensuring sufficient operational capability for training missions and the transition to Gripen E. The planned phase-out of 45 Gripen C/Ds will be adjusted depending on the operational availability of the new Gripen E variants. Sweden’s Gripen program is also directly linked to military assistance for Ukraine. On September 9, 2024, Stockholm announced a $443 million aid package to acquire Gripen spare parts, potentially preparing for a future transfer of aircraft to Kyiv. This support aligns with Sweden’s broader strategy of strengthening Ukraine’s defense capabilities. However, Stockholm remains cautious about the timeline for deliveries, considering ongoing international negotiations and the requirements of its own air force. The development of the Gripen E program has undergone multiple adjustments since its launch in 2013, particularly to align Swedish requirements with those of international customers. Deliveries to the Swedish and Brazilian air forces began in 2020, and Saab has since received orders for conversion kits to upgrade 20 Gripen C/D aircraft to Gripen E. The aim is to achieve a higher level of technical maturity while slightly slowing production to optimize performance. The Swedish Air Force plans to introduce the Gripen E at Såtenäs Air Base by late 2025, though its initial deployment will be limited. Additionally, Saab has received a SEK 1.7 billion order to maintain and modernize Taurus KEPD-350 missiles currently in service with the German Air Force. The contract, signed with TAURUS Systems—a joint venture between MBDA Germany and Saab—includes a major system upgrade and ten years of maintenance from 2025 to 2035. These enhancements will improve the missile’s capabilities to meet evolving operational requirements. The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 into Sweden’s Gripen fleet represents a significant development in the country’s long-range strike capabilities, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions in Europe. By combining an agile platform like the Gripen with a cruise missile capable of neutralizing strategic targets at extended ranges, Sweden strengthens its deterrence posture and enhances its operational flexibility. Future developments in the Gripen program, as well as decisions regarding Ukraine and Sweden’s air force modernization, will have a lasting impact on the country’s defense strategy in the coming years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/taurus-kepd-350-missile-soon-to-be-operational-on-swedish-gripen-fighter-jets-enabling-long-range-precision-strikes	2025-03-03T00:46:53-08:00

Focus: What Are the Nuclear Capabilities of France After President Macron's Offer to Protect Europe Against Russia?	On March 1, 2025, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that he was ready to initiate discussions on nuclear deterrence for Europe, signaling that France could extend its nuclear protection to other European Union (EU) member states in light of the increasing security threats posed by Russia. This statement marks a pivotal moment in European defense, suggesting that France, with its advanced nuclear capabilities, may play a more prominent role in safeguarding the continent’s security amid growing geopolitical tensions, particularly as Russia’s actions in Ukraine and military assertiveness in Eastern Europe continue to unsettle the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Rafale fighter aircraft equipped with the ASMP-A supersonic nuclear missile. (Picture source: MBDA) France has long maintained a robust nuclear deterrent, positioning itself as one of the leading nuclear powers globally. The French nuclear arsenal is primarily designed to defend national sovereignty, but in the context of the evolving security environment in Europe, Macron’s comments suggest a shift towards a more collaborative European nuclear posture. President Macron’s willingness to explore the idea of extending France's nuclear umbrella to other EU countries could signify an evolution in the continent's defense strategies, underscoring France's leadership role within both NATO and the EU. France’s nuclear deterrence is built around three primary elements: land-based missiles, air-launched systems, and sea-based platforms, each playing a critical role in ensuring the country's second-strike capability. These three pillars work together to provide France with a comprehensive and survivable nuclear force, capable of responding to any existential threat. While these forces are primarily intended to safeguard France’s own security, they also form the foundation for any potential broader European nuclear deterrence discussions that Macron alluded to. At the heart of France’s land-based nuclear deterrent are the M51 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which are primarily deployed on the Triomphant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). These missiles have a range of approximately 8,000 km and can carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), each with a nuclear warhead. This ensures that France can strike adversaries from a considerable distance, even in the event of a first-strike attack. The M51 system represents one of the most reliable and survivable elements of France’s nuclear strategy. While France does not currently have land-based ICBMs in the traditional sense, the strategic role of submarine-launched M51 missiles ensures that French nuclear forces are second-to-none when it comes to survivability. In terms of air-launched nuclear capabilities, France’s focus is on the ASMP-A (Air-Sol Moyenne Portée-Amélioré) cruise missile, which is deployed on both Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft and Mirage 2000N bombers. The ASMP-A missile is a supersonic, air-to-ground missile designed to deliver nuclear warheads to strategic targets at distances of up to 300 km. The French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) provides the air component of France’s nuclear triad, ensuring that the country can launch nuclear strikes from airbases or aircraft carriers, depending on the operational requirements. The Rafale fighter, with its high agility, versatility, and proven combat record, serves as the primary platform for the delivery of nuclear payloads. France is also planning to integrate future generations of missiles and aircraft, ensuring that its nuclear deterrent remains cutting-edge and capable of evolving alongside emerging technological threats. By far, the most prominent component of France's nuclear deterrent is its sea-based leg, which is centered around the Triomphant-class SSBNs. These submarines carry M51 ICBMs, which have the ability to strike enemy targets thousands of kilometers away while maintaining an untraceable presence beneath the ocean's surface. There are four Triomphant-class SSBNs in service, and they are equipped with the M51 missiles, each capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads. The SSBNs operate under strict nuclear deterrence protocols, and their survivability at sea ensures that France’s nuclear deterrent is never fully neutralized in the event of an attack. These submarines can remain submerged for extended periods, making them a virtually impregnable component of France’s deterrent. This highly survivable second-strike capability means that even in a scenario where French land-based or air-launched nuclear assets are neutralized, the nation can still retaliate with devastating effect from its nuclear-powered submarines. President Macron’s recent comments about European nuclear deterrence come as Europe faces growing geopolitical instability, particularly with Russia's actions in Ukraine and its renewed military assertiveness in Eastern Europe. In this context, Macron has indicated that France is willing to discuss the possibility of extending its nuclear umbrella over other EU member states, potentially enhancing security cooperation within NATO and the EU. Macron’s remarks are timely, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has raised concerns about the security of NATO’s eastern flank. While the alliance has worked to bolster its defenses, the reality is that nuclear deterrence remains a cornerstone of military strategy, especially for nations like France that possess advanced nuclear arsenals. The President’s comments suggest a willingness to deepen defense ties within the EU, including sharing strategic nuclear deterrence to better secure the continent. If Macron's proposal gains traction, France could theoretically offer extended nuclear protection to other EU member states. However, several technical and political factors would need to be addressed, including political consensus within the EU and the logistics of nuclear sharing arrangements. NATO has long used a nuclear-sharing arrangement with several countries, such as Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, allowing these nations to host nuclear weapons as part of the broader alliance. France’s willingness to allow other EU states access to its nuclear deterrent would mark an evolution of this concept and could change the dynamics of European defense. Additionally, extending nuclear deterrence would require detailed agreements on command and control protocols, ensuring that France retains control over its nuclear arsenal while simultaneously offering security guarantees to its European partners. Several NATO member countries also possess or host nuclear capabilities that contribute to the alliance's overall deterrence strategy. The United Kingdom maintains a nuclear deterrent based on the Trident II D5 SLBMs deployed aboard Vanguard-class SSBNs, while the United States provides a significant share of NATO’s nuclear forces through its arsenal of ICBMs, SLBMs, and B61 nuclear bombs stationed in various European countries. Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands all participate in NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangements, hosting U.S. nuclear weapons and ensuring that their aircraft are capable of delivering these weapons in a crisis. Although these countries do not have independent nuclear arsenals, they play a vital role in NATO’s nuclear posture. France’s nuclear deterrent, consisting of land-based, air-launched, and sea-based capabilities, is one of the most sophisticated in the world. President Macron's recent statements on discussing nuclear deterrence for Europe are part of a broader strategy to bolster European security, particularly in light of growing tensions with Russia. While much remains to be discussed, France's nuclear capabilities could play a crucial role in shaping the future of defense policy in Europe, ensuring stability, and providing a powerful deterrent against any potential aggressors. Should Macron’s proposal come to fruition, it could lead to a more integrated European defense strategy, enhancing security across the continent while reinforcing the collective security framework within NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-what-are-the-nuclear-capabilities-of-france-after-president-macrons-offer-to-protect-europe-against-russia	2025-03-02T05:08:19-08:00

Exclusive: Iran Strengthens Armored Forces with Delivery of Modernized US M60 Tank Suleiman-402	According to information published by several Iranian media outlets on February 27, 2025, Iran has received new military equipment, including the Suleiman-402, an upgraded version of the American-made M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (MBT). This new delivery is part of the country's ongoing efforts to enhance its military capabilities, particularly its armored forces, as Iran seeks to modernize and strengthen its defense industry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The official delivery ceremony of the Suleiman-402 tank to the Iranian Army marked a significant upgrade to the country's armored forces with the modernized US-made M60 platform. (Picture source: Iranian press agency) The M60 MBT (Main Battle Tank), originally developed by the United States in the 1950s and introduced into service in 1960, has been a significant component of Iran’s ground forces for decades. Iran first acquired a substantial number of M60 tanks during the 1970s, as part of a broader military modernization program under the regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. These tanks were part of Iran's military partnership with the United States before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Following the revolution, Iran found itself cut off from American military supplies, but the M60s remained an important part of the Iranian Army's armored forces. Over the years, Iran has made extensive efforts to maintain and upgrade these tanks, ensuring they remained operational and effective for several decades. The Suleiman-402, which is the latest variant of the M60 in the Iranian Army, represents a significant leap forward in the country's tank modernization efforts. The Iranian Army’s continued reliance on the M60 platform has driven the need for upgrades to improve its firepower, mobility, and survivability in modern combat situations. Although specific details of the Suleiman-402 remain largely unconfirmed due to the classified nature of such military projects, several enhancements have been suggested based on Iranian media reports and expert analysis. One of the primary upgrades is likely to be in the tank's armor protection. The Suleiman-402 is expected to feature enhanced composite and reactive armor, offering better defense against contemporary anti-tank weapons such as guided missiles, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and other modern threats. This upgraded armor would significantly improve the tank's survivability on the battlefield, especially in the face of more sophisticated and potent anti-tank systems used by adversaries. Another major improvement is in the tank's firepower. The Suleiman-402 is expected to be equipped with a 120mm smoothbore cannon, replacing the original M60’s rifled gun. The smoothbore cannon allows the tank to fire more advanced, high-velocity rounds, including armor-piercing munitions, which would significantly improve its ability to engage and destroy modern enemy armored vehicles at longer ranges. This upgrade enhances the tank's role in armored warfare, particularly in countering heavily armored threats on the battlefield. In terms of mobility, the Suleiman-402 is believed to have a more powerful engine, which would improve its speed, agility, and overall operational range. This engine upgrade is essential in ensuring the tank can effectively maneuver across various terrains and remain competitive in high-speed engagements with other modern armored vehicles. The fire control system of the Suleiman-402 is another area where significant improvements have been made. The tank is expected to feature an upgraded fire control system, including more advanced targeting sensors, ballistic computers, and enhanced night-vision capabilities. These upgrades will improve the tank’s effectiveness in low-visibility conditions, allowing it to engage targets with higher precision during both daytime and nighttime operations. The integration of more modern electronics would also allow the Suleiman-402 to better coordinate with other units on the battlefield, a crucial advantage in today’s networked warfare environments. While still speculative, there is also some possibility that the Suleiman-402 could include autonomous features to enhance its operational efficiency. This could include improvements in automated targeting or loading systems, although the specifics of such technologies have yet to be confirmed. The delivery of the Suleiman-402 is part of Iran's broader drive to bolster its indigenous defense industry, which has become an increasingly critical aspect of its military strategy. Over the years, Iran has faced significant international sanctions that have restricted its ability to acquire advanced foreign military technology. As a result, Iran has focused on developing and producing its own weapons systems, from tanks and armored vehicles to missiles and aircraft. This emphasis on self-sufficiency allows Iran to mitigate the effects of sanctions and reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly those in the West. The development of indigenous defense technologies, such as the Suleiman-402, reflects Iran’s desire for greater autonomy in its defense capabilities. The country’s ability to produce advanced military equipment locally not only ensures that it can continue to modernize its forces but also positions Iran as a self-reliant military power capable of maintaining its defense posture without external assistance. In the face of regional instability and ongoing geopolitical tensions, this strategic independence in defense production has become a top priority for the Iranian government. The Suleiman-402 tank, along with other domestic military projects, forms part of Iran’s vision for a more advanced and resilient military force. By upgrading its fleet of M60 tanks, Iran is able to extend the service life of these armored vehicles while enhancing their effectiveness on modern battlefields. This strategy of upgrading older platforms is an essential part of Iran’s military modernization efforts, which also include other indigenous systems, such as the Karrar main battle tank and various missile defense systems. The delivery of the Suleiman-402 highlights the growing importance of self-reliance in Iran's military strategy. This new tank will play a significant role in the Iranian Army's armored forces, complementing other modernized platforms and contributing to the country’s overall defense capabilities. In an era of increasing regional volatility and rising military tensions, the Suleiman-402 is a testament to Iran’s determination to enhance its military strength through domestic innovation and production. In conclusion, the Suleiman-402 is more than just an upgraded version of the M60 tank; it is a symbol of Iran’s broader strategic goal of achieving self-sufficiency in defense technology. As Iran continues to modernize its military, this tank will play an important role in enhancing its armored forces’ capabilities and bolstering its defense posture in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment. The Suleiman-402 not only improves Iran’s military capabilities but also underscores the country's commitment to technological independence in its defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-iran-strengthens-armored-forces-with-delivery-of-modernized-us-m60-tank-suleiman-402	2025-03-01T09:24:15-08:00	
Flash News: US Army to Field First Land-Based Variant of New LRHW Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon in 2025	The U.S. Army is set to deploy its land mobile version of its Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) to an operational unit by the end of 2025, as revealed in a recent U.S. Congress report released on February 27, 2025. This marks a significant leap forward in the U.S. Army's modernization efforts and highlights the growing importance of hypersonic technology in the evolving landscape of modern warfare. The LRHW is part of a broader strategy to ensure the U.S. military maintains its technological edge over adversaries who are rapidly developing advanced missile technologies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to Bravo Battery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery, Long Range Fires Battalion, 1st Multi-Domain Task Force, demonstrate the capabilities of one of the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon LRHW Transporter Erector Launchers participating in exercise Bamboo Eagle 24-3 on Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., August 2, 2024. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Hypersonic weapons, such as the LRHW (Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon), are a category of missiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5—five times the speed of sound—and can even reach speeds up to Mach 20, or roughly 24,000 kilometers per hour. What sets these weapons apart from traditional missiles is their ability to travel at hypersonic speeds while maintaining maneuverability mid-flight. Unlike conventional ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable arc, hypersonic weapons can adjust their flight path during the missile's trajectory, making them much harder to intercept with existing missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability gives hypersonic weapons a clear advantage in both offensive and defensive operations, allowing them to evade interception and strike with extreme precision, making them a game-changer in modern military strategy. The LRHW, designed to deliver these hypersonic capabilities, is a long-range, ground-launched missile system that combines an advanced hypersonic glide body with a conventional warhead. This combination enables the U.S. Army to strike targets at ranges far beyond those achievable by traditional artillery or missile systems. The LRHW has a reported range of approximately 2,776 kilometers (1,725 miles) and can travel at speeds exceeding 6,100 kilometers per hour (3,800 miles per hour). The weapon is capable of reaching the top of the Earth's atmosphere and remaining just beyond the reach of current air and missile defense systems until it is ready to strike, at which point it becomes nearly impossible to intercept or defend against. The LRHW can engage a variety of high-value targets, such as enemy command centers, naval fleets, missile defense sites, and strategic infrastructure, all with minimal warning. Its ability to reach these targets at extremely high speeds, coupled with its precision, makes it a formidable tool in both conventional and strategic warfare scenarios. The LRHW system provides the U.S. Army with a strategic attack weapon designed to defeat Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities, suppress adversary long-range fires, and engage other high-priority or time-critical targets. As part of the U.S. Army’s modernization efforts, it is seen as a critical asset for deterring potential adversaries, particularly in regions where military access is restricted or contested. In addition, the U.S. Army’s LRHW development program is closely aligned with the U.S. Navy's efforts, enhancing the overall interoperability of the military’s hypersonic missile capabilities. The LRHW is made up of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) and a 34.5-inch booster developed by the Navy, with the missile component being developed by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. The missile is designed to be launched from a land-based, truck-launched system, giving it the flexibility and mobility to be deployed in a wide variety of operational environments. When the hypersonic glide body is attached, it is referred to as the Navy-Army All Up Round plus Canister (AUR+C). This missile component serves as the common two-stage booster for both the U.S. Army’s LRHW and the U.S. Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) system, which can be fired from both surface vessels and submarines. The U.S. Army’s integration of the LRHW into its arsenal represents a significant leap in strike capability, offering the ability to engage targets at long ranges, outpacing traditional missile defense systems. The weapon’s speed, maneuverability, and precision make it a formidable tool in the U.S. military’s arsenal, with the ability to deter adversaries and respond rapidly to evolving threats. The deployment of hypersonic weapons like the LRHW is especially critical in the current geopolitical environment, where rival powers such as China and Russia are also developing similar technologies. The LRHW offers the U.S. Army a critical strategic advantage by ensuring that it can strike at high-priority targets in enemy territory at speeds that are difficult to defend against. The weapon's ability to rapidly change its trajectory mid-flight further complicates the task of intercepting or neutralizing the threat, making it an essential element in the U.S. military's deterrence strategy. In August 2024, a significant milestone in the LRHW program occurred when the U.S. Army’s only LRHW battery, part of the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), participated in Bamboo Eagle, an eight-day joint exercise led by the U.S. Air Force. The exercise, which took place across various locations in the U.S., was the first time that U.S. Army land-based fires were integrated into an Air Force-led exercise. Over 3,000 service members from the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and even allied forces like the Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force participated. The integration of the LRHW into Bamboo Eagle 24-3 showcased the U.S. military's ability to operate across multiple domains, including land, air, sea, and cyber, in a coordinated and effective manner. This participation demonstrated the LRHW's potential for joint operations, proving that it could serve as a key element in integrated, multi-service military operations, providing a versatile and powerful strike capability. The U.S. Army originally planned to deploy the LRHW to the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, specifically to the 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, 17th Field Artillery Brigade. However, the latest reports indicate that it is still unclear whether this specific unit will be the first to receive the LRHW, or if other units will be chosen for its initial deployment. Despite the uncertainty around the exact deployment location, the U.S. Army is on track to begin fielding the LRHW by the end of 2025, with the goal of having the system fully operational shortly thereafter. Looking to the future, the LRHW is expected to be just the beginning of the U.S. Army's hypersonic missile program. The U.S. Army is continuing to refine the LRHW's capabilities and is also working on developing additional hypersonic systems, including air-launched and sea-launched variants. These systems will complement the LRHW, enabling the U.S. military to maintain a strategic edge in high-speed, precision strikes across various domains. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare cannot be overstated. With their ability to strike rapidly and with precision, hypersonic missiles are seen as a key deterrent against adversaries who may otherwise feel emboldened to challenge U.S. military forces. These weapons represent a significant shift in how the U.S. military will engage in future conflicts, offering capabilities that are not only faster but also harder to predict and defend against. The LRHW, as part of the U.S. Army’s overall strategy, will provide a vital asset in future conflicts, allowing the U.S. to project power more effectively and rapidly than ever before, ensuring that it remains a dominant force in global military affairs.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-army-to-field-first-land-based-variant-of-new-lrhw-long-range-hypersonic-weapon-in-2025	2025-03-01T07:23:57-08:00

According to Colonel Per Steinar Trøite, head of the Norwegian Air Force’s support department for Ukraine, the NASAMS systems deployed to Ukraine have achieved an outstanding 94 percent effectiveness rate, a figure that highlights the advanced capabilities of this air defense system in real-world combat. In an interview with Aftenposten, Norway's largest daily newspaper, Colonel Trøite detailed the significant impact of NASAMS, revealing that it has successfully intercepted over 900 cruise missiles and drones, with more than 60 percent of these targets being cruise missiles, which are notoriously difficult to defend against.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A NASAMS (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) launcher unit ready for deployment, providing advanced air defense capabilities against a wide range of aerial threats. (Picture source: Norway MoD) This level of effectiveness, combined with the high volume of intercepted threats, underscores the precision and reliability of NASAMS air defense missile system in countering Russian missile and drone offensives. The system's ability to down over 900 aerial threats with a 94 percent success rate is a remarkable achievement in modern warfare and represents a crucial advancement in Ukraine’s ability to protect its airspace and critical infrastructure. These figures not only speak to the quality of NASAMS but also highlight the importance of Western air defense systems in strengthening Ukraine’s defensive capabilities. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, several countries have stepped up to deliver NASAMS systems to bolster Ukraine's defense. Norway was one of the first nations to supply the system, contributing the initial batch of NASAMS systems early in the conflict. The United States followed suit, providing additional systems to further enhance Ukraine's air defense capabilities. By early 2025, Ukraine had received at least three NASAMS batteries, with each battery comprising several launchers and radar systems, significantly augmenting its ability to intercept a variety of airborne threats. In addition to the initial contributions from Norway and the United States, other NATO members have also provided technical support and components, such as radar systems and missiles, which integrate with the NASAMS framework. While specific quantities of NASAMS systems delivered are not always disclosed, the combined contributions from these countries have strengthened Ukraine’s layered air defense network, which is designed to protect key military installations, cities, and civilian infrastructure. NASAMS is a cutting-edge air defense system that combines several advanced technologies to provide comprehensive protection against a range of airborne threats, including aircraft, helicopters, drones, and cruise missiles. The system’s multi-layered defense architecture allows it to intercept both high-altitude and low-altitude targets with high precision, making it effective against a wide variety of threats. At the heart of NASAMS is its Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), the AIM-120 missile, which has been adapted for surface-to-air launches. The system is designed to work in conjunction with a sophisticated radar and fire control system. The AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel radar is used to detect, track, and engage targets at a range of up to 120 kilometers (about 75 miles), depending on the type of target and the operational conditions. The radar is capable of tracking multiple targets simultaneously, allowing NASAMS to defend against several incoming threats at once. One of NASAMS’ most significant advantages is its ability to rapidly detect and respond to a wide variety of threats. The system’s Command and Control (C2) network integrates seamlessly with other air defense systems, enabling a highly coordinated defense effort. This capability is particularly valuable for Ukraine, where coordinated defense across multiple layers is necessary to protect vital assets. The system’s missile engagement can be executed at varying ranges depending on the type of target. For example, while the AIM-120 missile has an effective range of up to 180 kilometers against some targets, NASAMS typically engages threats at a closer range—often between 25 to 50 kilometers—to maximize interception accuracy and minimize the risk of a missile getting through. This makes NASAMS particularly effective against cruise missiles, which are commonly used in Russia's aerial bombardment campaigns. The 94 percent effectiveness rate reported by Colonel Trøite reflects the system’s superior targeting and interception capabilities. In addition to its missile defense capabilities, NASAMS also provides a robust defense against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a growing concern in modern warfare. Russia’s use of both surveillance and combat drones to attack Ukrainian positions has been a persistent threat. NASAMS, with its advanced tracking and missile engagement systems, is particularly effective at intercepting UAVs before they can cause significant damage. This capability is vital, given the growing use of drones on the battlefield. Moreover, NASAMS' modular design allows for flexible deployment in a variety of settings, from fixed installations to mobile units that can be quickly repositioned. This mobility makes NASAMS a highly adaptable solution, whether deployed to defend strategic military sites or used in broader area defense operations. The delivery of NASAMS to Ukraine has significantly strengthened the country’s air defense capabilities, especially in the face of Russia's large-scale missile and drone strikes. As Colonel Trøite pointed out, the success of NASAMS in intercepting over 900 aerial threats, including more than 500 cruise missiles, has been a crucial factor in mitigating the damage caused by Russian missile campaigns. In the broader context of Ukraine’s defense strategy, the 94 percent interception rate of NASAMS complements other air defense systems, creating a multi-layered defense network that can protect critical infrastructure from a wide array of missile and aerial threats. The continued supply of NASAMS and similar advanced systems will be essential for Ukraine as the war progresses. The success of NASAMS in countering Russia’s missile and drone tactics highlights the importance of Western defense support in ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and its ability to resist external aggression. With the impressive 900+ intercepts, NATO's contributions are playing a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defensive efforts and in shaping the future of the conflict. The NASAMS air defense missile system, with its advanced radar capabilities, highly effective missile interceptors, and modular design, has emerged as one of the most effective tools in Ukraine’s defense arsenal. The continued deliveries from NATO countries, including Norway and the United States, are enhancing Ukraine’s capacity to safeguard its airspace and critical infrastructure against Russian aerial threats. As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, systems like NASAMS will remain central to the country's efforts to defend itself and maintain its sovereignty in the face of ongoing Russian invasion.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-nasams-air-defense-system-intercepts-over-900-russian-missiles-with-94-percent-effectiveness-in-ukraine	2025-03-01T05:55:45-08:00

Poland’s first locally produced Leonardo AW149 leaves assembly line to replace aging Soviet-era helicopters	As reported by Wiktor Sawicki on February 27, 2025, the first AW149 helicopter has rolled off the assembly line in Świdnik, Poland, marking a milestone in the country’s military aviation industry. This follows Poland's 2022 decision to procure 32 AW149 helicopters from the Italian company Leonardo, with production based at PZL Świdnik. Deliveries, which began in 2023, are set to continue through 2029 as part of a $1.85 billion (€1.76 billion) contract, the largest order for the AW149 to date.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link It is estimated that approximately 20 of the ordered AW149 helicopters will be assembled in Świdnik, strengthening Poland’s domestic helicopter production. (Picture source: Twitter/Wiktor Sawicki) The AW149 production line in Świdnik officially opened in 2024, serving as a domestic logistics and technical support hub. The facility oversees systems integration, armament fittings, modernization efforts, and maintenance throughout the helicopters’ service life. It is estimated that approximately 20 of the ordered AW149 helicopters will be assembled in Świdnik, strengthening Poland’s domestic aerospace industry. Leonardo’s involvement in Polish helicopter production extends beyond the AW149, as the company previously secured a contract for four AW101 naval helicopters for the Polish Navy, also assembled at PZL Świdnik. This industrial investment aligns with Poland’s broader strategy of reducing reliance on Soviet-era platforms, as its helicopter fleet, which includes the Mi-8, Mi-17, Mi-24, and SH-2G, faces aging issues, with an average fleet age exceeding 30 years. Poland's decision to acquire the AW149 helicopters is linked to the Perkoz program, which aims to modernize the country’s rotary-wing fleet by replacing aging Soviet-era Mi-2 and W-3 Sokół helicopters. Initially, the Perkoz program sought to acquire 32 multi-role helicopters in three different variants: combat support, command, and reconnaissance/electronic warfare. However, in March 2021, the technical dialogue involving 12 contractors was suspended. The outbreak of war in Ukraine expedited Poland’s decision, leading to an urgent operational requirement that resulted in the AW149 contract in 2022. The helicopters are expected to be operated primarily by the 25th Air Cavalry Brigade, enhancing its transport, combat support, and reconnaissance capabilities. Historically, Poland had considered multiple options for replacing its helicopter fleet. Previous plans included the 2015 selection of the Airbus H225M Caracal, which was ultimately canceled, followed by small-scale acquisitions of the Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk for special forces. The AW149 was previously proposed in tenders but only secured its place in Poland’s modernization efforts after an assessment of industrial and operational benefits. The contract also ensures that at least a portion of the helicopters will be built in Poland, reinforcing local aerospace capabilities. The AW149 is a multi-role military helicopter with an 8,600 kg maximum takeoff weight, a 17.6-meter fuselage, and a 14.6-meter rotor diameter. Its development began in 2006 as a military derivative of the AW139, with its first flight occurring in 2009. It features structural reinforcements for military operations, advanced avionics, and modularity for multiple mission configurations. The helicopter has previously been exported to Thailand and Egypt, but Poland’s acquisition represents its largest commitment to date. In terms of performance, the AW149 is powered by either two General Electric CT7-2E1 or two Safran Aneto-1K engines. It achieves a maximum speed of 313 km/h and an operational range of 844 km, with a service ceiling of 4,600 meters. The helicopter can carry up to 19 passengers or 16 fully equipped soldiers, with a standard military configuration of 12 soldiers and two gunners. It supports various mission profiles, including troop transport, reconnaissance, and close air support. The Polish AW149s will be equipped with observation and targeting systems, self-defense countermeasures, and multiple weapon configurations. Armament options include two 7.92 mm machine guns mounted internally, along with guided and unguided rockets and air-to-ground missiles of the same class as Hellfire. Depending on mission requirements, weapons can be installed inside the cabin or mounted externally. Additionally, Poland has secured 800 AGM-114R2 Hellfire II missiles to integrate with the fleet, enhancing its offensive capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/polands-first-locally-produced-leonardo-aw149-leaves-assembly-line-to-replace-aging-soviet-era-helicopters	2025-02-28T00:15:29-08:00	
North Korea Conducts New Cruise Missile Test in Response to Reinforcement of US Military Exercises in Indo-Pacific	On February 26, 2025, North Korea carried out a new test of strategic cruise missiles from its west coast, demonstrating its military capabilities and responding to what it perceives as increasing external threats. Supervised by Kim Jong-un, the test aimed to assess the reliability of its weapons systems and send a direct message to its adversaries. According to the official KCNA news agency, the missiles followed an elliptical trajectory of 1,587 kilometers for nearly 8,000 seconds before reaching their targets, highlighting their precision and operational capability. The launch, closely monitored by South Korea and the United States, was detected early by South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, which had been tracking military movements in the North based on prior warning signs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency shows a strategic cruise missile being launched during a drill on February 26. (Picture source: KCNA) This test is part of an ongoing pattern of North Korea’s military demonstrations in response to regional geopolitical tensions. Kim Jong-un emphasized the necessity of these tests to maintain the effectiveness of North Korea’s nuclear deterrent and ensure national security. Pyongyang views these missile launches as a reaction to what it calls 'provocations' from the United States and its allies, particularly amid the strengthening of joint military exercises between Seoul and Washington. With the annual Freedom Shield exercise scheduled for March, North Korea perceives these drills as a direct threat, whereas the United States and South Korea maintain that they are purely defensive. In this context, North Korea aims to reinforce its deterrence posture, signaling that its military capabilities are operationally ready if needed. The timing of this launch coincides with shifts in U.S. policy toward North Korea under the Trump administration. Washington has reaffirmed its commitment to North Korea’s denuclearization and has strengthened its trilateral partnership with Seoul and Tokyo, increasing pressure on Kim Jong-un’s regime.According to Hong Min, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, these missile tests directly respond to Washington’s recent measures, including its continued support for UN sanctions against Pyongyang. This launch marks the fourth missile test conducted by North Korea this year and the second since Trump’s return to office. In January, Pyongyang had already tested nuclear-capable cruise missiles, framing the move as a 'firm countermeasure' to U.S. actions. Over the years, North Korea has sought to expand and refine its missile arsenal, developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, which are capable of reaching U.S. territory, as well as intermediate-range missiles like the Hwasong-12, which pose a direct threat to Japan and Guam. Additionally, it has developed short-range missiles, including the KN-23, modeled after the Russian Iskander missile, and strategic cruise missiles like those tested in its latest launch. This modernization effort reflects Pyongyang’s strategy to counter its adversaries’ missile defense systems by employing more unpredictable flight paths and harder-to-detect weapons. These technological advancements have significant implications for neighboring countries. South Korea and Japan remain the most exposed to North Korea’s missile capabilities and have been reinforcing their defense systems, with increased support from the United States, which has expanded its military presence in the region. For Washington, North Korea’s ability to reach U.S. territory with long-range missiles presents a strategic challenge, prompting a reassessment of deterrence frameworks. In response, the U.S. and its allies continue to strengthen their collective defense posture while maintaining diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang to curb its military advancements. The February 26 launch once again highlights North Korea’s approach of demonstrating its military capabilities while testing the reactions of its adversaries. As tensions in the region escalate, such displays risk further complicating the security situation in East Asia, reducing the prospects for diplomatic engagement or de-escalation soon.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/north-korea-conducts-new-cruise-missile-test-in-response-to-reinforcement-of-us-military-exercises-in-indo-pacific	2025-02-27T23:58:04-08:00

Several key defense industry figures, including Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace (KDA) and Nammo, attended the event. The South Korean Ambassador to Norway, Seo Min-Jeong, also participated, highlighting the growing strategic ties between the two countries. The K239 Chunmoo, with its combination of firepower and technological flexibility, appears as a promising option to bolster Norway’s defense capabilities. Developed by Hanwha Aerospace in collaboration with the South Korean Agency for Defense Development, the K239 Chunmoo was commissioned in 2014 and is distinguished by its ability to fire different calibers of rockets, including 130 mm, 227 mm, and 239 mm (guided), as well as the KTSSM tactical missile, which has a range of up to 200 km. This modularity allows the system to adapt to various operational requirements, whether to neutralize artillery positions, destroy defensive installations, or target high-value assets. The Chunmoo is designed for enhanced mobility on the field with its 8x8 chassis and quick deployment capabilities, featuring four hydraulic jacks to ensure stability during firing. One of the main strengths of the Chunmoo lies in its integration flexibility, demonstrated through its deployment in Poland’s HOMAR-K program, where it is mounted on Jelcz trucks. This adaptability is particularly relevant for Norway, as the system could be integrated onto national platforms, enhancing interoperability with other European defense systems, especially those of NATO, and also allowing the use of 122 mm rockets, a common caliber in Europe. Beyond its technical features, the acquisition of the Chunmoo aligns with an ongoing industrial cooperation strategy between Norway and South Korea. Since 2017, Hanwha Aerospace has provided Norway with K9 VIDAR self-propelled howitzers, and in 2022, additional orders increased the number of K9 units to 28 and K10 ammunition resupply vehicles to 14 in Norwegian service. This partnership has been further strengthened by a memorandum of understanding signed in June 2024 at the Eurosatory defense exhibition, aimed at integrating Norwegian technologies into Hanwha’s platforms. A prior agreement in 2022 focused on collaboration in infantry fighting vehicles and long-range precision strike systems, underscoring the mutual interest of both parties in joint projects. The K239 Chunmoo could significantly enhance Norway’s long-range precision strike capability, improving its effectiveness against potential threats in the Nordic region. As a NATO member, Norway must maintain a defense force capable of deterring any aggression, particularly due to its proximity to Russia. The Chunmoo, with its ability to fire rockets of varying calibers and strike targets up to 200 km away, would allow Norway to conduct precise strikes while providing flexibility for operations in different terrain and mission types. Additionally, its compatibility with multiple vehicle platforms would offer interoperability with other NATO defense systems. From a geopolitical standpoint, acquiring the Chunmoo would strengthen Norway’s strategic ties with South Korea, a key partner in Asia, and diversify its military relations beyond its traditional European and American allies. In the context of increasing tensions in Eastern Europe and the Arctic, particularly with Russia, a precision strike system like the Chunmoo would provide Norway with enhanced capabilities to respond swiftly to threats and contribute to deterrence efforts. Furthermore, this cooperation could create industrial opportunities for Norwegian companies, while solidifying Norway’s position as a key player in regional defense and within NATO. Hanwha Aerospace, South Korea's largest defense and aerospace group, continues to expand its presence in the international market. Specializing in the production of armored vehicles, and precision-guided munitions, and active in the space sector through the Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV) program, the company aims to increase its footprint in Europe. The Chunmoo MLRS offer to Norway is part of this strategy, presenting a high-performance system capable of significantly enhancing Norway’s long-range artillery capabilities while contributing to collective defense within NATO in an evolving security environment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/chunmoo-mlrs-by-hanwha-aerospace-could-emerge-as-a-new-platform-for-cooperation-with-norway	2025-02-27T07:31:51-08:00

Taiwan Mobilizes Military as China Launches Live-Fire Drills Near Its Coast	On February 26, 2025, Taiwan deployed its land, naval, and air forces in response to live-fire military exercises conducted by China off its coast. The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense condemned these maneuvers as a direct threat to regional security and a violation of international norms, as Beijing continues to increase military pressure on the island, which it claims as part of its territory. This latest escalation comes amid repeated Chinese air and maritime incursions around Taiwan, heightening uncertainty over the future of the strait. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese forces deployed to monitor, alert, and respond as China conducts live-fire drills near the island (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) According to Taipei's official statement, China mobilized 32 military aircraft as part of a joint combat exercise involving warships. At the same time, Beijing announced live-fire drills in a zone approximately 40 nautical miles off southern Taiwan, near the waters of Kaohsiung and Pingtung, where key Taiwanese military bases are located. In response, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense ordered the deployment of surveillance and defense forces to 'monitor, alert, and respond appropriately' to what it considers a violation of international regulations. Taiwanese authorities condemned China's unilateral designation of a military exercise zone so close to its territory without prior warning, calling it a reckless act that endangers civilian and military navigation. In addition to the risks posed to maritime and air traffic, Taipei views this operation as a major provocation aimed at destabilizing the region. Later in the day, Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense confirmed that Chinese forces had left the exercise area after several hours of activity but emphasized that the threat remains. These exercises occur as Beijing strengthens its military presence across the Asia-Pacific region. Less than a week earlier, the People's Liberation Army had conducted live-fire drills off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, prompting concerns from local authorities and forcing several commercial flights to alter their routes. This expansion of Chinese military activities signals an increasing effort to establish a dominant presence in the region. Meanwhile, China continues to reinforce its discourse on reunification with Taiwan. The official Xinhua news agency reported that Wang Huning, a senior leader of the Chinese Communist Party, recently urged Chinese authorities to 'firmly grasp the initiative in cross-strait relations and resolutely advance the cause of national reunification.' These statements, combined with recent military actions, indicate a more assertive approach by Beijing to exert pressure on Taiwan. In response to this growing challenge, the Taiwanese government reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening its defense capabilities. The Ministry of Defense stated that China’s policy, which claims to support 'peaceful coexistence' with Taiwan, contradicts its actions, as military incursions into the island’s maritime and aerial zones continue to increase. Taipei interprets these maneuvers as attempts to intimidate its population and test the responsiveness of its armed forces. Rising tensions around Taiwan remain a significant source of friction between China and the United States. While Washington maintains a policy of 'strategic ambiguity,' it is legally bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide the island with the means to defend itself in the event of Chinese aggression. However, there remains uncertainty regarding whether the U.S. would directly intervene militarily in a potential conflict. Amid this military and diplomatic standoff, Taipei continues to enhance its defense capabilities by modernizing its armed forces and strengthening strategic alliances. The situation in the Taiwan Strait remains highly volatile, with each new military maneuver increasing concerns over a potential confrontation between China and Taiwan.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-mobilizes-military-as-china-launches-live-fire-drills-near-its-coast	2025-02-27T01:30:00-08:00
