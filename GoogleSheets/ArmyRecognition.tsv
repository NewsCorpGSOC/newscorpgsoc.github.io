Breaking News: Iran's IRGC Navy Reveals Secret Underground Naval Base Housing Dozens of Missile Assault Boats	On January 18, 2025, Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveiled an underground naval missile base at an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf. The base, one of several underground facilities built to house vessels capable of launching long-range missiles and conducting distant warfare, was revealed by IRGC Chief Commander Hossein Salami. During ongoing war games, Salami visited the secret base and highlighted its strategic significance in enhancing Iran’s naval capabilities and deterrence in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from a video broadcast by IRGC-affiliated media showing the newly unveiled underground naval base in the Persian Gulf, housing several missile-equipped assault boats. (Picture source: Iranian state media video footage) This naval underground facility is part of a larger network of 'cities' specifically designed to house and deploy the IRGC (Iran Revolutionary Guard) Navy’s combat vessels. These subterranean complexes are central to Iran's naval defense strategy, allowing the IRGC to quickly mobilize its fleet of missile-equipped assault boats in the region. General Salami, in his speech at the unveiling, emphasized that the base is just one small component of a much larger system of subterranean installations. He asserted that the IRGC Navy operates numerous such bases, all designed to reinforce its operational resilience and readiness against external threats. By hiding these vessels in underground facilities, the IRGC significantly complicates efforts to locate and neutralize its fleet, providing a strategic advantage in the event of regional conflict. The underground base is specifically tailored to house fast-moving, missile-equipped boats, which are a core component of the IRGC Navy's asymmetric warfare strategy. These boats, capable of launching precision-guided missiles, allow the IRGC to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries, particularly the U.S. Navy, which operates in the region. The base also includes vessels equipped for mine-laying, further enhancing the IRGC’s ability to control key maritime chokepoints in the Strait of Hormuz and the broader Persian Gulf. The ability to lay naval mines is a critical element of Iran's strategy to deny access to critical shipping routes, complicating operations for foreign naval forces in the region. The choice to build such a base underground stems from several strategic considerations. First, it offers protection from airstrikes, which is increasingly important as satellite surveillance and precision-guided munitions become more advanced. With many foreign powers, particularly the United States, capable of targeting and destroying surface ships, housing assets in hidden underground facilities helps mitigate this risk. Furthermore, by dispersing its fleet across multiple hidden sites, the IRGC enhances the survivability of its naval forces. This network of subterranean bases ensures that if one or more facilities are attacked, others remain operational, allowing for continuity in defense operations. Another crucial reason behind this underground infrastructure is the IRGC's focus on asymmetric warfare. Unlike traditional naval forces, which rely on large surface ships, Iran uses small, fast-moving missile boats that can strike quickly and retreat before enemy forces can respond. This hit-and-run tactic is central to Iran's approach to naval defense, allowing them to challenge more powerful forces using low-cost, high-impact weapons. The underground bases also make it more difficult for enemies to predict the locations of these vessels, giving the IRGC the element of surprise. The unveiling of this base also underscores Iran’s growing emphasis on maritime defense, especially as tensions in the Persian Gulf continue to rise. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil passes, is a vital geopolitical chokepoint. By deploying missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels, Iran can create a constant threat to any foreign navy operating in the region, potentially disrupting global oil trade. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies persist, these developments serve as a reminder of Iran's commitment to maintaining control over this strategic waterway. Looking forward, General Salami's remarks suggest that the underground base is only a fraction of the IRGC’s broader defense infrastructure. Iran is continuing to build a network of such subterranean complexes, all designed to enhance its naval deterrence capabilities. These bases, hidden from view and designed to withstand airstrikes, play a key role in Iran’s defense strategy. As the IRGC expands its network of underground facilities, it is clear that the regime intends to continue fortifying its naval power while challenging foreign naval dominance in the region. The unveiling of this underground combat vessel base marks a significant milestone in Iran's ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen its IRGC Navy. With missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels strategically housed in these subterranean complexes, Iran is positioning itself to exert greater influence over the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This move further solidifies the IRGC’s asymmetric warfare capabilities, and as the region remains on edge, global powers will be closely watching Iran's growing naval infrastructure for its broader implications on regional security and maritime stability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-irans-irgc-navy-reveals-secret-underground-naval-base-housing-dozens-of-missile-assault-boats	2025-01-18T17:50:50-08:00	
Flash Info: US Navy MH-60R Seahawk Helicopter Shoot Down Aerial Drone in Flight for the First Time	On January 16, 2025, Admiral James Kilby, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, revealed an important milestone for U.S. Navy aviation. During his address at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium near Washington, D.C., Admiral Kilby confirmed that a U.S. Navy MH-60R 'Romeo' Seahawk helicopter deployed to the Red Sea had successfully shot down a drone operated by Houthi militants. This event, first reported by The War Zone, an online platform covering defense, military technology, and security-related topics, marks the first time a U.S. Navy helicopter has engaged and downed an enemy UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in flight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, a multi-role maritime helicopter, played a pivotal role in the first-ever shootdown of an aerial drone in flight over the Red Sea, marking a significant milestone in counter-drone operations. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The specific type of aerial drone targeted and the exact method used by the U.S. Navy Mh-60R Seahawk naval helicopter to neutralize the UAV remain undisclosed. However, Admiral Kilby mentioned that the helicopter crew had employed 'a little bit of an unconventional system' to carry out the operation. This statement hints at the use of non-traditional or advanced technologies to deal with the increasingly common threat posed by drones in maritime and conflict zones. The MH-60R Seahawk is a versatile and multi-role maritime helicopter used extensively by the U.S. Navy. Primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), and reconnaissance missions, the MH-60R is equipped with a suite of advanced sensors and armaments, making it well-suited for conventional and unconventional operations. Its core capabilities include detecting and tracking submarines, conducting surface strikes against maritime targets, and providing real-time intelligence and surveillance for fleet operations. The Seahawk is fitted with the state-of-the-art APS-153 radar system, a multi-mode radar capable of detecting both surface and airborne threats, which would have been crucial in identifying and tracking the Houthi drone. Additionally, the helicopter is equipped with advanced sonar and communications systems that allow for precise coordination with other naval assets. Regarding armament, the MH-60R is armed with a range of precision-guided weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Mk 50 torpedoes, and various machine guns. These capabilities make it a formidable platform for engaging both surface and air targets, as well as providing close-air support to ground forces. The versatility of the MH-60R, coupled with its powerful sensors and armament, positions it as an essential tool in modern naval warfare, capable of addressing a broad range of threats from conventional naval targets to emerging asymmetrical threats like drones. In this case, it can be speculated that the U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, with its advanced radar and sensor systems, likely played a key role in detecting the Houthi drone. However, downing a drone in flight, especially in a maritime environment, is far from simple. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are often small, agile, and capable of flying at low altitudes, which makes them challenging to detect and track. Given the operational challenges in the Red Sea, including potential interference from variable weather conditions, electromagnetic noise from the sea, and the unpredictable flight patterns of drones, the engagement would have required precise coordination and possibly unconventional methods to overcome these obstacles. The success of this operation underscores the Seahawk's advanced detection and tracking capabilities, but the exact nature of how the drone was engaged remains speculative at this stage. The growing use of drones in the Red Sea region, particularly by Houthi rebels, has added another layer of complexity to maritime security operations. The Houthis have increasingly deployed drones in their ongoing conflict with Saudi-led coalition forces, targeting both military assets and civilian shipping. Drones are often used to strike critical infrastructure, including oil tankers and naval vessels, raising concerns over the safety of international shipping routes. In this context, the successful downing of a drone by a U.S. Navy Seahawk is more than just a tactical victory—it represents a significant step in the evolving counter-drone capabilities of naval forces. The Red Sea's importance as a vital global trade route means that ensuring its security is of paramount concern for international naval forces. With the proliferation of UAV technology, particularly in conflict zones, the ability to intercept and neutralize these threats is becoming an essential capability for modern naval operations. The engagement of the drone by the U.S. Navy's MH-60R Seahawk is a noteworthy achievement, signaling the increasing importance of counter-drone capabilities within naval forces. As Admiral Kilby’s comments highlight, the use of 'unconventional systems' to take out the UAV underscores the innovative approaches needed to address the growing threat of drones in maritime operations. This successful mission also reinforces the idea that the battlefield is evolving—naval forces are no longer just focused on traditional threats like surface combatants and submarines but must also contend with the growing menace of UAVs. As demonstrated in this historic operation, the U.S. Navy’s ability to adapt to these new challenges will be crucial for maintaining maritime security in the Red Sea and beyond. As drone technology continues to evolve, it is likely that naval forces will increasingly rely on both conventional and unconventional means to detect, track, and neutralize these threats. The integration of advanced sensors, electronic warfare, and other countermeasures will shape the future of naval operations in increasingly complex and contested environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-info-us-navy-mh-60r-seahawk-helicopter-shoot-down-aerial-drone-in-flight-for-the-first-time	2025-01-18T03:10:41-08:00	
Exclusive: US Navy Enhances Defense of combat ship with Hellfire Missiles and Advanced Counter-Drone Systems	On January 16, 2025, the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) announced a significant enhancement to the defense capabilities of the U.S. Navy combat ships, with the USS Indianapolis (LCS 17), a forward-deployed Freedom-variant littoral combat ship (LCS), receiving critical upgrades to its Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) capabilities. As part of this upgrade, the ship has integrated Longbow Hellfire (LBHF) missiles into its Surface-to-Surface Missile Module (SSMM) to enhance its ability to counter both traditional maritime threats and emerging aerial challenges posed by unmanned systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missile launches from the Surface-To-Surface Missile Module (SSMM) aboard the Independence-variant Littoral Combat Ship USS Montgomery (LCS 8). The missile exercise was the first proof-of-concept launch of the Longbow Hellfire missile against a land-based target. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The LBHF (Longbow Hellfire ) missile, originally designed to counter small boat threats with its precision-guided capabilities, now plays a dual role in neutralizing drones and other aerial threats. The Longbow Hellfire variant incorporates radar-guided technology, enabling it to engage targets in adverse weather conditions and through battlefield clutter, significantly improving its effectiveness in complex operational environments. With a range of up to 8 kilometers, the LBHF missile uses a laser-guided warhead for high precision, while its radar seeker offers enhanced target acquisition, even in conditions where visibility is limited. This integration of Hellfire missiles into the C-UAS (Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System) suite allows the U.S. Navy USS Indianapolis Littoral Combat Ship to rapidly neutralize both surface and aerial threats, reinforcing the LCS's (Littoral Combat Ship) adaptability in the face of modern multi-domain challenges. The SSMM (Surface-to-Surface Missile Module) was originally designed to counter surface threats, particularly targeting small boats in littoral waters. Equipped with the Longbow Hellfire (LBHF) missile, the LCS (Littoral Combat Ship) gained the capability to engage such threats at extended ranges, using vertically launched Hellfire missiles. The Hellfire missile system has proven highly effective for naval forces due to its precision and versatility. The missile's versatility extends beyond surface targets to land-based and air threats, with the Longbow Hellfire version offering significant advantages in terms of target acquisition and tracking in all-weather conditions. This version of the Hellfire missile incorporates radar-guided technology to improve tracking and targeting in poor visibility, such as fog, rain, or smoke, ensuring the missile can engage fast-moving maritime targets with high accuracy even in challenging environments. With the growing presence of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) on modern battlefields, the U.S. Navy recognized the need to equip its ships with more advanced systems to counter these threats. The USS Indianapolis is now among the first ships in the Navy to benefit from the integration of C-UAS technology into its existing capabilities. Drones, with their ability to operate in a variety of roles from surveillance and reconnaissance to offensive strike missions, present a complex challenge for naval defense forces. Their low cost, mobility, and range of operational uses make them a difficult threat to counter. The C-UAS capabilities aboard the USS Indianapolis allow it to detect, track, and neutralize these aerial threats, further enhancing its operational flexibility. In 2022, the SSMM demonstrated its ability to counter land-based threats with a successful land attack demonstration, highlighting the module's evolving role in meeting a broader spectrum of threats. The integration of C-UAS capabilities into the module underscores the Navy's recognition of the growing threat posed by unmanned systems, which both state and non-state actors increasingly use to challenge naval superiority. The flexibility of the LCS—a ship designed for rapid adaptation through modular mission packages—enables it to quickly incorporate new capabilities such as the C-UAS system and Longbow Hellfire missiles, thus ensuring that the ship remains highly effective against emerging threats. The Longbow Hellfire missile is a sophisticated, precision-guided weapon that was originally developed for use by Apache AH-64 helicopters to engage both ground and aerial targets. It is part of the Hellfire family of missiles, but the Longbow variant incorporates advanced radar-guided technology, which distinguishes it from other versions of the missile. The Longbow Hellfire is equipped with a millimeter-wave radar seeker that allows it to track targets with a high degree of precision, even in adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog, or smoke. This capability is particularly valuable in dynamic combat environments, where traditional line-of-sight targeting can be compromised. The radar seeker enables the missile to engage targets in all-weather conditions, day or night, making it highly versatile. Its laser guidance system also ensures that it can be used effectively in tandem with other targeting platforms, giving it flexibility in both air-to-ground and surface-to-surface engagements. Integrating the Longbow Hellfire missile into a ship, particularly a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) like the USS Indianapolis, is unique because of the missile’s ability to adapt to a variety of combat scenarios and its ability to be fired vertically, as opposed to being launched from an aircraft or a ground-based platform.

On January 15, 2025, Infodefensa reported that the Chilean Army is considering purchasing Senator 4x4 armored vehicles from the Canadian manufacturer Roshel Inc. as part of a revised approach to the Cromo project. Initiated in 2018 by the Army Projects and Research Directorate (Dipride), the Cromo project aimed to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Over 1,400 Roshel Senator 4x4 armored vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation, and Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility in Shelby Township, Michigan. (Picture source: Roshel) The original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles for the Mechanized Battalion of the 1st Buin Infantry Regiment, with a budget allocation of $111.8 million. Due to delays and complications, the tender process was declared void in April 2024, prompting an expansion of the project’s scope to include 4x4 and 6x6 platforms. The initial tender specified several requirements, including vehicles capable of carrying ten personnel, meeting NATO STANAG 4569 Level 3 standards for ballistic and mine protection, and integrating remote weapon stations for NATO-classified armaments. These vehicles were intended for use in non-war military operations, disaster response, and training in Peldehue, located north of Santiago. However, financial limitations and challenges integrating L3Harris telecommunications systems led to the rejection of all submitted bids. Following the cancellation of the tender, the Chilean Army issued a request for information (RFI) to manufacturers, expanding its interest to 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 configurations. Companies responding to the RFI include BMC and Otokar from Turkey, Excalibur Army from the Czech Republic, Iveco from Italy, Patria Group from Finland, and General Dynamics Land Systems. The RFI outlined specifications such as STANAG 4569 Level 2/2A/2B protection, operational functionality in extreme conditions at altitudes above 4,500 meters, and temperature ranges from -20°C to 45°C. The vehicles are also expected to demonstrate versatility across various terrains. Roshel’s Senator 4x4 is among the vehicles being evaluated. This Canadian-made Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle has been used in Ukraine, with more than 1,400 units delivered since 2022. Reports from Ukraine have described the vehicle’s reliability and off-road performance under frontline conditions. Therefore, the Chilean Army is reportedly considering direct procurement of the Senator through the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), bypassing a competitive bidding process. This method has been criticized for potentially limiting market competition and excluding alternatives, such as Colombia’s Hunter TR-12 or France’s Arquus Bastion. Chile's original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle.

Belgium Invests in Mine Countermeasures with New Ship Liege	According to information published by the Belgian MoD on January 16, 2025, a momentous occasion for the Belgian Navy and the city of Liege unfolded at the Giurgiu shipyard in Romania with the keel-laying ceremony for the Liege, a new mine countermeasures vessel (MCMV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of the Belgian City-class rMcM Liege. (Picture source: Belgian MoD) The keel-laying, a traditional naval ceremony symbolizing the beginning of a ship’s construction, was attended by Belgian Navy officials, local dignitaries, and representatives from Liège. The Liège is being constructed as part of the Belgian-Dutch Replacement Mine Countermeasures (rMCM) program, a joint initiative to replace the aging minehunting fleets of both nations. The ship’s construction follows a phased approach, beginning with the assembly of its hull in Romania. Once this stage is completed, the vessel will be transported to Concarneau, France, where advanced systems and equipment will be installed by Naval Group, a key partner in the project. After its completion, the Liège will undergo rigorous testing, including harbor and sea trials, before being equipped with its weapon systems in Lorient, France. The Liège is one of 12 vessels being built under the rMCM program, with six designated for the Belgian Navy and six for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Scheduled for full operational deployment by 2030, these ships will incorporate innovative minehunting technologies, including a fleet of approximately 100 unmanned drones. These systems, part of a modular toolbox, will enhance the fleet’s ability to detect and neutralize mines effectively. Context Historically, mine warfare in the North Sea has been a pivotal aspect of naval strategy due to the region's strategic importance as a maritime gateway. During the World Wars, the North Sea became a critical theater for deploying naval mines to control access, protect key shipping routes, and limit the movement of enemy fleets. In World War I, the North Sea saw the implementation of extensive minefields, such as the North Sea Mine Barrage. This Allied operation aimed to deter German U-boat activity by creating a massive minefield stretching between Scotland and Norway. Over 70,000 mines were laid in deep waters, marking one of the most ambitious mining operations of the time. The barrage was a logistical feat, demonstrating the role of mines in countering undersea threats, although its actual effectiveness remains debated. During World War II, the North Sea once again became a contested space. Both the Axis and Allied forces employed mines extensively, using them to blockade ports, disrupt shipping lanes, and deny access to critical areas. Mines proved to be a relatively inexpensive yet highly effective tool for naval dominance. The German Navy used magnetic mines, a technological innovation of the era, to great effect, challenging traditional mine-sweeping techniques and forcing the Allies to develop countermeasures. The aftermath of these conflicts left thousands of mines scattered across the seabed, posing long-term risks to navigation, fishing, and infrastructure development. The effort to clear these mines was a monumental task undertaken in the post-war years, and unexploded ordnance from these periods continues to be discovered and neutralized today.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/belgium-invests-in-mine-countermeasures-with-new-ship-liege	2025-01-17T04:49:25-08:00

NATO Surveillance Mission French Aircraft Faces Russian Hostility in Baltic Sea	As reported by Le Figaro, a high-tension incident occurred on January 16, 2025, during an aerial surveillance mission over the Baltic Sea. A French Navy Atlantique 2 (ATL2) operating under NATO's framework was targeted by Russian forces while conducting a surveillance flight in response to recent undersea cable damage. The French Armed Forces General Staff confirmed this event, which an AFP journalist witnessed firsthand onboard the aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Atlantique 2 is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) The aircraft departed Brittany earlier that day and was tasked with inspecting approximately 200 vessels operating in international waters near Sweden and the Baltic states. During the mission, the plane encountered electronic jamming and was designated by a fire-control radar, a procedure known in military terms as ' illumination.' According to Colonel Guillaume Vernet, spokesperson for the General Staff, this act signals hostility, even though it is not uncommon in this strategically sensitive region. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions. It is an evolution of the Breguet Atlantic, featuring advanced operational capabilities, robust endurance, and notable maneuverability. Its bilobed fuselage houses a pressurized cabin and a large weapons bay, supporting its versatility.

Equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, the ATL2 features a magnetic anomaly detector, a 360° Iguane radar, and a FLIR infrared sensor, enabling day-and-night surface target identification. It is powered by two Rolls Royce Tyne Mk21 turboprop engines, reaching speeds of up to 648 km/h. Its armament includes AM39 missiles, MU90 torpedoes, and laser-guided bombs, supported by a 12-member crew handling systems, intelligence, and mission execution. The professionalism of the French crew was pivotal in preventing escalation despite the heightened tensions. Colonel Vernet emphasized that Russia’s radar illumination aimed to express restrained hostility, stopping short of direct military action. An attack on a NATO aircraft would have risked triggering a severe and uncontrollable escalation with the Alliance. This incident occurs amid growing suspicions of sabotage targeting critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Over recent months, several undersea communication and power cables have been damaged. On December 25, the EstLink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia, along with several telecommunication lines, were compromised shortly after similar events in Swedish waters. Finnish authorities suspect Russian involvement and have seized the Eagle S, a tanker under the Cook Islands flag, allegedly part of a Russian 'ghost fleet.' General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, described the event as 'serious,' noting that such provocations are not confined to Europe. Experts, including former military aviator Xavier Tytelman, highlighted the risks of miscalculation or immediate responses in such situations, which could inadvertently lead to significant escalation. Despite these provocations, the ATL2 completed its mission without identifying suspicious vessels. However, the incident underscores the persistent confrontations in the Baltic region, where hybrid warfare tactics and intimidation measures are prevalent. NATO continues to heighten its vigilance, reflecting the ongoing challenges to maritime security and regional stability posed by geopolitical rivalries. The Baltic Sea has long been a hotspot for tensions between Russia and NATO member states, characterized by frequent interceptions of military aircraft. Russian planes, such as Su-27 Flankers and Il-20s, often operate without flight plans or active transponders in international airspace, complicating their identification and endangering air safety. In response, NATO interceptors, including German and British Eurofighters, are routinely deployed to escort these aircraft out of the area. While these encounters are typically handled professionally, they exemplify the heightened geopolitical strains fueled by the Ukraine conflict and intensified military activities on both sides.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/nato-surveillance-mission-french-aircraft-faces-russian-hostility-in-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T00:09:01-08:00

The missile, which has been in development for several years, is part of a broader strategy to enhance Iran's ability to deter and defend against maritime threats. These new launcher units will be integrated into both the Iranian Navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy, providing a new layer of operational flexibility and reach for the country’s defense forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new mobile launcher unit for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship missile, delivered to the Iranian Navy on January 16, 2025, enhances Iran's naval strike capabilities with increased mobility and operational flexibility (Picture source: X Account Hamid) First unveiled in August 2020, the Abu Mahdi cruise missile is a domestically developed long-range anti-ship weapon with a striking range of over 1,000 kilometers. Named after the influential Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the missile has been designed to deliver both anti-ship and land-attack capabilities, providing Iran with a versatile tool to challenge naval forces operating in its strategic waters. One of the most significant features of the Abu Mahdi missile is its long range, which at over 1,000 kilometers, is approximately three times the range of Iran's previous most capable anti-ship missiles, such as the 350 km Raad missile and the 300 km Qadir missile. This substantial increase in range allows Iran to project its power much further, complicating the ability of adversaries to operate near its coastline. The Abu Mahdi missile is equipped with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)-powered guidance, which allows it to perform advanced maneuvering in-flight, avoiding radar detection through low-altitude flight patterns and unpredictable course alterations. These features make the missile particularly effective against heavily defended targets such as aircraft carriers and naval vessels equipped with advanced air defense systems. This combination of long-range capabilities and high precision makes the Abu Mahdi a formidable tool in Iran's naval arsenal. The newly delivered mobile launcher units will allow the Abu Mahdi missiles to be deployed quickly and efficiently from various locations, enhancing their operational flexibility. These launchers can fire multiple missiles at short intervals and from diverse fixed and mobile platforms, enabling Iranian forces to strike multiple targets simultaneously and with a variety of attack trajectories. The dual-mode seekers on the Abu Mahdi, which combine both active and passive radar homing systems, are designed to ensure high precision even in the face of electronic warfare attempts. The integration of mobile launchers with the missile system further complicates adversaries' attempts to neutralize Iran's capabilities. The delivery of these launcher units significantly extends Iran's naval deterrence capabilities. With the Abu Mahdi missile, Iranian forces now possess a weapon that can strike enemy ships from a distance well beyond their shores, effectively forcing foreign military assets, such as aircraft carriers, to stay at least 1,000 kilometers from Iranian waters. This ability to deny access to large swathes of the Persian Gulf and beyond significantly alters the regional naval balance of power. As Iranian defense officials have emphasized, the Abu Mahdi missile is a crucial component of Iran's strategy to defend its maritime borders and exert influence over the Strait of Hormuz, through which a substantial portion of global oil shipments pass. The missile's advanced guidance systems and ability to operate from various platforms, including coastal installations and ships, further enhance its role in Iran's defense strategy. The importance of anti-ship missile capabilities for Iran cannot be overstated, especially in the context of its current strategic environment. Iran is located in a region where maritime security is a constant concern, with the strategic Strait of Hormuz being a chokepoint for global oil transport and a focal point for international tension. In recent years, Iran's adversarial relations with Israel have intensified, with both countries accusing each other of hostile actions and interventions. Israel's growing presence and alliances in the region, particularly in the Mediterranean and around the Gulf, have heightened Iran's concerns over its maritime sovereignty and the security of its critical oil exports. In this volatile context, the Abu Mahdi missile system represents a crucial component of Iran's broader military strategy to deter any foreign military intervention, particularly by Israel and its allies. With the ability to strike naval assets at ranges previously beyond Iran's reach, these missiles bolster Tehran’s strategic posture, allowing it to challenge the naval superiority of regional adversaries, including Israel, and create a formidable defense against any attempts to restrict its maritime access. The Abu Mahdi missile, with its ability to target enemy vessels from a distance and evade advanced radar systems, ensures that Israel and other regional powers would have to stay far out of range to avoid devastating strikes. This increases the deterrence effect, complicating any military planning and making any potential naval engagement in the Persian Gulf a highly risky endeavor. The successful integration of mobile launchers into Iran's naval strategy underscores the increasing sophistication of its military assets, positioning it as a formidable maritime force in the Middle East. The delivery of these mobile launchers for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship cruise missiles represents a major leap in Iran's naval defense capabilities. Iran has significantly bolstered its deterrence capabilities by enhancing its range, precision, and flexibility of its missile forces, making it better positioned to defend its territorial waters and project power in the region. With these new assets in place, Iran’s military is now more capable of challenging foreign naval forces and asserting its dominance in the strategically vital waters of the Persian Gulf.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-strengthens-anti-ship-arsenal-with-new-mobile-abu-mahdi-missiles-launchers	2025-01-16T08:23:52-08:00

The vehicles delivered to Croatia are based on the baseline ODS model, which lacks certain features such as second-generation FLIR and the Driver’s Vision Enhancer included in the 300+ ODS-SA variants delivered to Ukraine. These Bradleys have undergone refurbishments at the Đuro Đaković facility, including drivetrain overhauls, weapon system integration, and protective coatings. Upgrades also include enhancements to engines, transmissions, electronic systems, TOW anti-tank missile integration, and advanced communication systems. These modifications aim to improve situational awareness, protection, and NATO compatibility. Croatia's decision to acquire these US-made IFVs dates back to 2022 as part of an effort to replace its aging fleet of BVP M-80s, a Yugoslavian infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) developed in the 1970s to replace the M-60 armored personnel carrier. Its design was influenced by the Soviet BMP-1 and featured a fully amphibious chassis and a turret-mounted 20mm autocannon. The first prototype was completed in 1974, and the production model, M-80, entered service in 1979. The initial version used a French-built 260-horsepower engine, while the M-80A variant, introduced later, incorporated a domestically produced Daimler-Benz engine with 320 horsepower for improved performance. Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, approximately 1,000 units were manufactured. The M2A2 ODS-SA (Operation Desert Storm - Situational Awareness) is an upgraded version of the M2A2 Bradley, which incorporates improvements based on lessons from the Gulf War, such as enhanced armor, a 600hp engine for greater mobility, and situational awareness systems with cameras providing a 360-degree view. (Picture source: Croatian MoD) The BVP M-80A is equipped with a 20mm M-55 autocannon, a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun, and a launcher for 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank guided missiles, enabling engagement of various target types. It is protected by aluminum armor designed to shield against small arms fire and shell fragments. The vehicle can travel at speeds of up to 65 km/h on land and 8 km/h in water, with a range of approximately 500 kilometers. It has a crew of three and can carry seven infantry personnel. These older vehicles, which saw extensive use during the Yugoslav Wars, have demonstrated limited capabilities in firepower, protection, and communication systems compared to modern IFVs, such as the Bradley. The Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) was developed by the United States to transport infantry while providing protection and firepower, functioning alongside the M1 Abrams main battle tank. Development began in the 1960s in response to the Soviet BMP series, leading to the introduction of the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) and the M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) in the early 1980s. These vehicles were designed to support modern armored warfare, equipped with a 25mm M242 Bushmaster chain gun, TOW anti-tank missiles, and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, balancing mobility, protection, and firepower. The M2A2 ODS-SA (Operation Desert Storm - Situational Awareness) is an upgraded version of the M2A2 Bradley. It incorporates improvements based on lessons from the Gulf War, such as enhanced armor to withstand 30mm APDS rounds and RPGs, a 600hp engine for greater mobility, and situational awareness systems with cameras providing a 360-degree view. Other upgrades include an eye-safe laser rangefinder, GPS-based tactical navigation, and a combat identification system to improve operational efficiency, particularly in urban and close-combat environments.

(Picture source: Croatian MoD) The M2A2 ODS-SA has been deployed in various conflicts, including Ukraine, where its Bushmaster cannon has been used to engage targets ranging from BMP-1s to modern T-90M tanks. The 25mm autocannon enables rapid fire, and TOW missiles allow the engagement of heavily armored targets at extended ranges. The upgraded armor and situational awareness systems have contributed to crew protection and operational effectiveness. Recent deployments, including in Ukraine, have demonstrated its role in supporting infantry and countering enemy armor in modern combat scenarios. This excellent infantry fighting vehicle, however, will be replaced in the future by the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle (MICV), formerly known as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV). Croatia has recently undertaken significant military modernization efforts to enhance its defense capabilities and align with NATO standards. In April 2024, the Croatian Air Force received the first six of twelve French Dassault Rafale fighter jets, replacing its outdated MiG-21s, with the remaining six expected by 2025. Additionally, Croatia plans to acquire up to 50 German-made Leopard 2A8 tanks, replacing its Soviet-era M-84 tanks, which are being sent to Ukraine as part of military aid along with several RAK-SA-12 MLRS and two AN-32B transport aircraft. Furthermore, the acquisition of eight U.S. High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) is underway, marking a strategic advancement in Croatia's long-range precision strike capabilities. The partnership between Croatia and the United States has been a key component of these efforts. Established in 1996, it expanded following Croatia’s NATO accession in 2009 and EU membership in 2013. For instance, the Minnesota–Croatia National Guard Partnership has focused on joint training, crisis response, and modernization. The U.S. has provided Croatia with military equipment such as UH-60M Black Hawk and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters. Additionally, in October 2023, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III acknowledged Croatia’s contributions to Ukraine and NATO operations, emphasizing its growing role in security initiatives. Influenced by the Soviet BMP-1, the first prototype of the BVP M-80 infantry fighting vehicle was completed in 1974, and the production model entered service in 1979.

US Expresses Concern Over Pakistan's Development of Long-Range Ballistic Missiles	During a speech delivered on December 19 at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Jon Finer, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor, described Pakistan’s ballistic missile program as an 'emerging threat' to the United States. He highlighted that Pakistan is developing advanced missile technologies, such as high-powered rocket engines, which could eventually enable Islamabad to strike targets well beyond its region, potentially including the U.S. territory. This statement underscores the growing strain in U.S.-Pakistan relations, already fraught with tensions exacerbated by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and Washington's closer strategic alignment with India. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Shaheen-III long-range ballistic missile (Picture source: IISS) Pakistan’s ballistic missile arsenal, traditionally focused on regional deterrence against India, has undergone significant modernization in recent years. Among its systems, the Shaheen-III, still in development, is the longest-range missile in Pakistan’s inventory, with a range of 2,750 kilometers. Designed to target strategic areas such as India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this two-stage, solid-fueled missile can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads. Its mobility, provided by a Chinese transporter-erector-launcher, enhances its strategic flexibility. Speculation suggests it may eventually be equipped with multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to counter missile defenses. This modernization effort is bolstered by close technical cooperation with China and past collaborations with North Korea and Iran. Despite these advancements, U.S. officials assess that Pakistan’s ability to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of targeting the U.S. homeland remains years away. However, they express concern over the broader implications of Pakistan’s efforts for regional and global stability. On December 18, a day before Finer’s speech, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned National Development Complex, which plays a central role in missile development. Three additional entities were sanctioned for supplying critical materials for the program. These measures aim to curb the proliferation of missile technologies, although U.S. proposals for confidence-building measures, such as telemetry data sharing and test range limitations, were rejected by Islamabad. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in a statement issued on December 19, neither confirmed nor denied the development of long-range ballistic missiles but defended its strategic capabilities as essential for safeguarding sovereignty and maintaining peace in South Asia. The ministry also accused the U.S. of discriminatory practices undermining nonproliferation efforts and exacerbating regional military imbalances. This development signals a potential shift in Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence doctrine, historically focused on countering India. Such advancements may indicate ambitions to extend its strategic reach beyond the region, potentially complicating global nonproliferation efforts and contributing to a broader arms race. Meanwhile, India continues to develop its long-range missile systems, including the Agni-V with a range exceeding 5,200 kilometers, and is working on the Agni-VI to counter China’s capabilities. U.S. accusations regarding Pakistan’s missile program highlight a significant decline in bilateral relations once characterized by strategic cooperation. These revelations and subsequent sanctions intensify geopolitical tensions in South Asia, raising questions about Islamabad’s long-term strategic goals. As mutual distrust deepens, the prospect of a broader arms race threatens to reshape the regional and global strategic balance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-expresses-concern-over-pakistans-development-of-long-range-ballistic-missiles	2025-01-15T06:59:41-08:00

The Ministry of Defence aims to increase the number of tanks from 30 to 52 vehicles, which would require a total of 104 combat tanks to meet NATO’s operational requirements. The initial plan involved the acquisition of over 100 Leopard 2A8 tanks as part of a joint initiative with the German Ministry of Defence. However, the estimated €2 billion cost for acquiring such a large number of tanks, with each unit priced at approximately €25 million, has raised concerns about the financial feasibility of the program. These financial challenges have prompted Slovakia to reconsider its options, and the CV90120-T, a light tank, has now emerged as a viable alternative. The CV90120-T, developed by BAE Systems, offers a lighter and more cost-effective solution compared to the Leopard 2A8. First introduced in 1998, the CV90120-T has undergone several upgrades, and the latest version is priced at €11.5 million per unit—approximately half the cost of a Leopard 2A8. While its competitive price and capabilities make it an attractive option, the CV90120-T has not yet secured significant orders, but its affordability makes it an appealing choice for Slovakia’s military modernization efforts. Beyond the financial aspect, the CV90120-T offers additional benefits. Its integration into Slovakia’s fleet could lead to enhanced industrial cooperation and standardization with the CV9035 infantry fighting vehicles already on order. This potential synergy would not only improve operational efficiency but also strengthen Slovakia’s domestic defense industry by fostering increased local production. As Slovakia moves forward with its decision-making process, the country is evaluating factors such as financial affordability, operational readiness, and strategic partnerships. The final decision will aim to balance the need for a modern and capable armored force with the constraints of the national defense budget, ensuring that Slovakia continues to meet its NATO commitments while modernizing its armed forces. This decision reflects broader trends in defense procurement, where financial accessibility and strategic alignment are becoming increasingly important in the face of rising military costs. As Slovakia explores alternatives such as the CV90120-T, it underscores the importance of cost-effective solutions in maintaining a capable and sustainable defense posture in an evolving security environment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/slovakia-reconsiders-military-modernization-plans-and-considers-swedish-cv90120-t-light-tanks	2025-01-14T03:18:31-08:00

Flash Info: Denmark Plans Major Arctic Defense Boost with New Vessels Patrols and F-35 Fighter Jets in Greenland	On January 10, 2025, Denmark unveiled a comprehensive plan to significantly boost its military presence in Greenland, a strategically critical Arctic territory that has become the center of geopolitical attention due to growing interest from the United States. According to Danish TV channels DR and TV2, this expansion is primarily motivated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's continued focus on Greenland, underscoring its importance for U.S. security interests in the Arctic region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kangerlussuaq Airport in Greenland: A Strategic Hub for Military Operations and Future F-35 Deployments. (Picture source: Wikimedia) In response to U.S. ambitions, Denmark has proposed the purchase of two new Arctic inspection vessels to replace its aging fleet of four vessels currently operating in the region. These vessels are crucial for monitoring Greenland’s vast maritime borders, which span more than 2.1 million square kilometers, an area four times the size of France. The new ships will be better equipped to handle the demanding Arctic conditions, enhancing Denmark’s surveillance capabilities in a region that is increasingly becoming a hotspot for geopolitical rivalries. Alongside the new vessels, Denmark also plans to increase its dog sled patrols from the current 12, reinforcing its surveillance network across Greenland's rugged and ice-covered terrain. Dog sled patrols, although limited in reach, offer unmatched access to remote areas that are difficult to navigate with conventional vehicles. By expanding these patrols, Denmark aims to strengthen its monitoring and response capabilities in some of the most challenging environments on Earth. A key element of Denmark's military modernization involves the proposed upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport, a former U.S. military base in western Greenland. The plan includes making the airport capable of accommodating advanced F-35 fighter jets, a move that would significantly enhance Denmark’s air surveillance and rapid-response capabilities in the Arctic. Kangerlussuaq's strategic location near Greenland’s western coast, along the shortest route from North America to Europe, has long made it an attractive site for military operations. With the upgrades, Denmark would be able to deploy state-of-the-art aircraft for air patrols, surveillance, and deterrent operations, further bolstering its defense capabilities in the region. As part of its overall strategy to strengthen surveillance and intelligence in the Arctic, Denmark has committed $400 million to improve its long-range drone capabilities. These drones will be deployed to cover the vast, remote expanses of Greenland, providing critical real-time intelligence on military movements, environmental changes, and potential threats. This investment will help Denmark maintain a strategic edge in an increasingly contested region, especially as the Arctic's rapidly changing climate opens new shipping routes and access to natural resources. The ability to track and monitor these developments is essential to safeguarding Denmark's interests in the area. This strategic military buildup comes in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated remarks about Greenland's geopolitical importance. Trump has long expressed interest in Greenland, even suggesting in 2019 that the United States should purchase the island from Denmark. While this proposal was firmly rejected by both Denmark and Greenland’s leadership, Trump has continued to view Greenland as a critical asset to U.S. security. His recent statements in early January 2025 reaffirmed his belief that controlling Greenland is essential for U.S. national security. While not explicitly advocating for the island's purchase this time, Trump’s rhetoric signals an ongoing effort to assert U.S. influence in the Arctic, a region that is increasingly pivotal due to resource exploration, military competition, and climate change. Denmark, which holds responsibility for Greenland’s defense and security, has historically maintained limited military capabilities on the island. The existing forces include aging inspection vessels, a Challenger surveillance plane, and dog sled patrols, all tasked with monitoring a vast and inhospitable territory. These resources, though functional in the past, have proven insufficient to address the growing security concerns in the Arctic. The Danish government has acknowledged this limitation and, under increasing pressure, has begun to modernize its defense infrastructure to ensure Greenland’s protection in the face of rising external threats. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, is strategically located at the heart of Arctic geopolitics, a region where nations like Russia, Canada, and the United States are vying for influence. Denmark’s military investments reflect a concerted effort to secure Greenland’s sovereignty while preserving its semi-autonomous status. The island’s vast resources and strategic location make it a highly contested area, and as the U.S. seeks to bolster its military presence in the Arctic, Denmark faces the challenge of balancing its sovereignty over Greenland with maintaining strong defense ties to NATO, particularly with the U.S. In conclusion, Denmark's plan to invest in modernizing its military infrastructure in Greenland marks a crucial step in ensuring the island’s defense amidst growing geopolitical tensions. The proposed acquisitions of new Arctic inspection vessels, the expansion of dog sled patrols, and the upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport to accommodate F-35 jets demonstrate Denmark’s commitment to strengthening its Arctic defense. These measures not only respond to Donald Trump’s renewed interest in Greenland but also acknowledge the changing dynamics in the Arctic, ensuring Denmark remains a key player in the region's security as global powers vie for control over its resources and strategic assets.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-denmark-plans-major-arctic-defense-boost-with-new-vessels-patrols-and-f-35-fighter-jets-in-greenland	2025-01-14T02:39:35-08:00	
France Relies on FPV Drones to Redefine Role of Its Gazelle Combat Helicopters	While the U.S. Army canceled its latest reconnaissance and attack helicopter project in early 2024, the French Army has undertaken a strategic approach to modernizing its helicopter operations by integrating advanced technologies, particularly first-person view (FPV) drones. This ambitious initiative is part of a broader project to 'drone-enable' its operations by 2040. Recently, the 3rd Combat Helicopter Regiment (3e RHC) conducted an initial experiment integrating an FPV drone aboard a Gazelle helicopter. The drone was remotely piloted from the helicopter, marking a significant step toward effective collaboration between manned and unmanned platforms.

This ambitious initiative is part of a broader project to 'drone-enable' its operations by 2040. Recently, the 3rd Combat Helicopter Regiment (3e RHC) conducted an initial experiment integrating an FPV drone aboard a Gazelle helicopter. The drone was remotely piloted from the helicopter, marking a significant step toward effective collaboration between manned and unmanned platforms. The experiment pursued two key objectives: enhancing reconnaissance and combat support capabilities while testing the concept of 'air-launched devices' (ELA). This concept involves deploying drones for kinetic or non-kinetic missions at distances of 20 to 50 kilometers from the host helicopter. These drones could eventually operate in synergy with future Guépard helicopters, developed under the HIL program, which will gradually replace the Gazelle fleet. The FPV drones tested stand out for their agility and their ability to provide real-time video feeds to the operator through a virtual reality (VR) headset. Although specific details about the drones used have not been disclosed, images show an operator aboard the Gazelle using typical commercial drone control equipment adapted for military applications. Tactical uses include urban reconnaissance, target identification, guiding precision strikes, as well as electronic jamming or laser designation for artillery. Another crucial aspect is the compatibility of these drones with existing artillery systems, such as the Nexter CAESAR self-propelled howitzer. Drones could enhance intelligence loops by offering target acquisition and destruction capabilities at long range, thereby shortening the time between detection and action. In parallel, in January 2025, the French Army presented the DT-46 drone, a versatile platform designed for reconnaissance and tactical support missions. This convertible drone, weighing less than 30 kilograms, can take off vertically with its four rotors before transitioning to horizontal flight, covering distances of up to 100 kilometers with an endurance of five hours. Its ability to be assembled in 15 minutes and operated by a small team of four highlights its adaptability. Equipped with a retractable electro-optical turret, it is designed to meet the demands of modern combat environments. General David Cruzille, commander of the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT), highlighted that this initiative aligns with a combined employment doctrine for helicopters and drones, conceived 15 years ago but only now feasible due to technological advancements. This approach aims to reduce risks for crews while enhancing operational capabilities in complex and hostile environments. However, General Pierre Schill, Chief of Defense Staff, emphasized the continued importance of manned platforms. According to him, manned helicopters remain essential, particularly in scenarios involving disrupted communications or operations requiring rapid and adaptive human decision-making. These experiments represent the beginning of a broader transformation. With the goal of full 'drone enablement' by 2040, the French Army aims to develop innovative solutions that will redefine aerial operations in Europe and beyond. The integration of drones with manned platforms promises to improve mission effectiveness while reducing costs and risks to personnel. The test involving Gazelle helicopters and FPV drones is a critical step toward this future. It demonstrates the potential of drones as tactical force multipliers while laying the groundwork for an operational doctrine suited to contemporary challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/france-relies-on-fpv-drones-to-redefine-role-of-its-gazelle-combat-helicopters	2025-01-14T02:22:34-08:00	
Will three new ships deployed by Sweden prevent attacks on underwater infrastructure?	According to information published by Associated Press on January 12, 2025, Sweden will contribute up to three warships to a NATO-led initiative aimed at enhancing the alliance's presence in the Baltic Sea. The move is part of an effort to guard against potential sabotage of vital underwater infrastructure, the Swedish government announce.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Swedish Navy submarine rescue ship HSwMS Belos. (Picture source: Finnish MoD) In addition to the warships, Sweden’s military will deploy an ASC 890 surveillance aircraft to enhance situational awareness in the region. The Swedish Coast Guard will also play a significant role, with four ships dedicated to monitoring the Baltic Sea and an additional seven vessels on standby for rapid response. This marks Sweden's first operational contribution to NATO’s defense and deterrence efforts as a member of the alliance. The country formally joined NATO in March, becoming its 32nd member. Sweden's accession followed that of neighboring Finland and was spurred by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which significantly altered the security landscape in Northern Europe. The decision to strengthen NATO's presence in the Baltic comes amid a series of incidents in the region, raising concerns about possible Russian activities. The Baltic Sea, a crucial economic and strategic corridor, is crisscrossed by undersea cables and pipelines that connect Nordic, Baltic, and Central European nations. These infrastructures facilitate trade, enhance energy security, and, in some cases, reduce reliance on Russian energy resources. Sweden’s participation in this NATO operation comes at a pivotal moment for the alliance, which has been focusing on fortifying its eastern flank in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The Baltic Sea has become a focal point for these efforts, given its strategic location and the vulnerabilities of its underwater infrastructure. Comments Monitoring undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is particularly challenging due to the region's unique characteristics and the nature of the threats involved. The Baltic is one of the busiest maritime zones globally, with over 2,000 ships navigating its waters daily, including commercial cargo vessels, oil tankers, and fishing trawlers. This high density of maritime activity creates significant obstacles for identifying vessels that might pose a deliberate or accidental risk to undersea cables. The sheer volume of traffic makes it difficult to discern routine activities from those potentially harmful. The technological limitations in the detection and surveillance of undersea infrastructure further compound the problem. Current systems struggle to provide real-time monitoring of extensive cable networks, which often span hundreds or thousands of kilometers. The deep-sea environment adds complexity, with cables often lying on the seabed in remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor. Damage to cables can be caused by natural phenomena, such as seabed shifts or underwater currents, but deliberate sabotage, such as anchor dragging or the use of specialized underwater drones, is increasingly suspected. The covert nature of these activities makes attribution particularly difficult, leaving authorities reliant on indirect evidence or post-incident investigations. Jurisdictional and legal challenges also play a major role. Undersea cables frequently traverse international waters, where no single nation has the authority to enforce protective measures. This limits the ability of individual countries to act decisively against potential threats. Even within territorial waters, enforcement can be difficult due to overlapping national interests and the need for coordination between multiple stakeholders. Moreover, laws governing undersea infrastructure security are often outdated or insufficiently comprehensive, leaving gaps in enforcement and response capabilities. Adding to these challenges, the Baltic Sea itself poses unique geographical difficulties. Its relatively shallow depths, brackish water, and numerous islands create a complex maritime environment that can obscure monitoring efforts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/will-three-new-ships-deployed-by-sweden-prevent-attacks-on-underwater-infrastructure	2025-01-14T01:58:02-08:00	
Despite Tensions Over Greenland United States Delivers Three New F-35A Lightning IIs to Denmark	The Danish Air Force received three new Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II multirole fighters on January 12, 2025, marking a major milestone in its gradual transition from its aging fleet of F-16s. The three aircraft arrived at Skrydstrup Air Base on January 12, after departing Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and making a technical stopover in the Azores. Their delivery was supported by US Air Force aerial refueling aircraft, illustrating the close partnership between Denmark and the United States in developing next-generation combat capabilities for the Danish Air Force. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35A is a stealth multirole fighter designed to carry out conventional takeoff and landing missions. (Picture source: Danish MoD) According to the Danish Ministry of Defence, the arrival of these three fighters brings the total number of F-35As delivered to Denmark to 17. Of these 17 aircraft, 11 are now stationed on Danish soil, while the remaining 6 are still based at Luke to train Danish pilots and technicians. This 'dual-base' approach allows Denmark to gradually increase its operational availability while continuing to train its personnel on this fifth-generation fighter. Denmark’s F-35 program, designed to replace its end-of-life F-16s, calls for the delivery of a total of 27 aircraft. The first deliveries began in 2023, following the launch of Danish pilot training in the United States in 2020. The first Danish pilot took the controls of an F-35 in January 2021, flying a US Air Force aircraft—an example of the growing interoperability among the many nations operating the F-35. The Danish Air Force plans to reach Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its first F-35 squadron this year. As the F-35s gradually take over from the F-16s, they will notably assume air policing duties, essential for protecting Danish airspace. The complete transition to the F-35 will span several years, with a period of parallel operation of both aircraft types until the F-16 fleet is definitively retired. The F-35A is a stealth multirole fighter designed to carry out conventional takeoff and landing missions. It is an American aircraft developed by Lockheed Martin, in partnership with Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Singapore, Finland, Canada, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Greece, and Germany, have chosen this model to enhance their air defense capabilities. The F-35A’s armament notably includes an internal 20 mm M61A2 Vulcan cannon and advanced air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder. It can also carry guided bombs like the GBU-31 JDAM and the GBU-39 SDB, as well as munitions intended to counter enemy radars like the AGM-88 HARM. In addition, the fighter has external hardpoints capable of accommodating up to six additional weapons or fuel tanks. Its electronic and detection capabilities rely on a powerful AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, a Distributed Aperture System (DAS) providing 360-degree situational awareness, an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), as well as a Helmet-Mounted Display System (HMDS). It is equipped with secure data links and an electronic warfare suite to jam enemy radars and protect against missiles. Weighing up to 31,800 kilograms at takeoff, the F-35A is powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney F135-PW-100 turbofan engine providing 28,000 pounds of thrust dry and 43,000 pounds with afterburner, enabling it to reach a maximum speed of Mach 1.6 (about 1,930 km/h). Its range depends on the mission, varying from a combat radius of about 2,220 kilometers to more than 3,600 kilometers with an appropriate configuration. The aircraft measures 15.7 meters in length, 4.4 meters in height, and has a wingspan of 10.7 meters—dimensions that provide the flexibility needed to operate from a variety of air bases. Globally, more than 1,100 F-35s have already been delivered by Lockheed Martin, underscoring the growing adoption of this fighter by numerous air forces. Denmark thus becomes the fifth European country to put the F-35 into service on its national territory, after Norway, the Netherlands, and others. Belgium and Poland have also received their first F-35s, currently stationed in the United States for pilot training.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/despite-tensions-over-greenland-united-states-delivers-three-new-f-35a-lightning-iis-to-denmark	2025-01-14T01:56:08-08:00

The helicopter is assigned to the 341st Missile Wing, which is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and security of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), a key component of the United States' nuclear deterrence strategy. The MH-139A is based on the Leonardo AW139 multirole helicopter and was introduced under a $2.4 billion contract awarded to Boeing in September 2018 to replace the U.S. Air Force's aging UH-1N Huey fleet, in use since the 1970s.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6C-67C turboshaft engines, each providing 820 kW, the MH-139A Grey Wolf has a top speed of 269 km/h, a range of 1,432 kilometers, and an operational ceiling of 6,096 meters. (Picture source: Boeing) The 341st Missile Wing operates from Malmstrom Air Force Base, tasked with maintaining the readiness of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and securing missile field operations. The replacement of the UH-1N Huey with the MH-139A Grey Wolf introduces upgraded capabilities, including increased speed, extended range, and higher payload capacity. These features allow for more effective patrols, faster response to security threats, and improved transportation of personnel within the missile field complex. The Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) serves as the land-based component of the United States' nuclear triad, which also includes submarine-launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers. With a range exceeding 6,000 miles (approximately 9,656 km) and the capability to carry multiple warheads, the Minuteman III is maintained in a state of constant readiness, housed in hardened silos across several states. Regular test launches, such as the one conducted in November 2024, demonstrate its operational capability and reliability. Despite its age, the Minuteman III has undergone continuous modernization efforts to maintain its effectiveness, with plans to replace it with the LGM-35 Sentinel ICBM beginning in 2030. In 2018, the U.S. Air Force selected the MH-139A Grey Wolf, a military adaptation of the Leonardo AW139, over the UH-60 Black Hawk derivatives to replace its aging UH-1N Huey fleet. This decision was influenced by several factors. For instance, the Grey Wolf is designed to cruise 50% faster, operate 50% farther, and has a 30% larger cabin, allowing it to carry 5,000 pounds more payload. The MH-139A introduces full autopilot capability, reducing pilot workload, and emphasizes operational efficiency with lower operating and support costs. Manufactured at Leonardo's facility in northeast Philadelphia, where the baseline AW139 is produced, the MH-139A offers specific advancements over the UH-1N, including a 50% increase in both speed and range, a 30% larger cabin, and an additional payload capacity of 2,268 kilograms. The helicopter is equipped with updated avionics, situational awareness enhancements, and autopilot functionality, reducing pilot workload. The condition-based maintenance system is designed to reduce lifecycle costs by over $1 billion. It is also equipped with defensive systems such as chaff and flare dispensers, missile warning systems, and crashworthy fuel tanks. Optional configurations include M240 7.62 mm machine guns. The helicopter is intended for roles including missile field security, airlift, and search and rescue operations. Choosen in 2018 by the U.S. Air Force, the MH-139A Grey Wolf, a military adaptation of the Leonardo AW139, could cruise 50% faster, operate 50% farther, and has a 30% larger cabin compared to the UH-60 Black Hawk, allowing it to carry 5,000 pounds more payload. (Picture source: US Air Force) The MH-139A is derived from the Leonardo AW139 commercial helicopter with modifications to meet military requirements. The program represents the first major acquisition for Air Force Global Strike Command. Initial deliveries were delayed due to the need for Federal Aviation Administration certification, which is necessary for operations in domestic airspace. The first test helicopters were delivered in 2022, and the system achieved operational capability in March 2024. It participated in its first training exercise at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in September 2024. Regarding cost, the U.S. Air Force initially planned to acquire up to 84 MH-139A helicopters for approximately $2.38 billion, averaging about $28 million per unit. However, due to fiscal constraints and reassessments, the planned procurement was reduced to 26 aircraft, increasing the average unit cost to approximately $39.37 million, as Boeing integrates into a civilian AW139 helicopter military-specific equipment and systems to meet U.S. Air Force requirements. For instance, while both share the same airframe and core design, the MH-139A features military-specific systems, including advanced avionics, enhanced communication suites, and defensive countermeasures such as missile warning systems and chaff and flare dispensers. It includes additional survivability enhancements like cockpit and cabin armor and crashworthy, self-sealing fuel tanks. The MH-139A can also be armed with externally mounted M240 machine guns, a capability not present in the civilian AW139. It is designed for a range of missions such as security patrols, personnel and cargo transport, and search and rescue, reflecting operational demands that differ from those of the AW139. These distinctions enable the MH-139A to fulfill military roles while building on the AW139's existing capabilities. The MH-139A is a medium-lift helicopter with a rotor diameter of 13.78 meters, a length of 16.67 meters, and a maximum gross weight of 6,400 kilograms. It is powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6C-67C turboshaft engines, each providing 820 kW. It has a top speed of 269 km/h, a range of 1,432 kilometers, and an operational ceiling of 6,096 meters. The cabin can accommodate two pilots and up to 15 passengers, depending on mission requirements. The UH-1N Twin Huey, which the MH-139A replaces, was introduced in the 1970s as a twin-engine variant of the Bell 212. Developed by Bell Helicopter and powered by twin Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6T turboshaft engines, it was initially procured for the U.S. military despite concerns over its Canadian-produced engines. The UH-1N was used for ICBM field security, VIP transport, search and rescue, medical evacuation, and command-and-control missions. It saw deployment in conflicts including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. Over time, the UH-1N’s speed, range, and payload capacity became insufficient for evolving mission needs. The Air Force continued its use into the 2020s for specific missions, while newer models like the UH-1Y Venom and the MH-139A replaced it. The UH-1N Twin Huey, which the MH-139A replaces, was introduced in the 1970s as a twin-engine variant of the Bell 212, and was used by the 341st Missile Wing to secure the launch sites of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), a key component of the United States' nuclear deterrence strategy.

(Picture source: Wikimedia) This move comes as Iran continues to bolster its defense posture amid escalating tensions with Israel and ongoing concerns about its nuclear program. Rahimzadeh emphasized that both army and IRGC (Islamic Revolution Guards Corps) air defense units have been deployed near critical sites such as Natanz, enhancing their ability to detect and neutralize aerial threats. The air defense systems in place reportedly include new and advanced technologies, reflecting the country's determination to safeguard its sensitive nuclear infrastructure. The Natanz facility, a cornerstone of Iran's uranium enrichment program, has long been a focal point of international contention due to concerns over its potential role in the development of nuclear weapons. Iran's air defense upgrades signal its increasing focus on protecting such facilities and its broader preparedness for aerial challenges amid the complex security landscape. Rahimzadeh also stated that the air defense measures are part of a wider national strategy, with upcoming exercises planned to strengthen the country’s air defense capabilities. These drills will be conducted under the command of the integrated air defense network, an initiative designed to consolidate and enhance the effectiveness of Iran’s military and defensive resources. On January 8, 2025, the Defense Mirror website reported that Iran had ramped up its defense posture by conducting large-scale military exercises to protect its nuclear sites. These exercises come amid growing concerns over Israel's military stance and its potential for action against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Israel, which has consistently voiced its opposition to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, is said to be preparing for a military strike, fearing that Iran’s nuclear program could eventually lead to the development of nuclear weapons. The perceived threat from Iran’s nuclear program has been compounded by its ongoing support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, whose missile and drone attacks on Israel have heightened security concerns in Tel Aviv. These attacks have been attributed to Iranian assistance to the Houthi group, further fueling Israel’s fears of an expanding nuclear threat. In this context, Israeli defense officials are reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, with a sense of urgency mounting ahead of the upcoming change in the U.S. presidency. In October 2024, Israel conducted airstrikes against Iranian missile-production sites around Tehran. These strikes targeted key facilities, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. These attacks were seen as part of Israel's broader strategy to disrupt Iran's missile development and its nuclear capabilities. The airstrikes are believed to have been a direct response to what Israel perceives as a growing threat from Iran’s expanding missile and nuclear programs. The threat of an Israeli military response has been compounded by uncertainties surrounding the new U.S. administration, as President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January 2025. Israeli officials fear that Trump may prioritize diplomatic engagement with Iran over military action, which has created a sense of urgency in Tel Aviv to neutralize what it views as an existential threat before the transition of power. Iran's nuclear program has been a point of contention for over two decades, with the country maintaining that its nuclear activities are intended solely for peaceful purposes, such as energy production. However, the international community, particularly Israel and Western powers, has expressed concerns that Iran's nuclear ambitions could ultimately result in the development of nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has monitored Iran’s nuclear activities, issuing reports that have raised questions about Tehran’s compliance with international agreements. Despite the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, tensions have remained high, especially following the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in 2018. Since then, Iran has resumed some of its nuclear enrichment activities, increasing uranium enrichment levels beyond the limits set by the JCPOA. These developments have sparked renewed concern from the international community, with the United Nations and the European Union calling for greater transparency and accountability in Iran’s nuclear program. In the face of these growing concerns, Iran has invested heavily in its defense systems, particularly air defense, to protect its nuclear facilities from external threats. This includes the deployment of advanced missile defense systems around sensitive sites like Natanz. By enhancing its military capabilities, Iran seeks to send a clear message about its resolve to maintain its nuclear sovereignty, despite the international pressure to curtail its nuclear program. The strategic considerations of regional powers like Israel and global players like the United States further complicate the situation surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. The potential for military confrontation remains high, with Israel reportedly preparing for the possibility of an attack on Iran's nuclear sites. The trajectory of this crisis will largely depend on the actions of key stakeholders, including the new U.S. administration under President Trump, Israel’s military strategy, and Iran’s willingness to engage in further diplomacy or continue its nuclear activities. As Iran continues to strengthen its defenses and conduct military exercises to safeguard its nuclear infrastructure, the risk of an escalation in the region remains significant. The potential for a military confrontation, especially between Israel and Iran, could have far-reaching implications not only for the Middle East but for global security as a whole. With the situation continuing to evolve, the international community must closely monitor developments in Iran's nuclear program and its military posture, while also considering diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-deploys-new-air-defense-systems-to-protect-nuclear-facility-amid-threat-of-israeli-airstrikes	2025-01-10T09:09:30-08:00

Secretary Austin’s statement reflects the Biden administration's commitment to supporting regional partners and ensuring that ISIS does not regain its former strength. The decision to maintain this increased troop presence is driven by the ongoing instability in Syria's northeast, where ISIS continues to exploit a fractured political and military landscape. The group, while no longer holding large swaths of territory, remains capable of conducting attacks and insurgent operations, making it essential for U.S. forces to maintain a presence to disrupt these efforts and provide security for local populations. Secretary Austin's remarks highlight the importance of the mission, which not only targets ISIS but also works in concert with local forces and international partners to bring stability to the region. The Pentagon has also reassured the public that U.S. military operations in Syria will continue despite potential fiscal challenges. On December 19, 2024, U.S. Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder issued a statement confirming that even if a partial government shutdown were to occur, military missions abroad, including those in Syria, would remain unaffected. This reflects the Pentagon’s priority to maintain critical security operations in the region, particularly in light of the persistent threats posed by ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The operational readiness of U.S. forces in Syria is vital, as instability in the region could have far-reaching implications for U.S. interests in the Middle East. As part of CJTF-OIR, U.S. forces continue to collaborate with local Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces, as well as international coalition partners, to ensure that ISIS is defeated and that regional stability is supported. The ongoing U.S. commitment to the mission demonstrates the broader strategic importance of the region to U.S. national security. In addition to the personnel deployed in Syria, the U.S. military maintains a robust presence of advanced combat equipment to support its mission. According to images released by the U.S. DoD in December 2024, U.S. soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division are stationed in Syria, equipped with a variety of combat vehicles to aid in operations. These include Bradley M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) and M-ATV MRAPs (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles), which are critical for both offensive and defensive operations in the region's challenging terrain. The Bradley M2A3 IFVs, known for their firepower and mobility, are highly effective in urban combat scenarios, providing essential support to local partner forces on the ground. These vehicles are designed to engage enemy forces in complex environments, offering enhanced capabilities for infantry support and protection.

Syria Blocks Russian Evacuation Ship Sparta II at Strategic Tartus Port	According to information published by UAWire on January 10, 2025, Russia’s evacuation of military assets from Syria has hit a critical roadblock, as the cargo ship Sparta II has been denied access to the port of Tartus by the country’s new authorities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian cargo ship Sparta II remains stranded off the Syrian coast as new authorities deny port access, stalling Moscow's evacuation of military assets from Tartus. (Picture source: OBL) This development follows a regime change in Syria that saw the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, casting uncertainty over Russia’s future in the region. The ship, which arrived off the Syrian coast on January 5 after departing Russia’s Kaliningrad region in December, remains adrift as negotiations falter. The Tartus port, home to Russia’s only naval base outside its borders, is a linchpin in Moscow’s regional strategy. However, the vessel’s controversial history, including prior sanction-listed activities such as transporting military equipment from Crimea to Syria, has likely contributed to the denial. This impasse has effectively stalled Russian evacuation efforts, forcing reliance on alternative routes, such as air operations through Khmeimim airbase, to withdraw personnel and smaller assets. Satellite imagery has revealed an extensive buildup of Russian military equipment at Tartus, including dismantled air defense radar systems and over 100 trucks staged for removal. Despite this readiness, no ships are currently docked at the port to load these assets, leaving significant resources stranded. The lack of maritime access underscores the severity of the challenge facing Moscow as it attempts to recalibrate its presence in Syria. The broader geopolitical context further complicates the situation. Russia’s withdrawal of its fleet from Tartus in December followed the rapid advance of Syrian rebels toward Damascus, signaling a major shift in the country’s power dynamics. The overthrow of Assad’s regime has prompted Moscow to engage in negotiations with the new authorities to secure its remaining footholds in Syria, particularly the Tartus naval base and Khmeimim airbase. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has confirmed these talks, highlighting the strategic importance of these installations to Russia’s influence in the region. Meanwhile, international attention on the situation has intensified. A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft has been deployed to monitor the Sparta II and broader developments in the Mediterranean, reflecting heightened interest in the implications of Russia’s repositioning. The vessel’s continued delay adds to the uncertainty, amplifying concerns over Russia’s ability to protect and extract its military assets under shifting regional dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/syria-blocks-russian-evacuation-ship-sparta-ii-at-strategic-tartus-port	2025-01-10T07:55:15-08:00	
Analysis: Croatia Enhances Air Power Capabilities with French Rafale Fighter Jets Replacing Soviet-made MiG-21	In December 2024, Croatia’s air defense capabilities took a monumental leap forward with the arrival of eight French Dassault Rafale fighter jets at the 'Colonel Marko Živković' barracks in Pleso, marking the largest and most significant strategic project in the history of the Croatian Air Force. This milestone is part of Croatia’s ongoing effort to modernize its military assets and align more closely with NATO standards, positioning the country as a stronger, more capable member of the alliance.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Croatia’s Air Force strengthens its capabilities with the acquisition of French Dassault Rafale jets, marking a new era of modernization and NATO integration. (Picture source: Croatia MoD) The Rafale program follows the signing of a major defense contract in 2022, when Croatia finalized an agreement with France to purchase a fleet of 12 Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft. The deal, valued at approximately €999 million, was a crucial step in Croatia’s broader military modernization strategy. The contract also includes comprehensive training programs for Croatian pilots and maintenance personnel, as well as logistical and technical support to ensure the aircraft's long-term operational readiness. This agreement was a part of Croatia’s effort to replace its aging fleet of MiG-21 fighter jets, which had been in service since the early 1990s. Croatia’s decision to purchase the Rafale jets was driven by the need for a more modern, capable fighter to meet the growing security challenges in Europe. After considering a variety of options, including the Swedish Gripen and American F-16, the Croatian government selected the Rafale due to its multirole capabilities, advanced avionics, and proven combat performance. The French government, in turn, supported Croatia's acquisition of the Rafale, reinforcing the strategic partnership between the two nations within NATO. The purchase is seen as a significant step in enhancing Croatia’s air defense capabilities and aligning its military forces with NATO’s evolving standards. The Rafale’s advanced radar and electronic warfare systems, coupled with its versatility in both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, offer Croatia enhanced capabilities that are vital in contemporary security environments. The first batch of Rafale aircraft arrived in Croatia in April 2024, with the full fleet expected to be operational by 2025. This modernization is not just a leap in terms of technology, but also in strategic importance. By equipping its air force with one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, Croatia is enhancing both its defensive and offensive capabilities. The Rafale is equipped with state-of-the-art radar and electronic warfare systems, giving it a technological edge that far surpasses the MiG-21s, which have long been outclassed in terms of performance. The Rafale program signifies the replacement of the aging MiG-21 fleet, which has served as the backbone of the Croatian Air Force for decades, notably during the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995). The MiG-21s were instrumental in the formation of Croatia's air force, as the nation had no official air combat capability at the beginning of the conflict. Over time, a fleet of MiG-21s was acquired, playing a pivotal role in reconnaissance, air superiority, and close air support missions. Despite challenges with limited resources and spare parts, these aircraft were critical in the country's struggle for independence. Croatia replaces its MiG-21, in service since the 1990s, with French Rafale fighter jets to enhance air defense capabilities. (Picture source Wikimedia) By the time Croatia joined NATO in 2009, the MiG-21s had undergone several upgrades, including improved avionics, to meet the alliance’s interoperability standards. However, as the MiG-21 fleet aged and its operational limitations became more apparent, it became clear that the aircraft could no longer provide the level of performance needed to support Croatia’s growing defense requirements. Consequently, the Croatian government set in motion a process to replace the MiG-21s with modern, advanced fighter jets capable of performing a wide range of missions in line with NATO expectations. The MiG-21 was designed in the 1950s and has remained in service with various countries well beyond its intended lifespan. While it served as a reliable platform during the Croatian War of Independence, its capabilities have become increasingly outdated in the context of modern aerial warfare. The MiG-21 is limited in terms of payload capacity, radar and avionics sophistication, and operational range. Additionally, its single-engine design and older airframe technology provide reduced survivability compared to modern fighter jets.The Rafale, on the other hand, represents a significant leap in air combat capabilities. With a maximum speed of Mach 1.8, a range of 3,700 km, and a ceiling of 15,240 meters, the Rafale can operate in a variety of roles, including air superiority, ground attack, reconnaissance, and nuclear deterrence. Its advanced radar system, the Thales RBE2 AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, provides superior tracking, targeting, and situational awareness, far exceeding the radar systems available on the MiG-21. The Rafale is also equipped with electronic warfare capabilities and can carry a much wider array of modern, precision-guided weapons, including air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground munitions, and a range of bombs. One of the key advantages of the Rafale over the MiG-21 is its multirole flexibility. The MiG-21 was primarily designed as a lightweight interceptor and was only adapted for ground attack missions later in its service life. In contrast, the Rafale was built from the ground up as a multirole platform, capable of seamlessly transitioning between different combat missions without compromising performance. This makes the Rafale more versatile, allowing Croatia’s Air Force to conduct a broader range of missions with a single type of aircraft. Beyond performance, the Rafale also offers Croatia substantial improvements in terms of survivability and operational effectiveness. The aircraft's stealthy design, low radar cross-section, and advanced electronic countermeasures make it significantly harder to detect and engage than the MiG-21. Its advanced cockpit and avionics systems enhance pilot situational awareness, while the aircraft’s ability to carry out long-range strikes with precision-guided munitions further expands Croatia's offensive capabilities. Beyond boosting national defense, the Rafale program is designed to integrate Croatia more effectively into NATO’s defense framework. NATO interoperability is a key component of Croatia’s strategic defense objectives, and the Rafale’s advanced systems are fully compatible with NATO's operational standards. As NATO continues to adapt to evolving global security challenges, Croatia’s enhanced capabilities will allow it to contribute more effectively to alliance operations, including air policing, rapid-response missions, and collaborative defense initiatives. Until the full operational readiness of Croatia’s Rafale fleet, NATO has supported the country's airspace protection efforts through Air Policing missions carried out by the Italian and Hungarian Air Forces. This interim arrangement has allowed the Croatian Air Force to focus on intensive training for its pilots and ground crews as they prepare to integrate the Rafales into their operations. The retirement of the MiG-21s by the end of 2024 will mark the conclusion of an era for the Croatian Air Force. While these aircraft hold a special place in the country’s military history, particularly for their role during the Croatian War of Independence, the decision to phase them out is driven by the need for more modern, capable, and versatile aircraft to address the complex security landscape of the 21st century. The MiG-21s will forever be a symbol of Croatia’s resilience and ingenuity in the face of adversity. Despite the limitations of the aircraft and the severe resource constraints during the war, the Croatian Air Force managed to achieve remarkable successes, establishing itself as a respected entity within the region. However, as Croatia looks to the future, the Rafale represents a major step in reinforcing the country’s air defense capabilities and ensuring its security within the broader NATO framework. With the arrival of the Rafale, Croatia has entered a new chapter in its military modernization efforts, underlining the country’s commitment to enhancing its national defense while playing a more active role in regional and NATO security. The Croatian Air Force's modernization plan, which includes the Rafale fleet and other ongoing upgrades, will position the country as a key player in NATO's defense posture in Southeastern Europe. As Croatia moves into 2025, the full integration of the Rafale fighter jets will not only strengthen its national defense but also solidify its strategic role within NATO, ensuring that the Croatian Air Force is prepared to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving global security environment. The Rafale program is a clear statement of Croatia’s resolve to protect its sovereignty, contribute to NATO's collective defense, and maintain peace and stability in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/analysis-croatia-enhances-air-power-capabilities-with-french-rafale-fighter-jets-replacing-soviet-made-mig-21	2025-01-10T06:53:16-08:00

Greek frigate Hydra quietly deploys to Red Sea with upgraded anti-drone system amid Meko modernization debate	According to information published by Christian Mazanitis on January 10, 2025, the Greek frigate HYDRA has quietly set sail for the Red Sea, embarking on its fourth mission in the region to join Operation ASPIDES.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Navy's Hydra-class frigate Hydra in April 2024. (Picture source: European Union) This European Union-led mission aims to protect maritime trade routes from terrorist threats, particularly those posed by Yemen's Houthi rebels. Unlike its previous deployments, the HYDRA’s departure from the Salamis Naval Base was marked by an unusual lack of ceremony, with no formal send-off by the Chief of the Hellenic Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral Dimitrios-Eleftherios Katarras, or any public announcement from the Navy’s press office. The deployment comes nearly a year after the frigate’s last mission in the Red Sea, but with a key upgrade: the installation of an advanced anti-drone system, KENTAVROS. This domestically developed system builds on lessons learned from the frigate’s earlier encounters with Houthi drone attacks, including a close call with a kamikaze drone during its first mission. The KENTAVROS system, first installed on the frigate PSARA and later on SPETSAI, now equips the HYDRA for a more robust response to emerging aerial threats. Despite its operational importance, the HYDRA’s deployment highlights the urgent need for modernization of Greece's four MEKO-class frigates. Commissioned in 1992, the HYDRA is now 33 years old, operating with outdated electronics from the 1980s. Successive delays in modernization efforts have left the frigates struggling to match contemporary naval threats. Initially, the cost of upgrading the MEKO-class ships was projected at €1 billion, including new weapons systems under a U.S. Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) proposal four years ago. That proposal faced backlash and was shelved in favor of acquiring FDI Belharra frigates, which were celebrated as a game-changer for the Hellenic Navy. However, escalating costs and emerging security demands have forced a reconsideration of the MEKO upgrade program. The latest reports suggest a scaled-down modernization plan with a 60% cost reduction, capping expenses at €100 million per ship, or €400 million for the entire fleet. This 'surface-level' modernization will focus on installing the KENTAVROS anti-drone system across all four frigates, alongside upgraded radar systems for improved threat detection. While these upgrades aim to extend the ships' operational life by 10 to 12 years, they fall short of comprehensive overhauls. The MEKO-class frigates are expected to assume secondary roles behind the newly acquired FDI Belharra ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/greek-frigate-hydra-quietly-deploys-to-red-sea-with-upgraded-anti-drone-system-amid-meko-modernization-debate	2025-01-10T01:01:37-08:00

US Congress Warns of Rising Costs and Challenges in US Navy's 2025 Shipbuilding Plan	According to information published by the US Gov on January 6, 2025, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released its analysis of the U.S. Navy’s ambitious 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, highlighting significant increases in costs and challenges in execution. The plan envisions a modernized fleet to address evolving maritime threats, but the financial and logistical demands underscore the scale of the undertaking.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Virginia-class submarine USS Texas at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. (Picture source: US DoD) The Navy aims to expand its current fleet of 295 battle force ships to 390 by 2054, while also integrating 134 unmanned surface and undersea vessels. However, the fleet is expected to shrink in the near term, dropping to 283 ships by 2027 due to planned retirements before rebounding in subsequent years. This strategy aligns with the Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations concept, which emphasizes spreading offensive and defensive capabilities across a larger number of platforms. The costs of implementing the 2025 plan are projected to average $40.1 billion annually, adjusted for inflation, over the next three decades. This represents a 46 percent increase compared to the Navy’s recent funding levels. The CBO’s projections are significantly higher than the Navy’s estimates, reflecting differing assumptions about labor, materials, and inflation trends in shipbuilding. For example, the CBO estimates the cost of Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers will be billions more than the Navy projects. Challenges within the shipbuilding industrial base compound the difficulties of meeting the Navy’s goals. Shipyard production rates have slowed dramatically, with construction times for destroyers and submarines extending to nearly a decade. Labor shortages and an aging supplier base further complicate efforts, particularly as shipyards face increasing demands for complex vessels like nuclear-powered submarines. To address these issues, the Navy has committed $10 billion to improve the submarine industrial base, including investments in workforce development and infrastructure. The plan also emphasizes the construction of six Ford-class carriers to replace aging Nimitz-class vessels, a continued investment in attack submarines, and the development of next-generation destroyers and smaller combatants. However, delays in new ship classes and cost overruns could impact the Navy’s ability to meet its long-term objectives. For example, the introduction of the next-generation attack submarine has been postponed to 2040, while production rates for the Virginia-class submarines have not yet met planned targets. While the Navy’s focus on unmanned systems signals a strategic pivot toward future warfare, these platforms remain largely in the development phase, with unclear costs and capabilities. The integration of unmanned vessels into the fleet will be critical to achieving the Navy’s vision of a hybrid force, but questions remain about the technological readiness and operational role of these systems. The CBO’s analysis serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges inherent in such an ambitious plan. The envisioned fleet reflects the Navy’s response to growing geopolitical threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, but the realization of this vision will require careful navigation of fiscal constraints, industrial limitations, and strategic priorities. As Congress reviews the 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, the balance between ambition and feasibility will be a focal point. The decisions made in the coming years will shape the future of the U.S. Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-congress-warns-of-rising-costs-and-challenges-in-us-navys-2025-shipbuilding-plan	2025-01-09T01:58:31-08:00	
UAE could transfer up to 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets to Morocco with France’s consent	On January 8, 2025, LeDesk reported that discussions are progressing on a possible transfer of 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Morocco, contingent upon France’s agreement. According to Emirati sources, Abu Dhabi could cede half of its Mirage 2000-9E fleet to the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) once the UAE begins receiving deliveries of Rafale F4 jets from Paris, scheduled for 2027.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. (Picture source: Army Recognition) This prospect was initially deemed unlikely four years ago, but it has gained momentum following the visit of Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita to France in April 2024, along with reports mentioning King Mohammed VI’s private stay in Abu Dhabi. A three-year suspension initially delayed the Mirage sale, mostly because the original 1998 contract stipulates that any transfer of these aircraft requires French consent for re-export. The potential transfer of Emirati Mirage 2000-9 aircraft to Morocco gained additional attention when the French government reportedly explored the option of buying back some UAE Mirages to provide them to Ukraine. This requirement complicated the transaction, but the UAE’s preference leaned toward selling part of its fleet, with 30 Mirage 2000-9s intended for Morocco and a portion for Egypt. While an agreement in principle appears to exist, no official statements have confirmed the final steps, delivery schedule, or upgrade packages. Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April of the previous year but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. Abu Dhabi signed a significant contract with France in December 2021 for 80 Rafale F4 jets and 12 military helicopters, valued at about $18 billion, marking the largest international order for Rafale fighters since their introduction in 2004. With the UAE set to retire some Mirage 2000-9s in favor of the Rafale F4, several countries, including Iraq, Greece, Egypt, and Morocco, have been mentioned in discussions about receiving secondhand Mirage 2000s. On the Moroccan side, the RMAF currently operates around two-dozen upgraded Mirage F-1MF2000 aircraft, about two-dozen F-5s, and approximately two-dozen F-16C/D Block 52+ fighters. Morocco has also ordered an additional 25 F-16C/D Block 72 jets for delivery between late 2025 and 2027 and has been mentioned as potentially becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire the F-35 Lightning II from the United States. As reported on January 8, 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense may finalize a deal for 32 F-35 fighters for Morocco, with an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, including procurement and maintenance. If concluded, this acquisition would introduce fifth-generation capabilities to the RMAF, which analysts believe is motivated by Morocco’s rivalry with Algeria, especially concerning Western Sahara. Algeria has reportedly signed a contract for 14 Russian Su-57 fighters, complementing Su-30MKA and Su-35 jets in its inventory. This purchase is part of a broader effort in Algiers to maintain what it perceives as a necessary regional balance. Diplomatic friction persists between Morocco and Algeria, particularly following the 2021 severing of ties and ongoing disagreements over Western Sahara and the Polisario Front. Originally designed to offer an upgrade over the Mirage 2000-5, the 2000-9 includes a digital autopilot, advanced electronic warfare systems, and a cockpit arrangement similar in some respects to that of the Rafale. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Meanwhile, the presence of Emirati Mirage 2000-9s in different theaters has drawn scrutiny from various governments. On July 24, 2024, at least seven Emirati Mirage 2000-9DAD/EAD fighter-bombers were deployed to a People’s Liberation Army Air Force base in Xinjiang province, China, for the Falcon Shield 2024 exercise. Supported by C-17A Globemaster III transports and an A330 MRTT tanker, the UAE contingent cooperated with Chinese forces for the second consecutive edition of these drills. Analysts in the United States expressed concern that Beijing could gain insights into Western aviation technology through such interactions. UAE-China defense cooperation has already produced tensions, with the suspension in 2021 of negotiations to sell 50 F-35 Lightning II fighters to Abu Dhabi, reportedly due to disagreements over technical requirements, cost issues, and concerns about Chinese involvement in UAE military affairs. The UAE Air Force, which also operates over 70 F-16 Block 60 fighters of American origin, has thus diversified its fleet with Western and Chinese systems, including Hongdu L-15 trainers and Wing Loong drones. The Mirage 2000-9 is based on Dassault’s Mirage 2000 design, featuring an advanced modular avionics architecture, a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan engine, and a delta-wing configuration. Its technical enhancements include the RDY-2 or RBY-2 radar, integration of MICA air-to-air missiles, and capacity for precision-guided munitions such as the Shehan (or Shehab) laser-designation pod, guided bombs, and the Black Shaheen cruise missile, which is the export version of the SCALP-EG. Originally designed to offer an upgrade over the Mirage 2000-5, the 2000-9 includes a digital autopilot, advanced electronic warfare systems, and a cockpit arrangement similar in some respects to that of the Rafale. Historical records indicate that 62 Mirage 2000-9s were ordered new or upgraded from older Mirage 2000 airframes in the UAE’s previous contracts. Enhanced maintenance and modernization work have been carried out since 2019, through deals signed by Dassault Aviation, Thales, and MBDA, extending the service life of these aircraft into the 2030s. The Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 920 knots, a wingspan of 9.1 meters, a height of 5.2 meters, a length of 14.4 meters, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. The aircraft is powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner. Its RDY-2 radar allows both air-to-air and air-to-surface operations, with maximum detection ranges cited at more than 140 kilometers. The model’s armament options include MICA EM and IR missiles, up to 2,000-liter drop tanks, the Black Shaheen cruise missile, laser-guided bombs such as the BGL-1000, and other guided weapons, often linked to Thales or MBDA systems for targeting and electronic warfare. Maintenance and upgrade programs have involved not only Dassault but also engine manufacturer Snecma (now Safran) and electronics firms such as Thales, Smiths, Elettronica, and others. Powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner, the Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 1,700 km/h, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Dassault Mirage 2000 itself was developed in the 1970s to replace older Mirage III fighters in French service. The single-engine, delta-wing Mirage 2000 first flew in March 1978, eventually evolving into multiple variants, including the Mirage 2000C, the nuclear-oriented Mirage 2000N, and the Mirage 2000D specialized in conventional strikes. The 2000-5 introduced enhancements for multirole operations, while the 2000-9 for the UAE included more sophisticated avionics, radar upgrades, and an expanded suite of weapons. Dassault’s official literature also highlighted the aircraft’s modular avionics design, improved digital flight controls, high maneuverability, and multiple weapons integrations. Over 600 Mirage 2000s of all variants were produced, entering service in countries such as France, the UAE, India, Greece, Taiwan, Egypt, Peru, Qatar, and Brazil. Some have been retired in favor of newer platforms like the Rafale or F-16, but others remain in active service with regular upgrades. The Dassault Mirage 2000’s historical backdrop includes extensive use by the French Air Force in NATO missions and various operations. The type served in the Gulf War, the Bosnian conflict, and over Kosovo. It was also deployed in Afghanistan, with the Mirage 2000D variant performing precision strikes in conjunction with Allied forces. France continues to operate the Mirage 2000-5 and Mirage 2000D, though it has gradually introduced the Rafale to replace older models. In 2011, French Mirage 2000s participated in operations over Libya. More recently, France committed aircraft to combat the Islamic State group, though some have been replaced by newer Rafales. Discussions arose in 2024 regarding Mirage 2000s and the possibility of sending them to Ukraine, but no official confirmation came from France’s Ministry of Defense despite inquiries. In other nations, including India, the Mirage 2000 saw notable use in the 1999 Kargil conflict and ongoing modernization. India’s fleet is designated the Vajra and has undergone an upgrade to near-2000-5 levels, with new radars, weapons, and electronic warfare suites. Other operators such as Greece, Taiwan, Qatar, Egypt, and Peru either still deploy the Mirage 2000 or have done so in recent decades, occasionally pursuing local upgrades or additional weapon integrations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/uae-could-transfer-up-to-30-mirage-2000-9e-fighter-jets-to-morocco-with-frances-consent	2025-01-09T01:49:23-08:00	
Exclusive: US Lockheed Martin's X-59 Achieves Key Afterburner Test Milestone in Quiet Supersonic Aviation Revolution	According to a video published by Lockheed Martin on December 29, 2024, the company's groundbreaking X-59 aircraft has successfully conducted afterburner tests, marking a significant milestone in the quest for quiet supersonic aviation. These tests demonstrate the X-59's capability to operate at supersonic speeds while maintaining a relatively low sonic boom, a key goal of the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. Lockheed Martin, in collaboration with NASA, is developing the X-59 as part of an effort to break through the barriers that currently prevent commercial supersonic flight over land due to noise concerns.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Lockheed Martin X-59 aircraft undergoes afterburner testing, marking a pivotal moment in its development as part of the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. (Picture source Lockheed Martin) The afterburner test phase is a crucial component of the X-59's broader performance evaluation, as it assesses the aircraft's ability to accelerate to supersonic speeds with minimal environmental impact. The afterburner itself is a key technology used in supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, adding fuel to the exhaust stream after combustion to generate additional thrust, often resulting in higher speeds. The X-59’s design, however, incorporates advanced modifications to its afterburner system aimed at minimizing the loud sonic boom typically associated with supersonic flight. This test is a critical step toward Lockheed Martin’s and NASA’s goal of achieving a breakthrough in supersonic travel that could lead to a future where commercial airlines are capable of flying faster than the speed of sound without producing the disruptive sonic booms that have historically been a deterrent for passengers and communities on the ground. The X-59, as part of the QueSST program, has been designed with a sleek, long fuselage and a unique tail configuration that allow it to cut through the air more efficiently, reducing shockwaves that normally result in the loud 'boom' heard when conventional supersonic aircraft break the sound barrier. As part of the ongoing testing process, the X-59 has been undergoing a series of engine runs, structural tests, and evaluations of its aerodynamics and acoustic emissions. The aircraft's design features, including its elongated nose and specialized engine nacelles, are specifically optimized to reduce the intensity of the sonic boom to a mere 'sonic thump' that would be barely noticeable to people on the ground. Lockheed Martin’s video provides a glimpse into the rigorous testing process that has been conducted, including capturing the afterburner ignition and the aircraft’s ability to maintain supersonic speeds while producing significantly lower noise levels. The successful completion of the afterburner tests is seen as a major leap forward for the X-59 program, bringing the aircraft closer to its next phase of testing, which will involve flight tests at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center. There, engineers and researchers will conduct supersonic flight tests over a series of designated test sites, collecting data on the aircraft's acoustic emissions and evaluating the community’s reaction to the reduced sonic boom. If these tests prove successful, the X-59 could pave the way for commercial supersonic flights over land in the near future. The development of the X-59 is particularly timely as the global aviation industry has been exploring ways to reduce travel times and improve efficiency in air travel, with supersonic transport offering the potential for significantly faster journeys. The aircraft’s success could ultimately lead to a new generation of supersonic jets capable of operating within the confines of modern noise regulations, potentially revolutionizing air travel. Lockheed Martin has expressed its commitment to continuing the testing phase in close collaboration with NASA, with the ultimate goal of certifying the X-59 for commercial use. Should the project succeed, it could open the door for future supersonic transport aircraft that are quieter, more efficient, and capable of dramatically shortening flight times on long-haul routes. Beyond its commercial prospects, the X-59's innovative design and advanced technologies also hold significant potential for military applications. The aircraft's ability to fly at supersonic speeds while minimizing the sonic boom could be a game-changer for military operations, especially in reconnaissance, strike missions, and rapid response scenarios. Traditional supersonic military aircraft, such as the Concorde-based supersonic bombers or fighter jets, generate substantial noise when breaking the sound barrier, often alerting adversaries to their presence. The X-59's reduced sonic signature would enable military forces to conduct high-speed operations without the usual warning signs, offering enhanced stealth and surprise. Furthermore, its ability to maintain supersonic speeds over long distances without compromising operational efficiency could make it an ideal platform for rapid strategic deployment, long-range reconnaissance, or even covert strikes. These capabilities, combined with its potential to reduce flight time across vast areas, could transform modern military operations, providing forces with a significant edge in both conventional and asymmetric warfare environments. This latest development highlights the increasing strides being made in the field of supersonic aviation, as aerospace companies work toward creating faster, quieter, and more sustainable aircraft to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving aviation market. With the afterburner tests now completed, the X-59 is one step closer to changing the way the world travels by air, while also expanding its potential for military operations on a global scale.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-us-lockheed-martins-x-59-achieves-key-afterburner-test-milestone-in-quiet-supersonic-aviation-revolution	2025-01-09T01:39:51-08:00

Analysis: Why Donald Trump wants Greenland for US missile defense and rare earth supplies	On January 8, 2025, the BBC reported that Donald Trump reaffirmed his intention for the United States to acquire Greenland, emphasizing its importance for national security and economic interests. Trump did not rule out using military or economic measures to pursue this objective, highlighting Greenland's strategic significance for Arctic defense and resource extraction. Greenland’s leadership, supported by Denmark, strongly rejected the proposal, reiterating that the territory is not for sale and emphasizing the principle of self-determination.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The M1A2 SEP V3 Abrams tank integrates advanced systems that require rare earth elements for components like electronics, sensors, and communication systems, though the specific rare earths involved are not publicly detailed. (Picture source: US DoD) Donald Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland is driven by its strategic military significance and abundant natural resources. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. Additionally, the island's vast reserves of minerals, including rare earth elements, present substantial economic opportunities. Trump views acquiring Greenland as essential for countering geopolitical rivals like Russia and China, who are increasing their presence in the Arctic region. The United States has shown interest in Greenland since 1867, when Secretary of State William H. Seward explored purchasing both Greenland and Iceland, though Congress opposed the idea. After World War II, in 1946, the U.S. offered Denmark $100 million in gold bars for Greenland, citing military necessity, but Denmark declined. During the Cold War, the U.S. established the Thule Air Base in Greenland, underscoring the island's strategic importance. Trump's recent proposals echo these historical attempts, emphasizing both security and economic factors. Reactions to Trump's proposal have been predominantly negative. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dismissed the idea as unrealistic, stating that Greenland is not for sale. Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede reiterated that the island is not on the market, emphasizing Greenland's autonomy and the importance of self-determination. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also rejected the notion, stressing the need to respect allies' sovereignty. These responses reflect a consensus that Greenland's future should be determined by its inhabitants, rather than external actors. The discussion surrounding Greenland is tied to the importance of critical raw materials (CRMs), including rare earth elements. These materials are essential for manufacturing technologies such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems, as well as defense systems. CRMs are categorized by their economic value and their unique properties, which are often irreplaceable in high-tech applications, coupled with their limited availability and the complexities associated with their extraction and processing.

More importantly, such materials are vital for the production of most modern military vehicles, which require specific CRMs for structural, electronic, and propulsion components. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. (Picture source: US DoD) For example, critical raw materials (CRMs) are essential to producing tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, such as the Swedish-made CV90. Infantry fighting vehicles heavily rely on aluminum for structural components and graphite for electronic systems, ensuring functionality under diverse operational conditions. Beryllium is used in connectors and onboard electronics due to its lightweight and conductive properties. Titanium and iron/steel are employed for armor and propulsion systems, with the latter providing durability and structural strength. Copper supports communication systems, while tungsten enhances precision-guided mechanisms and armament effectiveness. Fighter aircraft, like the American F-16 and F-35, require a broad array of CRMs due to their high-performance demands. Aluminum and graphite are key for airframes, including the body, wings, and tail, due to their lightweight and strength. Titanium is widely used in propulsion systems, including turbines and nozzles, for its heat resistance and strength. Copper is applied in electro-optical and control systems, while nickel is used in airframes and propulsion systems for heat resistance. Rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium enable advanced avionics and control systems. Borates and gallium are crucial for radar, sensors, and electronic warfare systems, highlighting the reliance on materials with specific electromagnetic properties. Warships depend on a narrower but critical set of materials. Aluminum is used for decks, superstructures, and propulsion shafts, while titanium and iron/steel form the hulls and structural reinforcements for their corrosion resistance and strength. Copper supports propulsion systems and onboard electrical components. Lithium and silver are utilized in battery technologies for submarines and torpedoes, enabling energy storage and propulsion. Nickel and cobalt are integral to electronic systems, navigation radars, and sonar, providing reliability in marine environments. These materials collectively ensure the vessels' operational effectiveness in various naval scenarios. China leads the global production of rare earth elements, accounting for 69% of output in 2023, with a mine production of approximately 240,000 metric tons. The United States produced 43,000 metric tons (12.3% of global production), followed by Myanmar (38,000 metric tons), Australia (18,000 metric tons), Thailand, India, and Russia in smaller quantities. China also dominates refining and processing capabilities, which are critical for transforming raw materials into usable components for high-tech and defense industries. In December 2023, China imposed an export ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies, citing national security concerns. The ban aimed to preserve China's technological edge and limit other nations' ability to achieve independence in this sector. Additional measures in 2024 included production and export quotas aimed at preserving domestic supplies for priority industries. China has declared rare earth resources state-owned and has used export restrictions in trade negotiations and geopolitical disputes, solidifying its influence over global supply chains. The U.S. defense industry heavily relies on Chinese rare earth materials, which constitute approximately 80% of the supply used in defense systems. The embargo affects the production of technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, which require rare earth magnets, creating risks of supply chain disruptions, delays in manufacturing, and increased costs. To address this, the U.S. is exploring alternative sources and increasing domestic investment in rare earth production to reduce dependency and strengthen supply chain resilience. Donald Trump's latest announcements on Greenland, while seemingly extreme, may therefore seem logical from a purely strategic point of view.

Its ability to relay this data to JMSDF command and allied forces ensures a coordinated and informed response, which is critical in managing the fast-paced dynamics of naval engagements. In anti-submarine warfare, the V-BAT can assist in detecting Chinese submarines operating near Japanese waters. The East China Sea is a known transit area for Chinese submarines heading into the Pacific, and the V-BAT, equipped with synthetic aperture radar or magnetic anomaly detectors, could provide an additional layer of defense by identifying submarine locations and relaying their movements to JMSDF assets. The UAV’s stealthy design and low radar signature make it ideal for covert ISR missions in sensitive zones. For instance, it could be deployed to shadow Chinese vessels or maritime militia ships operating near the Senkaku Islands, documenting activities for strategic decision-making. In scenarios where China employs swarming tactics using smaller vessels or drones, the V-BAT can provide overwatch for JMSDF vessels, identifying threats early and coordinating countermeasures. Its modular payloads can also be adapted for electronic warfare, such as jamming Chinese communications or gathering electronic intelligence to disrupt their operational cohesion.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/strategic-leap-japan-acquires-v-bat-uavs-for-naval-surveillance	2025-01-08T05:24:48-08:00	
Italy purchases four Skynex 35mm air defense systems to counter low-altitude and short-range threats	As reported by A-129 Mangusta on January 7, 2025, Italy signed a contract with Rheinmetall Italia to purchase four Skynex air defense systems in a Counter Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) static configuration. General Carmine Masiello’s earlier visit to Rheinmetall Italia S.p.A. headquarters in Rome on December 17, 2024, confirmed the intention to equip Italian forces with these systems, aligning with details in the Multi-Year Programming Document 2024–2026.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A complete Skynex system comprises four Revolver Gun Mk3 35mm cannons, each capable of firing 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of up to 4 kilometers. It utilizes programmable 35mm Ahead ammunition, which is resistant to electronic countermeasures, ensuring precise target engagement. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Within this document, €400 million are forecasted for the overall requirement, with €80 million spread over four years currently financed by the defense budget. The plan includes the systems, their ten-year integrated logistics support, ammunition, trucks, communication and information systems, and infrastructure adaptations. The aim is to counter rockets, artillery, mortars, unmanned aircraft systems, and loitering munitions, thereby providing very short-range protection for personnel and critical infrastructure in Italy and for contingents deployed abroad. These four C-RAM systems fulfill commitments made to the Alliance and are described in the Defense Planning Document (DPP) as Skynex, a Rheinmetall-produced system that integrates separate airspace surveillance components and effectors, accommodates radar technologies from multiple manufacturers, and employs programmable 35 mm Ahead ammunition resistant to electronic countermeasures. This new capability is expected to deter threats posed by rockets, artillery, and mortars, as well as drones and loitering munitions, especially for contingents deployed in operational theaters. Reports indicate that Italy’s short-range air defense program (GRIFO), managed by the Italian Army and already involving the CAMM-ER missile, may integrate the Skynex 35 mm system to address low-altitude and short-range threats. In May 2024, MBDA announced tests of the CAMM-ER missile with the GRIFO system’s Command Post and Engagement Module, confirming its capability against a simulated enemy aircraft attack. Combining multiple solutions ensures that aerial targets of varying ranges and altitudes can be addressed, strengthening national defense sovereignty and industrial partnerships. This purchase also aims to secure technological expertise within Italy’s domestic defense sector, as the Skynex system is manufactured in Rome’s Tiburtina Valley. Several Italian publications have reported on Skynex production for Ukraine. Originally developed in Switzerland by Oerlikon, Skynex is now built at Rheinmetall Italia, circumventing Swiss restrictions on direct exports of completed war materials while adhering to regulations permitting the transfer of technological know-how. This approach facilitated deployment to Ukraine under a contract financed by the German government. By the end of 2023, two Skynex systems, financed by the German government and valued at 183 million Swiss francs, were delivered to Ukrainian forces. Germany subsequently placed orders for three more units, bringing the total value to around 500 million euros. Some systems even arrived ahead of schedule via the Polish logistics hub in Rzeszow. Following the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, Rheinmetall announced shorter delivery times for Skynex due to investments in personnel and infrastructure, reducing the timeline from two years to approximately one year. Rheinmetall Italia invested €100 million in 2023 and an additional €20 million in 2024 to expedite production and address increased demand. Personnel numbers are expected to grow from 450 to about 550 by early 2025, and the supplier roster expanded from 467 in 2022 to 762 in 2024. Italy’s short-range air defense program (GRIFO), managed by the Italian Army and already involving the CAMM-ER missile, may integrate the Skynex 35 mm system to address low-altitude and short-range threats. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Italy’s decision to invest in four systems follows NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s visit to Rheinmetall Italia’s Rome headquarters on November 5, 2024. This visit coincided with his meetings with President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and focused on reviewing new air defense technologies, such as Skynex, which Germany financed and donated to Ukraine. Rheinmetall AG is also collaborating with Leonardo to produce the Panther tank and Lynx tracked vehicle for the Italian Army, a partnership valued at over €23 billion over fifteen years. This cooperation aims to develop new heavy tanks, known as Main Battle Tanks, and address future European requirements under the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program. The Rome plant now plays a pivotal role in Rheinmetall’s global operations, overseeing major radar and cannon production. The company’s turnover in Italy exceeds one billion euros, with six plants nationwide. The Skynex air defense system includes several modular components designed for short-range and very short-range operations. It features four Revolver Gun Mk3 cannons, each capable of firing 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of up to 4 kilometers. The system utilizes programmable 35 mm Ahead ammunition, resistant to electronic countermeasures, for precise target engagement. Its CN-1 command module enables centralized control, while the X-TAR3D X-band radar ensures 360-degree target acquisition, classification, and tracking. Mobility is supported by HX trucks, and the modular design allows the integration of additional sensors and effectors, such as the SkyKnight missile, which extends the engagement range to 10 kilometers. The distributed component design reduces the risk of significant damage from single strikes. The Skynex system can address various aerial threats, including rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), NATO-class I drones, and loitering munitions. Its radar provides continuous 360-degree coverage, enabling tracking and classification in diverse environmental and electronic conditions. The programmable 35 mm ammunition creates a dense projectile pattern, ensuring an effective engagement of small, fast-moving targets. Rheinmetall Italia cited the success of Germany’s Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun in Ukraine as validation of cannon-based short-range defense systems. The company emphasizes the lower cost of 35 mm munitions compared to missiles and the rounds’ resistance to electronic interference. The modular architecture supports adaptability to mission-specific needs, allowing the integration of effectors like high-energy lasers or missiles to counter saturation attacks. These features make Skynex suitable for protecting critical infrastructure and deployed forces, enabling a robust response to evolving threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/italy-purchases-four-skynex-35mm-air-defense-systems-to-counter-low-altitude-and-short-range-threats	2025-01-08T04:09:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukrainian F-16 Fighter Jet Pilot Sets Historic Record by Destroying Six Missiles in a Single Mission	According to a report published on January 7, 2025, by the Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, a Ukrainian pilot flying an F-16 Fighting Falcon has achieved a remarkable feat by destroying six enemy cruise missiles in a single combat mission. This historic achievement occurred during a massive missile and drone attack in December 2024, marking a milestone in the F-16’s capability to engage and eliminate high-speed missile threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image: A Ukrainian pilot in front of an F-16 Fighting Falcon donated by Ukraine's international allies. (Picture source: Social Network) The Ukrainian pilot successfully intercepted and destroyed four cruise missiles using the F-16’s air-to-air missiles (AAMs) and then proceeded to eliminate two more missiles using the M61 Vulcan cannon. The F-16’s radar systems, including the AN/APG-68 radar, proved crucial in tracking the fast-moving missile targets, even those equipped with electronic countermeasures (REBs). This made the mission not only historically significant but also a testament to the high skill of the Ukrainian pilot and the versatile nature of the F-16 as a missile defense platform. While the Ukrainian F-16 pilot’s success is unprecedented, other F-16 pilots have also engaged in missile interception missions in previous combat scenarios, offering valuable insight into the aircraft’s ability to neutralize aerial threats. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, F-16s were used to intercept and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles, though their success in directly destroying these missiles was limited. F-16s were primarily tasked with striking missile launchers and air defense systems, but they also worked in tandem with Patriot missile defense systems to counter ballistic missile threats. The AIM-7 Sparrow missiles and radar systems on the F-16 allowed for some interception capabilities against the low-flying Scud missiles. This mission highlighted the F-16’s adaptability in missile defense operations, even in high-risk scenarios. Similarly, during Operation Allied Force in 1999, F-16s were integral in the broader NATO missile defense strategy, which involved targeting and neutralizing Serbian missile launchers and air defense sites. While the F-16 was not directly involved in intercepting incoming missiles, it provided essential offensive strikes against missile launch sites that posed significant threats to NATO aircraft. F-16 pilots contributed to air superiority by eliminating missile systems and supporting the overall missile defense efforts. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has extensive experience in missile defense operations, including using the F-16 to engage airborne missile threats. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Israeli F-16s were involved in countering Katyusha rockets and other short-range missiles fired by Hezbollah. Though the F-16 did not directly intercept these rockets with its cannon or air-to-air missiles, it played a critical role in eliminating missile launch sites and providing surveillance, which allowed other defense systems like the Iron Dome to neutralize the threats. The F-16’s precision strikes and close air support proved to be vital in controlling the airspace and eliminating missile launch points. In Turkey, during the Syrian Civil War, Turkey’s F-16s were actively used in countering ballistic missile threats from Syria. While Patriot missile systems served as the primary missile defense, F-16s were tasked with surveillance and offensive strikes against missile launchers and ground-based missile systems. These missions further demonstrated the F-16’s versatility in dealing with missile threats, often working in conjunction with other air defense systems to provide comprehensive protection. The M61 Vulcan cannon mounted on the F-16 is a 6-barrel, 20mm rotary cannon capable of firing at 6,000 rounds per minute. While it is commonly used in close-range dogfights and against aerial targets like enemy aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), its application against missiles is extremely rare and highly challenging. The cannon’s high rate of fire and short-range effectiveness make it a difficult tool to use against fast-moving missiles, which often require precise tracking and engagement at very close distances—typically under 500 meters. In the case of the Ukrainian pilot’s mission, the M61 Vulcan was used against two incoming cruise missiles, which required the pilot to close the distance and engage the target with great precision. While the primary method of missile interception in the F-16 is through air-to-air missiles (AAMs) like the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the cannon proved useful in situations where close-range engagement was necessary, especially in scenarios where the aircraft's missiles had already been expended or the threat was in the final stages of approach. The historic achievement by the Ukrainian F-16 pilot in destroying six missiles in one mission is a significant moment in the evolution of missile defense using F-16s. The aircraft’s radar systems, air-to-air missiles, and M61 Vulcan cannon allow for a range of interception options against high-speed aerial threats, from cruise missiles to ballistic projectiles. The experiences of other F-16 pilots in past combat situations, including the U.S., Israel, and Turkey, further highlight the fighter's versatility in missile defense roles, whether in directly destroying missiles or supporting broader air defense strategies. The success of the Ukrainian F-16 pilot underscores the growing capabilities of the F-16 Fighting Falcon in modern warfare, particularly in high-intensity conflicts where missile threats are increasingly sophisticated. With continued training, technology upgrades, and combat experience, the F-16 is proving to be a formidable weapon in the global fight against missile proliferation and aerial threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-jet-pilot-sets-historic-record-by-destroying-six-missiles-in-a-single-mission	2025-01-08T03:11:10-08:00	
Development of Combat UAVs in Japan Through Strategic Partnership with Boeing	Boeing Japan, a subsidiary of the American aerospace multinational Boeing, secured a contract on December 10, 2024, with Japan's Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency (ATLA) to conduct research and simulation testing on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) designed to operate alongside manned aircraft. This initiative aligns with Japan's strategy to develop advanced technologies aimed at enhancing its military capabilities in autonomous systems and collaborative combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XQ-58A Valkyrie is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle designed by Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions for the U.S. Air Force's unmanned combat air vehicle program (Picture source: US DoD) Signed on October 18, 2024, for an amount of 155,177,000 JPY, approximately 1 million USD, this contract represents a significant step in Japan’s efforts to integrate UAVs into its military operations. ATLA explained that Boeing Japan was uniquely positioned to carry out this project due to its exclusive access to the required simulation software, along with the necessary technical resources and expertise. Japan's interest in combat UAVs is not a recent development. As early as December 2022, the Ministry of Defense (JMOD) announced plans to develop 'combat support UAVs' capable of collaborating with manned aircraft. These efforts are also part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a joint initiative between Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft. In December 2023, JMOD also signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct research on artificial intelligence for UAVs to ensure seamless integration with Japan's future fighter jets. The concept of collaborative UAVs, often referred to as 'loyal wingman' or 'collaborative combat aircraft' (CCA), aims to create autonomous drones capable of supporting manned aircraft in a range of missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and combat operations. One prominent example is Boeing Australia's MQ-28 Ghost Bat, a multi-role UAV developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. Designed as a 'force multiplier,' the Ghost Bat features advanced artificial intelligence and a modular nose section that can be customized to meet specific operational requirements. In July 2024, it was announced that Australia’s Ghost Bats would prioritize ISR capabilities over weapon systems, partially due to Boeing's unsuccessful bid for an autonomous combat jet program in the United States. Nevertheless, the Ghost Bat remains a viable candidate for Japan’s combat support UAV program, given its adaptability and role in multi-domain missions. Japan is also pursuing additional UAV development independently. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is working on two collaborative UAV concepts: one focused on tactical combat and another aimed at supporting manned aircraft operations. Both are being designed to integrate with the GCAP next-generation fighter, underscoring Japan’s commitment to incorporating cutting-edge technologies into its defense systems. In parallel with Boeing Japan's research, ATLA continues to explore other initiatives to advance autonomous capabilities. This month, the agency issued public bids for the development of stealth UAVs for aerial refueling and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) designed for explosive handling and mine countermeasures. The outcomes of Boeing Japan's simulation tests will play a crucial role in shaping ATLA and JMOD’s decisions on selecting UAVs that best align with Japan's defense requirements. These efforts reflect the country’s focus on modernizing its military through international partnerships and autonomous technological advancements. This contract between Boeing Japan and ATLA highlights a pivotal moment in Japan’s development of autonomous military capabilities. As the country invests in collaborative technologies for its future aircraft, partnerships with nations like the United States emphasize the importance of a strategic approach to addressing evolving defense challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/development-of-combat-uavs-in-japan-through-strategic-partnership-with-boeing	2025-01-08T02:30:36-08:00	
Lithuania Strengthens Its Drone Capabilities with New UAV Acquisitions from United States	Lithuania continues its commitment to enhancing its defense capabilities with recent acquisitions from the United States, including advanced manpack radios and small uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV). These agreements, signed by the Defence Materiel Agency (DMA) under the Ministry of National Defence, represent an investment in modernizing the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration photo issued by the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense. (Picture source: Lithuanian MoD) One of the key acquisitions involves a set of L3Harris manpack radios, valued at approximately 25 million dollars. These advanced communication systems will be integrated into Lithuania’s Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) and Vilkas Infantry Fighting Vehicles, providing enhanced communication capabilities for troops in the field. L3Harris radios are considered among the most advanced in their category, ensuring that the Lithuanian forces will have reliable and efficient communication technology. In addition to the radios, Lithuania secured a contract for the acquisition of a small UAS from the U.S. manufacturer AeroVironment Inc., a leader in uncrewed aerial systems. Worth 7.8 million dollars, this deal focuses on vertical take-off drones designed for fire control and adjustment tasks. These systems will be integrated with the Switchblade 600 combat drones, also acquired from the U.S. government. The UAS is scheduled for delivery by the end of 2025, with plans for future supplementation to further strengthen Lithuania's drone capabilities. AeroVironment offers several UAS (uncrewed aerial systems) models that could match the description given in the release, particularly vertical take-off drones for fire control and adjustment tasks. Here are some of the AeroVironment UAS models that could potentially be part of this acquisition. The Wasp AE is a tactical medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone designed to offer surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and it is capable of vertical takeoff using a launch ramp. Although it is larger than smaller UAS, it could be suitable for fire control tasks due to its surveillance capabilities and endurance. The Puma 3 AE is a small drone designed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is capable of vertical takeoff and landing and is used for tactical missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This model could be a good candidate for fire control and adjustment tasks, although it is lighter and designed for shorter missions. Although not specifically mentioned in the articles, the Quantix Recon is a hybrid drone capable of both long-range surveillance missions and data collection tasks, with the ability to take off and land vertically. This model is particularly useful for hard-to-access areas, which could make it an interesting option for fire control support missions. Lithuania’s growing acquisitions from the United States reflect its strengthening defense posture in the Baltic region. With a mid-term procurement plan valued at 1.3 billion dollars, the country has become the largest purchaser of U.S. weaponry among the Baltic states, accounting for approximately 20% of its military acquisitions. Among the systems acquired are Javelin anti-tank missiles, JLTV vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, HINARS, AMRAAM for medium-range NASAMS, and Switchblade drones, all contributing to the modernization of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. These acquisitions are part of Lithuania's broader defense strategy to improve its operational capabilities and strengthen regional security in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lithuania-strengthens-its-drone-capabilities-with-new-uav-acquisitions-from-united-states	2025-01-08T02:29:24-08:00	
Morocco could soon become the first Arab nation to acquire US-made F-35 stealth fighter jets	According to Identité Juive on November 22, 2024, Morocco is reportedly progressing toward becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States. The U.S. Department of Defense is expected to finalize an agreement for the delivery of 32 F-35 Lightning IIs, at an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, covering both procurement and maintenance. If confirmed, this acquisition would expand the Royal Moroccan Air Force’s inventory, which is currently centered on fourth-generation F-16 aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, the Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. (Picture source: US DoD) To date, Arab African nations show mixed outcomes regarding the acquisition of F-35 fighter jets. Türkiye ordered 30 F-35As, with plans for up to 100, but purchases were halted in 2020 due to U.S. sanctions over Türkiye’s procurement of the Russian S-400 missile system. Four jets were delivered but remain withheld at Luke Air Force Base, and the U.S. stated in February 2024 that Türkiye could be readmitted to the F-35 program if it resolves the S-400 issue. The United Arab Emirates signed a deal in January 2021 for 50 F-35s as part of a $23 billion arms package, but in December 2021, the UAE unilaterally suspended the agreement, citing technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost concerns. A senior UAE official indicated in September 2024 that discussions with the U.S. over the F-35 are not expected to resume. Qatar expressed interest in the F-35 in 2020, but U.S. policy to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge has prevented progress. Saudi Arabia has shown interest in the F-35 since 2012 but has not advanced toward an agreement, with obstacles including U.S. concerns about regional stability, human rights issues, and Israel’s military edge, leading to the potential acquisition of 100 Turkish KAAN fighters. Regarding Morocco, negotiations for the deal reportedly took place between 2020 and 2022, with Morocco seeking Israel’s assistance to facilitate discussions with U.S. authorities. A meeting in November 2021 between Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Moroccan Defense Minister Abdellatif Loudiyi is cited as instrumental in advancing these negotiations. Rising tensions with Algeria—particularly regarding the Western Sahara conflict and Algeria’s support for the Polisario Front—are considered major factors driving Morocco’s interest in these aircraft. Algeria’s acquisition of Russian Su-57 stealth fighters has also reportedly influenced Morocco's decision. Algeria is reported to have signed a contract for the acquisition of 14 Su-57 fighter jets from Russia as part of a broader military agreement that includes Su-34 and Su-35 aircraft. The Su-57, designated as a fifth-generation stealth fighter, incorporates features such as reduced radar cross-section, advanced avionics, and enhanced maneuverability. This reported procurement would add to Algeria's existing fleet of Su-30MKA and Su-35 aircraft, reflecting its effort to modernize its air force. If the agreement is implemented, Algeria could become the first country outside Russia to receive the Su-57. This acquisition aligns with Algeria’s strategy to maintain a regional military balance with Morocco amid ongoing tensions over Western Sahara. Algeria’s potential acquisition of the Su-57 is considered a significant factor influencing Morocco’s decision to modernize its forces with a comparable or superior fifth-generation stealth fighter, such as the F-35. (Picture source: Russian social media) Since Morocco annexed the region in 1975, Algeria has supported the Polisario Front, which advocates for Western Sahara’s independence, by providing political backing and hosting Sahrawi refugees. Algeria frames this support as consistent with its regional policies and anti-colonial stance. Morocco claims Western Sahara as part of its territory and has proposed limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Diplomatic relations between the two countries worsened in August 2021, when Algeria severed ties with Morocco, citing what it called 'hostile actions' related to the conflict. Morocco’s interest in the F-35 is therefore part of a broader effort to strengthen its defense capabilities in collaboration with Western allies, including the United States and Israel. This effort also includes acquisitions such as AH-64E Apache helicopters, M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, Bradley armored vehicles, and MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. The F-35 was prominently featured at the 7th Marrakech Air Show, held from October 30 to November 2, 2024, under the High Patronage of King Mohammed VI and with the support of the Royal Moroccan Air Force. The event showcased over 300 exhibitors and hosted 100 international delegations. Morocco also displayed its first Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopter at the event, part of an order for 24 units currently in production. In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, several factors would determine the outcome. The Su-57 is a fifth-generation stealth aircraft designed by Russia, capable of achieving speeds over Mach 2 and equipped with thrust-vectoring engines for enhanced maneuverability. The F-35, developed by the United States, prioritizes stealth and advanced avionics, with a low radar cross-section and integrated sensor fusion for improved situational awareness. The Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. This balance suggests that the F-35 could hold an advantage in beyond-visual-range scenarios, depending on the operational context and pilot expertise. The potential acquisition of Su-57 fighter jets by Algeria and F-35 aircraft by Morocco could shift the military balance in North Africa. Algeria's interest in the Su-57 appears aimed at countering Morocco's existing fleet of F-16s and its potential procurement of F-35s, raising the likelihood of a regional arms race. This development might prompt neighboring countries, such as Spain, to reassess their defense strategies, including the possible acquisition of F-35s to maintain strategic balance. The introduction of these advanced aircraft could impact the military equilibrium, increase tensions, and influence diplomatic relations within the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/morocco-could-soon-become-the-first-arab-nation-to-acquire-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-jets	2025-01-08T02:05:30-08:00	
Rafale Fighter Jets and Barracuda Submarines Propel French Arms Sales in 2024	After a year marked by a decline in orders in 2023, France’s defense industrial and technological base (BITD) achieved significant growth in 2024, with exports reaching €18 billion. This performance underscores the strategic importance of arms exports for the French economy and national sovereignty, while also highlighting the inherent volatility of the sector. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands (Picture source: Naval Group) In 2023, orders amounted to €8.2 billion, a modest figure compared to the €27 billion recorded in 2022. Although this decline was disappointing, the Ministry of the Armed Forces emphasized that annual fluctuations are largely influenced by the signing of major contracts. Notably, the global context remained favorable, with military expenditures reaching a record $2.443 trillion, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In 2024, the French defense industry rebounded strongly, with exports exceeding €18 billion. During a speech delivered at the Invalides courtyard on January 7, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu described 2024 as the 'second-best year in our history,' surpassing the €14 billion achieved in 2016. These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands. Despite these achievements, the minister emphasized the need to sustain efforts, pointing to promising prospects for 2025. Among them, he confirmed the sale of 14 Caracal helicopters to Iraq, though this figure raises questions. In September, Baghdad had announced a contract for 12 H225M Caracals, suggesting a potential additional order, though no further details have been provided. Looking ahead, Lecornu outlined priorities that include surface ships, particularly defense and intervention frigates, submarines, radars, artillery systems, helicopters, and Rafale jets. He also highlighted the strategic importance of the next-generation SAMP/T medium-range ground-based air defense system, designed to counter increasing ballistic threats, particularly from Iran and Russia. The minister reiterated that arms exports are critical for the BITD. Beyond supporting the trade balance and generating employment across France, they ensure national sovereignty by sustaining an industrial model developed in the 1960s. The results achieved in 2024 reflect the resilience and adaptability of the French defense industry. However, maintaining this momentum requires continued vigilance, particularly in a global context of evolving military expenditures and strategic challenges. With major opportunities already emerging, 2025 has the potential to further consolidate France’s position as a global leader in arms exports.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rafale-fighter-jets-and-barracuda-submarines-propel-french-arms-sales-in-2024	2025-01-08T01:53:54-08:00	
Türkiye Integrated Russian S-400 Into Air Defense Framework Amids Tensions with US	Türkiye has reportedly succeeded in integrating the Russian S-400 missile system into its national air defense architecture, marking an advancement in the country’s defense capabilities. This move highlights Türkiye’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its multi-layered defense structure and its broader military strategy for autonomy. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Reports from Turkish media outlets, such as Turkish Minute and TurDef, confirm that the S-400 system will be interconnected with various Turkish defense technologies. (Picture source: ) Reports from Turkish media outlets, such as Turkish Minute and TurDef, confirm that the S-400 system will be interconnected with various Turkish defense technologies, including the national SIPER air defense system. This integration is part of Türkiye’s broader initiative to enhance its air defense through the HAKIM 100 command-and-control system. Developed by the Turkish contractor Aselsan, the HAKIM 100 system will unify a range of platforms, including NATO assets, into a coherent network. This will enable Turkish military commanders to access a comprehensive overview of airspace based on real-time data from various sensors and radars. The aim of this integration is to improve the coordination and operational efficiency of Türkiye's air defense systems. Furthermore, the HAKIM 100 will include advanced algorithms for threat assessment and weapon allocation, with future updates planned to incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning to further enhance operational capabilities. Although Türkiye's Ministry of Defense has yet to issue an official statement, the integration of the S-400 into the national defense framework is seen as a key moment in Türkiye’s defense policy. This move also represents the country’s efforts to strengthen its defense autonomy and its complex geopolitical position, balancing its relations with both Eastern and Western powers. Türkiye's acquisition of the S-400 system, finalized in 2017 after a failed attempt to obtain the U.S. Patriot system, has long been a point of friction in its relations with the United States and NATO. The $2.5 billion deal was partly motivated by Turkey’s desire for technology transfer and local production capabilities, which were not included in the U.S. Patriot offer. In contrast, the Russian offer allowed Turkey to access both the system and the possibility of locally producing similar technologies. Despite international opposition, including Türkiye's exclusion from the F-35 program and subsequent sanctions, the acquisition of the S-400 is seen by Ankara as essential to strengthening national defense. Türkiye's deployment of four S-400 batteries in strategic locations, including the southern border with Syria, is designed to protect critical infrastructure and strengthen air defense against regional aerial threats. As Türkiye continues to integrate the S-400 into its defense framework, it also signals a broader shift in its relations with NATO. The visit of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to TUSAŞ, the Turkish aerospace company responsible for the development of the KAAN fighter jet, underscores the growing cooperation between Türkiye and the alliance.

Additionally, mandatory military service has recently been extended to one year to bolster troop numbers. However, a legislative proposal from the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, in cooperation with the Taiwan People's Party, threatens to reduce the defense budget by 28%. By altering the distribution of funds between the central and local governments, this measure could undermine Taiwan's ability to sustain its defense efforts. National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu has warned that such reductions might also weaken the willingness of allies like the United States, Japan, and the Philippines to assist Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China. Currently, Taiwan allocates approximately 2.4% of its GDP—around $20 billion—annually to defense spending. This investment regularly draws criticism from Beijing, which views U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as provocative. Although China has issued repeated warnings, calling these sales a 'dangerous game,' its responses have so far been limited to targeted economic sanctions on involved companies and frequent military displays near Taiwan. Despite this pressure, most Taiwanese continue to support the current state of de facto independence. In conclusion, these military drills take place in a context of rising internal and external tensions. While Taiwan strengthens its defensive capabilities to counter potential threats from China, uncertainties surrounding defense funding raise questions about the sustainability of its military posture in the long term.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-conducts-military-drills-amid-concerns-over-defense-budget-cuts	2025-01-07T06:12:57-08:00	
Russia begins testing UTS-800 turboprop aircraft to lower training aircraft expenses	As reported by AviaComments on December 28, 2024, the Ural Civil Aviation Plant (UZGA) delivered the first two serial UTS-800 turboprop training aircraft to the Russian Ministry of Defense. These aircraft, designated '06' and '07' with red tail numbers, will be incorporated into flight tests to evaluate their performance and suitability for training cadets in operational and tactical aviation.

Conducting such an operation in the Red Sea presents its own challenges, given the area’s strategic importance as a major maritime route and its proximity to potential adversaries. The Houthis, supported by Iran, have previously targeted commercial shipping and military assets in the region using drones, mines, and anti-ship missiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/yemen-conflict-us-navy-dismantles-houthi-weapon-sites-with-tomahawks	2025-01-07T05:04:25-08:00	
Taiwan's Communication Cable Damaged: Chinese Vessel Suspected in Sabotage	According to information published by Renminbao on January 6, 2025, a submarine communication cable off the northeastern coast of Taiwan was damaged last week, with suspicions pointing to a Chinese vessel dragging its anchor. The incident has sparked heightened concerns over potential gray-zone tactics employed by Beijing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan investigates damage to a key submarine communication cable, with suspicions pointing to a Chinese-linked cargo vessel, highlighting growing concerns over gray-zone tactics. (Picture source: Taiwanese Coast Guard) In the early hours of January 3, damage was reported to a four-core international submarine cable near Taiwan's northeastern waters, off Keelung. Taiwan's Coast Guard identified a Cameroon-flagged cargo ship, Shunxing 39, as a possible culprit. The vessel had been navigating irregularly in the area and reportedly dragged its anchor at the exact location of the cable damage. Despite its foreign flag, the ship is registered to a Hong Kong-based company, Jie Yang Trading Co., whose sole listed owner is Guo Wenjie. The vessel, which attempted to leave the area due to poor sea conditions, is now en route to Busan, South Korea. Taiwan has sought South Korean assistance in investigating the ship and its activities. Chunghwa Telecom, the operator of the damaged cable, activated emergency backup systems to reroute communication traffic, successfully restoring service for affected customers in a short time. While no severe disruptions occurred, the incident underscores Taiwan’s vulnerability in safeguarding its communication infrastructure. The Taiwan Coast Guard dispatched vessels to investigate, requesting the Shunxing 39 to return to the site for inspection. However, adverse weather conditions hindered further actions, and the vessel proceeded toward its original destination in Busan. Taiwanese officials view the incident as part of a worrying global trend of submarine cable sabotage. A senior national security officer highlighted that many involved ships are often in poor condition and engaged in non-commercial activities, drawing comparisons to Russia's shadow fleet implicated in similar cases. Beijing has not officially responded to the incident, but Taiwanese lawmakers believe it is part of an escalating gray-zone strategy—using unconventional means to undermine Taiwan's security without direct conflict. Legislators have called for reinforced measures, including stricter cable protection zones, faster interception protocols, and the ability to detain suspected vessels. This is not the first time Taiwan’s submarine cables have been damaged. Over the past five years, cables connecting Taiwan’s main island to the Matsu Islands have been reportedly damaged nearly 30 times by Chinese vessels. Globally, submarine cables have become a focus of geopolitical tensions. In November 2024, Finland and Germany reported damage to the C-Lion1 cable, with a Chinese cargo ship, Yi Peng 3, flagged as a suspect. Similarly, the Newnew Polar Bear, a Chinese vessel, was linked to the October 2023 damage of a natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. Russian vessels have also been implicated in incidents, such as the Eagle S, suspected of damaging the Estlink 2 cable between Finland and Estonia last month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/taiwans-communication-cable-damaged-chinese-vessel-suspected-in-sabotage	2025-01-07T03:24:56-08:00

KNDS France Tests Ascalon Gun for Next Generation of Main Battle Tanks	On January 4, 2025, KNDS France released impressive footage of its ASCALON gun in action, showcasing its performance and adaptability during recent tests. This new phase of testing follows several years of development and highlights the gun’s capabilities as a key component of the future Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a major European defense program. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ASCALON gun was in action during recent tests. (Picture source: KNDS) The MGCS project, initially launched in 2017, was delayed after reaching the SADS Part 1 study phase. However, it was revived in April 2024 through a protocol agreement signed by French Minister of Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, and his German counterpart, Boris Pistorius. This agreement allowed the focus to shift back to military needs, prioritizing operational requirements over industrial demands, drawing inspiration from the successful collaboration of the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) between France, Germany, and Spain. As part of the MGCS initiative, KNDS is developing a 'family of systems' that includes next-generation tanks, drones, robots, and other components, all interconnected via a combat cloud. The project is organized into eight main capability pillars: platform, turrets and guns, secondary armament, communication and command systems, simulation, sensors, drone defense, and logistics. Additionally, the creation of a joint project company involving KNDS France, Thales, KNDS Deutschland, and Rheinmetall was planned, but it has faced delays, with the Bundestag yet to approve the next phase of the project. A major point of contention in the MGCS project is the choice of main armament for the future combat vehicle. Rheinmetall has proposed its 130mm gun, while KNDS France has advocated for its ASCALON system, which uses telescoped ammunition stored in an autoloading turret and capable of being 'programmed beyond the line of sight.' The primary advantage of the ASCALON lies in its minimal barrel wear and flexibility in terms of ammunition selection. At the 2024 EuroSatory exhibition, KNDS France demonstrated the versatility of the ASCALON, with the system capable of being equipped with 120mm to 140mm guns, with caliber changes completed in under an hour. The company emphasized that this innovative concept offers significant growth potential, enabling performance levels that current technologies cannot match. The next phase of testing will involve firing the ASCALON gun integrated into a combat vehicle turret, scheduled for later this year. This test will evaluate the system’s capabilities and its potential integration into the MGCS. In the meantime, KNDS France has launched a media campaign to highlight ASCALON’s performance. Recent images shared on social media showcased the system’s ability to quickly change calibers and its precision with newly developed armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, such as the 120mm 'Shard.' These rounds successfully pierced two reinforced concrete slabs, several meters apart, with remarkable accuracy. François Groshanny, director of the 'Future Combat Vehicle' program at KNDS France, recently outlined the four key features of the ASCALON system. These include unprecedented muzzle and target power, the ability to change caliber in under 30 minutes, a compact design using a 'super shot' architecture, and the system's integration into a turret with minimal internal footprint, thus allowing for more personnel to be housed in the chassis. As the MGCS project continues to evolve, the ASCALON gun is expected to play a key role in shaping the future of armored combat systems, with its advanced features and flexible design offering a significant advantage on the battlefield.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/knds-france-tests-ascalon-gun-for-next-generation-of-main-battle-tanks	2025-01-07T01:05:35-08:00

Analysis: North Korea’s Hypersonic Missile Test Escalates Regional and Global Security Threats	On Monday, January 6, 2025, North Korea conducted a test launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) tipped with a hypersonic warhead, a move that has sharply elevated security concerns in the region and beyond. The missile, reportedly traveling 1,500 kilometers at a velocity of Mach 12—12 times the speed of sound—represents a significant escalation in Pyongyang’s missile technology. The test, personally supervised by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was described by state media as a pivotal step in bolstering the country’s defensive capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korea test-fires a hypersonic missile on January 6, 2025, escalating regional and global security threats (Picture source: North Korea press agency) According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the hypersonic missile is designed to 'reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state.' The South Korean military, which detected the launch, confirmed the missile’s trajectory from the Pyongyang area and noted it flew approximately 1,100 kilometers before landing in the East Sea (Sea of Japan). This marked North Korea’s first missile test of 2025 and underscored its intent to continue advancing its weapons programs despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts. The test’s strategic implications are profound, particularly due to the hypersonic technology employed. Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5, but their defining feature is their ability to maneuver unpredictably during flight. This combination of speed and agility makes them exceptionally difficult to detect, track, and intercept using existing missile defense systems. North Korea’s reported success in achieving a speed of Mach 12 amplifies these challenges, as regional defense systems, such as the U.S.-deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea or Japan’s Aegis-equipped destroyers, would have little time to respond. The missile’s range of 1,500 kilometers also underscores its potential to strike critical U.S. military installations in the Pacific, including those in Guam. These bases serve as key hubs for U.S. operations in the Indo-Pacific, providing logistical and strategic support to regional allies. A credible hypersonic missile capability targeting these installations fundamentally shifts the balance of power in the region, directly challenging U.S. military supremacy and deterrence. For South Korea, the proximity to North Korea amplifies the threat. Hypersonic missiles reduce detection and response times to such an extent that key South Korean cities, military installations, and infrastructure are left highly vulnerable. South Korea’s current political instability further complicates the situation. Following a failed attempt to impose martial law, President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached, leaving the nation’s leadership in disarray. This internal crisis has weakened South Korea’s ability to respond cohesively to North Korea’s provocations, exposing significant gaps in its national security. The test also sends a strong message to the United States, which is in a transitional political phase as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20, 2025. Analysts suggest the timing of the test was deliberate, aimed at leveraging the period of U.S. political uncertainty to demonstrate North Korea’s growing military prowess. By showcasing its hypersonic capability, Pyongyang is signaling its readiness to challenge the new U.S. administration while positioning itself for future negotiations. The test’s implications for Japan are equally alarming. The missile’s flight path into the East Sea (Sea of Japan) highlights Japan’s vulnerability to North Korea’s missile arsenal. As a close U.S. ally and a key regional security player, Japan will likely face intensified pressure to upgrade its missile defense systems to counter the hypersonic threat. This could trigger a broader arms race in the Indo-Pacific as nations seek to develop advanced defensive and offensive capabilities in response to North Korea’s actions. On a broader scale, North Korea’s successful hypersonic missile test threatens to destabilize the regional security environment. Hypersonic weapons pose unique challenges to the existing global security architecture, as their speed and maneuverability undermine traditional missile defense systems. This development could accelerate the proliferation of hypersonic technologies, with other nations racing to match or counter North Korea’s advancements. The international community, particularly through the United Nations Security Council, faces the difficult task of addressing this latest provocation. However, longstanding divisions among major powers such as China, Russia, and the United States complicate the prospect of unified action. Meanwhile, regional allies like South Korea and Japan will need to invest heavily in next-generation missile defense systems, including space-based sensors and counter-hypersonic technologies, to address this emerging threat. The risks of miscalculation are also rising. The combination of North Korea’s provocative actions, South Korea’s political turmoil, and the U.S. leadership transition creates a volatile environment where even minor incidents could spiral into more significant conflicts. Monday’s hypersonic missile test marks a turning point in North Korea’s weapons program, signaling its growing capability to threaten regional stability and global security. As Pyongyang continues to refine its hypersonic technology, the urgency for a coordinated response by the United States, its allies, and the broader international community has never been greater. Without decisive action, North Korea’s advancements risk emboldening the regime and heightening tensions in an already precarious Indo-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-north-koreas-hypersonic-missile-test-escalates-regional-and-global-security-threats	2025-01-07T01:00:27-08:00

Black Sea Power Struggle: Why Neither Russia Nor Ukraine Holds Naval Supremacy	According to information published Eesti Rahvusringhääling on January 6, 2025, Commodore Ivo Värk, Navy Commander of Estonia, highlighted that neither Russia nor Ukraine currently possesses uncontested control over the maritime zone, in a detailed analysis of the ongoing naval standoff in the Black Sea. Both nations remain confined in their operations, with their actions heavily influenced by coastal defenses and the complex nature of modern naval warfare.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A contested battleground: Neither Russia nor Ukraine holds dominance in the Black Sea, as evolving naval tactics and modern technologies like drones shape the conflict. (Picture source: Ukrainian MoD) The Black Sea has become a focal point of constrained naval strategies, with both sides exercising caution in their movements. Naval operations are primarily concentrated near coastal areas, where air defense systems, naval mines, and shore-based weaponry provide a safety buffer. Ships from both sides are deployed sparingly and for specific missions, avoiding excessive risks in an environment where control can shift rapidly. Strategic assets like gas drilling platforms play a significant role in the conflict, serving as intelligence hubs for both nations. However, these installations remain contested and frequently change hands. On December 31, Ukraine achieved a significant milestone by destroying a Russian helicopter using a naval drone, marking the first such success in the Black Sea. This highlights Ukraine’s innovative use of surface-based attack drones, which have become a key tool in their naval arsenal. Despite their potential, these drones face limitations in cost, effectiveness, and deployment conditions. The Magura naval drone, estimated at €400,000 per unit, represents a costly investment for Ukraine, which has reported instances where multiple drones failed to reach their targets due to evolving Russian countermeasures. Out of 20 drones launched, none may successfully complete their mission, underscoring the challenges of operating in a contested marine environment. The use of naval drones has sparked interest, but their long-term impact remains a subject of debate. While they provide enhanced situational awareness and intelligence capabilities, drones are unlikely to replace traditional naval platforms such as submarines, surface ships, and missile systems. Instead, they are emerging as complementary tools within the broader framework of modern naval operations. The naval dynamics in the Black Sea demonstrate the complexities of modern maritime conflict. While traditional naval platforms remain indispensable, emerging technologies like drones are reshaping operational strategies. The ongoing contest underscores the adaptability of both sides as they navigate a high-stakes maritime environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/black-sea-power-struggle-why-neither-russia-nor-ukraine-holds-naval-supremacy	2025-01-06T07:53:24-08:00	
North Korea Launches Its First Missile of 2025 During Antony Blinken's Visit to Seoul	North Korea conducted its first ballistic missile launch of the year, escalating tensions in the region as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on an official visit to Seoul. According to Japan's Ministry of Defense, the intermediate-range missile was launched from the Pyongyang area and traveled approximately 1,100 kilometers before falling into the sea off the east coast. This marks North Korea's first missile test since November when several short-range ballistic missiles were launched. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The exact nature of the missile remains unclear, but analysts speculate it could be a hypersonic missile, an advanced version of those tested in January and April 2024 (Picture source: KCNA) Japanese and South Korean authorities quickly confirmed the incident, with Japan's defense ministry reporting the object’s impact in the sea shortly after launch. This missile test coincided with Blinken's meetings with South Korean counterparts to strengthen the strategic alliance between Seoul and Washington amid political instability in South Korea. South Korea is currently navigating a period of uncertainty following last month’s declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk-yeol. This controversial move led to his arrest, leaving interim governance to Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok. Blinken commended South Korea’s democratic resilience while reaffirming the United States' commitment to supporting its ally during this challenging period. The exact nature of the missile remains unclear, but analysts speculate it could be a hypersonic missile, an advanced version of those tested in January and April 2024. If this hypothesis is correct, the launch would signal an effort to bolster North Korea’s military capabilities while delivering a strategic message to the international community. North Korea has significantly expanded its ballistic missile capabilities in recent years, developing an arsenal ranging from short-range missiles like the KN-23 and KN-25 to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. In 2024, North Korea intensified its missile activities, including the launch of the advanced Hwasong-19 ICBM and the deployment of Hwasong-11D launchers near the southern border, each armed with short-range missiles. These actions align with a strategy aimed at reinforcing nuclear deterrence and asserting its presence on the global stage. The timing of this launch raises questions about its political motives. Some analysts suggest it might be an attempt to draw the attention of President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, and potentially restart stalled nuclear disarmament talks. However, Pyongyang appears cautious about resuming negotiations despite Trump’s interest in re-engaging. Geopolitically, reports suggest Russia might be providing satellite technologies to North Korea in exchange for military support in Ukraine. This potential cooperation has heightened international concerns, with Blinken emphasizing the importance of strengthened collaboration between Seoul and Tokyo to address threats from Pyongyang and China’s growing regional influence. In response to the launch, South Korea fired missiles into the sea as a show of deterrence. This underscores Seoul's resolve to counter any provocations, despite its domestic political challenges. Meanwhile, South Korean and U.S. forces remain on high alert, prepared to respond decisively to further escalations. As 2025 begins with renewed tensions, this event highlights the enduring security challenges on the Korean Peninsula. The region faces critical months ahead, both militarily and diplomatically.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/north-korea-launches-its-first-missile-of-2025-during-antony-blinkens-visit-to-seoul	2025-01-06T07:32:26-08:00

Taiwan deploys new Qingtian hypersonic missile to counter China's growing missile capabilities	On December 28, 2024, the Liberty Times reported that Taiwan had finalized the development of its hypersonic cruise missile, the Qingtian, with a range exceeding 2,000 kilometers. The missile builds on the Yunfeng and Yungeng II programs, originally designed for ranges between 1,200 and 2,000 kilometers. The Qingtian introduces advancements in propulsion, navigation, and guidance technologies, enhancing its range, speed, and operational flexibility. Mass production of the Qingtian began in late 2024, with initial units already delivered to Taiwan’s Air Force missile brigades.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link According to information available, the Qingtian hypersonic missile is based on the earlier Yunfeng and Yungeng II programs, originally designed for ranges between 1,200 and 2,000 kilometers, allowing Taiwan to target strategic locations deep within mainland China. (Picture source: Taiwan MoD) The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) led the Qingtian’s development. The missile incorporates ramjet propulsion and materials capable of withstanding high temperatures during hypersonic flight, supported by the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense’s 'National Defense Advanced Technology Research Plan.' Utilizing composite ceramic materials, the missile can endure the extreme conditions associated with speeds exceeding Mach 6. These attributes enable it to evade air defense systems and extend its operational applications. The Qingtian will be deployed on both fixed-launch systems and mobile platforms, enhancing survivability against potential preemptive strikes. The Czech-made Tatra Force 12X12 trucks, were chosen for their off-road capabilities, adaptability to mountainous terrain, and maneuverability. If Czech procurement encounters difficulties, the American Oshkosh M983 serves as an alternative platform. The adoption of mobile launch platforms represents a shift from previous trailer-mounted systems, aligning with modern military trends favoring self-contained launchers. The Qingtian program builds on decades of work on Taiwan’s long-range strike capabilities, originating with the Yunfeng program under President Lee Teng-hui’s administration. Despite challenges such as technical issues in guidance systems and international restrictions under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the program advanced significantly after key restrictions were eased in 2023. This easing, facilitated by agreements with the United States, provided Taiwan access to critical components for precision guidance and propulsion, enhancing the Qingtian’s accuracy and range. The Qingtian forms part of Taiwan’s broader efforts to bolster deterrence capabilities while maintaining technological independence. The Wanjian air-to-ground missile, with a range of 200 kilometers, recently entered mass production, with a longer-range variant under development. Taiwan’s defense initiatives also include domestic submarine production and research into advanced propulsion technologies, such as scramjet engines for future hypersonic applications. These efforts diversify Taiwan’s missile inventory and address various tactical and strategic requirements. Taiwan’s missile advancements come in response to increasing military pressure from China. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) now fields over 3,000 ballistic missiles, including 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the DF-5, DF-31, and DF-41, which have ranges exceeding 12,000 kilometers. The PLARF also operates 900 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), 1,300 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), 500 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), and 400 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs). These systems include dual-use missiles like the DF-26, the DF-17 equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle, and the CJ-100, with a range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers. The Qingtian missile, with its range of approximately 2,000 kilometers, can target strategic locations within mainland China. Reports indicate that its reach extends to areas north of Beijing, including Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. This range covers significant political and military centers, including Beijing and other urban and industrial hubs. The deployment of the Qingtian provides Taiwan with the capability to address critical areas within northern China, strengthening its overall defense strategy. Hypersonic missiles, including the Qingtian, challenge existing defense systems due to their speed, maneuverability, and low-altitude flight paths. Traveling at speeds exceeding Mach 5, they reduce response times for interception. Unlike ballistic missiles that follow predictable trajectories, hypersonic systems perform evasive maneuvers, complicating detection and tracking. Their low-altitude profiles further evade radar detection, necessitating advanced interception technologies to counter their threat.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-deploys-new-qingtian-hypersonic-missile-to-counter-chinas-growing-missile-capabilities	2025-01-06T01:33:42-08:00
