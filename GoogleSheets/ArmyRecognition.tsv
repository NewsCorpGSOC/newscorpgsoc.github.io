(Picture source: US DoD) The country is currently in the third phase of its modernization initiative, called 'Horizons,' which has allocated $35 billion for upgrading its defense capabilities over the next decade. These improvements are considered essential for protecting the territorial integrity of the Philippines, particularly due to its archipelagic geography, which presents unique defense challenges. In a recent speech before leading business figures, General Romeo Brawner, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, emphasized the importance of acquiring submarines. 'It’s a dream for us to get at least two submarines,' Brawner said. 'We are an archipelago. Therefore, we need this kind of capability because it is really difficult to defend the entire archipelago without submarines.' The Philippines' acquisition of defense technologies from India has already begun with the purchase of a BrahMos missile system worth $375 million in 2022. The government has confirmed additional orders for this advanced weapon system, which is expected to be delivered in the coming years. 'We are receiving more of this system this year, and in the years to come,' Brawner added. To further strengthen its defense infrastructure, the Philippines is also acquiring medium-range missiles and at least 40 fighter jets to improve its air and missile defense capabilities. Additionally, the country is expected to receive two corvettes from South Korea this year, further bolstering its naval assets. The strengthening of ties between South Korea and the Philippines is marked by the elevation of their bilateral relations to a strategic partnership last year. Brawner also indicated that the Philippines is working to include South Korea in the Quad, a strategic multilateral group composed of Australia, Japan, the United States, and the Philippines. This initiative reflects the emphasis on regional security cooperation in response to rising tensions with China, particularly in the South China Sea. The Philippines has noted a concerning increase in actions that the country describes as 'illegal, coercive, and deceptive' by China in the South China Sea. According to Brawner, the number of Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea, which refers to waters within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, has significantly increased. From 190 Chinese ships in 2021, the Philippines is now observing a daily average of 286 ships in its maritime zone. As the Philippines continues to bolster its defense capabilities, the situation in the South China Sea remains a central point. The ongoing military buildup aims to ensure that the Philippines can effectively protect its territorial waters and respond to regional security challenges in the face of China’s increasingly assertive actions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/philippines-seeks-to-expand-its-maritime-capabilities-with-acquisition-of-two-submarines	2025-02-13T02:08:00-08:00

(Picture source: X account louischeung_hk) The new Type 054B of the Chinese Navy (PLAN - People's Liberation Army Navy) represents a major upgrade over its predecessor, the Type 054A. While the Type 054A is known for its medium-range air defense capabilities, including the Type 382 radar and HHQ-16 missiles, the newer Type 054B integrates several significant improvements. It is larger, with an estimated displacement of around 6,000 tons compared to the 4,000-ton Type 054A. The new design introduces enhanced stealth characteristics, improved radar and sensor systems, and likely a more advanced integrated combat system. These upgrades suggest a broader operational role, potentially improving anti-air, anti-submarine, and surface warfare capabilities. Sea trials mark a crucial stage in the ship’s development, allowing engineers and naval experts to test the vessel in real-world conditions. The performance of propulsion systems, weapons integration, and electronic warfare systems are assessed to ensure the ship meets operational standards before being commissioned into service. The sighting of the second Type 054B undergoing sea trials indicates that China is accelerating the production and deployment of these new frigates, likely aiming to bolster its fleet amid rising regional tensions and maritime security concerns. China’s naval expansion has been nothing short of transformative in recent years, particularly when compared to other global naval powers such as the United States. The commissioning of the Type 054B frigates is part of a broader naval modernization effort that has seen China surpass the U.S. in the number of combat-ready vessels. As of 2024, the PLAN had already exceeded 370 warships, a number projected to reach 400 by the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has struggled to maintain a fleet size above 290 ships, largely due to budgetary constraints, shipbuilding delays, and workforce shortages. Despite this numerical advantage, the U.S. Navy still retains a technological edge. The American fleet possesses superior aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, and advanced integrated warfare systems. The U.S. has also been investing heavily in next-generation naval capabilities, including unmanned surface vessels, hypersonic weapons, and electronic warfare systems. However, China is rapidly closing the gap. The development of the Type 054B, alongside larger projects like the Fujian aircraft carrier, demonstrates Beijing’s ambitions to secure regional dominance and expand its blue-water capabilities. Beyond the U.S., other global navies are also modernizing, but at a much slower pace. Economic sanctions and industrial limitations have hindered Russia’s naval development, preventing large-scale shipbuilding projects. India has been steadily expanding its fleet with a focus on aircraft carriers and destroyers, but its shipbuilding capacity remains far behind China’s. Meanwhile, European navies, such as those of the UK, France, and Germany, have prioritized high-end but limited naval programs, focusing on advanced technology rather than fleet size. One of China’s greatest advantages in naval expansion is its industrial base. The country’s shipbuilding industry dominates the global market, accounting for the vast majority of commercial and military ship orders. Backed by state-led initiatives, China’s shipyards operate at an unmatched pace, enabling the mass production of warships with high efficiency. In contrast, the U.S. faces significant challenges in shipbuilding due to logistical constraints, labor shortages, and rising costs. The few American shipyards capable of building major warships operate at a much slower pace compared to China’s extensive infrastructure. As a result, while China can rapidly commission new vessels like the Type 054B, the U.S. Navy struggles with delays in programs such as the DDG(X) next-generation destroyer and the Virginia-class submarines. The increasing demand for warships, along with rising production costs, has also led to a reported increase in prices, reflecting the high strategic value and technological advancements of these new-generation vessels. However, with a state-controlled defense industry and lower production costs, China can afford to maintain its shipbuilding momentum far more efficiently than its Western counterparts. The deployment of the Type 054B frigates highlights a key shift in China’s naval strategy. These ships will likely play a vital role in fleet defense, escorting aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships while also being capable of independent operations. Their advanced capabilities make them a formidable addition to the PLAN, particularly in contested waters such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. With the Type 054B and other warships rapidly joining the PLAN’s ranks, China is positioning itself to challenge traditional maritime powers and project naval strength beyond the Indo-Pacific. The increasing number of modernized Chinese warships raises concerns for U.S. and allied forces in the region as the balance of power at sea continues to shift. If current trends persist, the PLAN will not only dominate the regional seas but could also rival the U.S. Navy on a global scale by the 2030s. This rapid naval expansion, combined with advancements in missile technology, electronic warfare, and naval aviation, ensures that China will remain a central player in shaping the future of maritime security worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-chinas-second-type-054b-frigate-conducts-sea-trials-signaling-the-rapid-expansion-of-chinese-navy	2025-02-12T01:40:53-08:00

The first prototype flew in 1995, and the helicopter entered operational service in 2007. As of March 2024, 515 NH90s had been delivered to multiple countries, with production continuing. The NH90 has been introduced into service by multiple operators, with varied experiences regarding its performance and maintenance requirements. Countries such as Germany, Italy, and France continue to use and upgrade their NH90 fleets, incorporating new mission systems and improved sustainment processes. However, Norway and Australia have withdrawn the NH90 from service due to issues related to maintenance costs, availability rates, and operational sustainment challenges. The NH90 remains in production, with efforts underway to address operational limitations and improve serviceability across its variants.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/french-army-receives-final-nh90-caiman-tactical-transport-helicopter-to-replace-its-60-year-old-puma	2025-02-10T03:29:08-08:00

The package includes GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs and JDAM kits, compatible with Israel’s F-15I, F-16I, and F-35I aircraft, bolstering its munitions stockpile and operational readiness. This deal follows a surge in U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS), which reached a record $318.7 billion in Fiscal Year 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Israeli Air Force (IAF) operates multiple fighter jets capable of deploying these munitions, including the F-15I Ra’am, F-16I Sufa, and F-35I Adir. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) The proposed sale includes 2,166 GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB-I), 2,800 MK 82 500-pound general-purpose bomb bodies, and a significant quantity of Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kits. The JDAM package consists of 13,000 units for MK-84 bomb bodies, 3,475 for BLU-109 bomb bodies, and 1,004 for GBU-38v1 configurations. Additionally, Israel will receive 17,475 FMU-152A/B fuzes, FMU-139 fuzes, bomb components, and logistics and program support. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2025. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) operates multiple aircraft capable of deploying these munitions, including the F-15I Ra’am, F-16I Sufa, and F-35I Adir. The GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-I) is a 250-pound precision-guided munition designed for accurate strikes with reduced collateral effects. Its compact size allows aircraft to carry multiple units per sortie, increasing target engagement per mission. The bomb utilizes GPS guidance for all-weather accuracy. The MK 82 General Purpose Bomb is a 500-pound unguided munition widely used in air-to-ground operations. When fitted with JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition) guidance kits, it becomes a precision-guided bomb capable of engaging stationary and moving targets. JDAM kits convert unguided bombs such as the MK 82, MK 84, and BLU-109 into GPS-guided munitions, enhancing accuracy under varying weather conditions. The FMU-152A/B and FMU-139 fuzes provide programmable detonation options, including airburst, impact, and delayed explosion, depending on operational requirements. These fuzes offer adaptability for engaging different target types, such as hardened structures or open-area threats. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been a strategic U.S. partner. Its location in the Middle East provides the U.S. with a strategic presence in a region critical for global energy security and geopolitical stability. Militarily, Israel possesses advanced defense capabilities, supported by U.S. military aid and joint technology development, including missile defense systems. Intelligence-sharing agreements between the two nations have bolstered counterterrorism efforts and regional security initiatives. The U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement (1985) has further strengthened economic ties, particularly in the defense and high-tech sectors. Since the October 2023 conflict with Hamas, U.S.-Israel defense cooperation has intensified, with the United States providing substantial military aid and arms sales, including hundreds of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), designated locally as 'Para.' At least $12.5 billion in direct military assistance has been allocated through legislative measures, including $3.8 billion from a March 2024 bill and $8.7 billion from an April 2024 supplemental appropriations act. Significant arms deals have also been executed, including a $660 million sale of Hellfire missiles, reinforcing Israel’s defense capabilities amid sustained regional tensions. This approval comes amid a broader surge in U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS). In Fiscal Year 2023, FMS transactions hit a record $80.9 billion, with Fiscal Year 2024 surpassing this, as U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments rose 29%, reaching $318.7 billion. This growth is driven largely by global efforts to replenish defense stocks depleted by aid to Ukraine and prepare for potential conflicts. Major U.S. defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman, have played a pivotal role in fulfilling these contracts. However, in January 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14169, titled 'Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.' This order imposed a 90-day pause on all U.S. foreign development assistance programs to review their alignment with American interests and values. The suspension affected various aid initiatives, including health services, education, and emergency projects, with exceptions limited to emergency food assistance and military aid for key allies, including Israel.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-to-significantly-increase-israels-strike-capabilities-with-6-75-billion-worth-of-gps-guided-bombs	2025-02-10T02:40:43-08:00	
DGA Launches DROIDE Program to Accelerate Deployment of Ground Robots in French Army	On February 7, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) announced a new phase in the development of military robotics in France by awarding, on December 30, 2024, a seven-year framework agreement to KNDS France and Safran Electronics &amp; Defense. This program, named DROIDE, is part of a broader effort to modernize France’s military capabilities in autonomous systems, to strengthen the use of ground robotic platforms by 2030-2035. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The DROIDE agreement serves as a key instrument for structuring research and development efforts around essential technologies for military ground robots (Picture source: DGA) This initiative represents a significant step in the strategy for integrating robotics into ground combat, a priority that has been under exploration by the DGA for several years. The French Army has been assessing the potential of robotic systems to support military operations in logistics, reconnaissance, and combat roles. The DROIDE framework agreement aims to advance the technological maturity of robotic platforms while considering the specific challenges posed by terrain and operational conditions. The program will lead to the development of a multi-mission ground robotic demonstrator designed to assist combat units and reduce soldier exposure to risk.The recent history of military robotics in France demonstrates a progressive expansion of capabilities in this domain. In 2018, the DGA commissioned a study from a consortium formed by Safran Electronics &amp; Defense and the SME Effidence to anticipate the integration of robots into combat units under the FURIOUS program (FUturs systèmes Robotiques Innovants en tant qu’OUtilS au profit du combattant embarqué et débarqué). This project led to the development of three demonstrators of varying sizes, designed for zone reconnaissance, building exploration, and equipment transport. These systems underwent testing at the Urban Operations Training Center (CENZUB) in Sissonne.Following the progress made under the FURIOUS program, a new contractual phase was awarded to Safran Electronics &amp; Defense in 2022, after successful trials conducted in 2021 at the Urban Combat Training Center. This phase focused on optimizing the modular architecture of the systems, both in hardware and software, to enhance their level of autonomy.Concurrently, the French Army has increased field experimentation efforts, conducting trials with a robotic mule in the Sahel, launching the CoHoMa challenge, and establishing the Vulcain section to explore the integration of robotics in military operations. The Military Programming Law (LPM) 2024-2030 has reinforced this approach by emphasizing the necessity of developing ground robots capable of interacting with soldiers and their environment under human control, reducing the risks faced by deployed forces.During a Senate hearing in November 2024, the French Army Chief of Staff, General Pierre Schill, detailed expectations regarding ground robotics. He highlighted the importance of preliminary research and demonstrator development, noting that while this field remains less mature than aerial drones, it requires sustained investment, particularly in software development. He also outlined concrete applications for these systems, such as engineering operations involving demining robots and logistical support using robotic carriers capable of following armored vehicles to transport supplies forward.However, deploying armed robotic systems presents complex technical and operational challenges. General Schill emphasized the difficulties associated with autonomous movement and fire control, despite proposals from defense manufacturers such as KNDS France, which developed the Optio X20 armed with a 20mm cannon, and MBDA, which has also introduced relevant solutions. The LPM aims for an initial integration of these robotic systems by 2030, while continuing the necessary testing to ensure their effectiveness and safety in operational environments.Within this framework, the DROIDE agreement serves as a key instrument for structuring research and development efforts around essential technologies for military ground robots. It is designed to include third-party partners offering innovative solutions, thereby strengthening France’s industrial and technological ecosystem in this field.Safran Electronics &amp; Defense is expected to leverage its experience from the FURIOUS program, particularly with its Nerva mini-robots and Ultro 600 robotic mule. Meanwhile, KNDS France will build on its collaboration with SERA Ingénierie, a subsidiary of the SOGECLAIR group, which contributed to the development of the Centurio ground robot. The Centurio has already undergone operational testing at the Canjuers military camp, demonstrating advancements in ground robotics.The awarding of the DROIDE framework agreement to KNDS France and Safran Electronics &amp; Defense confirms the DGA and the French Army’s commitment to accelerating the integration of autonomous systems into ground forces. By structuring research and development around a multi-mission demonstrator, the program aims to identify the most suitable technological solutions for future operational requirements while maintaining industrial and technological sovereignty in the strategic field of military robotics.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/dga-launches-droide-program-to-accelerate-deployment-of-ground-robots-in-french-army	2025-02-10T02:06:56-08:00	
Flash News: Türkiye to Strengthen ESSI’s European Air Defense with Locally-Made Missile Systems	According to information published by the Turkish daily newspaper Daily Sabah on February 10, 2025, Türkiye, which joined the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) in February 2024, is now an official participant in the German-led project aimed at creating a unified and effective missile defense system across Europe and can offer its locally-made air defense missile systems to enhance the capabilities of the ESSI project. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Turkish SIPER long-range air defense missile system, developed by Roketsan and Aselsan, is designed to provide advanced protection against airborne threats, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles (Picture source: SSB) The European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) is a collaborative missile defense program spearheaded by Germany, aimed at strengthening Europe’s air and missile defense architecture through the integration of various air defense systems from participating nations. Designed to counter a wide range of aerial threats, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones, ESSI seeks to enhance NATO’s overall deterrence and response capabilities. The initiative promotes interoperability among European defense systems by incorporating a mix of existing and new technologies, such as the IRIS-T SLM, Patriot, and Arrow-3 air defense systems. By uniting multiple European nations under a single defensive umbrella, ESSI not only fortifies Europe’s protection against aerial threats but also streamlines defense procurement, reducing costs and enhancing coordination among allied forces. In October 2022, fifteen European nations, including Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, and the United Kingdom, signed a declaration to join the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI). The initiative, led by Germany, focuses on the joint procurement of air defense systems to enhance Europe’s missile defense capabilities. All founding states are NATO members, with Finland formally joining the alliance in 2023, further strengthening the collective defense framework. ESSI is closely aligned with NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (NATINAMDS), reinforcing the alliance’s ability to counter aerial threats through a unified and multi-layered air defense network. In February 2024, the German government announced the addition of Greece and Türkiye to the initiative, marking a significant expansion of ESSI’s geographical coverage and operational capabilities. Türkiye’s participation, in particular, adds a new dimension to the initiative, leveraging its strategic location and advanced indigenous air defense systems. With these new members, ESSI continues to evolve as a critical pillar of European security, fostering greater defense cooperation among NATO allies and enhancing deterrence against potential threats. Türkiye’s inclusion in ESSI is particularly noteworthy given its critical geographic position at the intersection of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. As NATO’s southeastern flank, Türkiye provides essential early warning and rapid-response capabilities against missile threats emerging from volatile regions, including the Middle East and the Caucasus. While the initiative is primarily focused on countering Russian threats, Türkiye’s regional coverage enhances its strategic relevance, reinforcing NATO’s collective security posture. Furthermore, Ankara’s participation could signal a recalibration of its relationships with NATO, the European Union, and the United States, potentially easing tensions in defense cooperation. Beyond strategic positioning, Türkiye brings valuable technological contributions to ESSI. Over the past decade, the Turkish defense industry has made significant advancements in the development of indigenous air defense systems, strengthening its ability to support Europe’s missile defense architecture. Led by major defense companies such as Roketsan and Aselsan, Türkiye has successfully developed and deployed a range of modern air defense systems tailored to counter evolving threats. The HISAR-A and HISAR-O systems provide short- and medium-range air defense solutions capable of countering aerial threats, including aircraft, drones, and missiles. Meanwhile, the SIPER long-range air defense system, with a current range exceeding 100 kilometers and future versions expected to reach 180 kilometers, enhances Türkiye’s capability to contribute to medium- and long-range missile defense within ESSI. Additionally, Türkiye has been investing in high-altitude and layered air defense solutions, such as the Çelik Kubbe ('Steel Dome') system, a fully integrated command-and-control network designed to enhance operational coordination. These advancements demonstrate Türkiye’s growing self-reliance in defense technology and its ability to provide sophisticated capabilities to ESSI, reinforcing NATO’s overall missile defense strategy. Despite the strategic and technological advantages Türkiye brings to ESSI, challenges remain. Political tensions within NATO, differences in procurement strategies, and financial commitments from participating nations continue to pose obstacles to full integration. Moreover, ensuring seamless interoperability between Türkiye’s defense systems and existing European missile defense infrastructure will require extensive coordination. Nonetheless, Türkiye’s involvement in ESSI marks an important step toward deeper European defense cooperation. As NATO prioritizes the enhancement of its air and missile defense capabilities, Türkiye’s participation is expected to play a crucial role in the initiative’s success. This development not only strengthens Europe’s collective security but also reaffirms Türkiye’s significance as a key player in regional and global defense. With geopolitical tensions at a high, the expansion of ESSI highlights the growing importance of multinational defense collaboration in addressing modern security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-tuerkiye-to-strengthen-essis-european-air-defense-with-locally-made-missile-systems	2025-02-10T01:32:10-08:00	
China to expand its nuclear submarine fleet as the production of Type 093B increases	On February 7, 2025, Tom Shugart shared an image taken on February 4, 2025, showing the Huludao nuclear submarine shipyard, where a Type 093B nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN/SSGN) was observed with its vertical launch system (VLS) hatches open, revealing what appears to be 12 tubes, indicating a considerable increase in firepower for this class of attack submarine. Another image showed a separate Type 093B on the transfer dock, which is typically used for newly built submarines. At least four Type 093 submarines were observed at the shipyard, though it is unclear whether all are newly constructed or undergoing maintenance.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link At the Huludao shipyard, a Type 093B nuclear-powered attack submarine was observed with its vertical launch system (VLS) hatches open, revealing what appears to be 12 tubes, indicating a considerable increase in firepower for this class of attack submarine. (Picture source: Chinese social media and Twitter/Tom Shugart) China seems to have ordered a rapid expansion of the People's Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) submarine fleet, particularly the Type 093B series. According to several analysts, between seven and eight Type 093B submarines have been built in just the past three years, a production rate that exceeds the number of attack submarines China has constructed over the past three decades. When including conventional submarines, such as the new Type 039C, the total number of submarines launched by China in the past three years surpasses 15. Experts now believe that China is steadily increasing its fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, possibly as a precursor to the introduction of the next-generation Type 095 SSN. Until then, the Type 093B is likely to replace aging vessels while achieving a significant qualitative leap in underwater capabilities. The adoption of pump-jet propulsion in the Type 093B suggests an effort to reduce acoustic signatures and improve underwater performance. Pump-jet propulsors are generally associated with submarines designed for higher speeds and reduced detectability. While initial estimates suggested an initial batch of six units, current reports indicate that Type 093B production is ongoing, replacing older submarines and increasing the total SSN fleet size. China’s nuclear-powered submarine development began in the 1970s with the Type 091 (Han-class) SSN, which was later replaced by the Type 093 (Shang-class) nuclear-powered attack submarine to enhance the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) underwater capabilities. Designed with assistance from Russia, its development aimed to address the limitations of the Type 091, particularly in noise reduction and combat effectiveness. The first Type 093 entered service in the early 2000s, featuring improved hydrodynamics, quieter operation, and greater endurance. Later variants, such as the Type 093A and 093B, incorporated vertical launch systems (VLS) for several types of cruise missiles, marking the first time that a Chinese attack submarine has incorporated such a capability. The Type 093B, reportedly featuring an elongated hull and advanced sensors, is believed to serve as a transition toward the next-generation Type 095 submarine, also designated as 09-V. The Type 093B incorporates a streamlined hull designed to reduce acoustic signatures. It uses a pump-jet propulsion system rather than a conventional propeller, a change consistent with recent trends in SSN design. This propulsion system is generally associated with improvements in efficiency and noise reduction at higher speeds. A key feature of the Type 093B is the integration of a vertical launch system (VLS), marking the first known instance of a Chinese SSN being equipped with VLS, allowing it to launch a range of missile types. The observed configuration, which appears to include between 12 and 24 VLS cells, suggests the submarine can be armed with anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs), and potentially submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Satellite imagery from early 2023 showed that China had launched its eighth Type 093-class submarine at Huludao, with at least two confirmed as Type 093B variants. The rate of production suggests a degree of standardization in manufacturing. During the 70th anniversary of the PLAN’s Submarine Force in June 2024, Chinese state media outlined the increasing role of nuclear-powered attack submarines in naval operations. Reports suggest that the Type 093B may be capable of carrying a submarine-launched variant of the YJ-21 hypersonic missile, which has been observed on Type 055 destroyers. If deployed from submarines, this missile would expand China’s strike capabilities. The increased production rate of the Type 093B also raises questions about the future composition of China’s underwater fleet, particularly regarding the ratio of SSNs to conventionally powered submarines (SSKs) such as the Type 039C. The increased adoption of pump-jet propulsion indicates that these new SSNs may be deployed more aggressively than their predecessors. Additionally, beyond the Type 093B, China is continuing to develop its submarine fleet. The Type 094 SSBNs have been used for strategic deterrence patrols, though some analysts suggest that China's nuclear triad is not yet fully operational. There are reports that China may modify some Type 094 SSBNs into SSGNs, potentially increasing their missile capabilities. This will increase the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)’s capability for blue-water operations, extend its operational range, and strengthen its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities. SSKs will likely remain part of the fleet for regional defense and littoral operations, while the growing SSN fleet is positioned to conduct long-range patrols, escort carrier groups, and contribute to strategic deterrence in the Pacific and surrounding waters. In parallel, China is actively enhancing the missile capabilities of its main vessels. The Type 055 destroyer, for instance, is equipped with 112 vertical launch system (VLS) cells, capable of deploying various missiles, including the YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missile and the CJ-10 land-attack cruise missile. The YJ-18 features a subsonic cruise mode and a supersonic terminal attack, with an estimated range of 220 to 540 kilometers, while the CJ-10 is a land-attack cruise missile with a range exceeding 1,500 kilometers. Additionally, China has introduced the YJ-21, a hypersonic anti-ship ballistic missile with an estimated range of approximately 1,500 kilometers and speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 10. The recently commissioned Type 054B frigate also features modern missile systems, contributing to China's growing naval firepower, with reports from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) indicating that by 2024, the Chinese Navy had achieved more than 50% of the U.S. Navy's firepower in VLS missile cells.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/china-to-expand-its-nuclear-submarine-fleet-as-the-production-of-type-093b-increases	2025-02-10T01:28:24-08:00	
Indonesia Weighs Aircraft Carrier Acquisition to Strengthen Maritime Operations and Security	Indonesia is currently exploring the possibility of acquiring an aircraft carrier to strengthen its military capabilities in a non-combat role. During a press conference held on February 6, 2025, in Jakarta, the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL), Admiral Muhammad Ali, emphasized the need to modernize the fleet’s equipment and presented several acquisition proposals to the Indonesian Ministry of Defense. Among these proposals is the acquisition of an aircraft carrier designed for non-combat missions, along with the purchase of frigates from Italy and fast missile-armed patrol boats from Turkey. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Rumors have circulated about the possible acquisition of the Giuseppe Garibaldi aircraft carrier, which could indicate a potential agreement with the Italian naval industry for modernization or licensed construction (Picture source: Marina Difesa) For several years, the Indonesian Navy has conducted studies on acquiring an aircraft carrier-like vessel capable of carrying helicopters for both combat and non-combat operations. Indonesia has not yet officially confirmed the builder of its potential aircraft carrier, but several options are under consideration. PT PAL Indonesia, the country’s leading shipbuilder, has already proposed helicopter carrier and amphibious assault ship concepts, making it a possible candidate for a domestic construction project, potentially in collaboration with a foreign partner.Italy could also play a key role, particularly through Fincantieri, which already has ties with the Indonesian Navy for the supply of frigates. Additionally, rumors have circulated about the possible acquisition of the Giuseppe Garibaldi aircraft carrier, which could indicate a potential agreement with the Italian naval industry for modernization or licensed construction.Another possibility is a partnership with South Korea, a country with which Indonesia already collaborates in the naval sector, particularly through Hyundai Heavy Industries or DSME, which could offer a suitable platform. The option of purchasing a second-hand vessel also remains on the table, with potential modernization by the original builder according to the Indonesian Navy’s specific requirements. The final decision will depend on the country’s strategic priorities, budget, and ongoing negotiations with its industrial and military partners.Although the Indonesian Navy is considered one of the most powerful in Southeast Asia, it still lacks sufficient capabilities and ships to safeguard the country’s vast territory and exclusive economic zones. The aging fleet remains a recurring challenge. As part of its armed forces modernization plan, known as the Minimum Essential Force (MEF), the Indonesian Navy plans to operate at least four amphibious helicopter carrier vessels.Beyond the aircraft carrier project, the Indonesian Navy is also pursuing other strategic acquisitions. It has submitted an official request for the purchase of two frigates built in Italy to enhance its fleet’s operational presence and capabilities. Meanwhile, two domestically produced frigates have been prepared for service, reinforcing the country’s goal of increasing industrial and operational self-sufficiency. Additionally, multiple fast missile-equipped patrol boats from Turkey will further strengthen the fleet.Indonesia has also received a grant proposal from Japan, offering two patrol vessels to be stationed at the Balikpapan naval base in East Kalimantan. This location is strategically important as it will bolster the military presence near Indonesia’s future capital, Nusantara, situated close to Balikpapan. Admiral Muhammad Ali stated that these patrol vessels are well suited to the region’s geography, particularly due to their ability to navigate the numerous waterways in the future capital. Measuring 18 meters in length, these ships will enhance riverine security and surveillance.The Indonesian Parliament (DPR) has approved the Ministry of Defense and the armed forces’ request to accept this Japanese grant, reflecting the country’s commitment to strengthening its maritime security. These acquisitions and modernization efforts represent a clear strategy aimed at improving Indonesia’s power projection and maritime security within an evolving regional landscape.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indonesia-weighs-aircraft-carrier-acquisition-to-strengthen-maritime-operations-and-security	2025-02-10T00:49:41-08:00	
German Navy Enhances Its Maritime Patrol Capabilities with Reception of Its First P-8A Poseidon	The first Boeing P-8A Poseidon intended for the German Navy has been painted in German colors at Boeing's facility in Seattle, marking a key step in modernizing Germany’s maritime surveillance capabilities. This aircraft, registered as 63+01 and bearing serial number 170528, is the first of eight units to be ordered. They will gradually replace the aging P-3C Orion fleet. Delivery is scheduled for August 2025, initiating the transition to a more advanced and technologically integrated platform. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The P-8A Poseidon is a multi-role maritime patrol aircraft derived from the Boeing 737NG, designed for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions (Picture source: Boeing) Germany began acquiring the P-8A Poseidon in June 2021 with an initial order of five aircraft under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, later adding three more units in November 2023. This program, allowing Germany to procure U.S. military equipment through an intergovernmental agreement, has progressed at an unusually fast pace, with only four years between the contract signing and the completion of the first unit. Following the application of its livery, the aircraft was transferred to Boeing Defense, where it will be equipped with its mission systems and undergo a series of tests before being handed over to the German Navy’s air squadron based in Nordholz, Lower Saxony.The P-8A Poseidon is a multi-role maritime patrol aircraft derived from the Boeing 737NG, designed for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Powered by two CFM-56-7BE turbofan engines, it reaches a maximum speed of 490 knots, an operational ceiling of 41,000 feet, and extended endurance due to its in-flight refueling capability. Its Link 11 and Link 16 data links, combined with advanced satellite connectivity, enable near real-time intelligence transmission to command centers, optimizing coordination in joint and multinational operations. Its adaptable architecture allows for long-duration missions both in deep-sea environments and near coastal areas, with enhanced command and control capabilities on the battlefield.The aircraft’s weaponry includes Mark 54 torpedoes, AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and depth charges, distributed between an internal weapons bay and external hardpoints under the wings. It is also equipped with 129 sonobuoys for detecting, localizing, and tracking submarines. For surveillance and targeting, it features an inverse synthetic aperture radar and a synthetic aperture radar, enabling precise identification of surface and underwater threats. In terms of self-protection, the Poseidon is fitted with the AN/AAQ-24(V) DIRCM system, designed to detect and neutralize infrared-guided missiles, enhancing its survivability against aerial and naval threats.The acquisition of the P-8A Poseidon by the German Navy comes at a time when the renewal of maritime patrol capabilities is becoming increasingly urgent. Initially, Germany considered this procurement as an interim solution while awaiting the development of the Franco-German Maritime Airborne Warfare System, scheduled for 2035. However, with the shifting industrial priorities in France and Berlin’s decision to expand its P-8A fleet, the long-term integration of the aircraft into German forces appears increasingly likely.By acquiring the P-8A Poseidon, Germany joins the ranks of operators that include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Norway, New Zealand, South Korea, and India, while Canada is also preparing to introduce the platform. Currently, over 130 P-8A aircraft are in service worldwide, accumulating more than 600,000 flight hours. Production begins at Boeing’s commercial aircraft facility in Renton, where the fuselage is manufactured according to 737 specifications before being transferred to Boeing’s defense facilities for military equipment and mission system integration.The German P-8A fleet will incorporate the latest configurations, including an advanced self-protection system capable of countering infrared-guided missiles, similar to those used on German government aircraft. For anti-submarine warfare, the aircraft will be equipped with acoustic buoy launchers, Mark 54 torpedoes, and Mark 84 depth charges. However, unlike the P-3C Orion, it will not feature a magnetic anomaly detector, reducing its ability to directly detect submarines based on their magnetic signature. For reconnaissance and counter-surface warfare missions, the Poseidon will be armed with Harpoon missiles and will feature a retractable electro-optical turret, as well as the AN/ALQ-240(V)1 electronic support measures system, providing electronic warfare and signal intelligence capabilities.One of the P-8A’s key advantages is its ability to transmit real-time intelligence to German command centers, strengthening Germany’s maritime surveillance in an evolving strategic environment. With its next-generation communication systems, it will play a central role in networked warfare operations, improving interoperability with NATO allies. Frigate Captain Björn M., project lead for the P-8A program within the BAAINBw, emphasized that this aircraft represents a significant enhancement in joint-force coordination and marks a new era for maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare.The entry of the P-8A Poseidon into the German Navy marks a critical step for the Bundeswehr in accelerating the modernization of its maritime patrol capabilities. This program, executed at an accelerated pace for a project of this scale, reflects Germany’s intent to quickly address operational gaps left by the retirement of the Orion fleet. In a geopolitical context shaped by the war in Ukraine and the increasing need for enhanced maritime surveillance, these new aircraft will reinforce Germany’s strategic posture and its ability to conduct long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/german-navy-enhances-its-maritime-patrol-capabilities-with-reception-of-its-first-p-8a-poseidon	2025-02-10T00:19:52-08:00

Breaking News: Morocco Chooses Israeli ATMOS 2000 Howitzers Over French CAESAR Amid Growing Defense Ties	According to information published on February 8, 2025, by the French financial weekly La Tribune, defense journalist Michel Cabirol reported that Israeli defense company Elbit Systems had secured a contract to supply 36 ATMOS 2000 155mm wheeled self-propelled howitzers to Morocco. These artillery systems will be mounted on Czech Tatra trucks, marking a significant shift in Morocco’s artillery procurement strategy. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ATMOS 2000 is a 155mm/52-caliber truck-mounted self-propelled howitzer developed by Israeli defense company Elbit Systems. (Picture source: Elbit Systems) This decision follows operational challenges faced with the French-made CAESAR howitzers, which were delivered in 2022 by KNDS France. Citing Cabirol, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) experienced recurring technical issues with the CAESAR systems, prompting them to seek a more reliable and efficient alternative. France had been anticipating a new order for additional CAESAR howitzers, but instead, Rabat selected the Israeli ATMOS 2000, signaling a growing preference for Israeli military technology over traditional European suppliers. The ATMOS 2000 (Autonomous Truck Mounted Howitzer System) is a 155mm/52-caliber truck-mounted artillery system designed for rapid deployment and superior mobility. One of its key advantages is its adaptability to various high-mobility truck platforms, including 6x6 and 8x8 configurations, providing flexibility based on operational needs. The system is capable of firing extended-range projectiles exceeding 40 kilometers, with a rate of fire between 4 to 9 rounds per minute, depending on the mode of operation. The advanced automatic laying and navigation system ensures high precision, and the system is fully compatible with modern C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence) networks for enhanced battlefield awareness. The ATMOS 2000 is designed for quick relocation, moving within 30 seconds after firing to avoid counter-battery threats. Additionally, its semi-automatic loading system allows it to be operated efficiently by a crew of 2 to 6 personnel, making it a more automated and efficient alternative to traditional towed and self-propelled howitzers. According to Elbit Systems, the ATMOS 2000 outperforms the French CAESAR in multiple aspects, particularly in mobility, automation, firepower, and crew efficiency. Unlike the CAESAR, which is primarily available on French Arquus or Mercedes-Benz trucks, the ATMOS 2000 is adaptable to a variety of truck chassis, including Czech Tatra trucks, allowing Morocco to integrate it into its existing logistics infrastructure. The automation level of the ATMOS 2000 is another key advantage, as it incorporates a semi-automatic loading system, reducing crew workload and enhancing rate of fire. In contrast, the CAESAR uses a manual loading system, requiring a larger crew of 4 to 5 personnel, which increases operational complexity and slows down the artillery system’s response time in combat scenarios. When comparing firepower and rate of fire, the ATMOS 2000 is capable of firing between 4 to 9 rounds per minute, depending on the mission profile and crew efficiency, and supports MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact) capabilities, allowing multiple shells to hit a target simultaneously. While the CAESAR has a comparable rate of fire of 6 rounds per minute, operational reports from Morocco suggest that ATMOS provides a more reliable and efficient artillery platform in sustained combat operations. Elbit Systems has also integrated advanced fire control and C4I capabilities into the ATMOS 2000, enabling real-time target sharing, automated fire correction, and enhanced digital battlefield awareness. While the CAESAR also features a modern fire control system, Morocco has reported integration challenges with foreign C4I networks, making it less adaptable for their specific operational needs. In terms of mobility and deployment speed, the ATMOS 2000 has a significant advantage, as it can relocate in under 30 seconds after firing, reducing vulnerability to enemy counter-battery fire. The CAESAR, in comparison, requires approximately one minute to complete its firing sequence and reposition, making it slightly slower in high-intensity combat scenarios. Both systems are compatible with NATO-standard 155mm ammunition, with the ATMOS achieving a range of over 40 km using ERFB-BB (Extended Range Full Bore - Base Bleed) projectiles, while the CAESAR can reach 42 km with the same ammunition and up to 50 km with VLAP (Very Long-Range Artillery Projectile). Since establishing formal diplomatic relations in 2020, Morocco and Israel have significantly expanded their defense cooperation. In 2021, the two countries signed a Defense Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), opening the door for defense contracts, intelligence sharing, and joint military projects. Among the most notable agreements was Morocco's $500 million deal in 2023 to acquire the Israeli Barak MX air and missile defense system, significantly strengthening its air defense network. Additionally, Morocco has integrated 20 Israeli EL/M-2032 radar systems into its F-5E fighter jets, enhancing their air-to-air combat capabilities. The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces have also bolstered their air defense with the acquisition of 75 Barak-LRAD long-range air defense systems, which are part of the Barak-MX missile defense package. The growing presence of Israeli military equipment on the global defense market is becoming increasingly evident, often competing directly with European defense manufacturers, including France. Over the past decade, Israel has expanded its defense exports through strategic agreements, offering modern, combat-proven technology that appeals to nations seeking reliable alternatives to European and American systems. In contrast, France has struggled to maintain its influence, facing delays in deliveries, complex political conditions, and customer dissatisfaction with some of its defense products. The Moroccan shift from the French CAESAR to the Israeli ATMOS 2000 is a prime example of this trend, highlighting the increasing preference for Israeli artillery systems in regions like Africa and Asia. While France had been expecting to secure an additional order for more CAESAR howitzers from Morocco, the selection of the ATMOS 2000 underscores Israel’s growing role as a major global arms supplier, offering combat-proven, cost-effective, and adaptable solutions that appeal to modern militaries. As a result, Israel’s defense industry is steadily increasing its market share, posing a significant challenge to traditional European suppliers like France in the highly competitive global arms market.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-morocco-chooses-israeli-atmos-2000-howitzers-over-french-caesar-amid-growing-defense-ties	2025-02-09T05:28:22-08:00

Flash News: Boeing F/A-18E/F Naval Fighter Jet Gains New Long-Range Target Detection with New IRST Block II	On February 4, 2025, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced that the Infrared Search and Track (IRST) Block II system has achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fleet. Officially operational as of November 2024, this advanced sensor system enhances the aircraft’s ability to search, detect, track, and engage airborne threats at long range, providing a critical advantage in modern air combat.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Using passive infrared technology, the IRST Block II upgrade enhances the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet's ability to detect, track, and engage airborne threats at long range. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, developed and manufactured by the American Company Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, is a twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft designed for a wide range of missions. It serves as the backbone of the U.S. Navy’s carrier air wings, performing air superiority, strike operations, close air support, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. McDonnell Douglas originally developed the Super Hornet as an advanced and enlarged version of the F/A-18 Hornet. Following the merger of McDonnell Douglas with Boeing in 1997, production and further development of the aircraft were taken over by Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security. The Super Hornet entered service with the U.S. Navy in 1999, replacing aging platforms like the F-14 Tomcat and supplementing the original F/A-18A-D Hornet models. Boeing remains the primary contractor and manufacturer of the F/A-18E/F, producing the aircraft at its St. Louis, Missouri facility while also overseeing modernization programs, sustainment, and upgrades. The Super Hornet features a larger airframe, more advanced avionics, and increased fuel capacity compared to its predecessor. It is powered by two General Electric F414-GE-400 afterburning turbofan engines, each delivering 22,000 pounds of thrust, ensuring superior speed, agility, and combat endurance. The aircraft incorporates stealth-enhancing design features, radar-absorbent materials, and a low radar cross-section (RCS), increasing survivability in contested environments. One of its key advantages is the AN/APG-79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which enables long-range target detection, tracking, and engagement. However, in environments where radar jamming and electronic warfare threats are present, the addition of the IRST Block II system significantly enhances the aircraft’s effectiveness by enabling passive target detection and tracking. The ASG-34A(V)1 F/A-18E/F IRST is a centerline-mounted pod that houses a long-wave infrared (LWIR) sensor, providing a passive fire control system for searching, detecting, tracking, and engaging airborne targets at extended ranges. Unlike radar, which can be jammed or detected, the IRST Block II system operates passively, meaning it does not emit signals, making it highly effective in electronic warfare-heavy and radar-denied environments. The IRST sensor assembly is integrated onto the front of the redesigned FPU-13/A centerline fuel tank, replacing the standard FPU-12/A 480-gallon fuel tank. Due to this integration, the fuel capacity is reduced to 340 gallons, leading to a decrease in available fuel and reduced mission endurance for the F/A-18E/F. However, the trade-off provides a significant enhancement in combat effectiveness, allowing for early threat detection and long-range engagement. The IRST Block II system acts as a complementary sensor to the AN/APG-79 fire control radar, providing a dual-layer detection system in environments where enemy electronic warfare systems attempt to jam or disable radar-based tracking. It can operate autonomously or in coordination with other onboard sensors, allowing pilots to detect and track enemy aircraft at long range without radar emissions, maintaining stealth. It enables identification and classification of targets based on infrared signatures, distinguishing between different aircraft types. It also supports beyond-visual-range (BVR) missile engagements by providing targeting data for AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder Block II missiles. This capability is crucial in modern air combat, where fifth-generation stealth aircraft and advanced electronic warfare threats are increasingly prevalent. By integrating IRST Block II, the Super Hornet gains an advantage in both offensive and defensive air combat by allowing pilots to track threats without exposing their own position. Before reaching IOC, the IRST Block II system underwent rigorous Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) with Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 9. The F/A-18 and EA-18G Program Office (PMA-265) collaborated with VX-31 and VX-23, conducting extensive operational and developmental testing to validate the system's performance in real-world combat conditions. The IRST system has been developed in two phases, with Block I introduced in 2011, integrating an early IRST system onto an F/A-18 fuel tank, providing initial passive detection capability. Block II, developed in 2019, introduced an improved infrared sensor, enhanced processing capabilities, and upgraded software, culminating in IOC in 2024 and first operational deployment in 2025. With IOC declared, the next step is the full-rate production decision scheduled for Spring 2025, which will allow for the widespread integration of IRST Block II across carrier-based F/A-18E/F squadrons. The integration of IRST Block II into the Super Hornet fleet marks a significant advancement in U.S. Navy air combat capability. As a naval carrier-capable fighter jet, this new version of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet offers the U.S. Navy a critical edge in modern air combat. With the ability to operate from aircraft carriers in high-threat environments, the Super Hornet equipped with IRST Block II enhances long-range air dominance by allowing pilots to engage enemy aircraft with greater precision while remaining undetected. The system significantly improves beyond-visual-range engagement capabilities, ensuring that the Super Hornet remains effective against advanced adversaries equipped with stealth technology and electronic warfare systems. Additionally, the enhanced sensor fusion between IRST and AESA radar provides uninterrupted target tracking, allowing for better coordination with naval assets, carrier strike groups, and allied forces. By integrating IRST Block II, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet strengthens carrier-based air superiority, ensuring that U.S. Naval forces maintain operational effectiveness in contested environments. With adversaries continuing to develop advanced stealth aircraft and electronic warfare capabilities, the Super Hornet’s enhanced sensor suite and expanded combat capabilities reinforce its role as a dominant multirole fighter for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-boeing-f-a-18e-f-naval-fighter-jet-gains-new-long-range-target-detection-with-new-irst-block-ii	2025-02-07T09:43:10-08:00

The first reactor was activated in December 2024, followed by the second on February 2, 2025, confirming the operational readiness of the ship’s nuclear propulsion system. Currently docked at Sevmash, the cruiser is scheduled to begin sea trials in the summer of 2025, with state trials planned before commissioning in 2026, as the Admiral Nakhimov now has a higher missile capacity than the US Zumwalt and Arleigh Burke classes.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Upon successful completion of the sea trials, the Admiral Nakhimov nuclear battlecruiser will be reintroduced into the Russian Northern Fleet as one of its most powerful surface ships, with a service life projected to extend at least for 30 years. (Picture source: Russian social media) The ship’s extensive overhaul has faced multiple delays, with earlier estimates suggesting a return to service in 2022. However, modifications to the upgrade program and financial constraints have further extended the timeline. The cost of the refurbishment has reportedly exceeded 200 billion rubles, making it one of the most expensive warship modernizations in Russian naval history. According to earlier statements from Russian sources, the goal was to achieve the physical launch of both reactors and initiate undocking procedures by the fall of 2024. However, the first reactor was only activated in December 2024, coinciding with the completion of the ship’s demagnetization process. Originally designated Kalinin, the Admiral Nakhimov was constructed at the Baltic Shipyard in Leningrad as the third nuclear-powered battlecruiser of the Kirov class. It was laid down on May 17, 1983, launched on April 25, 1986, and commissioned into the Russian Northern Fleet on December 30, 1988, before being renamed on April 22, 1992. The ship was placed into long-term maintenance in 1999, with major modernization efforts beginning in 2013. Before this full-scale upgrade, it carried 20 P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles, 96 S-300F Fort-M air defense missiles, six 30mm Kashtan close-in weapon systems, as well as torpedo and anti-submarine systems. The modernization has significantly enhanced the ship’s combat capabilities. Ten 3S14 universal vertical launch systems, each containing eight Kalibr-NK or Oniks cruise missiles, have replaced the previous missile setup, allowing for a total of 80 missiles. The ship has also been equipped to launch the 3M22 Tsirkon hypersonic missile, extending its strike capability. Additionally, the air defense systems have been upgraded, replacing the older S-300F with a navalized S-400 system containing 96 launch cells. Shorter-range defenses now include the Pantsir-ME and a naval adaptation of the S-350 Vityaz, replacing the older Osa-M system. In comparison, China’s Type 055 destroyers feature 112 VLS cells, accommodating YJ-18 anti-ship missiles, CJ-10 land-attack cruise missiles, and HHQ-9 long-range air defense missiles. The Type 055 is equipped with a dual-band radar system and electronic warfare capabilities. The U.S. Arleigh Burke Flight III destroyers are fitted with 96 Mk 41 VLS cells, supporting Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, SM-6 air defense missiles, and ESSM interceptors. The Zumwalt-class destroyers, with 80 VLS cells, are designed for low-observable operations and multi-mission strike capabilities, including hypersonic missile integration. While the Admiral Nakhimov has a higher missile capacity than the Zumwalt and Arleigh Burke classes, it lacks the integrated stealth features of modern Chinese and U.S. designs, which may affect its survivability. Spanning for over a decade, the Admiral Nakhimov’s extensive modernization has faced multiple delays, with earlier estimates suggesting a return to service in 2022. (Picture source: Russian social media) Compared to the Moskva cruiser, which carried 16 P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missiles and S-300F Fort air defense missiles, the Admiral Nakhimov has a significantly larger missile arsenal, more modern air defense systems, and enhanced electronic warfare capabilities. The Moskva, commissioned in 1983, used older radar and fire control systems, limiting its adaptability to newer threats. While the Moskva was optimized for fleet air defense with limited multi-role capabilities, the Admiral Nakhimov is configured for a broader range of missions, including long-range precision strikes, air defense, and anti-submarine warfare. Beyond missile armaments, the ship's nuclear propulsion system has been fully restored, with two KN-3 nuclear reactors producing 2×150 MW, supported by two auxiliary boilers and two turbines generating a combined 140,000 hp (103 MW) on shafts. The propulsion system also includes four power plants with a capacity of 18 MW, four steam turbine generators producing 3 MW each, and four gas turbine generators rated at 1.5 MW each, ensuring speeds of up to 32 knots. All electronic warfare and radar systems have been upgraded to modern standards, with improved target tracking and threat detection capabilities. Additional enhancements include the installation of the Redut naval air defense system and the Paket-NK anti-submarine system, increasing layered defense capabilities against aerial, surface, and underwater threats. The final modernization phase will involve extensive testing of the 28,000-ton vessel, with factory sea trials expected in mid-2025, followed by state trials assessing all systems under operational conditions. Upon successful completion, the Admiral Nakhimov will be reintroduced into the Russian Northern Fleet as one of its most powerful surface ships. The vessel's service life is projected to extend at least 30 years, enabling it to engage naval and land-based targets at long range while offering enhanced air defense for fleet operations. The fate of the Admiral Nakhimov’s sister ship, the Pyotr Velikiy, remains under review. In mid-2023, reports suggested it could be decommissioned after the Admiral Nakhimov’s return to service, but the Northern Fleet later denied this. The Pyotr Velikiy remains in operational duty as the only currently active Kirov-class cruiser until the Admiral Nakhimov is recommissioned, though its long-term future within the Russian Navy remains unclear. The Kirov-class nuclear-powered missile cruisers were developed during the Soviet era as the largest non-aircraft carrier surface combatants. Displacing 28,000 tons, they surpass most modern naval combatants, including U.S. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. The class was designed for multi-role operations, with anti-ship, anti-air, and anti-submarine capabilities. However, their high maintenance costs and reliance on nuclear propulsion have limited their long-term viability, with only two of the original four ships remaining in service, as the Admiral Ushakov and Admiral Lazarev were decommissioned due to their aging systems and expensive maintenance.

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Arctic Region is emerging as a key arena for military power projection, driven by a combination of strategic, environmental, and economic factors. Melting ice is opening up new maritime routes, and significant natural resources such as oil, gas, and minerals lie beneath its icy surface. Control of these resources, as well as the ability to secure vital shipping lanes, has made the region a strategic hotspot. The thawing of Arctic waters has also made it easier for military forces to maneuver through previously inaccessible areas, making it imperative for armed forces to be prepared for operations in these harsh conditions. The region’s remoteness and environmental challenges mean that conventional military tactics and equipment must be adapted to operate in extreme cold, high-altitude, and unpredictable weather conditions. These factors emphasize the necessity for specialized training and the development of interoperable forces that can respond to any crisis or conflict in this sensitive region. The U.S. Army’s Arctic Forge 25 exercise serves as a critical training ground for U.S. forces to refine their cold-weather capabilities. Over 330 soldiers from the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division and 10th Mountain Division will join approximately 500 Finnish personnel and 40 Canadian troops to enhance their interoperability and survival skills in freezing conditions. The multinational exercise focuses on command and control of a combined battalion while honing cold-weather survival techniques essential for Arctic operations. The 10th Mountain Division is a specialized U.S. Army unit renowned for its expertise in cold-weather and mountain warfare. Trained to operate in extreme conditions, the division is equipped with specialized gear and undergoes rigorous training in winter survival, cross-country skiing, and mountaineering. Its soldiers are capable of performing combat operations in harsh environments, from snow-covered mountains to high-altitude terrains. With a legacy dating back to World War II, the division has proven its adaptability in diverse regions, including Afghanistan, and remains a vital asset for both cold-weather and mountainous combat, often participating in joint multinational exercises to enhance interoperability in such conditions. The exercise is not just about survival, however. It also plays a vital role in NATO’s defense posture, particularly in the High North. 'Operating in the high-north allows NATO forces to train our warfighting tasks to be prepared to respond in conflict or crisis,' said Gen. Christopher Donahue, Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The training helps ensure that NATO forces can operate together seamlessly, reinforcing the Alliance’s defense commitments made during the 2024 NATO summit in Washington, D.C. More than 110 U.S. Army soldiers from the 41st Field Artillery Brigade will also participate, deploying from Grafenwoehr, Germany, to Bardufoss, Norway. This segment of the exercise will showcase U.S. forces' ability to deliver long-range precision fires in Arctic conditions, a critical capability in defending the region’s strategic interests. The U.S. Army’s participation in Arctic Forge 25 and its ongoing focus on Arctic readiness underscore the U.S. military’s commitment to safeguarding national interests in the region. By developing the necessary operational capabilities, the U.S. is positioning itself to respond to any potential threats in a region increasingly seen as vital to global stability. In addition to military preparedness, the Arctic region is also a significant focus of U.S. foreign policy, and recent decisions by former President Donald Trump, following his return to office in 2025, underscore this growing emphasis. The Arctic’s strategic importance has only intensified under his leadership, and his administration’s actions reflect a broader strategy aimed at securing U.S. influence in the region. One of Trump’s first actions was to focus on enhancing the U.S. military presence in the Arctic, particularly as tensions with Russia and China continue to rise. His administration has also revived previous plans, such as the proposal to expand U.S. military operations in the Arctic, which is seen as crucial to maintaining control over emerging shipping routes and securing valuable resources. Trump’s broader defense policies have continued to center on national security and military strength, with a particular focus on ensuring that the U.S. maintains superiority in contested regions like the Arctic. His moves also involve pushing back against growing foreign influence in the region, especially from Russia and China, who have expanded their military and economic activities in the Arctic in recent years. Furthermore, Trump’s emphasis on military readiness is aligned with his broader vision of strengthening U.S. defense capabilities worldwide, making the Arctic a strategic focal point of his second term. Additionally, Trump has pursued a more isolationist and America-first approach to foreign policy, as evidenced by his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and his skepticism towards multilateral environmental initiatives. Despite facing legal challenges from environmental groups and states like California, Trump remains committed to his vision of promoting energy independence, which includes continued exploration of Arctic oil and gas reserves. Trump’s recent actions also include a continuation of his aggressive stance on China, with new measures aimed at limiting Chinese access to critical infrastructure and strengthening U.S. national security against technological influence from Beijing. This is in line with his previous policies and represents a broader strategy of reinforcing U.S. power in critical regions such as the Arctic. In sum, the Arctic region remains a critical area of interest for global armed forces, and with the continued influence of leaders like Trump, it is likely to see increased military and geopolitical attention. The U.S. Army’s exercises, such as Arctic Forge 25, and the broader strategic shifts under Trump’s presidency, reflect the growing significance of this region as a cornerstone of U.S. defense and foreign policy. As military activities in the Arctic intensify, both NATO forces and Arctic nations will continue to adapt and prepare for a future shaped by global competition and environmental changes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-army-deploys-11th-airborne-and-10th-mountain-divisions-to-arctic-to-secure-strategic-interests	2025-02-06T01:27:41-08:00

With a range of 1,700 km, the Etamad missile extends Iran’s ability to target a broader range of regions, including parts of the Middle East, the Arabian Peninsula, and even Israel, which is within its reach. Such a range positions the missile as a significant asset in Iran’s strategic deterrence and offensive capabilities. At the international level, the Etamad missile poses a serious security concern for neighboring countries and global powers with interests in the region. For instance, it brings key targets in Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other Gulf states within striking distance, particularly critical military infrastructure and defense sites. Iran's ability to launch precise strikes against such targets would complicate the defense strategies of these nations and their allies. The missile's capability also adds to the growing apprehension in Europe. Iranian officials have previously hinted at future missile systems capable of reaching continental Europe, raising alarms over the potential for a more direct threat to European security. If Iran’s missile capabilities continue to advance, countries in the West may face increased pressure to develop more robust missile defense systems or engage in more aggressive diplomacy and countermeasures. Moreover, the Etamad missile could lead to increased arms competition in the region. Countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and others may feel compelled to enhance their own missile and defense systems to counter the perceived threat from Iran, potentially fueling an arms race in the already volatile Middle East. This missile development also impacts the broader geopolitical dynamics surrounding the Iran nuclear deal. With advancements in both ballistic missile technology and nuclear capabilities, Iran's posture on the global stage could further strain relations with Western powers, particularly the United States, which has imposed sanctions on Iran for its missile development and nuclear ambitions. While official testing and deployment dates for the Etamad remain unclear, the missile’s 1,700 km range positions it as a significant threat, particularly to military and infrastructure targets in neighboring countries. This development underscores Iran's continuing efforts to strengthen its military deterrence capabilities despite international sanctions and regional opposition. As the Etamad joins other advanced Iranian missile systems, such as the Fattah hypersonic missile and the Khoramshahr-2, Iran’s missile program continues to evolve, making it a key factor in the regional balance of power.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/iran-unveils-new-etamad-1700-km-ballistic-missile-strengthening-threats-at-international-level	2025-02-04T03:05:48-08:00

These vehicles are also expected to provide a counter-battery capability, allowing the Australian Army to strike, neutralize, and destroy enemy artillery systems before they can be used against Australian forces or their allies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/australia-officially-receives-its-first-as9-huntsman-vehicles-from-south-korea	2025-02-04T02:08:58-08:00	
India Expands its Sea-Based Nuclear Deterrence with Commissioning of INS Aridhaman Submarine	India continues to enhance its strategic deterrence capability with the integration of its third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), INS Aridhaman (S4), which is expected to enter service this year after nearly three years of trials. Currently, the Indian Navy operates two SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighat, and this new addition will mark a significant step in the expansion of its strategic submarine fleet. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link INS Arihant, India’s first indigenously built SSBN, was commissioned in August 2016. (Picture source: Indian MoD) INS Arihant, India’s first indigenously built SSBN, was commissioned in August 2016. With a displacement of 6,000 tons, it is powered by an 83 MW pressurized water reactor using enriched uranium. Its induction was a critical milestone, enabling India to establish a credible sea-based nuclear deterrent. Its successor, INS Arighat, was commissioned in August 2024. While retaining the core design of INS Arihant, it incorporates several technological improvements, including enhanced sonar, navigation, stealth capabilities, and fire control systems, making it a more capable platform. INS Aridhaman (S4), the third SSBN in the series, is in its final testing phase and is expected to join the fleet soon. Based on the design of INS Arihant and INS Arighat, it retains the 83 MW reactor but includes multiple technical upgrades derived from operational feedback. According to experts, it features advanced maintenance and safety enhancements to improve reliability and crew efficiency. India's maritime deterrence strategy is driven by the need to counter potential threats in the Indian Ocean. Given the vulnerability of aircraft carriers to long-range ballistic missiles such as China’s Dong Feng-21 and Dong Feng-26, the Indian government has prioritized the development of nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines over acquiring a third aircraft carrier. In this context, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) recently approved the construction of two nuclear-powered attack submarines to reinforce India’s presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy continues its conventional submarine program with the upcoming commissioning of the sixth Kalvari-class submarine, INS Vagsheer, scheduled for December 2024. Additionally, the construction of three new diesel-attack submarines will commence in collaboration with the French Naval Group to further enhance India’s conventional underwater capabilities. With an increasing presence of Chinese warships in the Indian Ocean—averaging around ten PLA Navy vessels per month—and the anticipated deployment of long-range carrier-based patrols by 2025-26, India is accelerating its naval modernization efforts to safeguard its strategic interests. The integration of new SSBNs and attack submarines underscores New Delhi’s commitment to maintaining a credible deterrence posture and ensuring maritime security in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/india-expands-its-sea-based-nuclear-deterrence-with-commissioning-of-ins-aridhaman-submarine	2025-02-04T01:57:27-08:00	
Flash News: US Trump administration proposes $1 billion arms sale to Israel including bombs and bulldozers	According to information published by American Newspaper 'The Wall Street Journal', on February 3, 2024, the Trump administration has informally notified U.S. Congress of a proposed new arms sale to Israel valued at approximately $1 billion. The sale includes a variety of munitions and heavy equipment, specifically: 4,500 BLU-110 precision-guided bombs, 200 Mk 83 1,000-pound bombs, and Caterpillar D9 bulldozers, with the munitions valued at $700 million and the bulldozers at $300 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Aviation Ordnanceman 2nd Class Marilyn Marquez conducts an inventory of pallets containing MK 83/BLU-110 general-purpose bombs in the hangar bay of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) during an ammunition cross-deck operation with the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71). (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The BLU-110 bomb is a 225 kg (500-pound), precision-guided munition designed to penetrate hardened targets, making it highly effective against structures such as bunkers, command centers, and other fortified military assets. The BLU-110 is part of a broader family of bombs developed for precision strike capabilities, meaning that it can be launched from various aircraft and guided to its target with remarkable accuracy. This bomb uses GPS and inertial guidance systems, ensuring that even in contested environments with jamming or countermeasures, it can still strike its intended target with minimal deviation. The ability to target specific, high-value assets without causing widespread collateral damage is particularly crucial in modern military operations where minimizing civilian casualties is a priority. The Mk 83 bomb, on the other hand, is a much larger, 450 kg (1,000-pound) general-purpose bomb used by the U.S. and Israeli Air Forces for a wider range of tactical missions. Although it is less specialized than the BLU-110, the Mk 83 is designed to be a versatile weapon that can be used against larger or less fortified targets, such as military airfields, supply depots, and vehicle convoys. It is a free-fall bomb that can be equipped with precision-guided fuzes, allowing for accuracy when dropped from high altitudes or at stand-off distances. This bomb’s larger size and payload make it effective for clearing large areas or neutralizing more substantial enemy infrastructure. Both the BLU-110 and Mk 83 bombs are integral to Israel's airstrike capabilities, enhancing its ability to conduct operations against a range of targets with great precision. The BLU-110s, with their smaller size and advanced guidance systems, are particularly useful for surgical strikes in urban environments or against hardened military targets. In contrast, the Mk 83s, with their larger payload, are better suited for larger-scale attacks, such as demolishing military facilities, aircraft hangars, or supply lines. Together, these two types of bombs will greatly expand the Israeli Air Force's operational flexibility, allowing it to respond effectively to a variety of combat scenarios, from targeted strikes against militant leaders to large-scale raids on enemy infrastructure. The Caterpillar D9 bulldozers included in the sale are heavy-duty vehicles that have been adapted for military use by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for a range of engineering tasks. These bulldozers are often used in combat zones to clear obstacles, demolish enemy fortifications, and even construct defensive positions. The D9 has become an iconic piece of military equipment for Israel, particularly in urban warfare or areas with significant defensive structures, such as tunnels used by militant groups in Gaza. These machines are heavily armored to withstand small-arms fire and explosive blasts, allowing them to perform under direct fire without being easily neutralized. They play a critical role in ensuring that Israeli forces can maneuver freely, clear pathways, and neutralize enemy positions in both urban and rural settings. This proposed arms sale is part of broader strategic objectives shared by both nations, particularly in the context of growing regional tensions. Israel faces an increasingly volatile security environment, particularly due to Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East. The U.S. sees Israel as a key partner in countering Iran's destabilizing activities, which include supporting various militant groups across the region. The weapons offered in this sale will provide Israel with additional resources to bolster its defense and maintain its military superiority, which is critical in an area where Israel faces threats from multiple fronts. In addition to countering the influence of Iran, Israel's reliance on precision strikes has made weapons like the BLU-110 and Mk 83 bombs essential in its counterterrorism and defense efforts. These weapons are particularly effective in minimizing collateral damage while targeting military infrastructure, weapons caches, and underground bunkers. As Israel continues its efforts to address asymmetrical threats posed by hostile groups, the ability to strike with accuracy is crucial for its defense strategy. The inclusion of Caterpillar D9 bulldozers in this sale also emphasizes Israel’s need for heavy equipment in modern warfare. These bulldozers are often used in clearing obstacles, constructing defensive barriers, and demolishing enemy fortifications, making them indispensable in urban warfare and operations in areas with entrenched military positions. The D9 bulldozer has been used by the IDF in past operations, particularly in Gaza, where it played a significant role in clearing tunnels used by militants and other combat engineering tasks. While the arms sale has been notified to Congress, it has not yet been finalized. Congress has a 30-day period in which it can raise objections to the sale. However, given the long-standing and strategic relationship between the U.S. and Israel, such objections are unlikely to delay the sale significantly. Past arms sales between the two nations have generally faced little resistance, although some members of Congress may raise concerns about the humanitarian implications of providing advanced weaponry, particularly in the context of ongoing conflicts in the region. The proposed $1 billion arms sale is a clear indication of the U.S.'s continued support for Israel and its efforts to maintain its qualitative military edge in a volatile region. As tensions persist in the Middle East, particularly with the threat posed by Iran and various militant groups, this sale provides Israel with the necessary tools to defend itself and secure its strategic interests. The U.S. and Israel’s military cooperation remains a cornerstone of their partnership, ensuring that Israel remains equipped to address the ever-evolving security challenges it faces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-trump-administration-proposes-1-billion-arms-sale-to-israel-including-bombs-and-bulldozers	2025-02-04T01:50:21-08:00	
Belgium could end a decade without tanks by entering into the European MGCS program	The Arizona agreement, finalized on February 2, 2025, outlines Belgium’s revised defense policy under the newly elected government led by Prime Minister Bart De Wever. While minor modifications may be made, the agreement discusses Belgium's potential participation in the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a Franco-German initiative to develop a next-generation main battle tank (MBT) system. This decision aligns with Belgium's broader defense modernization efforts, which involve increased military spending and engagement in European military projects. It also indicates Belgium's renewed interest in acquiring tanks following the retirement of its last Leopard 1s in 2014.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belgium's potential participation in the MGCS program would require investments in personnel, maintenance infrastructure, and training, as the country retired its last Leopard 1 main battle tanks in 2014. (Picture source: Rheinmetall) In the early post-World War II period, the Belgian Army operated various tanks, beginning with American M4 Sherman models post-World War II, including the M4A1(76)W HVSS, alongside British models. In the early 1950s, Belgium acquired M46 Patton tanks from the United States, which remained in service until the late 1960s. Between 1968 and 1971, Belgium procured 334 Leopard 1 tanks from Germany, distributing them among eight tank regiments and the Armour School. In the 1980s, 132 units were modernized to the Leopard 1A5(BE) standard, incorporating an improved fire control system and thermal imaging. The end of the Cold War led to reductions in the tank fleet, with 128 Leopard 1s sold to Brazil and the remainder retired in 2014. At that time, Belgium focused on mobility, flexibility, and rapid deployability for its armed forces, reducing costs. Consequently, Belgium acquired 242 Piranha IIIC 8×8 vehicles between 2008 and 2015, including 18 Piranha IIC DF90 fire support vehicles armed with a 90mm gun. However, the DF90’s inability to fire planned anti-tank rounds limited its role to infantry support with high-explosive ammunition. Additionally, 32 Piranha IIC DF30 vehicles were scheduled for retrofit with two Spike-MR anti-tank guided missiles each. As a result, by 2023, the Belgian Army lacked main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and air defense systems, operating a fleet primarily composed of wheeled vehicles, including 38 Pandur II reconnaissance vehicles. The withdrawal of heavy armor reduced Belgium’s armored capabilities significantly. During the Cold War, Belgium operated various types of armored vehicles, including German Jagdpanzer Kanone tank destroyers, American M113 and M75 armored personnel carriers, French AMX-13 VTT variants, and British Scorpion and Scimitar CVRTs. Belgium's forces in Germany were scaled down over time, with three brigades under British control in 1946 growing to a force of 150,000 personnel by 1952. By 1970, the Belgian presence was reduced to a single corps with two divisions, and by the end of the Cold War in 1990, it had declined to under 25,000 personnel. In recent years, Belgium has sought to rebuild its army, identifying the absence of heavy armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and air defense systems as capability gaps. The country joined the French Scorpion program in 2017, ordering 60 EBRC Jaguar reconnaissance vehicles and 382 VBMR Griffon armored personnel carriers. Belgium also ordered 19 CAESAR II self-propelled howitzers, with delivery expected between 2026 and 2030. Developed by a consortium comprising France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, the MGCS will not be a single tank but a 'system of systems' integrating crewed and uncrewed vehicles. (Picture source: Hensoldt) From an industrial standpoint, Belgium's potential entry into MGCS coincides with its defense firms’ expanding role in European defense projects. John Cockerill Defense is in the process of acquiring France’s Arquus to strengthen its position in the medium-armored vehicle sector. Meanwhile, FN Herstal has agreements for ammunition production, including a trilateral initiative with France and the Netherlands. Both companies are also involved in the MARTE program, a European research initiative for future MBT technologies. MARTE, which includes 47 European partners, is expected to support the MGCS by advancing armor protection, automated targeting, and firepower capabilities. The MGCS project, launched in 2017, is designed to replace the German Leopard 2 and French Leclerc tanks with a more advanced combat system by 2040. Developed by KNDS, a consortium comprising France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, the MGCS will not be a single tank but a 'system of systems' integrating crewed and uncrewed vehicles. Its development focuses on modularity, better firepower, enhanced protection, and AI-driven battlefield management. However, France and Germany have disagreed on key technical aspects, such as gun caliber, with France advocating for a 140mm system and Germany supporting a 130mm alternative. Industrial competition has contributed to delays, but both governments remain committed to advancing the program as a critical component of European armored forces. As MGCS progresses, discussions about potential new partners, including Italy and Spain, have emerged. While France and Germany remain the primary stakeholders, expanding participation could introduce additional expertise and funding. However, integrating new members requires industrial and political negotiations, as France and Germany have historically maintained control over their defense projects. Therefore, Belgium's potential participation in the MGCS program would require investments in personnel, maintenance infrastructure, and training, alongside negotiations on technology transfer and industrial benefits. For the Belgian Army, joining the MGCS could indicate a long-term commitment to restoring armored capabilities and strengthening its role in European defense. The new Belgian government has also committed to investments in long-range firepower, including multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), which could align with MGCS participation. Options under consideration include the French FLP-T program, the American M142 HIMARS, and the Euro-PULS system from Elbit Systems and KNDS Deutschland. The focus on long-range strike capabilities is part of Belgium’s broader effort to enhance indirect fire and deep-strike capabilities. Alongside the MGCS, Belgium is engaged as an observer in the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) and is considering involvement in the Next Generation Rotary Capacity initiative to develop a replacement for the medium multi-role helicopters currently in service with European armies, such as the AW-101.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/belgium-could-end-a-decade-without-tanks-by-entering-into-the-european-mgcs-program	2025-02-04T01:40:28-08:00	
Saudi Arabia Increases its Military Budget and Reinforces its Leadership in Middle East	Saudi Arabia has announced an increase in its defense budget for 2025, raising military expenditures to $78 billion from $75.8 billion in 2024. This allocation accounts for 21% of the country's public spending and 7.1% of its gross domestic product, according to Ahmad Al-Ohali, Governor of the General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI). The increase follows a consistent growth trend, with an annual average rise of 4.5% since 1960. Saudi Arabia is now among the five largest military budgets globally and remains the leading defense spender in the Arab world.

A key objective of this initiative is to localize 50% of defense expenditures by 2030. Ahmad Al-Ohali expressed confidence in achieving this target, stating in February 2024 that the country could even exceed this threshold before the decade’s end. Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has undertaken several defense acquisitions and industrial initiatives aimed at modernizing its armed forces and strengthening its military industry. In February 2024, the country ordered the South Korean Cheongung II air defense system for $3.2 billion. This medium-range missile system complements existing capabilities such as the Patriot and THAAD systems, enhancing national air defense. In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense approved the sale of 220 AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder tactical missiles to Saudi Arabia, valued at $252 million. The agreement includes technical support and training programs to enhance the capabilities of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Additionally, in December 2024, the Spanish shipbuilder Navantia signed a contract with the Saudi Ministry of Defense to build three AVANTE 2200 corvettes for the Royal Saudi Navy. The final vessel is scheduled for delivery by 2028.

The contract also included four ground stations, a configurable simulation system, a digital tracking infrastructure, and a drone operations center at Moroccan airbases. Moroccan military personnel underwent training in Turkey to operate these drones, with the first group completing their program in September 2021. Since then, Morocco has shown increased interest in Turkish defense equipment, exploring the possibility of acquiring Bayraktar Akıncı drones, a more advanced platform with a greater payload capacity and enhanced mission capabilities. Baykar’s establishment in Morocco is part of a broader trend of military cooperation between the two nations. Turkey has emerged as a key player in the armed drone sector, attracting multiple international clients. Morocco, on its side, is seeking to strengthen its defense autonomy and modernize its armed forces. The maintenance facility for Bayraktar TB2 drones, and potentially Akıncı drones in the future, would enable Morocco to optimize its fleet’s operational readiness. Despite uncertainties regarding the extent of local production, Baykar’s investment aligns with its strategy of expanding into emerging markets. The company has already begun constructing a factory in Ukraine, which is expected to produce up to 120 drones annually, and has also set up an assembly line in Saudi Arabia. While the Moroccan facility is comparatively smaller, it underscores Baykar’s intention to establish a lasting presence in Africa. As part of its efforts to develop a domestic defense industry, Morocco has also partnered with Israeli firm BlueBird Aero Systems to build a drone factory. However, this project, initiated in April 2024, has faced delays due to ongoing conflicts in Gaza. The collaboration between Morocco, Turkey, and Israel in defense and technology reflects a broader objective of modernizing Morocco’s armed forces and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Although Baykar’s new Moroccan subsidiary is not a full-scale production facility, it represents a step toward strengthening strategic ties between Rabat and Ankara while enhancing Turkey’s industrial presence in Africa.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/baykar-sets-up-strategic-drone-maintenance-hub-in-morocco-expanding-african-reach	2025-02-03T07:22:09-08:00

Lockheed Martin Strengthens US-UK Nuclear Deterrence Until 2084 with Trident II D5LE2	Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $383 million contract by the U.S. Navy to develop a modernized version of the Trident II nuclear ballistic missile, designated Trident II D5 Life Extension 2 (D5LE2). This program aims to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the strategic deterrence system deployed aboard ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) through 2084. The missile remains a key component of the deterrence posture of both the United States and the United Kingdom, which cooperate in this field under the Polaris Sales Agreement. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The D5LE2 modernization seeks to extend its operational lifespan while maintaining performance in response to evolving threats (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The Trident II D5 is currently in service on U.S. Ohio-class and British Vanguard-class submarines. Designed and developed by Lockheed Martin, this submarine-launched ballistic missile has a range exceeding 12,000 km and is capable of carrying multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Until now, Trident II missiles have been equipped with W76 and W88 nuclear warheads, but their service life, exceeding 25 years, has raised concerns regarding reliability and safety. The D5LE2 modernization seeks to extend their operational lifespan while maintaining performance in response to evolving threats. The upgrade includes improvements to the missile’s guidance and propulsion systems. With its three-stage solid-fuel propulsion, the Trident II D5 achieves rapid acceleration and a trajectory designed to evade interception. Its inertial guidance system, enhanced with electronic upgrades, contributes to increased accuracy. The Trident II has also been considered for conventional applications under the Prompt Global Strike program, which aimed to provide the United States with a rapid, non-nuclear strike capability. This initiative sought to equip certain Trident missiles with modified reentry vehicles featuring GPS navigation and trajectory correction systems, enabling an impact precision of approximately ten meters. However, the proposal generated significant international debate, with concerns that such a launch could be mistaken for a nuclear attack, potentially triggering an unintended response. The program was ultimately discontinued, but in 2018, the U.S. administration approved the production of the W76-2, a low-yield warhead specifically designed for Trident missiles. Its deployment was officially confirmed in 2020, with initial operational integration aboard USS Tennessee. To support the production and integration of D5LE2 components, Lockheed Martin has initiated the construction of a new production facility in Titusville, Florida. Covering approximately 21,000 square meters, the site will expand the company's presence on the Space Coast, a key aerospace industry hub. Scheduled to be operational by 2027, the facility is expected to create approximately 300 high-skilled jobs. Florida state authorities, represented by Secretary of Commerce J. Alex Kelly, have emphasized the economic significance of this investment in strengthening the region’s defense and aerospace industries. This contract is part of a broader effort to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded Lockheed Martin Space a $2.1 billion contract for the production and sustainment of Trident II D5 missiles, as well as the development of new W93 nuclear warheads and their Mk7 reentry vehicles. These warheads, currently under development at Los Alamos National Laboratory, mark the first new U.S. nuclear weapons production initiative in 40 years. These programs reflect the ongoing commitment of the United States and the United Kingdom to maintaining technological and strategic capabilities in nuclear deterrence. Lockheed Martin, which this year marks 70 years of collaboration with the U.S. Navy under the Fleet Ballistic Missiles program, continues to play a central role in the evolution of strategic missile systems. With the Trident II D5LE2, both nations are ensuring the continued credibility and effectiveness of their deterrence posture in the decades ahead.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/lockheed-martin-strengthens-us-uk-nuclear-deterrence-until-2084-with-trident-ii-d5le2	2025-02-03T06:06:06-08:00

Malaysia awaits final US approval to complete the purchase of 30 F/A-18 Hornet fighters from Kuwait	As reported by Astro Awani on February 1, 2025, the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) is expected to finalize the acquisition of 30 used F/A-18C/D Hornet fighter jets from the Kuwaiti Air Force (KAF) in 2025. The deal has been under negotiation for several years and is now in its final stages, requiring only documentation and approvals from Kuwait and the United States. This purchase is intended to maintain Malaysia’s air defense capabilities while awaiting the implementation of its Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) program, projected to commence in the 15th Malaysia Plan around 2040.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F/A-18C is a single-seat variant, while the F/A-18D is a two-seat version configurable for training or as an all-weather strike aircraft with a Weapons and Sensors Officer operating targeting systems. (Picture source: US DoD) Malaysia’s interest in acquiring the Kuwaiti Hornets dates back to at least 2017, when the country first explored options to supplement its fighter fleet. The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) currently operates eight two-seat F/A-18D Hornets, acquired in 1997, under the 18th Squadron at Butterworth Air Base. Over the years, these aircraft have undergone upgrades to avionics, communications, and weapons systems, including the integration of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and the Link 16 datalink. The MRCA program, originally intended to modernize Malaysia’s air combat capabilities, has faced delays, making the interim acquisition of the Kuwaiti Hornets a temporary solution. Kuwait operates 39 F/A-18C/D Hornets, delivered between 1992 and 1993, as part of its air force modernization following the Gulf War. The country is transitioning to newer aircraft, including the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter Typhoon, leading to the decision to sell its older Hornet fleet. Malaysia officially expressed interest in these aircraft during a visit by Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin to Kuwait in October 2024. During the visit, Khaled inspected the aircraft and held discussions with Kuwaiti officials, resulting in the establishment of a joint committee to expedite the negotiation process. The sale remains contingent on approval from the United States, as the aircraft are American-made. One of the primary reasons for Malaysia’s acquisition is the need to address capability gaps in its air force while awaiting the MRCA program. The RMAF has faced maintenance and operational challenges, particularly with its Sukhoi Su-30MKM fleet, which has been affected by serviceability issues due to logistical constraints. Expanding the Hornet fleet is seen as a way to sustain operational capability without further delays. The relatively low flight hours and well-maintained condition of the Kuwaiti Hornets make them a viable option for extending Malaysia’s fighter fleet while offering an opportunity to standardize maintenance and operations. The acquisition has encountered challenges, including the requirement for approval from the United States, which has also considered the Kuwaiti Hornets for its Marine Corps. Tunisia has reportedly expressed interest in purchasing the same aircraft, creating potential competition. The process of securing U.S. authorization has caused delays, though Malaysian officials anticipate a resolution. Another challenge is the logistical and maintenance burden associated with operating an aging fleet. While Malaysia’s existing Hornets have been upgraded, the Kuwaiti models belong to an earlier production block, which may lead to compatibility issues with spare parts and software integration. Expanding the fleet with older aircraft may also impact operational budgets and maintenance capacity. The F/A-18C and F/A-18D Hornet are twin-engine, carrier-capable multirole fighter aircraft developed in 1987 as part of a block upgrade of the original F/A-18 Hornet, which was initially designed in the 1970s. The upgrade incorporated enhanced radar, avionics, and expanded weapons compatibility, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM, AGM-84E SLAM, and AGM-65F Maverick missiles. The F/A-18C is a single-seat variant, while the F/A-18D is a two-seat version configurable for training or as an all-weather strike aircraft with a Weapons and Sensors Officer operating targeting systems. The aircraft includes the Martin-Baker NACES ejection seat, a self-protection jammer, and a synthetic aperture radar for ground mapping in low-visibility conditions. Models delivered since 1989 feature improved night attack capabilities with the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, AN/AAS-38A NITE Hawk FLIR targeting pod, night vision compatibility, and upgraded multi-function displays. Some F/A-18D aircraft are configured for reconnaissance with the ATARS electro-optical sensor package. The aircraft are powered by two F404-GE-402 enhanced performance engines, increasing static thrust by 10%. Since 1993, they have included a laser designator/ranger for self-marking and targeting. Production ended in 2000, with the last F/A-18C delivered to Finland and the final F/A-18D to the U.S. Marine Corps. The U.S. Navy retired its F/A-18C/D fleet in 2019, but the U.S. Marine Corps continues to operate and upgrade its aircraft, integrating the APG-79(V)4 AESA radar system.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/malaysia-awaits-final-us-approval-to-complete-the-purchase-of-30-f-a-18-hornet-fighters-from-kuwait	2025-02-03T03:51:55-08:00	
France Turns to Its Automotive Industry for Military Drone Production	Amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising tensions in Europe, France is seeking to adapt its defense industry to meet new battlefield requirements. Traditionally characterized by slow production cycles focused on high-performance equipment, the sector now faces the challenge of increasing both speed and volume. To address this, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) is exploring new solutions by turning to the civilian industry, particularly the automotive sector, for the manufacturing of so-called 'kamikaze' drones similar to those used in Ukraine, according to a report by L'Opinion on February 2, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Colibri is a loitering munition drone specially adapted for short-range missions (Picture source: Army Recognition) These long-range remotely operated munitions (MTO), capable of striking targets over 100 kilometers away, could be produced by a yet undisclosed French industrial company. No firm orders have been placed at this stage, but the stated objective is clear: to deliver several thousand of these drones within a few months. This initiative marks a shift in France’s defense production model, which for decades has prioritized high-tech equipment, designed through lengthy and meticulous processes, rather than rapid large-scale manufacturing. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the limitations of this approach, exposing the difficulties of adapting to the demands of high-intensity conflict. 'This was not a criterion for us for decades,' acknowledges Emmanuel Chiva, the General Delegate for Armaments, emphasizing the need for a structural change. In response, the DGA is expanding its scope and looking to leverage expertise from other industries such as chemicals, energy, and even the agri-food sector, all accustomed to high-volume production. This shift is not entirely new. During World War I, Michelin produced aircraft while Renault manufactured tanks. Today, despite a relative state of peace, France faces growing strategic challenges, yet its defense industry still operates under a model favoring technological excellence over production speed and scale. The Rafale fighter jet, submarines, and the nuclear deterrent exemplify this approach, where emphasis has historically been placed on high performance, often at the cost of extended production timelines and significant expenses. However, modern conflicts require greater responsiveness, and this model is struggling to meet those needs. In June 2022, President Emmanuel Macron called for a transition to a 'war economy', a shift that has yet to be fully realized. Some notable progress has been made. Nexter, for example, has increased its production of 155mm shells sixtyfold since 2022, while Dassault Aviation is gradually reaching a production rate of three Rafale jets per month, compared to just one a decade ago. MBDA, meanwhile, is reducing the production time of the Aster air defense missile from 42 to 18 months by 2026. Despite these improvements, these lead times remain lengthy in the context of high-intensity warfare, where the rapid replenishment of equipment is crucial. Aware of this challenge, Emmanuel Chiva has suggested new approaches, including the development of *'low-cost'* surface-to-air missile designs to accelerate their production. This initiative aims to foster innovation among defense manufacturers and the 4,500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that form the backbone of the defense sector. The goal is to move away from a purely stock-based approach, where equipment ordered in batches reaches obsolescence simultaneously, toward a continuous supply system better suited to operational needs. The integration of the automotive industry into drone production aligns with this broader effort to adapt to evolving strategic conditions. By leveraging the civilian sector’s expertise in rapid and large-scale manufacturing, the DGA aims to meet the growing demand for military equipment. If this initiative is successfully implemented, it could lead to a significant transformation in how France designs and produces its defense systems. However, this transition toward a more agile and responsive defense industry raises several critical questions: the adaptation of industrial standards, the maintenance of quality requirements, and the state’s ability to swiftly scale up production in a crisis. In an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape, the success of this transformation will be a key test of France’s strategic resilience.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/france-turns-to-its-automotive-industry-for-military-drone-production	2025-02-03T03:19:48-08:00

Equipped with a 360-degree radar system, the Zoubin boasts a detection range of up to 30 kilometers, with an engagement range of 20 kilometers. The radar is capable of tracking up to 100 targets simultaneously, while the system can engage as many as 8 targets at once. This makes the Zoubin a formidable force against aerial threats, even in highly congested airspace. One of the standout features of the Zoubin system is its use of a missile with an infrared seeker. Unlike traditional missile systems, which rely on radar for target acquisition, the infrared seeker allows for a lighter, more compact design, making the system ideal for deployment on mobile platforms such as fast trucks. This design choice reflects the growing trend in modern defense systems to reduce reliance on bulky radar setups while improving precision and mobility. The Zoubin's radar is equipped with an active phased array system, which improves its ability to detect and track multiple targets in real-time. The radar is reportedly capable of engaging cruise missiles, drones, and other low-altitude targets with high precision. According to Iranian officials, the system's engagement range is currently around 15 kilometers, with plans to extend this range to approximately 25 kilometers in the near future. The Zoubin system is said to be derived from some of the most advanced air defense technologies available globally, placing it on par with other modern systems in terms of performance and operational capacity. The integration of such a highly sophisticated radar and missile system into a mobile platform gives the Zoubin a strategic advantage, particularly in dynamic, fast-moving combat scenarios where mobility and adaptability are key. One of the key advantages of the Zoubin missile defense system is its ability to integrate with Iran’s broader defense network. The system can be linked with other Iranian air defense platforms, such as the Majid, Mersad, Khordad 15, and 9 Dey missile systems, creating a layered defense network that offers a higher level of protection against aerial threats. This integration ensures that the Zoubin can operate seamlessly within the larger air defense structure of Iran, enhancing coordination and effectiveness in responding to enemy threats. Additionally, the system's modular design and ability to operate in coordination with other platforms make it highly adaptable to different operational environments. Its mobility and integration capabilities make it a versatile asset for both national defense and regional security operations, allowing Iranian forces to respond rapidly to any emerging threats. The Zoubin missile defense system is positioned as a tactical asset that can be rapidly deployed in various operational scenarios. Its high mobility, combined with its 360-degree defense capability and advanced radar system, provides it with the ability to protect strategic sites and military assets from aerial attacks. Given the current geopolitical tensions in the region, particularly between Iran and Israel, the development of such advanced air defense systems is seen as a critical step in securing Iran’s airspace and maritime interests. Iranian defense officials have also hinted that the system’s capabilities will continue to improve, with upgrades planned to increase its range and target engagement capacity. As part of its ongoing efforts to bolster its defense capabilities, Iran will likely continue to refine the Zoubin system in the coming years, integrating newer technologies and expanding its range of potential applications. The Zoubin missile defense system represents a significant leap forward for Iran’s air defense capabilities. With its advanced radar, infrared missile seeker, and highly mobile design, it is well-suited to intercept a wide array of aerial threats, particularly in regions where rapid response and flexibility are crucial. As tensions continue to rise in the Middle East, systems like the Zoubin will play an increasingly important role in safeguarding Iran’s strategic assets, while also enhancing the country’s ability to defend against potential foreign attacks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/iran-advances-in-air-defense-technology-with-zoubin-missile-system-amid-tensions-with-israel	2025-02-03T03:17:02-08:00	
Philippines Plans Acquisition of Fast Attack Interdiction Craft with Missiles to Strengthen Maritime Defense	The Philippine Navy is advancing with its project to acquire Fast Attack Interdiction Crafts with Missiles (FAIC-M) as part of Phase 2 of the Re-Horizon 3 modernization program under the Revised Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program (RAFPMP). The project outlines the acquisition of 10 new fast attack interdiction crafts equipped with missile systems to enhance the country’s defense and security capabilities in its littoral zones, particularly in the sensitive tri-border areas with Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as in the South China Sea, including the Kalayaan Island Group. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Philippine Navy is advancing with its project to acquire Fast Attack Interdiction Crafts with Missiles. (Picture source: Philippines Navy) This initiative follows the Philippine Navy’s ongoing efforts to modernize its fleet, which includes the retirement of the Tomas Batilo-class fast attack crafts, a South Korean version of the Chamsuri-class, which have been out of active service since 2021. The acquisition of these new boats, designed to strengthen the Navy’s effectiveness in rapid interdiction and defense operations, aligns with the broader goals of the modernization program. The new FAIC-M boats are expected to be equipped with advanced systems, including the Rafael Typhoon Mk.30C remote-controlled weapon station armed with a 30mm Mk.44 Bushmaster II autocannon, and the Typhoon MLS-NLOS missile launcher, capable of launching short-range surface-to-surface Spike-NLOS missiles. The acquisition plan, signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2024, allocates a total budget of 16 billion pesos for the procurement of the 10 new boats, an increase from the 10 billion pesos allocated in 2020 for the initial acquisition of nine boats. This budget increase accounts for inflation, as well as the cost of local construction of the boats at the Philippine Navy’s Naval Shipyard in Cavite, in addition to the increased number of missile systems and spare parts required. Phase 2 of the project is also expected to include the acquisition of weapons, ammunition, and potentially system integration, with separate contracts likely to be signed for the boats, weapons systems, and ammunition. Despite the approval of the funding plan, the project was not included in the programmed funding for 2025 under the AFP Modernization Program due to budget cuts. However, there is potential for financing through the Unprogrammed Fund, contingent on additional financial support from the national government. Alternatively, the Philippine Navy may use its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) funding for FY2025, which requires only an initial 10% commitment to initiate the project. Given that the Philippine Navy already operates Shaldag Mk. V fast attack crafts, locally known as the Acero-class fast attack interdiction craft, it is expected that the additional units will follow the same design and be equipped with the same advanced weapon systems.

Rafael is the prime contractor, while IAI supplies radar and integration components. The system is designed for short- and medium-range interception and has been exhibited at defense industry events. It is mounted on different truck platforms for mobile air defense. The Spyder has four main variants: Spyder-SR (Short Range), Spyder-ER (Extended Range), Spyder-MR (Medium Range), and Spyder-LR (Long Range). The SR and ER models use an inclined, rotatable launcher, while the MR and LR versions use a vertical launcher. The system’s interception range varies, with Spyder-SR reaching up to 15 km and Spyder-LR extending to 80 km. It uses Python-5 infrared-homing missiles and Derby active radar-guided missiles. The Spyder-MR and Spyder-LR variants integrate the EL/M-2084 Multi-Mission Radar, which can track multiple targets. In 2023, Rafael announced that the Derby LR missile had been upgraded to engage tactical ballistic missiles. The system is designed for all-weather operations and can be integrated into a networked air defense structure. The Spyder is in service with multiple countries, including India, Singapore, Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, the Philippines, and the Czech Republic. India acquired 18 Spyder-MR systems with Python-5 and Derby missiles. The Czech Republic signed a $627 million contract for four Spyder batteries to replace Soviet-era 2K12 Kub systems, with deliveries expected by 2026. Ethiopia reportedly deployed Spyder-MR for infrastructure protection, including at the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Reports indicate Georgia may have operated the Spyder-SR during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, though there is no official confirmation. Romania is also evaluating the Spyder system alongside other options for a potential procurement.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/philippine-marine-corps-could-purchase-israeli-spyder-air-defense-missile-system-to-protect-key-military-installations	2025-02-03T02:43:38-08:00

US Navy Transforms Naval Protection with Helios Laser's Power on USS Preble at Sea	In its 2024 report, the U.S. Office of the Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation released an image of the USS Preble (DDG-88) deploying its HELIOS laser weapon system at sea. This image, one of the clearest in recent years, highlights the growing importance of this technology in Washington’s strategic vision. The HELIOS system (High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance) marks a significant transition from theoretically directed energy weapons to their concrete and operational application on the battlefield. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link he U.S. Navy’s Center for Countermeasures (CCM) supervised demonstrations in which the system successfully engaged unmanned aerial targets, validating its functional and operational performance (Picture source: US Navy) Developed by Lockheed Martin, HELIOS reflects the U.S. Navy’s commitment to integrating directed energy weapons into its fleet to enhance defense capabilities against modern threats. This system combines a high-energy laser, an optical dazzler, and an advanced surveillance capability, providing a layered defense approach that allows targets to be physically neutralized and their sensors disrupted. The Navy aims to counter threats such as drones, fast attack craft, and potentially short-range missiles. The HELIOS program was initiated in 2018 with an initial $150 million contract awarded to Lockheed Martin for development, manufacturing, and delivery of two systems—one for land-based testing and another for naval integration. After successfully passing its Critical Design Review in 2020, sea trials began in 2021 at Wallops Island, Virginia. The USS Preble was the first Arleigh Burke-class destroyer to be equipped with the system, marking a key milestone in the adoption of directed energy weapons within the U.S. Navy. HELIOS operates at an initial power of 60 kilowatts, with the potential to scale up to 120 kilowatts depending on operational needs. Unlike conventional ammunition-based systems, this laser weapon provides a key operational advantage: virtually unlimited firing capacity as long as power is available. This reduces logistical constraints related to ammunition resupply and extends the ship’s operational endurance, particularly in scenarios where resupply options may be limited. Beyond its destructive capability, the system includes an optical dazzler designed to temporarily blind or disable enemy surveillance sensors, adding a strategic advantage in reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance operations. Its integration with the Aegis combat system allows for seamless coordination with other defensive measures, enhancing overall combat effectiveness. HELIOS has undergone rigorous testing. The U.S. Navy’s Center for Countermeasures (CCM) supervised demonstrations in which the system successfully engaged unmanned aerial targets, validating its functional and operational performance. In FY24, CCM conducted 32 test events to evaluate airborne countermeasures, counter-unmanned aircraft systems, and the development and assessment of directed energy weapons as potential countermeasures. Additionally, CCM partnered with allied forces to advance the development and testing of infrared and radio frequency countermeasures. The integration of HELIOS aboard the USS Preble is only the first step. The U.S. Navy plans to expand the use of directed energy weapons to other vessels, including more powerful systems such as the 150-kilowatt Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD), already deployed on select ships. This expansion aligns with a broader military strategy aimed at developing cost-effective defense solutions tailored to evolving asymmetric threats. The HELIOS system is designed to protect naval assets from various threats, including drones, fast attack craft, and cruise missiles. It combines a high-energy laser capable of physically destroying targets with an optical dazzler to disrupt or disable enemy sensors. Additionally, it provides advanced surveillance and intelligence capabilities, enhancing situational awareness for operators. Among its competitors, the Israeli-developed 'Iron Beam' system is designed to intercept drones, rockets, and mortar shells at a lower cost per engagement. Similarly, South Korea recently introduced the 'Block-I' system, a 100-kilowatt laser weapon designed to counter drones and other aerial threats. Other nations, including China, Russia, and Germany, are also investing in this technology, highlighting the growing global competition in directed energy-based defense systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navy-transforms-naval-protection-with-helios-lasers-power-on-uss-preble-at-sea	2025-02-03T01:39:00-08:00	
Exclusive | Belgium could purchase rocket launcher systems to modernize its artillery capabilities	The Arizona agreement, finalized on February 2, 2025, marks a shift in Belgium’s defense policy under the new government led by Prime Minister Bart De Wever. Presented to the King late on Friday evening, the agreement outlines a plan to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2029 and 2.5% by 2034. This financial trajectory aims to expand Belgium’s military capabilities, modernize its forces, and align its commitments with NATO and EU security objectives. While the finalized document remains subject to minor modifications, it establishes a framework for national defense readiness, including the country's potential first MLRS purchase.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Belgian Air Force played a key role in the first-ever A400M HIRAIN (HIMARS Rapid Infiltration) mission in July 2024, when an M142 system was deployed by Belgium’s 20th Squadron Tactical Airlift. (Picture source: US DoD) A key element of the Arizona agreement is the establishment of a Defense Fund, which will serve as the primary mechanism for channeling resources into military modernization. Managed as a subsidiary of the state-owned SFPIM (Société Fédérale de Participations et d’Investissement), the fund will be supported through asset transfers to ensure a structured model for long-term investments. The government seeks to secure industrial returns from defense contracts by fostering domestic manufacturing, research, and development. Belgian defense firms will be integrated into procurement programs to support technological advancements and economic activity. Belgium is increasing its defense R&amp;D budget, allocating at least 2% of total defense expenditures to technological advancements. Collaborative initiatives with European partners, including potential participation in the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) and future air combat platforms, are under consideration. Belgium’s air force modernization plan includes investments in new fighter aircraft, an expanded transport fleet, and enhanced electronic warfare and counter-drone capabilities. Plans for an operational helicopter fleet aim to improve rotary-wing missions in national and coalition operations. Transport aviation will be reinforced through the procurement of smaller, tactical platforms to supplement heavy airlift capabilities. Air defense investments focus on radar systems, air surveillance, and electronic warfare measures to enhance airspace protection. The potential expansion of Belgium’s F-35 fleet is under discussion as the government reassesses previous procurement limitations. While the prior administration capped the order at 34 aircraft, NATO had recommended a larger fleet to meet air combat requirements. The current proposal, previously supported by the new Defense Minister, Theo Francken, considers acquiring additional F-35s to improve operational effectiveness. This expansion aligns with Belgium’s objective of reaching NATO’s 2% GDP defense spending benchmark by 2029 while maintaining interoperability with allied air forces. Increasing the number of F-35s would strengthen Belgium’s role in NATO air defense missions. Belgium is modernizing its ground forces within the CaMo program, focusing on improvements in firepower, logistics, and operational mobility. The army plans to introduce new platforms to enhance deep-strike capabilities, integrating multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS). Stockpiles of essential military equipment will be expanded, and an additional brigade for NATO operations is under consideration. The initiative prioritizes advanced technologies and cooperation with European allies to develop next-generation combat capabilities. Given Belgium’s plans to procure more American fighter jets and its efforts to stimulate the domestic defense industry by prioritizing local manufacturing and technology development, the possibility of Belgium opting for American MLRS systems remains significant. This is particularly relevant given that a Trump election victory could lead to increased purchases of American equipment, alongside indications tied to both the Belgian defense industry and Belgium’s previous international exercises. Thales Belgium has indicated that the US-made M270 MLRS can be configured to fire its 70mm rockets in a 9x6 array, which may align with Belgium’s interest in a system capable of launching both guided and unguided munitions. Given Belgium’s procurement strategy and industrial policies, selecting a modular MLRS with NATO-standardized ammunition would align with strategic objectives. The M270 MLRS, widely used by NATO allies, supports interoperability and the use of GMLRS, ER-GMLRS, and Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) for long-range engagements. An alternative under consideration is the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), a wheeled variant offering greater mobility compared to the tracked M270. HIMARS can launch the same range of guided munitions but is designed for rapid deployment and integration with mechanized and airborne units. Several European countries, including Poland and Romania, have already acquired HIMARS, underscoring its growing role in NATO’s artillery capabilities. Belgium’s potential procurement of either system would mark a significant step toward reinforcing its deep-strike capabilities, aligning with NATO’s push for increased long-range fire support among member states. Furthermore, the Belgian Air Force played a key role in the first-ever A400M HIRAIN (HIMARS Rapid Infiltration) mission in July 2024, when an M142 system was deployed by Belgium’s 20th Squadron Tactical Airlift, 15th Wing, during the Winter Shield exercise with U.S. and Latvian forces. Beyond air and ground force modernization, Belgium is allocating resources to naval expansion, unmanned systems, and cyber defense. The navy is set to acquire a third frigate and additional mine countermeasure vessels to support NATO maritime security operations. Investments in autonomous and remotely operated systems aim to improve underwater threat detection and neutralization. Belgium is expanding its drone fleet, integrating surveillance and combat-capable systems across multiple service branches to enhance reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, and precision-strike capabilities. Cyber warfare and electronic defense capabilities are being developed as part of Belgium’s modernization efforts. The government is strengthening cyber resilience, AI-driven defense applications, and electronic warfare tools. Military mobility investments include upgrades to transportation infrastructure, strategic landing capabilities, and specialized rail transport to support rapid deployments. Belgium is coordinating with NATO and EU partners to ensure interoperability and optimize logistical operations for allied forces in Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-belgium-could-purchase-rocket-launcher-systems-to-modernize-its-artillery-capabilities	2025-02-03T01:21:10-08:00	
Flash News: US Strikes Terrorist Group in Somalia Marking First Operation of Trump Administration	On February 1, 2025, U.S. forces launched a series of airstrikes in northern Somalia, targeting members of the Islamic State's (ISIS) affiliate in the region. This operation, announced by U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, marks the first major military action in Somalia under the Trump administration's second term. It follows a pattern of increased U.S. military engagement in Africa, especially during Donald Trump’s first presidency, when the U.S. conducted extensive airstrike campaigns aimed at dismantling terrorist groups in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 1 conducts routine flight operations from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The strikes took place in the Puntland region, specifically within the Gholis mountain range, a known stronghold for ISIS in Somalia. AFRICOM confirmed that multiple ISIS operatives were killed, though it did not provide specific details about the individuals targeted. In a statement, President Donald Trump referenced the operation, noting that it was aimed at eliminating a senior ISIS planner operating in the area. This targeted action aligns with ongoing U.S. efforts to combat ISIS and other terror groups, such as Al-Shabaab, that have taken root in Somalia and the broader Horn of Africa. The military assets involved in this operation were not explicitly detailed by AFRICOM, but photos accompanying the announcement indicated that Carrier Air Wing 1, operating from the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75), played a key role. The Harry S. Truman, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier based at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, has been operating in the Red Sea and the waters surrounding Yemen and Somalia. This deployment is part of broader U.S. military efforts to combat regional instability, particularly the threat posed by the Houthi movement in Yemen. The Carrier Air Wing 1 includes several key squadrons, such as Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), flying the F/A-18F; Strike Fighter Squadron 143 (VFA-143) and Strike Fighter Squadron 81 (VFA-81), both flying the F/A-18E; and Electronic Attack Squadron 144 (VAQ-144), operating the EA-18G Growler for electronic warfare. Additionally, Airborne Command and Control Squadron 126 (VAW-126), flying the E-2D Hawkeye, and several other support and attack squadrons from Naval Air Station Oceana and Naval Station Norfolk were involved in the operation, enhancing the Harry S. Truman’s capability to project power in the region. The U.S. Navy’s regional presence is further bolstered by the USS Gettysburg (CG-64), a guided-missile cruiser, and multiple destroyers, including the USS Stout (DDG-55), USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109), and USS The Sullivans (DDG-68). These vessels are part of Destroyer Squadron 28, based at Naval Station Norfolk, and have been integral to the broader counterterrorism and counter-piracy missions in the region. Additionally, the Ohio-class guided-missile submarine, USS Georgia (SSGN-729), operating in the Middle East, has played a critical role in the naval presence, carrying 154 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles and special operations forces for precision strikes. This airstrike highlights the ongoing U.S. commitment to countering ISIS and other terrorist factions in Somalia, a country that has long struggled with instability. The operation in Puntland is a clear signal that the U.S. is willing to intensify its military efforts under the Trump administration to protect American and allied interests in Africa. It also underscores the strategic importance of the Horn of Africa, both in terms of counterterrorism operations and as a key maritime corridor for global trade. The involvement of the USS Harry S. Truman and its air wing in this operation suggests that U.S. forces are increasingly relying on carrier-based aviation to conduct strikes in support of counterterrorism operations, reflecting the global reach of U.S. military assets. As the region continues to grapple with the influence of terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, the U.S. will likely maintain a strong military presence in East Africa, with airstrikes and naval power playing a central role in shaping the security landscape. This operation is also a reminder of the enduring challenges the U.S. faces in countering transnational terrorism, even as other global conflicts, like the war in Ukraine, continue to dominate headlines. The results of the operation in Puntland serve as another significant chapter in the broader context of U.S. military strategy in Africa, where a mix of airstrikes, special forces operations, and partnerships with local governments remains central to the U.S. approach in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-strikes-terrorist-group-in-somalia-marking-first-operation-of-trump-administration	2025-02-03T01:18:49-08:00

With a payload capacity of up to 35 tons, it can transport armored vehicles, helicopters, or up to 116 equipped paratroopers. Its range of 4,700 nautical miles allows it to reach distant operational theaters without refueling, while its four TP400-D6 engines, each producing 11,600 horsepower, provide high-performance capabilities. The A400M is also designed to operate from unprepared runways, a key feature for supporting forces deployed in difficult terrain. Its advanced avionics and automatic terrain-following system, a first for a transport aircraft, enable it to fly at very low altitudes and perform precise airdrops in contested environments. The supply glider must be fully autonomous, following a preprogrammed flight path after release. It must cover a distance of 70 to 80 km while carrying a payload of 700 kg, with a minimum volume of one cubic meter, expandable to 1.5 cubic meters depending on operational needs. The system must allow for serial deployment, with at least two units released simultaneously, requiring secure integration in the A400M’s cargo hold to ensure stable restraint and safe deployment. Designed as a disposable asset, it will not be recovered but must ensure the intact delivery of its cargo. Landing capability must be controlled, whether on dry or wet terrain, with a vertical impact speed below 9 m/s to preserve the payload’s condition and facilitate its rapid recovery by ground forces. This project represents a significant development in military airborne logistics, providing an alternative to traditional parachute drops while reducing transport aircraft exposure to hostile threats. By enabling a more flexible and secure resupply method, it could meet the needs of forces operating in contested environments, particularly when ground access is obstructed. The integration of such a system within the French Army would enhance operational resilience and responsiveness while optimizing air assets for logistical missions. Similar systems already exist, notably in the United States, where the Silent Arrow GD-2000, an autonomous and disposable supply glider, is designed for deployment from C-130 or CH-47 aircraft. The JPADS (Joint Precision Airdrop System), a GPS-guided parachute, is also used for precision supply drops. However, the French glider would distinguish itself by its integration with the A400M, enabling serial airdrops and optimized material delivery over longer distances. By leveraging the glider’s autonomous flight capability and the A400M’s high-altitude drop capacity, the French Army could benefit from an innovative solution that significantly enhances airborne logistical operations. If successfully developed, this project could transform resupply capabilities by offering a reliable and autonomous method for delivering cargo to difficult or conflict-affected areas. This technology could also pave the way for future innovations in military transport and logistics, with potential applications in humanitarian missions, such as delivering medical supplies or essential resources in crisis situations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/french-army-explores-new-logistic-approach-in-contested-zones-with-airbus-a400m-supply-glider-airdrop-tests	2025-02-03T00:54:32-08:00

US Army to Enhance M-SHORAD Short-Range Air Defense Systems Based on Lessons from Ukraine Conflict	According to a U.S. Congress report published in January 2025, the U.S. Army plans to adapt and enhance its Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system based on valuable lessons from the ongoing Ukraine conflict. The evolving nature of air threats, such as the extensive use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), loitering munitions, and other low-altitude air threats, has underlined the need for modernized air defense systems. These systems, including military and commercial UAVs (Unmanned aerial Vehicles), are employed in both kinetic and non-kinetic roles, highlighting the growing complexity of air threats. The U.S. Army intends to incorporate these lessons into the M-SHORAD’s future development to ensure the system is better equipped to handle such challenges, particularly regarding the increasing use of drones and loitering munitions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Army Soldiers from C Battery, 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery, 10th Army Air &amp; Missile Defense Command, participate in driver training on the M-SHORAD Stryker at the Oberdachstetten Range Complex, Germany, on April 23, 2023. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) In February 2024, the U.S. Army deployed four Stryker-mounted 50 kW laser DE M-SHORAD prototypes to the Middle East for soldiers to test the system’s performance against aerial threats. Initial soldier feedback was characterized as 'not overwhelmingly positive,' with officials suggesting that 'results from the lab environment and test ranges are very different from the tactical environment.' This feedback suggests that while the system may have shown potential in controlled testing, it faced challenges in real-world operational conditions. The U.S. Army continues to refine this technology, with a decision on a future Enduring High Energy Laser (HEL) system slated for 2026. The M-SHORAD system itself is a key part of the U.S. Army's short-range air defense strategy, designed to provide air defense against low-altitude threats, including rotary-wing aircraft, fixed-wing UAVs, and short-range ballistic missiles. The U.S. Army has been developing the system in increments, with each phase offering increased capabilities to meet evolving threats. Initially, the U.S. Army planned to field 144 M-SHORAD Increment 1 systems across four battalions, each equipped with 40 units, as well as support vehicles and personnel. The first systems were delivered to the 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment in 2021, with full operational capability achieved by late 2022. By 2024, the U.S. Army had started to deliver additional M-SHORAD systems as part of the planned expansion of the fleet. These deliveries were integral to the Army’s ongoing efforts to build up its air defense capabilities, ensuring that each battalion is fully equipped with the necessary vehicles, radar systems, and armament. In total, the U.S. Army intends to procure up to 162 M-SHORAD systems, with plans to expand the fleet to as many as 361 systems, depending on future decisions. The additional systems being delivered in 2024 are part of this ongoing expansion, aiming to improve the Army’s ability to counter low-altitude air threats in both domestic and overseas deployments. The M-SHORAD Increment 1, based on the M1126 Stryker combat vehicle chassis, is equipped with a range of armaments, including two AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles, four FIM-92 Stinger missiles, a 30 mm automatic cannon, and a 7.62 mm M-240 machine gun. The system also features a multi-mission radar capable of tracking both ground and aerial threats. However, the U.S. Army is planning to retrofit the system by replacing the Hellfire missile launcher due to concerns about wear and tear, which has led to potential safety issues. This retrofit will involve swapping the Hellfire launcher for a second Stinger missile pod, bringing the total number of Stinger missiles to eight per vehicle. Looking ahead, M-SHORAD Increment 2 will incorporate a 50-kilowatt directed energy laser system, representing a significant leap in air defense technology. The laser is designed to engage aerial threats as well as artillery and rockets, although there have been challenges in defending against these additional threats. The 50 kW laser system has been undergoing testing since 2019, and while it has proven effective against drones, it has not been as successful in countering other types of short-range threats like rockets and artillery. In response to these challenges, the U.S. Army continues to refine the laser system, with a decision on a future Enduring High Energy Laser (HEL) system expected by 2026. The next phase, M-SHORAD Increment 3, will introduce the Next-Generation Short Range Interceptor (NGSRI) to replace the FIM-92 Stinger missile, offering improved engagement range and accuracy. Additionally, the system will incorporate the XM 1223 Multi-Mode Proximity Airburst Munition (MMPA), which can target air, ground, and personnel threats. In March 2023, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies were selected to develop competing prototypes of the NGSRI, with the first operational demonstration scheduled for FY2026 and production expected to begin in 2027. The U.S. Army also issued a Request for Information (RFI) in May 2024 for M-SHORAD Increment 4, which aims to provide air defense capabilities for dismounted units. This increment will focus on creating a portable and deployable solution that can be airlifted via C-130 aircraft and integrated onto platforms such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) or robotic vehicles. The U.S. Army seeks responses for systems that can be operational by FY2027 to FY2028, with long-term goals extending to beyond 2035. With the increasing complexity of air threats, particularly from drones and loitering munitions, the U.S. Army is moving quickly to upgrade its M-SHORAD system. The development of the system’s various increments—ranging from improvements to Increment 1, to advances in directed energy with Increment 2, and the introduction of the next-generation interceptors in Increment 3—will bolster the U.S. Army's air defense capabilities. Increment 4’s focus on dismounted capabilities will ensure the U.S. Army’s readiness for a variety of future combat scenarios. As these advancements unfold, ongoing testing and soldier feedback will be crucial to refining M-SHORAD and adapting it to the fast-changing landscape of modern warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-to-enhance-m-shorad-short-range-air-defense-systems-based-on-lessons-from-ukraine-conflict	2025-02-02T03:08:30-08:00

Despite the lack of immediate threat, the operation reflects ongoing concerns over growing military activity in the Arctic, where shifting ice patterns are opening up new trade routes and increasing competition for resources. To monitor the situation, NORAD launched a multi-layered response. The Canadian NORAD Region (CANR) dispatched two CF-18 Hornet fighter jets, supported by a KC-135 refueling aircraft. From the Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR), NORAD launched two U.S. F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters, along with two KC-135 Stratotanker refueling aircraft and one E-3 Sentry AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) surveillance aircraft. The E-3 AWACS, a critical asset in both NATO and NORAD operations, provided real-time airspace monitoring, enhancing situational awareness during the operation. NORAD highlighted that this monitoring operation was part of its routine defense measures, emphasizing the importance of its ability to detect, track, and positively identify aircraft. 'Our ability to detect, track, and positively identify aircraft is critical to maintaining the security of North American airspace,' said a NORAD spokesperson. The monitoring of Russian aircraft highlights the strategic importance of the Arctic to both Russia and North America. As the Arctic region's ice continues to melt due to climate change, new shipping lanes and untapped natural resources are becoming increasingly accessible, making it a focal point of global competition. The region is believed to hold a significant portion of the world's untapped oil and gas reserves, as well as mineral resources vital for future technological advancements, such as rare earth elements essential for electronics and green energy technologies. For Russia, the Arctic is a critical area for both military and economic expansion. Over the past decade, Russia has been heavily investing in its Arctic military infrastructure, modernizing bases, deploying advanced weapons systems, and increasing the presence of its Northern Fleet. These activities are seen as a means to assert dominance in the region, control key shipping routes, and secure access to energy reserves. In particular, Russia has taken steps to strengthen its control over the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which provides a faster shipping lane between Europe and Asia as it navigates through Arctic waters, previously inaccessible due to thick ice cover. For the United States and Canada, maintaining control and influence in the Arctic is crucial to national security and economic interests. The U.S. sees the Arctic as a potential gateway for military power projection, given its proximity to the Russian Federation. In addition, the U.S. is committed to ensuring the safe passage of commercial ships through Arctic waters and preventing any foreign military presence that could threaten vital trade routes or pose a strategic military advantage. For Canada, which shares the Arctic region with the U.S., maintaining sovereignty over its northern territories and airspace is paramount. In response to Russia's growing presence, both the U.S. and Canada have ramped up their military readiness in the region. NORAD, as the command responsible for defending North American airspace, plays a vital role in monitoring and responding to Russian activities, whether they involve air incursions or maritime threats.

For the U.S. and Canada, the Arctic is not only important for the defense of their sovereignty but also for securing the flow of global commerce and access to energy resources. By monitoring Russian aircraft and demonstrating a strong defense presence, NORAD sends a clear message that North America will not allow the region to become a flashpoint for military conflict. Moreover, it underscores the strategic value of cooperation between the U.S. and Canada, as both nations continue to strengthen their defense capabilities in the High North. In addition to military considerations, the Arctic’s growing accessibility could reshape global trade patterns, with countries seeking to control or influence new shipping lanes. The U.S. and Canada, both of which are major trading powers, cannot afford to lose control over these vital maritime routes. With China also eyeing the Arctic for trade and resource extraction, the competition for control over these emerging lanes will intensify in the coming years. NORAD’s deployment of advanced fighter jets, AWACS surveillance, and tanker support is a clear indication that the defense of North America extends beyond just its southern borders. The Arctic, as the 'High North' becomes an area of increasingly strategic importance. With tensions over Russian activities in the region likely to persist, NORAD’s readiness and response capability will remain a key component in ensuring North American security in the face of a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. While no further provocations were reported following the monitoring operation, the incident highlights the rising tensions in the Arctic and signals the continued importance of joint U.S.-Canadian defense efforts. As NATO allies bolster their defenses in the region, NORAD's vigilance remains a cornerstone of North American security strategy, providing a deterrent to any potential threats emerging from the growing military and strategic competition in the Arctic. The ability to control and secure this crucial region will play a pivotal role in shaping the global balance of power in the years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-norad-us-and-canadian-fighter-jets-monitor-russian-aircraft-in-arctic-amid-growing-global-interest	2025-02-01T06:44:02-08:00

UK to sell HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark to Brazil Raising Concerns Over Amphibious Capability	According to information published by Daily Mail on January 26, 2025, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is reportedly preparing to sell two of its amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, to Brazil for a sum that undervalues their prior maintenance and refit costs. This move, part of a broader cost-cutting strategy, raises questions about the Royal Navy’s future amphibious capabilities and the strategic implications of offloading key assets at a time of increasing global instability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's Albion-class amphibious transport dock HMS Albion. (Picture source: UK MoD) HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark are the UK’s sole remaining dedicated amphibious warfare ships, capable of deploying Royal Marines, vehicles, and equipment in contested environments. These vessels, commissioned in the early 2000s, are designed for expeditionary operations, humanitarian assistance, and power projection. Their potential sale reduces the Royal Navy’s ability to conduct independent amphibious operations, shifting reliance onto allied forces or alternative, less capable platforms. The decision aligns with the MoD’s ongoing modernization efforts, which prioritize emerging technologies, multi-role platforms, and cost-efficiency. However, the absence of a direct replacement for these vessels could leave the UK with a gap in its ability to conduct large-scale amphibious landings without significant support from allied navies, particularly the United States and NATO partners. Over the past 14 years, the UK has invested heavily in maintaining and upgrading both ships, with reported expenditures exceeding £132 million, plus additional planned refits estimated at £72 million for HMS Bulwark before its premature decommissioning. The reported £20 million sale price raises concerns about the financial rationale behind the decision, given that their combined replacement cost would be several times higher. While the ships are nearing the later stages of their service life, their hulls and core systems remain operationally viable, particularly with further upgrades. Brazil’s potential acquisition suggests that these vessels still hold significant operational value, raising the question of why the UK considers them surplus while another navy sees them as a strategic asset. The decision to retire these ships follows a broader Royal Navy restructuring aimed at prioritizing multi-role platforms, including the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, Type 31 frigates, and Future Commando Force concepts. These initiatives focus on distributed lethality, smaller amphibious platforms, and integration with air and cyber capabilities. However, these concepts have yet to fully replace the strategic utility of dedicated amphibious assault ships. The Royal Marines’ ability to conduct major amphibious operations traditionally relied on these platforms for deploying armored vehicles, logistics, and troops ashore in contested environments. Without them, future operations may be constrained to littoral strike roles utilizing smaller support ships and aviation assets, limiting the scale and flexibility of UK expeditionary warfare. For Brazil, acquiring HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark would significantly enhance its amphibious and power projection capabilities. The Brazilian Navy currently operates an aging fleet, including the amphibious transport dock Bahia (ex-French Siroco). The addition of two Albion-class vessels would provide Brazil with greater capacity for humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and military operations in the South Atlantic, particularly concerning territorial security and regional partnerships. This transfer would also reinforce Brazil’s defense ties with the UK, following previous acquisitions such as the aircraft carrier São Paulo (ex-French Foch) and other Royal Navy vessels. It positions Brazil as a leading naval power in South America, capable of deploying forces at a strategic distance.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/uk-to-sell-hms-albion-and-hms-bulwark-to-brazil-raising-concerns-over-amphibious-capability	2025-01-31T06:23:36-08:00

The geopolitical landscape has become increasingly volatile, with missile threats from rogue states and adversarial nations growing in both number and sophistication. The development of long-range, high-speed missiles, particularly in regions like the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East, has driven the demand for advanced missile defense systems. As such, THAAD’s ability to counter these evolving threats has made it an essential asset in the arsenals of numerous nations. THAAD’s effectiveness has led to its adoption by several international partners, further solidifying its role in global security. Currently, THAAD systems are operational in the United States, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), South Korea, and more recently, Saudi Arabia, with discussions ongoing with other countries seeking to enhance their missile defense capabilities. In South Korea, THAAD was deployed in 2017 as a countermeasure to North Korea's advancing missile capabilities. The system provides a protective shield over Seoul and the surrounding region, particularly in response to increasing missile tests conducted by North Korea, which threatened regional stability. The UAE signed an agreement with the U.S. in 2011 for the purchase of THAAD systems to bolster its defense infrastructure, particularly against ballistic missile threats from neighboring countries in the region. In 2020, Saudi Arabia completed the deployment of THAAD batteries as part of its ongoing effort to modernize its air defense systems. The system is integral to defending key infrastructure in the Kingdom, especially with the growing missile threat from Yemen-based Houthi rebels and Iranian-backed forces. An important feature of THAAD is its integration with other missile defense systems, such as the PAC-3 MSE (Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement). The ability to operate in tandem with other systems is critical in today’s multi-layered defense environment, where adversaries may employ sophisticated, long-range missile systems designed to bypass individual defense layers. The U.S. Army's ongoing development of an integrated and networked air and missile defense architecture aims to enhance the synergy between various systems, enabling them to work in concert to detect, track, and neutralize threats in real-time. This networked approach provides a more resilient and comprehensive defense posture, particularly against advanced missile threats. Lockheed Martin’s successful delivery of the 900th THAAD interceptor marks a crucial milestone in the system’s continued evolution. The company remains committed to delivering cutting-edge capabilities, ensuring that THAAD can adapt to meet emerging threats. With its proven track record, strategic importance, and broad user base, THAAD continues to be one of the most trusted missile defense systems globally. As geopolitical tensions persist and missile technology continues to advance, THAAD will remain an indispensable tool in the defense of both the U.S. and its allies, providing a reliable shield against the increasing threats posed by ballistic missiles worldwide. The key technical specifications of THAAD include an interceptor range of up to 200 km (124 miles), an ability to intercept missiles at altitudes above 150 km, and the AN/TPY-2 radar system that provides precise tracking and target discrimination. The interceptor itself relies on a kinetic energy-based approach to destroy incoming missiles, without the use of explosive warheads. This highly effective 'hit-to-kill' method is capable of neutralizing high-speed and high-altitude threats. Additionally, THAAD can be rapidly deployed and relocated, providing flexibility in defense strategy. With its world-leading performance and unmatched reliability, the U.S. THAAD system represents a cornerstone of modern missile defense. As the global security environment continues to evolve, THAAD’s success in meeting the challenges of ballistic missile defense reinforces its role as a vital asset for the U.S. and its allies. The delivery of the 900th interceptor marks a new chapter in THAAD’s operational history, with further advancements on the horizon as Lockheed Martin continues to push the boundaries of innovation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-thaad-reaches-900th-interceptor-delivery-cementing-its-role-as-global-shield-against-ballistic-missile-threats	2025-01-31T05:20:41-08:00	
Germany’s future IRIS-T Block II air-to-air missile to improve target tracking and accuracy	As reported by Diehl Defence on January 31, 2025, the German Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology, and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) and the company signed a contract at the end of December 2024, for the development and series production of the IRIS-T Block II missile system. The agreement was finalized within a short timeframe through coordination between the IRIS-T Project Management Office (PMO), BAAINBw, and Diehl Defence. Germany is the lead nation in this development program, with Sweden, Spain, and Italy also participating. The BAAINBw signed the contract on behalf of this multinational consortium.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new IRIS-T Block II air-to-air missile will receive a new seeker, updated electronics, and a data link capability (Picture source: Diehl Defence) In June 2024, the German company Diehl Defence announced that the IRIS-T Block II would incorporate a new seeker, updated electronics, and a data link capability. The German parliament approved financing for this program in December 2024, leading to the contract signing in late December 2024. Diehl Defence has also disclosed details about the IRIS-T SLX air-defense system, designed to engage incoming air-launched weapons and their carrier aircraft. Revealed at the ILA Berlin Air Show in June 2024, this system is expected to intercept targets at distances of up to 50 km and altitudes of up to 30 km. The system is projected to become operational within four years, with the capability to engage cruise missiles and helicopters. The IRIS-T (InfraRed Imaging System – Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled) is a European short-range air-to-air missile developed in cooperation between Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Norway. Since its introduction in 2005, more than 5,000 units have been delivered, and the system is currently in service with the air forces of 13 nations. It is integrated into multiple aircraft platforms, including the Eurofighter Typhoon, Gripen, F-16, Tornado, EF-18, KF-21, and F-5E, and is designed for use against both aircraft and incoming air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles. The development of the IRIS-T followed Germany’s reunification when Western analysts studied MiG-29A fighters inherited from the former East German Air Force. These aircraft were equipped with the Soviet-designed R-73 air-to-air missile, which surprised experts with its superior maneuverability, off-boresight targeting capabilities, and extended range compared to the AIM-9L/M Sidewinder, the standard missile used by NATO at the time. This led the German Ministry of Defence to study the continued relevance of close-range aerial engagements despite advancements in long-range detection and engagement technologies. Simulations indicated that visual-range combat remained likely due to factors such as the limited identification capabilities of modern aircraft, complex air situations involving multiple national forces, and the necessity of visual confirmation before engagement. This realization played a critical role in Germany’s decision to withdraw from the AIM-132 ASRAAM program in 1989, as its focus on extended-range engagements was deemed outdated. Instead, Germany sought to develop a missile with superior agility and close-combat capabilities, leading to the IRIS-T program in collaboration with Italy, Sweden, Greece, Canada, and Norway. In April 1996, Bodenseewerk Gerätetechnik (BGT) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with these partner nations, with Germany funding 50% of the development costs. Initial tests were conducted using Sidewinder missiles modified with IRIS-T seekers. The Bundestag approved the project in December 1997, with Germany contributing 46% of the budget, followed by Italy (20%), Sweden (18%), Greece (8%), Canada (4%), and Norway (3%). Spain replaced Canada in the program at the end of 2001, and in 2003, the partner nations signed a procurement contract worth €1 billion. Full-scale production began in the early 2000s, with Germany receiving the first operational missiles in 2005. The development of the IRIS-T followed Germany’s reunification, when Western analysts studied MiG-29A fighters equipped with the Soviet-designed R-73 air-to-air missile, which were inherited from the former East German Air Force. (Picture source: Russian social media) Early missiles could only engage targets from the rear, but this changed with the AIM-9L Sidewinder, which introduced all-aspect engagement, allowing it to target threats from multiple angles. The hit probability improved to 73% during the Falklands War but later declined due to the introduction of infrared countermeasures, as seen in the Second Gulf War, where effectiveness fell to 23%. To counter this, modern infrared-guided missiles, including the IRIS-T, use imaging infrared seekers that can differentiate between decoys and actual targets. The IRIS-T also integrates helmet-mounted sighting systems, allowing pilots to designate targets up to 90° off-boresight. Like the Python-5, it has a lock-on-after-launch capability, enabling engagement of targets beyond the aircraft’s immediate field of view. The missile can receive target data via the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) and adjust its trajectory accordingly. Designed for close combat, interception, and self-defense, the IRIS-T is a fire-and-forget short-range air-to-air missile with thrust vector control and an advanced infrared seeker. The seeker combines a focal plane array with a mechanical scan, enhancing resistance to countermeasures such as IR decoys and blinding lasers. The missile’s lock-on-after-launch (LOAL) mode and inertial navigation system allow engagement of targets beyond the seeker’s initial field of view. Moreover, the missile has a squint angle range of ±90° and can engage targets behind the launch platform within 0.5 seconds. Equipped with an 11.4 kg fragmentation warhead triggered by impact or a Ku-band radar proximity fuse and a propulsion system enabling rapid acceleration to speeds up to Mach 3, the IRIS-T is capable of intercepting fast, maneuvering aerial threats, including aircraft and missiles, at ranges of up to 25 km. Germany remains the primary operator, with an initial order of 1,250 missiles and an additional 1,280 ordered under a framework agreement extending until 2030. Other current operators include Austria (25 missiles), Brazil (unknown number), Greece (350), Italy (444), Norway (150, now transferred to Ukraine), Saudi Arabia (1,400, plus 150 ordered in 2024), South Africa (25), Spain (700), Sweden (450, including the IRIS-T SLS for ground-based air defense), Thailand (220), and Ukraine (unknown number). The missile has been integrated into various aircraft fleets, with five of the seven Eurofighter nations using it. Norway retired its IRIS-T stock in 2022, transferring its missiles to Ukraine. Future operators include Hungary, which is integrating the missile into its JAS 39 Gripen MS20 Block II modernization program, and South Korea, which has tested the IRIS-T on the KF-21 fighter, with a successful test firing announced in May 2024. Romania has also conducted trials with the missile on the IAR-99SM. Several countries operate or have ordered the ground-based IRIS-T SLM and SLS variants. Sweden has fielded the IRIS-T SLS since 2016, while Germany operates one IRIS-T SLM fire unit, with five more on order and two on option. Ukraine has received four IRIS-T SLM systems and is set to receive additional units, with Norway committing $92 million for a battery. Egypt operates seven IRIS-T SLM systems, with a further order for 400 missiles and 10 IRIS-T SLX systems approved in 2021. Austria, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, and Switzerland have placed orders or are negotiating procurement. This missile is also part of the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), with Germany, Latvia, Estonia, Norway, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia participating. Additionally, the IRIS-T's cost is lower compared to the PAC-3 MSE (priced at approximately €3.7 million per unit), as Germany is said to pay approximately €400,000 per missile, covering 46% of development costs. Germany remains the primary operator of the IRIS-T, with an initial order of 1,250 missiles and an additional 1,280 ordered under a framework agreement extending until 2030.

Keen Sword 2025: Lockheed Martin Integrates Aegis for Faster Networked Fire Control Across Land and Maritime Forces	According to information published by Lockheed Martin on January 29, 2025, the Keen Sword exercise near mainland Japan provided a critical testbed for validating the role of the Virtualized Aegis Weapon System (VAWS) in a networked, multi-domain fires environment.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Virtualized Aegis Weapon System (VAWS) integrates seamlessly with joint fire control networks during Keen Sword, demonstrating advanced CJADC2-enabled long-range strike coordination between U.S. and JSDF maritime and land forces. (Picture source: Samantha Rosales) By integrating Aegis with joint U.S. and Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) fire control systems, the exercise demonstrated key advancements in Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2), particularly in accelerating kill-chain processes and enhancing cross-domain targeting interoperability. Aegis' role in Keen Sword focused on fire control automation and digital C2 integration across maritime and land domains. Traditionally, long-range fires coordination across service branches relies on manual processes, introducing latency in targeting cycles. VAWS eliminated these inefficiencies by establishing a direct, digital fire control interface with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). This integration allowed for the near-instantaneous transmission of engagement orders and targeting data between naval and ground units, ensuring that sensor-derived information was processed and acted upon in real time. A key scenario within the exercise involved VAWS supporting the 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) in executing a simulated land-based strike coordinated with naval assets. This demonstrated the ability to process and distribute C2 data across disparate fire control networks, aligning land- and sea-based targeting capabilities into a unified strike package. The ability of Aegis to ingest targeting inputs from multiple domains and seamlessly transmit engagement orders without service-specific barriers reinforced its role as a cross-domain integrator within a CJADC2 architecture. From a strategic perspective, the application of Aegis in Keen Sword represents an evolution in distributed fires doctrine. Modern peer threats emphasize contested battlespaces where rapid, resilient targeting networks determine operational advantage. By leveraging a software-defined, virtualized battle management system, the exercise validated a framework where Aegis can function as an expeditionary control node, extending beyond its traditional maritime role to enable synchronized land-sea engagements. This shift aligns with emerging Indo-Pacific operational requirements, where allied forces must maintain persistent targeting and engagement capabilities across a dispersed, multi-domain battlespace. The integration of Aegis also underscores a broader doctrinal shift toward decentralized, network-centric fires. As adversaries develop counter-C2 strategies aimed at disrupting centralized battle management architectures, survivability hinges on the ability to distribute fire control functions across a resilient, multi-node network. VAWS' ability to rapidly integrate into joint and coalition architectures demonstrates an approach where command and control is no longer tied to single-domain assets but rather exists as a fluid, software-driven capability that can be extended across platforms and services. Keen Sword’s implementation of CJADC2-aligned fires coordination serves as a precursor to more extensive coalition integration in the region. The successful demonstration of VAWS at Keen Sword reinforces the viability of integrated, multi-domain fire control as a key enabler in maintaining strategic deterrence and operational superiority in the Indo-Pacific.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/keen-sword-2025-lockheed-martin-integrates-aegis-for-faster-networked-fire-control-across-land-and-maritime-forces	2025-01-31T04:00:28-08:00

Norwegian-Owned Ship Silver Dania Detained in Norway over Suspected Baltic Sea Cable Sabotage	According to information published by NRK on January 31, 2025, Norwegian authorities have ordered the cargo ship Silver Dania to dock in Tromsø following a legal request from Latvia. The vessel, owned by the Bergen-based company Silver Sea and registered under the Norwegian flag, is suspected of involvement in the deliberate destruction of an undersea fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and Sweden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Norwegian-owned cargo ship Silver Dania detained in Tromsø amid allegations of involvement in Baltic undersea cable sabotage. (Picture source: Silversea) The Baltic Sea has become a battleground for hybrid warfare, with repeated incidents targeting undersea infrastructure. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, multiple cases of unexplained damage to communication cables, energy pipelines, and power transmission lines have signaled a shift toward asymmetric conflict tactics. The Nord Stream pipeline explosions demonstrated the vulnerability of seabed infrastructure, prompting NATO and European defense planners to reinforce undersea security measures. The detention of Silver Dania is the latest event in a series of escalating maritime security threats. The vessel, built in 1989 and measuring 113.4 meters in length and 17.75 meters in width, operates between St. Petersburg and Murmansk, a region of strategic importance for Russian maritime logistics and military transport. AIS tracking data from MarineTraffic revealed that Silver Dania made an unexplained stop west of Senja before proceeding to Tromsø, a pattern that raised suspicions among authorities monitoring undersea infrastructure. The ship’s movements align with previous cases where unidentified vessels were detected near fiber-optic cables before disruptions occurred, adding to speculation that commercial ships may be repurposed for sabotage under the guise of regular cargo operations. Targeting undersea communication cables presents a direct security challenge, affecting not only national governments but also military coordination, banking systems, and civilian internet access. NATO and European intelligence agencies have increasingly warned that these attacks could serve as probes to test Western responses to maritime sabotage. The nature of the Baltic Sea, with its shallow depth and high concentration of military and commercial activity, makes it an ideal zone for covert operations. The damage to the Latvia-Sweden cable follows similar incidents involving Finnish and Estonian infrastructure, reinforcing concerns that these disruptions are part of a broader strategic campaign rather than isolated technical failures. In response to the growing threat, NATO has deployed additional naval forces to the Baltic, including warships equipped with sonar and surveillance capabilities designed to monitor vessel activity near critical underwater assets. The alliance has also expanded the use of underwater drones and seabed sensors to detect unauthorized operations in high-risk areas. The detention of Silver Dania suggests a shift toward more aggressive enforcement measures against suspected sabotage vessels, reflecting a heightened awareness of the role commercial ships may play in modern hybrid conflicts. The investigation into Silver Dania will determine whether the vessel was actively involved in sabotage or if it was merely operating in a sensitive area at the wrong time. Regardless of the outcome, the case highlights the evolving nature of maritime threats in the Baltic Sea. With underwater infrastructure increasingly viewed as a frontline in modern conflict, securing these assets has become a priority for European defense strategies. The possibility that state-affiliated actors are leveraging commercial shipping for intelligence gathering and sabotage underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and stricter maritime controls in regions where critical infrastructure is most vulnerable.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/norwegian-owned-ship-silver-dania-detained-in-norway-over-suspected-baltic-sea-cable-sabotage	2025-01-31T03:41:35-08:00

The initiation of Philadelphia’s fabrication comes amid ongoing discussions regarding the future of U.S. amphibious warfare and naval force structure. The San Antonio-class, particularly the Flight II variants, is intended to replace the aging Whidbey Island (LSD 41) and Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) classes of dock landing ships. While those vessels primarily functioned as well deck transporters with limited aviation facilities, the LPD Flight II design offers greater aviation integration, survivability, and command capabilities. Amphibious transport docks play a central role in distributed maritime operations, supporting missions ranging from amphibious assault and crisis response to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The growing emphasis on expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO) and stand-in forces, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, increases the relevance of flexible amphibious platforms capable of supporting both kinetic and non-kinetic missions. However, the long-term trajectory of the LPD program remains subject to budgetary constraints and evolving operational priorities. The Navy has previously signaled interest in a more distributed amphibious fleet structure, potentially incorporating smaller, more numerous amphibious platforms alongside traditional large-deck amphibious ships. Debate continues over the balance between high-capability, high-cost ships like the LPD Flight II and the need for lower-cost alternatives to support distributed operations in contested environments. Additionally, shifting strategic requirements in the face of near-peer competition, particularly in the Pacific, may influence future procurement decisions. While the San Antonio-class provides a robust capability for traditional amphibious operations, its ability to operate in highly contested environments with advanced anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) threats remains a consideration for fleet planners.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/hii-advances-amphibious-warfare-programs-with-start-of-uss-philadelphia-lpd-32-fabrication	2025-01-31T02:29:02-08:00

Negotiations for 60 aircraft continued in February 2015, but by 2020, the possibility of a Rafale acquisition appeared unlikely, as discussions focused on Mirage 2000-9 upgrades. The UAE also expressed interest in the Sukhoi Su-57 before opting for the F-35. In late 2020 and November 2021, reports indicated renewed interest in the Rafale, leading to the eventual contract. On December 3, 2021, the UAE finalized its order for 80 Rafale F4s, with the contract signed in the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, then Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Vice-Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. The agreement was signed by Dassault CEO Éric Trappier and Tawazun Economic Council CEO Tareq Abdul Raheem Al Hosani. The €17 billion contract officially took effect on April 19, 2022, with deliveries scheduled between 2027 and 2031. The Rafale F4s will replace the UAE’s Mirage 2000-9 fleet, acquired in 1998. The Rafale program originated in the early 1980s when France withdrew from the multinational Future European Fighter Aircraft (FEFA) project, which led to the development of the Eurofighter Typhoon. Dassault Aviation designed the Rafale as a twin-engine, canard-delta wing multirole fighter for air superiority, ground attack, reconnaissance, and nuclear deterrence missions. The aircraft first flew in 1986 as a technology demonstrator and entered operational service in 2001 with the French Navy and in 2006 with the French Air Force. Unlike other European fighter programs, the Rafale is primarily developed and manufactured in France, involving contributions from approximately 400 companies, with 90% of its 300,000 components produced domestically. According to a report by the French National Assembly published in 2013, the unit cost of the Rafale is between 90 and 100 million euros, excluding the weaponry. The aircraft has 14 external hardpoints (13 on the carrier-based Rafale M), five of which are designed for heavy ordnance or external fuel tanks. The Rafale has an empty weight of around 10 tonnes and is designed to carry up to 25 tonnes, including armaments and fuel, making it the only fighter in service capable of carrying 1.5 times its own weight. The Rafale has been used in military operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq, and Syria. Its first combat deployment occurred in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2011. In 2011, it carried out strike missions against armored columns in Libya. In 2013, during Operation Serval in Mali, a Rafale conducted a long-range airstrike lasting 9 hours and 35 minutes. The aircraft has also been deployed in counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Syria. The Rafale is designed for carrier and land-based operations and has a takeoff distance requirement of 400 meters. It has a top speed of Mach 1.8 (2,200 km/h) and an operational range of 1,850 km at high altitude. The aircraft is equipped with the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and carries various munitions, including Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, SCALP-EG cruise missiles, AASM Hammer guided bombs, and AM39 Exocet anti-ship missiles. The SPECTRA electronic warfare suite provides self-protection and threat detection. The F4 standard introduces upgrades in radar, electronic warfare, and networked communication capabilities. It includes improvements in data processing, artificial intelligence-assisted sensor fusion, and an upgraded helmet-mounted display. The aircraft’s communications systems have been enhanced for network-centric operations, and provisions have been made for the integration of future weapon systems. Flight testing for the F4 standard began in 2021, and the first deliveries occurred in 2023. All newly produced Rafales will be built to this standard, while existing aircraft will undergo retrofitting. In 2019, the French government allocated an additional €2 billion for further development, focusing on adapting the aircraft to evolving operational requirements. The Rafale is currently operated by France, Egypt, India, Qatar, Greece, Croatia, Indonesia, and the UAE. The UAE’s acquisition of 80 Rafales represents the largest single export order for the aircraft to date. Serbia has finalized a contract for 12 Rafales, while Iraq has expressed interest in acquiring 14 aircraft, with discussions reportedly involving payment through crude oil. Bangladesh has also been identified as a potential future operator. Since 2015, more Rafales have been sold internationally than acquired by the French military. Initial export orders were secured by Egypt, Qatar, and India between 2015 and 2016. After a period of limited sales, additional contracts were signed in 2021 and 2022, including deals with the UAE, Greece, Croatia, and Indonesia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/frances-first-rafale-f4-fighter-jet-for-uae-moves-to-initial-flight-testing-after-official-presentation	2025-01-31T00:39:56-08:00

(Picture source: Facebook/Rafał Bieńkowski) Compared to its predecessor, the BTR-60PB, the BTR-70 saw relatively limited production, as it retained some of the earlier vehicle’s shortcomings, such as the dual gasoline engines and restricted troop entry and exit points. These issues became evident during combat, particularly in the Soviet–Afghan War, leading to the introduction of the BTR-80 in 1984. The BTR-80 featured a single 260-horsepower diesel engine and an improved drivetrain, prompting the cessation of BTR-70 production the same year. The Soviet Union exported the BTR-70 to Afghanistan, East Germany, Hungary, and Romania, with Romania producing a local variant, the TAB-77. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many BTR-70s were inherited by post-Soviet states or re-exported. Some countries have retired their fleets, such as Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania, while others have extended their service life through modernization programs, including Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. Currently, Turkmenistan operates the largest fleet of BTR-70s, with approximately 300 units, followed by Russia with around 200. Azerbaijan has 132 units, while Pakistan retains up to 120. Belarus maintains approximately 64 units, North Macedonia 56, and Kyrgyzstan 45, including standard BTR-70s and upgraded BTR-70M models. Mongolia operates 40, Armenia 36, while Georgia and Uzbekistan each have 25. Other operators include Mexico with 26, Ghana and Zambia with 20 each, Tajikistan with up to 20, and Nicaragua and Sudan with smaller numbers. Ukraine, having inherited a substantial number from the Soviet Union, has pursued multiple modernization initiatives, including the BTR-70DI, BTR-70M, BTR-70 KBA-2, BTR-70T, and BTR-70 Varan armored personnel carriers, as well as the BTR-70Di-02 Svityaz command vehicle, the BMM Ark armored ambulance and the BREM-2000 (or BREM-7K), an armored recovery vehicle. The source of the 150 BTR-70DI modernized by Mista is most likely Ukraine, as this specific variant seems to have not been exported to any country, though differences exist in the choice of armament. There has been no official confirmation regarding the recipient of these modernized vehicles, but Ukraine remains the most probable operator, as Mista is also involved in producing the Oncilla, a Polish variant of the Ukrainian Dozor-B 4x4 armored personnel carrier. The upgrades, including Western diesel engines, reinforced protection, and electronic warfare enhancements, align with Ukraine’s operational needs. Additionally, reports confirm that vehicles matching this configuration have been observed in service with Ukraine’s 151st Separate Mechanized Brigade, suggesting that these modernized BTR-70s have been delivered to the Ukrainian military.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-modernizes-150-ukrainian-btr-70di-8x8-armored-personnel-carriers-to-improve-their-effectiveness	2025-01-30T08:01:11-08:00

Trump Administration’s Defense Chief reaffirms US Commitment to AUKUS in talks with Australia	According to information published by the US DoD on January 29 2025, the United States has reaffirmed its long-term commitment to the AUKUS defense pact under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, signaling continuity in the trilateral partnership between the U.S., Australia, and the United Kingdom.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link While docked at HMAS Stirling Navy Base on Garden Island, the crew of the Virginia-class fast-attack submarine USS Mississippi (SSN 782), assisted by explosive ordnance support specialists from Thales Australia, carefully loaded an inert Tomahawk missile training shape into the vessel. (Picture source: US DoD) AUKUS Pillar I, which focuses on the Royal Australian Navy’s transition to nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs), remains the most strategically significant aspect of the agreement. Australia is set to operate a hybrid fleet consisting of U.S. Virginia-class SSNs, delivered in the early 2030s, followed by the introduction of the SSN-AUKUS, a next-generation submarine based on the British SSN(R) design but incorporating U.S. combat systems and nuclear propulsion technology. The integration of S9G pressurized water reactors, derived from U.S. Virginia-class and Ohio-class submarines, ensures that Australia’s SSNs will maintain parity with American and British counterparts in terms of power output, submerged endurance, and operational tempo. These submarines will be optimized for low-acoustic signature propulsion, advanced sonar processing, and high-bandwidth secure communication systems, making them a core component of Indo-Pacific undersea deterrence. The Trump administration’s continued backing suggests that Australia’s nuclear propulsion capability development—including the establishment of domestic reactor sustainment facilities—will remain a priority, with an emphasis on workforce training, regulatory harmonization, and classified material handling protocols. Beyond submarines, AUKUS Pillar II expands the scope of allied defense cooperation into multi-domain warfare capabilities, emphasizing the co-development of advanced weapon systems, electronic warfare integration, and AI-enhanced battle networks. One of the primary areas of collaboration involves hypersonic and counter-hypersonic missile systems, where the U.S. is leveraging its experience with the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system and the U.K.’s high-speed glide vehicle research to accelerate Australia’s indigenous long-range strike capability. The Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise, central to AUKUS Pillar II, is focusing on establishing an Australian production line for next-generation munitions, ensuring logistical resilience for long-range precision fires. This includes the joint manufacturing of AGM-158B JASSM-ER, the integration of PrSM (Precision Strike Missile) variants, and potential Australian involvement in DARPA’s Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) successor program. The technological convergence under AUKUS also extends to networked warfare, with a key emphasis on the integration of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)-compliant battle management systems. The U.S. and Australia are working to align their C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) architectures, enabling real-time sensor fusion and multi-domain strike coordination. As part of this effort, AUKUS partners are pursuing a common MQ-28 Ghost Bat autonomy framework, allowing AI-driven sensor-sharing across unmanned platforms, further enhancing distributed lethality concepts within the Indo-Pacific battlespace. Another critical component of AUKUS is force posture realignment, particularly the expansion of U.S. rotational deployments in northern Australia. The U.S. Marine Rotational Force-Darwin (MRF-D) is evolving beyond a training contingent into an expeditionary force with prepositioned stocks of Naval Strike Missiles (NSM), HIMARS rocket artillery systems, and integrated air defense assets. Simultaneously, the enhancement of RAAF Base Tindal and HMAS Stirling as key operational nodes for U.S. and allied SSNs ensures that Australia becomes a strategic hub for undersea warfare operations, supporting not only its own fleet but also forward-deployed U.S. and U.K. assets. The Trump administration’s reaffirmation of AUKUS signals that these basing arrangements will continue, likely accompanied by increased investment in rapid deployment infrastructure, secure data exchange networks, and cross-domain ISR capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/trump-administrations-defense-chief-reaffirms-us-commitment-to-aukus-in-talks-with-australia	2025-01-30T07:19:41-08:00
