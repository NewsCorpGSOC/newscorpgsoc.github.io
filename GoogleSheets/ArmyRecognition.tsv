These vehicles are also expected to provide a counter-battery capability, allowing the Australian Army to strike, neutralize, and destroy enemy artillery systems before they can be used against Australian forces or their allies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/australia-officially-receives-its-first-as9-huntsman-vehicles-from-south-korea	2025-02-04T02:08:58-08:00	
India Expands its Sea-Based Nuclear Deterrence with Commissioning of INS Aridhaman Submarine	India continues to enhance its strategic deterrence capability with the integration of its third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), INS Aridhaman (S4), which is expected to enter service this year after nearly three years of trials. Currently, the Indian Navy operates two SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighat, and this new addition will mark a significant step in the expansion of its strategic submarine fleet. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link INS Arihant, India’s first indigenously built SSBN, was commissioned in August 2016. (Picture source: Indian MoD) INS Arihant, India’s first indigenously built SSBN, was commissioned in August 2016. With a displacement of 6,000 tons, it is powered by an 83 MW pressurized water reactor using enriched uranium. Its induction was a critical milestone, enabling India to establish a credible sea-based nuclear deterrent. Its successor, INS Arighat, was commissioned in August 2024. While retaining the core design of INS Arihant, it incorporates several technological improvements, including enhanced sonar, navigation, stealth capabilities, and fire control systems, making it a more capable platform. INS Aridhaman (S4), the third SSBN in the series, is in its final testing phase and is expected to join the fleet soon. Based on the design of INS Arihant and INS Arighat, it retains the 83 MW reactor but includes multiple technical upgrades derived from operational feedback. According to experts, it features advanced maintenance and safety enhancements to improve reliability and crew efficiency. India's maritime deterrence strategy is driven by the need to counter potential threats in the Indian Ocean. Given the vulnerability of aircraft carriers to long-range ballistic missiles such as China’s Dong Feng-21 and Dong Feng-26, the Indian government has prioritized the development of nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines over acquiring a third aircraft carrier. In this context, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) recently approved the construction of two nuclear-powered attack submarines to reinforce India’s presence in the Indo-Pacific region. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy continues its conventional submarine program with the upcoming commissioning of the sixth Kalvari-class submarine, INS Vagsheer, scheduled for December 2024. Additionally, the construction of three new diesel-attack submarines will commence in collaboration with the French Naval Group to further enhance India’s conventional underwater capabilities. With an increasing presence of Chinese warships in the Indian Ocean—averaging around ten PLA Navy vessels per month—and the anticipated deployment of long-range carrier-based patrols by 2025-26, India is accelerating its naval modernization efforts to safeguard its strategic interests. The integration of new SSBNs and attack submarines underscores New Delhi’s commitment to maintaining a credible deterrence posture and ensuring maritime security in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/india-expands-its-sea-based-nuclear-deterrence-with-commissioning-of-ins-aridhaman-submarine	2025-02-04T01:57:27-08:00	
Flash News: US Trump administration proposes $1 billion arms sale to Israel including bombs and bulldozers	According to information published by American Newspaper 'The Wall Street Journal', on February 3, 2024, the Trump administration has informally notified U.S. Congress of a proposed new arms sale to Israel valued at approximately $1 billion. The sale includes a variety of munitions and heavy equipment, specifically: 4,500 BLU-110 precision-guided bombs, 200 Mk 83 1,000-pound bombs, and Caterpillar D9 bulldozers, with the munitions valued at $700 million and the bulldozers at $300 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Aviation Ordnanceman 2nd Class Marilyn Marquez conducts an inventory of pallets containing MK 83/BLU-110 general-purpose bombs in the hangar bay of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) during an ammunition cross-deck operation with the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71). (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The BLU-110 bomb is a 225 kg (500-pound), precision-guided munition designed to penetrate hardened targets, making it highly effective against structures such as bunkers, command centers, and other fortified military assets. The BLU-110 is part of a broader family of bombs developed for precision strike capabilities, meaning that it can be launched from various aircraft and guided to its target with remarkable accuracy. This bomb uses GPS and inertial guidance systems, ensuring that even in contested environments with jamming or countermeasures, it can still strike its intended target with minimal deviation. The ability to target specific, high-value assets without causing widespread collateral damage is particularly crucial in modern military operations where minimizing civilian casualties is a priority. The Mk 83 bomb, on the other hand, is a much larger, 450 kg (1,000-pound) general-purpose bomb used by the U.S. and Israeli Air Forces for a wider range of tactical missions. Although it is less specialized than the BLU-110, the Mk 83 is designed to be a versatile weapon that can be used against larger or less fortified targets, such as military airfields, supply depots, and vehicle convoys. It is a free-fall bomb that can be equipped with precision-guided fuzes, allowing for accuracy when dropped from high altitudes or at stand-off distances. This bomb’s larger size and payload make it effective for clearing large areas or neutralizing more substantial enemy infrastructure. Both the BLU-110 and Mk 83 bombs are integral to Israel's airstrike capabilities, enhancing its ability to conduct operations against a range of targets with great precision. The BLU-110s, with their smaller size and advanced guidance systems, are particularly useful for surgical strikes in urban environments or against hardened military targets. In contrast, the Mk 83s, with their larger payload, are better suited for larger-scale attacks, such as demolishing military facilities, aircraft hangars, or supply lines. Together, these two types of bombs will greatly expand the Israeli Air Force's operational flexibility, allowing it to respond effectively to a variety of combat scenarios, from targeted strikes against militant leaders to large-scale raids on enemy infrastructure. The Caterpillar D9 bulldozers included in the sale are heavy-duty vehicles that have been adapted for military use by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for a range of engineering tasks. These bulldozers are often used in combat zones to clear obstacles, demolish enemy fortifications, and even construct defensive positions. The D9 has become an iconic piece of military equipment for Israel, particularly in urban warfare or areas with significant defensive structures, such as tunnels used by militant groups in Gaza. These machines are heavily armored to withstand small-arms fire and explosive blasts, allowing them to perform under direct fire without being easily neutralized. They play a critical role in ensuring that Israeli forces can maneuver freely, clear pathways, and neutralize enemy positions in both urban and rural settings. This proposed arms sale is part of broader strategic objectives shared by both nations, particularly in the context of growing regional tensions. Israel faces an increasingly volatile security environment, particularly due to Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East. The U.S. sees Israel as a key partner in countering Iran's destabilizing activities, which include supporting various militant groups across the region. The weapons offered in this sale will provide Israel with additional resources to bolster its defense and maintain its military superiority, which is critical in an area where Israel faces threats from multiple fronts. In addition to countering the influence of Iran, Israel's reliance on precision strikes has made weapons like the BLU-110 and Mk 83 bombs essential in its counterterrorism and defense efforts. These weapons are particularly effective in minimizing collateral damage while targeting military infrastructure, weapons caches, and underground bunkers. As Israel continues its efforts to address asymmetrical threats posed by hostile groups, the ability to strike with accuracy is crucial for its defense strategy. The inclusion of Caterpillar D9 bulldozers in this sale also emphasizes Israel’s need for heavy equipment in modern warfare. These bulldozers are often used in clearing obstacles, constructing defensive barriers, and demolishing enemy fortifications, making them indispensable in urban warfare and operations in areas with entrenched military positions. The D9 bulldozer has been used by the IDF in past operations, particularly in Gaza, where it played a significant role in clearing tunnels used by militants and other combat engineering tasks. While the arms sale has been notified to Congress, it has not yet been finalized. Congress has a 30-day period in which it can raise objections to the sale. However, given the long-standing and strategic relationship between the U.S. and Israel, such objections are unlikely to delay the sale significantly. Past arms sales between the two nations have generally faced little resistance, although some members of Congress may raise concerns about the humanitarian implications of providing advanced weaponry, particularly in the context of ongoing conflicts in the region. The proposed $1 billion arms sale is a clear indication of the U.S.'s continued support for Israel and its efforts to maintain its qualitative military edge in a volatile region. As tensions persist in the Middle East, particularly with the threat posed by Iran and various militant groups, this sale provides Israel with the necessary tools to defend itself and secure its strategic interests. The U.S. and Israel’s military cooperation remains a cornerstone of their partnership, ensuring that Israel remains equipped to address the ever-evolving security challenges it faces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-trump-administration-proposes-1-billion-arms-sale-to-israel-including-bombs-and-bulldozers	2025-02-04T01:50:21-08:00	
Belgium could end a decade without tanks by entering into the European MGCS program	The Arizona agreement, finalized on February 2, 2025, outlines Belgium’s revised defense policy under the newly elected government led by Prime Minister Bart De Wever. While minor modifications may be made, the agreement discusses Belgium's potential participation in the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a Franco-German initiative to develop a next-generation main battle tank (MBT) system. This decision aligns with Belgium's broader defense modernization efforts, which involve increased military spending and engagement in European military projects. It also indicates Belgium's renewed interest in acquiring tanks following the retirement of its last Leopard 1s in 2014.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belgium's potential participation in the MGCS program would require investments in personnel, maintenance infrastructure, and training, as the country retired its last Leopard 1 main battle tanks in 2014. (Picture source: Rheinmetall) In the early post-World War II period, the Belgian Army operated various tanks, beginning with American M4 Sherman models post-World War II, including the M4A1(76)W HVSS, alongside British models. In the early 1950s, Belgium acquired M46 Patton tanks from the United States, which remained in service until the late 1960s. Between 1968 and 1971, Belgium procured 334 Leopard 1 tanks from Germany, distributing them among eight tank regiments and the Armour School. In the 1980s, 132 units were modernized to the Leopard 1A5(BE) standard, incorporating an improved fire control system and thermal imaging. The end of the Cold War led to reductions in the tank fleet, with 128 Leopard 1s sold to Brazil and the remainder retired in 2014. At that time, Belgium focused on mobility, flexibility, and rapid deployability for its armed forces, reducing costs. Consequently, Belgium acquired 242 Piranha IIIC 8×8 vehicles between 2008 and 2015, including 18 Piranha IIC DF90 fire support vehicles armed with a 90mm gun. However, the DF90’s inability to fire planned anti-tank rounds limited its role to infantry support with high-explosive ammunition. Additionally, 32 Piranha IIC DF30 vehicles were scheduled for retrofit with two Spike-MR anti-tank guided missiles each. As a result, by 2023, the Belgian Army lacked main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and air defense systems, operating a fleet primarily composed of wheeled vehicles, including 38 Pandur II reconnaissance vehicles. The withdrawal of heavy armor reduced Belgium’s armored capabilities significantly. During the Cold War, Belgium operated various types of armored vehicles, including German Jagdpanzer Kanone tank destroyers, American M113 and M75 armored personnel carriers, French AMX-13 VTT variants, and British Scorpion and Scimitar CVRTs. Belgium's forces in Germany were scaled down over time, with three brigades under British control in 1946 growing to a force of 150,000 personnel by 1952. By 1970, the Belgian presence was reduced to a single corps with two divisions, and by the end of the Cold War in 1990, it had declined to under 25,000 personnel. In recent years, Belgium has sought to rebuild its army, identifying the absence of heavy armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and air defense systems as capability gaps. The country joined the French Scorpion program in 2017, ordering 60 EBRC Jaguar reconnaissance vehicles and 382 VBMR Griffon armored personnel carriers. Belgium also ordered 19 CAESAR II self-propelled howitzers, with delivery expected between 2026 and 2030. Developed by a consortium comprising France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, the MGCS will not be a single tank but a 'system of systems' integrating crewed and uncrewed vehicles. (Picture source: Hensoldt) From an industrial standpoint, Belgium's potential entry into MGCS coincides with its defense firms’ expanding role in European defense projects. John Cockerill Defense is in the process of acquiring France’s Arquus to strengthen its position in the medium-armored vehicle sector. Meanwhile, FN Herstal has agreements for ammunition production, including a trilateral initiative with France and the Netherlands. Both companies are also involved in the MARTE program, a European research initiative for future MBT technologies. MARTE, which includes 47 European partners, is expected to support the MGCS by advancing armor protection, automated targeting, and firepower capabilities. The MGCS project, launched in 2017, is designed to replace the German Leopard 2 and French Leclerc tanks with a more advanced combat system by 2040. Developed by KNDS, a consortium comprising France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, the MGCS will not be a single tank but a 'system of systems' integrating crewed and uncrewed vehicles. Its development focuses on modularity, better firepower, enhanced protection, and AI-driven battlefield management. However, France and Germany have disagreed on key technical aspects, such as gun caliber, with France advocating for a 140mm system and Germany supporting a 130mm alternative. Industrial competition has contributed to delays, but both governments remain committed to advancing the program as a critical component of European armored forces. As MGCS progresses, discussions about potential new partners, including Italy and Spain, have emerged. While France and Germany remain the primary stakeholders, expanding participation could introduce additional expertise and funding. However, integrating new members requires industrial and political negotiations, as France and Germany have historically maintained control over their defense projects. Therefore, Belgium's potential participation in the MGCS program would require investments in personnel, maintenance infrastructure, and training, alongside negotiations on technology transfer and industrial benefits. For the Belgian Army, joining the MGCS could indicate a long-term commitment to restoring armored capabilities and strengthening its role in European defense. The new Belgian government has also committed to investments in long-range firepower, including multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), which could align with MGCS participation. Options under consideration include the French FLP-T program, the American M142 HIMARS, and the Euro-PULS system from Elbit Systems and KNDS Deutschland. The focus on long-range strike capabilities is part of Belgium’s broader effort to enhance indirect fire and deep-strike capabilities. Alongside the MGCS, Belgium is engaged as an observer in the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) and is considering involvement in the Next Generation Rotary Capacity initiative to develop a replacement for the medium multi-role helicopters currently in service with European armies, such as the AW-101.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/belgium-could-end-a-decade-without-tanks-by-entering-into-the-european-mgcs-program	2025-02-04T01:40:28-08:00	
Saudi Arabia Increases its Military Budget and Reinforces its Leadership in Middle East	Saudi Arabia has announced an increase in its defense budget for 2025, raising military expenditures to $78 billion from $75.8 billion in 2024. This allocation accounts for 21% of the country's public spending and 7.1% of its gross domestic product, according to Ahmad Al-Ohali, Governor of the General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI). The increase follows a consistent growth trend, with an annual average rise of 4.5% since 1960. Saudi Arabia is now among the five largest military budgets globally and remains the leading defense spender in the Arab world. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has undertaken several defense acquisitions and industrial initiatives aimed at modernizing its armed forces and strengthening its military industry (Picture source: US DoD) As one of the world’s largest importers of military equipment, the country continues its strategic shift under Vision 2030, a program launched in 2016 to diversify the economy and enhance domestic industrial capabilities, including in the defense sector. A key objective of this initiative is to localize 50% of defense expenditures by 2030. Ahmad Al-Ohali expressed confidence in achieving this target, stating in February 2024 that the country could even exceed this threshold before the decade’s end. Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has undertaken several defense acquisitions and industrial initiatives aimed at modernizing its armed forces and strengthening its military industry. In February 2024, the country ordered the South Korean Cheongung II air defense system for $3.2 billion. This medium-range missile system complements existing capabilities such as the Patriot and THAAD systems, enhancing national air defense. In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense approved the sale of 220 AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder tactical missiles to Saudi Arabia, valued at $252 million. The agreement includes technical support and training programs to enhance the capabilities of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Additionally, in December 2024, the Spanish shipbuilder Navantia signed a contract with the Saudi Ministry of Defense to build three AVANTE 2200 corvettes for the Royal Saudi Navy. The final vessel is scheduled for delivery by 2028. The project includes crew training and integrated logistical support, with construction expected to generate around four million work hours and create up to 2,000 jobs in Spain. Saudi Arabia has also shown interest in acquiring Rafale F4 fighter aircraft from Dassault Aviation. After encountering difficulties in purchasing 48 Eurofighter Typhoon jets due to a German veto, the country submitted a request for a proposal in October 2023 for 54 Rafale F4 aircraft, marking a possible shift in its procurement strategy. These initiatives align with the broader goals of Vision 2030, which seeks to enhance domestic military production and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. At the World Defense Show 2024 in Riyadh, Ahmad Al-Ohali announced that the localization rate for Saudi Arabia’s defense industry had reached 19.35% by the end of 2023, up from 4% in 2018. This reflects ongoing efforts to develop a self-sufficient defense sector. To support these ambitions, GAMI launched the 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' platform in October 2023, aimed at attracting foreign investment and providing insights into opportunities within the Saudi defense market. In a recent statement, Ahmad Al-Ohali highlighted 74 identified opportunities in the country’s military supply chains, with 30 prioritized projects accounting for approximately 80% of future procurement expenditures. Saudi Arabia continues to position itself as a key player in the global defense industry while advancing its strategic objective of reducing reliance on foreign defense suppliers. The expansion of its military sector remains a central element of its broader economic and geopolitical transformation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/saudi-arabia-increases-its-military-budget-and-reinforces-its-leadership-in-middle-east	2025-02-04T01:15:46-08:00	
Colombia Signs New Defense Contract with Israel for Kfir Aircraft	In contrast to previous statements by Colombian President Gustavo Petro regarding the suspension of defense and security relations with Israel, the Colombian government has finally concluded a new contract with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) for the maintenance of its Kfir fighter aircraft fleet. Infodefensa reported This on February 3, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Kfir is a fighter aircraft developed by Israel Aerospace Industries based on the Dassault Mirage 5 and the IAI Nesher. (Picture source: Colombian MoD) According to information obtained from specialized sources, the agreement—officially listed under contract number 260-00-A-Cofac-Codaf-2024—amounts to USD 7.2 million. It took effect on December 27, 2024, and will remain valid until July 30, 2026. Under this agreement, IAI will provide scheduled and unscheduled maintenance services for the Colombian Air Force’s (FAC) Kfir C10/12 COA aircraft. The FAC will deploy a team of 44 specialized technicians from Combat Air Command No. 1, covering various fields of expertise such as airframes, armament, engines, avionics, electronics, and overall planning.

Exclusive: US Army to Procure 689 M109A7 Howitzers Through 2050 as Part of Major Artillery Modernization Effort	According to a recent report published by the U.S. Department of Defense on military program acquisitions for Fiscal Year 2025, the U.S. Army has outlined a significant plan to procure 689 M109A7 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzers (SPH) and sustain them through 2050. This move is a cornerstone of the U.S. Army's broader modernization effort to upgrade its artillery capabilities. The M109A7, part of the Paladin Integrated Management (PIM) program, will play a central role in enhancing indirect fire support for the U.S. Army's armored and mechanized infantry divisions over the next several decades. This procurement is part of a long-term strategy to modernize the U.S. Army's artillery fleet and fill a critical capability gap left by the cancellation of the Non-Line of Sight Cannon (NLOS-C) program in 2009.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. soldiers from the North Carolina National Guard’s 1st Battalion, 113th Field Artillery Regiment, conduct live-fire exercises with the newly fielded M109A7 Self-Propelled Howitzers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on May 20, 2021 (Picture source: US. DoD) The U.S. Army uses a two-increment approach to upgrade and modernize the M109 155mm howitzer fleet. The first phase of the modernization effort focuses on improving the mobility of the M109A7 155mm tracked self-propelled howitzer, ensuring that the system can operate effectively across various terrains in diverse combat environments. This upgrade is essential for maintaining battlefield flexibility and survivability. The second phase of the M109A7 upgrade will address key areas such as lethality, range, and reliability, providing the U.S. Army with a more powerful and dependable artillery system. These enhancements are crucial as the U.S. Army seeks to maintain its edge in an evolving battlefield where firepower and accuracy are key to success.

Lockheed Martin Strengthens US-UK Nuclear Deterrence Until 2084 with Trident II D5LE2	Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $383 million contract by the U.S. Navy to develop a modernized version of the Trident II nuclear ballistic missile, designated Trident II D5 Life Extension 2 (D5LE2). This program aims to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the strategic deterrence system deployed aboard ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) through 2084. The missile remains a key component of the deterrence posture of both the United States and the United Kingdom, which cooperate in this field under the Polaris Sales Agreement. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The D5LE2 modernization seeks to extend its operational lifespan while maintaining performance in response to evolving threats (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The Trident II D5 is currently in service on U.S. Ohio-class and British Vanguard-class submarines. Designed and developed by Lockheed Martin, this submarine-launched ballistic missile has a range exceeding 12,000 km and is capable of carrying multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Until now, Trident II missiles have been equipped with W76 and W88 nuclear warheads, but their service life, exceeding 25 years, has raised concerns regarding reliability and safety. The D5LE2 modernization seeks to extend their operational lifespan while maintaining performance in response to evolving threats. The upgrade includes improvements to the missile’s guidance and propulsion systems. With its three-stage solid-fuel propulsion, the Trident II D5 achieves rapid acceleration and a trajectory designed to evade interception. Its inertial guidance system, enhanced with electronic upgrades, contributes to increased accuracy. The Trident II has also been considered for conventional applications under the Prompt Global Strike program, which aimed to provide the United States with a rapid, non-nuclear strike capability. This initiative sought to equip certain Trident missiles with modified reentry vehicles featuring GPS navigation and trajectory correction systems, enabling an impact precision of approximately ten meters. However, the proposal generated significant international debate, with concerns that such a launch could be mistaken for a nuclear attack, potentially triggering an unintended response. The program was ultimately discontinued, but in 2018, the U.S. administration approved the production of the W76-2, a low-yield warhead specifically designed for Trident missiles. Its deployment was officially confirmed in 2020, with initial operational integration aboard USS Tennessee. To support the production and integration of D5LE2 components, Lockheed Martin has initiated the construction of a new production facility in Titusville, Florida. Covering approximately 21,000 square meters, the site will expand the company's presence on the Space Coast, a key aerospace industry hub. Scheduled to be operational by 2027, the facility is expected to create approximately 300 high-skilled jobs. Florida state authorities, represented by Secretary of Commerce J. Alex Kelly, have emphasized the economic significance of this investment in strengthening the region’s defense and aerospace industries. This contract is part of a broader effort to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded Lockheed Martin Space a $2.1 billion contract for the production and sustainment of Trident II D5 missiles, as well as the development of new W93 nuclear warheads and their Mk7 reentry vehicles. These warheads, currently under development at Los Alamos National Laboratory, mark the first new U.S. nuclear weapons production initiative in 40 years. These programs reflect the ongoing commitment of the United States and the United Kingdom to maintaining technological and strategic capabilities in nuclear deterrence. Lockheed Martin, which this year marks 70 years of collaboration with the U.S. Navy under the Fleet Ballistic Missiles program, continues to play a central role in the evolution of strategic missile systems. With the Trident II D5LE2, both nations are ensuring the continued credibility and effectiveness of their deterrence posture in the decades ahead.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/lockheed-martin-strengthens-us-uk-nuclear-deterrence-until-2084-with-trident-ii-d5le2	2025-02-03T06:06:06-08:00

Malaysia awaits final US approval to complete the purchase of 30 F/A-18 Hornet fighters from Kuwait	As reported by Astro Awani on February 1, 2025, the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) is expected to finalize the acquisition of 30 used F/A-18C/D Hornet fighter jets from the Kuwaiti Air Force (KAF) in 2025. The deal has been under negotiation for several years and is now in its final stages, requiring only documentation and approvals from Kuwait and the United States. This purchase is intended to maintain Malaysia’s air defense capabilities while awaiting the implementation of its Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) program, projected to commence in the 15th Malaysia Plan around 2040.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F/A-18C is a single-seat variant, while the F/A-18D is a two-seat version configurable for training or as an all-weather strike aircraft with a Weapons and Sensors Officer operating targeting systems. (Picture source: US DoD) Malaysia’s interest in acquiring the Kuwaiti Hornets dates back to at least 2017, when the country first explored options to supplement its fighter fleet. The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) currently operates eight two-seat F/A-18D Hornets, acquired in 1997, under the 18th Squadron at Butterworth Air Base. Over the years, these aircraft have undergone upgrades to avionics, communications, and weapons systems, including the integration of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and the Link 16 datalink. The MRCA program, originally intended to modernize Malaysia’s air combat capabilities, has faced delays, making the interim acquisition of the Kuwaiti Hornets a temporary solution. Kuwait operates 39 F/A-18C/D Hornets, delivered between 1992 and 1993, as part of its air force modernization following the Gulf War. The country is transitioning to newer aircraft, including the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter Typhoon, leading to the decision to sell its older Hornet fleet. Malaysia officially expressed interest in these aircraft during a visit by Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin to Kuwait in October 2024. During the visit, Khaled inspected the aircraft and held discussions with Kuwaiti officials, resulting in the establishment of a joint committee to expedite the negotiation process. The sale remains contingent on approval from the United States, as the aircraft are American-made. One of the primary reasons for Malaysia’s acquisition is the need to address capability gaps in its air force while awaiting the MRCA program. The RMAF has faced maintenance and operational challenges, particularly with its Sukhoi Su-30MKM fleet, which has been affected by serviceability issues due to logistical constraints. Expanding the Hornet fleet is seen as a way to sustain operational capability without further delays. The relatively low flight hours and well-maintained condition of the Kuwaiti Hornets make them a viable option for extending Malaysia’s fighter fleet while offering an opportunity to standardize maintenance and operations. The acquisition has encountered challenges, including the requirement for approval from the United States, which has also considered the Kuwaiti Hornets for its Marine Corps. Tunisia has reportedly expressed interest in purchasing the same aircraft, creating potential competition. The process of securing U.S. authorization has caused delays, though Malaysian officials anticipate a resolution. Another challenge is the logistical and maintenance burden associated with operating an aging fleet. While Malaysia’s existing Hornets have been upgraded, the Kuwaiti models belong to an earlier production block, which may lead to compatibility issues with spare parts and software integration. Expanding the fleet with older aircraft may also impact operational budgets and maintenance capacity. The F/A-18C and F/A-18D Hornet are twin-engine, carrier-capable multirole fighter aircraft developed in 1987 as part of a block upgrade of the original F/A-18 Hornet, which was initially designed in the 1970s. The upgrade incorporated enhanced radar, avionics, and expanded weapons compatibility, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM, AGM-84E SLAM, and AGM-65F Maverick missiles. The F/A-18C is a single-seat variant, while the F/A-18D is a two-seat version configurable for training or as an all-weather strike aircraft with a Weapons and Sensors Officer operating targeting systems. The aircraft includes the Martin-Baker NACES ejection seat, a self-protection jammer, and a synthetic aperture radar for ground mapping in low-visibility conditions. Models delivered since 1989 feature improved night attack capabilities with the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, AN/AAS-38A NITE Hawk FLIR targeting pod, night vision compatibility, and upgraded multi-function displays. Some F/A-18D aircraft are configured for reconnaissance with the ATARS electro-optical sensor package. The aircraft are powered by two F404-GE-402 enhanced performance engines, increasing static thrust by 10%. Since 1993, they have included a laser designator/ranger for self-marking and targeting. Production ended in 2000, with the last F/A-18C delivered to Finland and the final F/A-18D to the U.S. Marine Corps. The U.S. Navy retired its F/A-18C/D fleet in 2019, but the U.S. Marine Corps continues to operate and upgrade its aircraft, integrating the APG-79(V)4 AESA radar system.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/malaysia-awaits-final-us-approval-to-complete-the-purchase-of-30-f-a-18-hornet-fighters-from-kuwait	2025-02-03T03:51:55-08:00	
France Turns to Its Automotive Industry for Military Drone Production	Amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising tensions in Europe, France is seeking to adapt its defense industry to meet new battlefield requirements. Traditionally characterized by slow production cycles focused on high-performance equipment, the sector now faces the challenge of increasing both speed and volume. To address this, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) is exploring new solutions by turning to the civilian industry, particularly the automotive sector, for the manufacturing of so-called 'kamikaze' drones similar to those used in Ukraine, according to a report by L'Opinion on February 2, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Colibri is a loitering munition drone specially adapted for short-range missions (Picture source: Army Recognition) These long-range remotely operated munitions (MTO), capable of striking targets over 100 kilometers away, could be produced by a yet undisclosed French industrial company. No firm orders have been placed at this stage, but the stated objective is clear: to deliver several thousand of these drones within a few months. This initiative marks a shift in France’s defense production model, which for decades has prioritized high-tech equipment, designed through lengthy and meticulous processes, rather than rapid large-scale manufacturing. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the limitations of this approach, exposing the difficulties of adapting to the demands of high-intensity conflict. 'This was not a criterion for us for decades,' acknowledges Emmanuel Chiva, the General Delegate for Armaments, emphasizing the need for a structural change. In response, the DGA is expanding its scope and looking to leverage expertise from other industries such as chemicals, energy, and even the agri-food sector, all accustomed to high-volume production. This shift is not entirely new. During World War I, Michelin produced aircraft while Renault manufactured tanks. Today, despite a relative state of peace, France faces growing strategic challenges, yet its defense industry still operates under a model favoring technological excellence over production speed and scale. The Rafale fighter jet, submarines, and the nuclear deterrent exemplify this approach, where emphasis has historically been placed on high performance, often at the cost of extended production timelines and significant expenses. However, modern conflicts require greater responsiveness, and this model is struggling to meet those needs. In June 2022, President Emmanuel Macron called for a transition to a 'war economy', a shift that has yet to be fully realized. Some notable progress has been made. Nexter, for example, has increased its production of 155mm shells sixtyfold since 2022, while Dassault Aviation is gradually reaching a production rate of three Rafale jets per month, compared to just one a decade ago. MBDA, meanwhile, is reducing the production time of the Aster air defense missile from 42 to 18 months by 2026. Despite these improvements, these lead times remain lengthy in the context of high-intensity warfare, where the rapid replenishment of equipment is crucial. Aware of this challenge, Emmanuel Chiva has suggested new approaches, including the development of *'low-cost'* surface-to-air missile designs to accelerate their production. This initiative aims to foster innovation among defense manufacturers and the 4,500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that form the backbone of the defense sector. The goal is to move away from a purely stock-based approach, where equipment ordered in batches reaches obsolescence simultaneously, toward a continuous supply system better suited to operational needs. The integration of the automotive industry into drone production aligns with this broader effort to adapt to evolving strategic conditions. By leveraging the civilian sector’s expertise in rapid and large-scale manufacturing, the DGA aims to meet the growing demand for military equipment. If this initiative is successfully implemented, it could lead to a significant transformation in how France designs and produces its defense systems. However, this transition toward a more agile and responsive defense industry raises several critical questions: the adaptation of industrial standards, the maintenance of quality requirements, and the state’s ability to swiftly scale up production in a crisis. In an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape, the success of this transformation will be a key test of France’s strategic resilience.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/france-turns-to-its-automotive-industry-for-military-drone-production	2025-02-03T03:19:48-08:00

Philippines Plans Acquisition of Fast Attack Interdiction Craft with Missiles to Strengthen Maritime Defense	The Philippine Navy is advancing with its project to acquire Fast Attack Interdiction Crafts with Missiles (FAIC-M) as part of Phase 2 of the Re-Horizon 3 modernization program under the Revised Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program (RAFPMP). The project outlines the acquisition of 10 new fast attack interdiction crafts equipped with missile systems to enhance the country’s defense and security capabilities in its littoral zones, particularly in the sensitive tri-border areas with Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as in the South China Sea, including the Kalayaan Island Group. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Philippine Navy is advancing with its project to acquire Fast Attack Interdiction Crafts with Missiles. (Picture source: Philippines Navy) This initiative follows the Philippine Navy’s ongoing efforts to modernize its fleet, which includes the retirement of the Tomas Batilo-class fast attack crafts, a South Korean version of the Chamsuri-class, which have been out of active service since 2021. The acquisition of these new boats, designed to strengthen the Navy’s effectiveness in rapid interdiction and defense operations, aligns with the broader goals of the modernization program. The new FAIC-M boats are expected to be equipped with advanced systems, including the Rafael Typhoon Mk.30C remote-controlled weapon station armed with a 30mm Mk.44 Bushmaster II autocannon, and the Typhoon MLS-NLOS missile launcher, capable of launching short-range surface-to-surface Spike-NLOS missiles. The acquisition plan, signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2024, allocates a total budget of 16 billion pesos for the procurement of the 10 new boats, an increase from the 10 billion pesos allocated in 2020 for the initial acquisition of nine boats. This budget increase accounts for inflation, as well as the cost of local construction of the boats at the Philippine Navy’s Naval Shipyard in Cavite, in addition to the increased number of missile systems and spare parts required. Phase 2 of the project is also expected to include the acquisition of weapons, ammunition, and potentially system integration, with separate contracts likely to be signed for the boats, weapons systems, and ammunition. Despite the approval of the funding plan, the project was not included in the programmed funding for 2025 under the AFP Modernization Program due to budget cuts. However, there is potential for financing through the Unprogrammed Fund, contingent on additional financial support from the national government. Alternatively, the Philippine Navy may use its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) funding for FY2025, which requires only an initial 10% commitment to initiate the project. Given that the Philippine Navy already operates Shaldag Mk. V fast attack crafts, locally known as the Acero-class fast attack interdiction craft, it is expected that the additional units will follow the same design and be equipped with the same advanced weapon systems. These upgrades will ensure that the Philippine Navy’s Littoral Combat Force maintains operational readiness and effectively responds to growing security threats in its maritime zones.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/philippines-plans-acquisition-of-fast-attack-interdiction-craft-with-missiles-to-strengthen-maritime-defense	2025-02-03T02:49:55-08:00

The Spyder-MR system includes Python-5 infrared-guided missiles with a short-range capability of up to 12 km and Derby radar-guided missiles for medium-range engagements up to 50 km. Each battery consists of a command-and-control unit, three missile firing units, support vehicles for resupply, and radar systems. The Philippine variant employs different radar configurations than the standard version, potentially integrating IAI Elta’s EL/M-2138M Green Rock AESA radar and the EL/M-2106 ATAR 3D radar. The procurement includes a missile maintenance facility within the Philippines for sustainment. This acquisition was part of Horizon 2 of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program, which includes air defense enhancements. The Spyder-MR system serves as a secondary air defense layer alongside the FA-50PH fighter aircraft. In April 2023, the PAF established the SPADS Simulator-Training Center at Basa Air Base to train personnel in radar detection, command and control, and missile engagement. The Philippines is the third country in Southeast Asia, after Singapore and Vietnam, to operate the Spyder air defense system. The Spyder (Surface-to-air Python and Derby) system was developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with subsystems from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Development began in the early 2000s, with a test in 2005 at Shdema, Israel, where Python-5 and Derby missiles intercepted targets. Rafael is the prime contractor, while IAI supplies radar and integration components. The system is designed for short- and medium-range interception and has been exhibited at defense industry events. It is mounted on different truck platforms for mobile air defense. The Spyder has four main variants: Spyder-SR (Short Range), Spyder-ER (Extended Range), Spyder-MR (Medium Range), and Spyder-LR (Long Range). The SR and ER models use an inclined, rotatable launcher, while the MR and LR versions use a vertical launcher. The system’s interception range varies, with Spyder-SR reaching up to 15 km and Spyder-LR extending to 80 km. It uses Python-5 infrared-homing missiles and Derby active radar-guided missiles. The Spyder-MR and Spyder-LR variants integrate the EL/M-2084 Multi-Mission Radar, which can track multiple targets. In 2023, Rafael announced that the Derby LR missile had been upgraded to engage tactical ballistic missiles. The system is designed for all-weather operations and can be integrated into a networked air defense structure. The Spyder is in service with multiple countries, including India, Singapore, Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, the Philippines, and the Czech Republic. India acquired 18 Spyder-MR systems with Python-5 and Derby missiles. The Czech Republic signed a $627 million contract for four Spyder batteries to replace Soviet-era 2K12 Kub systems, with deliveries expected by 2026. Ethiopia reportedly deployed Spyder-MR for infrastructure protection, including at the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Reports indicate Georgia may have operated the Spyder-SR during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, though there is no official confirmation. Romania is also evaluating the Spyder system alongside other options for a potential procurement.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/philippine-marine-corps-could-purchase-israeli-spyder-air-defense-missile-system-to-protect-key-military-installations	2025-02-03T02:43:38-08:00

US Navy Transforms Naval Protection with Helios Laser's Power on USS Preble at Sea	In its 2024 report, the U.S. Office of the Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation released an image of the USS Preble (DDG-88) deploying its HELIOS laser weapon system at sea. This image, one of the clearest in recent years, highlights the growing importance of this technology in Washington’s strategic vision. The HELIOS system (High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance) marks a significant transition from theoretically directed energy weapons to their concrete and operational application on the battlefield. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link he U.S. Navy’s Center for Countermeasures (CCM) supervised demonstrations in which the system successfully engaged unmanned aerial targets, validating its functional and operational performance (Picture source: US Navy) Developed by Lockheed Martin, HELIOS reflects the U.S. Navy’s commitment to integrating directed energy weapons into its fleet to enhance defense capabilities against modern threats. This system combines a high-energy laser, an optical dazzler, and an advanced surveillance capability, providing a layered defense approach that allows targets to be physically neutralized and their sensors disrupted. The Navy aims to counter threats such as drones, fast attack craft, and potentially short-range missiles. The HELIOS program was initiated in 2018 with an initial $150 million contract awarded to Lockheed Martin for development, manufacturing, and delivery of two systems—one for land-based testing and another for naval integration. After successfully passing its Critical Design Review in 2020, sea trials began in 2021 at Wallops Island, Virginia. The USS Preble was the first Arleigh Burke-class destroyer to be equipped with the system, marking a key milestone in the adoption of directed energy weapons within the U.S. Navy. HELIOS operates at an initial power of 60 kilowatts, with the potential to scale up to 120 kilowatts depending on operational needs. Unlike conventional ammunition-based systems, this laser weapon provides a key operational advantage: virtually unlimited firing capacity as long as power is available. This reduces logistical constraints related to ammunition resupply and extends the ship’s operational endurance, particularly in scenarios where resupply options may be limited. Beyond its destructive capability, the system includes an optical dazzler designed to temporarily blind or disable enemy surveillance sensors, adding a strategic advantage in reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance operations. Its integration with the Aegis combat system allows for seamless coordination with other defensive measures, enhancing overall combat effectiveness. HELIOS has undergone rigorous testing. The U.S. Navy’s Center for Countermeasures (CCM) supervised demonstrations in which the system successfully engaged unmanned aerial targets, validating its functional and operational performance. In FY24, CCM conducted 32 test events to evaluate airborne countermeasures, counter-unmanned aircraft systems, and the development and assessment of directed energy weapons as potential countermeasures. Additionally, CCM partnered with allied forces to advance the development and testing of infrared and radio frequency countermeasures. The integration of HELIOS aboard the USS Preble is only the first step. The U.S. Navy plans to expand the use of directed energy weapons to other vessels, including more powerful systems such as the 150-kilowatt Laser Weapon System Demonstrator (LWSD), already deployed on select ships. This expansion aligns with a broader military strategy aimed at developing cost-effective defense solutions tailored to evolving asymmetric threats. The HELIOS system is designed to protect naval assets from various threats, including drones, fast attack craft, and cruise missiles. It combines a high-energy laser capable of physically destroying targets with an optical dazzler to disrupt or disable enemy sensors. Additionally, it provides advanced surveillance and intelligence capabilities, enhancing situational awareness for operators. Among its competitors, the Israeli-developed 'Iron Beam' system is designed to intercept drones, rockets, and mortar shells at a lower cost per engagement. Similarly, South Korea recently introduced the 'Block-I' system, a 100-kilowatt laser weapon designed to counter drones and other aerial threats. Other nations, including China, Russia, and Germany, are also investing in this technology, highlighting the growing global competition in directed energy-based defense systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navy-transforms-naval-protection-with-helios-lasers-power-on-uss-preble-at-sea	2025-02-03T01:39:00-08:00	
Exclusive | Belgium could purchase rocket launcher systems to modernize its artillery capabilities	The Arizona agreement, finalized on February 2, 2025, marks a shift in Belgium’s defense policy under the new government led by Prime Minister Bart De Wever. Presented to the King late on Friday evening, the agreement outlines a plan to increase defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2029 and 2.5% by 2034. This financial trajectory aims to expand Belgium’s military capabilities, modernize its forces, and align its commitments with NATO and EU security objectives. While the finalized document remains subject to minor modifications, it establishes a framework for national defense readiness, including the country's potential first MLRS purchase.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Belgian Air Force played a key role in the first-ever A400M HIRAIN (HIMARS Rapid Infiltration) mission in July 2024, when an M142 system was deployed by Belgium’s 20th Squadron Tactical Airlift. (Picture source: US DoD) A key element of the Arizona agreement is the establishment of a Defense Fund, which will serve as the primary mechanism for channeling resources into military modernization. Managed as a subsidiary of the state-owned SFPIM (Société Fédérale de Participations et d’Investissement), the fund will be supported through asset transfers to ensure a structured model for long-term investments. The government seeks to secure industrial returns from defense contracts by fostering domestic manufacturing, research, and development. Belgian defense firms will be integrated into procurement programs to support technological advancements and economic activity. Belgium is increasing its defense R&amp;D budget, allocating at least 2% of total defense expenditures to technological advancements. Collaborative initiatives with European partners, including potential participation in the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) and future air combat platforms, are under consideration. Belgium’s air force modernization plan includes investments in new fighter aircraft, an expanded transport fleet, and enhanced electronic warfare and counter-drone capabilities. Plans for an operational helicopter fleet aim to improve rotary-wing missions in national and coalition operations. Transport aviation will be reinforced through the procurement of smaller, tactical platforms to supplement heavy airlift capabilities. Air defense investments focus on radar systems, air surveillance, and electronic warfare measures to enhance airspace protection. The potential expansion of Belgium’s F-35 fleet is under discussion as the government reassesses previous procurement limitations. While the prior administration capped the order at 34 aircraft, NATO had recommended a larger fleet to meet air combat requirements. The current proposal, previously supported by the new Defense Minister, Theo Francken, considers acquiring additional F-35s to improve operational effectiveness. This expansion aligns with Belgium’s objective of reaching NATO’s 2% GDP defense spending benchmark by 2029 while maintaining interoperability with allied air forces. Increasing the number of F-35s would strengthen Belgium’s role in NATO air defense missions. Belgium is modernizing its ground forces within the CaMo program, focusing on improvements in firepower, logistics, and operational mobility. The army plans to introduce new platforms to enhance deep-strike capabilities, integrating multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS). Stockpiles of essential military equipment will be expanded, and an additional brigade for NATO operations is under consideration. The initiative prioritizes advanced technologies and cooperation with European allies to develop next-generation combat capabilities. Given Belgium’s plans to procure more American fighter jets and its efforts to stimulate the domestic defense industry by prioritizing local manufacturing and technology development, the possibility of Belgium opting for American MLRS systems remains significant. This is particularly relevant given that a Trump election victory could lead to increased purchases of American equipment, alongside indications tied to both the Belgian defense industry and Belgium’s previous international exercises. Thales Belgium has indicated that the US-made M270 MLRS can be configured to fire its 70mm rockets in a 9x6 array, which may align with Belgium’s interest in a system capable of launching both guided and unguided munitions. Given Belgium’s procurement strategy and industrial policies, selecting a modular MLRS with NATO-standardized ammunition would align with strategic objectives. The M270 MLRS, widely used by NATO allies, supports interoperability and the use of GMLRS, ER-GMLRS, and Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) for long-range engagements. An alternative under consideration is the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), a wheeled variant offering greater mobility compared to the tracked M270. HIMARS can launch the same range of guided munitions but is designed for rapid deployment and integration with mechanized and airborne units. Several European countries, including Poland and Romania, have already acquired HIMARS, underscoring its growing role in NATO’s artillery capabilities. Belgium’s potential procurement of either system would mark a significant step toward reinforcing its deep-strike capabilities, aligning with NATO’s push for increased long-range fire support among member states. Furthermore, the Belgian Air Force played a key role in the first-ever A400M HIRAIN (HIMARS Rapid Infiltration) mission in July 2024, when an M142 system was deployed by Belgium’s 20th Squadron Tactical Airlift, 15th Wing, during the Winter Shield exercise with U.S. and Latvian forces. Beyond air and ground force modernization, Belgium is allocating resources to naval expansion, unmanned systems, and cyber defense. The navy is set to acquire a third frigate and additional mine countermeasure vessels to support NATO maritime security operations. Investments in autonomous and remotely operated systems aim to improve underwater threat detection and neutralization. Belgium is expanding its drone fleet, integrating surveillance and combat-capable systems across multiple service branches to enhance reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, and precision-strike capabilities. Cyber warfare and electronic defense capabilities are being developed as part of Belgium’s modernization efforts. The government is strengthening cyber resilience, AI-driven defense applications, and electronic warfare tools. Military mobility investments include upgrades to transportation infrastructure, strategic landing capabilities, and specialized rail transport to support rapid deployments. Belgium is coordinating with NATO and EU partners to ensure interoperability and optimize logistical operations for allied forces in Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-belgium-could-purchase-rocket-launcher-systems-to-modernize-its-artillery-capabilities	2025-02-03T01:21:10-08:00	
Flash News: US Strikes Terrorist Group in Somalia Marking First Operation of Trump Administration	On February 1, 2025, U.S. forces launched a series of airstrikes in northern Somalia, targeting members of the Islamic State's (ISIS) affiliate in the region. This operation, announced by U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, marks the first major military action in Somalia under the Trump administration's second term. It follows a pattern of increased U.S. military engagement in Africa, especially during Donald Trump’s first presidency, when the U.S. conducted extensive airstrike campaigns aimed at dismantling terrorist groups in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 1 conducts routine flight operations from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The strikes took place in the Puntland region, specifically within the Gholis mountain range, a known stronghold for ISIS in Somalia. AFRICOM confirmed that multiple ISIS operatives were killed, though it did not provide specific details about the individuals targeted. In a statement, President Donald Trump referenced the operation, noting that it was aimed at eliminating a senior ISIS planner operating in the area. This targeted action aligns with ongoing U.S. efforts to combat ISIS and other terror groups, such as Al-Shabaab, that have taken root in Somalia and the broader Horn of Africa. The military assets involved in this operation were not explicitly detailed by AFRICOM, but photos accompanying the announcement indicated that Carrier Air Wing 1, operating from the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75), played a key role. The Harry S. Truman, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier based at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, has been operating in the Red Sea and the waters surrounding Yemen and Somalia. This deployment is part of broader U.S. military efforts to combat regional instability, particularly the threat posed by the Houthi movement in Yemen. The Carrier Air Wing 1 includes several key squadrons, such as Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), flying the F/A-18F; Strike Fighter Squadron 143 (VFA-143) and Strike Fighter Squadron 81 (VFA-81), both flying the F/A-18E; and Electronic Attack Squadron 144 (VAQ-144), operating the EA-18G Growler for electronic warfare. Additionally, Airborne Command and Control Squadron 126 (VAW-126), flying the E-2D Hawkeye, and several other support and attack squadrons from Naval Air Station Oceana and Naval Station Norfolk were involved in the operation, enhancing the Harry S. Truman’s capability to project power in the region. The U.S. Navy’s regional presence is further bolstered by the USS Gettysburg (CG-64), a guided-missile cruiser, and multiple destroyers, including the USS Stout (DDG-55), USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109), and USS The Sullivans (DDG-68). These vessels are part of Destroyer Squadron 28, based at Naval Station Norfolk, and have been integral to the broader counterterrorism and counter-piracy missions in the region. Additionally, the Ohio-class guided-missile submarine, USS Georgia (SSGN-729), operating in the Middle East, has played a critical role in the naval presence, carrying 154 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles and special operations forces for precision strikes. This airstrike highlights the ongoing U.S. commitment to countering ISIS and other terrorist factions in Somalia, a country that has long struggled with instability. The operation in Puntland is a clear signal that the U.S. is willing to intensify its military efforts under the Trump administration to protect American and allied interests in Africa. It also underscores the strategic importance of the Horn of Africa, both in terms of counterterrorism operations and as a key maritime corridor for global trade. The involvement of the USS Harry S.

French Army Explores New Logistic Approach in Contested Zones with Airbus A400M Supply Glider Airdrop Tests	The Airbus A400M Atlas, already tested for drone airdrops, is set to explore a new logistical capability with the deployment of supply gliders. Faced with the limitations of traditional parachute drops, which require aircraft to fly directly over the landing zone and expose them to surface-to-air threats, the French Army is seeking to improve supply delivery in contested areas. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The A400M Atlas, a military transport aircraft designed for both strategic and tactical missions, serves as an ideal platform for integrating this glider (Picture source: French MoD) The concept involves a disposable glider that can be dropped at a distance and autonomously travel several dozen kilometers before reaching its target with high precision. Released from an altitude of 24,000 to 30,000 feet and more than 80 km from the landing point, this system would provide a safer and more flexible alternative for resupply in hostile environments. The project is currently the subject of a call for expressions of interest issued by the French Directorate General of Armaments’ aerospace innovation center (DGA/Techniques Aérospatiales IDEA3), with a submission deadline set for March 12. The A400M Atlas, a military transport aircraft designed for both strategic and tactical missions, serves as an ideal platform for integrating this glider. With a payload capacity of up to 35 tons, it can transport armored vehicles, helicopters, or up to 116 equipped paratroopers. Its range of 4,700 nautical miles allows it to reach distant operational theaters without refueling, while its four TP400-D6 engines, each producing 11,600 horsepower, provide high-performance capabilities. The A400M is also designed to operate from unprepared runways, a key feature for supporting forces deployed in difficult terrain. Its advanced avionics and automatic terrain-following system, a first for a transport aircraft, enable it to fly at very low altitudes and perform precise airdrops in contested environments. The supply glider must be fully autonomous, following a preprogrammed flight path after release. It must cover a distance of 70 to 80 km while carrying a payload of 700 kg, with a minimum volume of one cubic meter, expandable to 1.5 cubic meters depending on operational needs. The system must allow for serial deployment, with at least two units released simultaneously, requiring secure integration in the A400M’s cargo hold to ensure stable restraint and safe deployment. Designed as a disposable asset, it will not be recovered but must ensure the intact delivery of its cargo. Landing capability must be controlled, whether on dry or wet terrain, with a vertical impact speed below 9 m/s to preserve the payload’s condition and facilitate its rapid recovery by ground forces. This project represents a significant development in military airborne logistics, providing an alternative to traditional parachute drops while reducing transport aircraft exposure to hostile threats. By enabling a more flexible and secure resupply method, it could meet the needs of forces operating in contested environments, particularly when ground access is obstructed. The integration of such a system within the French Army would enhance operational resilience and responsiveness while optimizing air assets for logistical missions. Similar systems already exist, notably in the United States, where the Silent Arrow GD-2000, an autonomous and disposable supply glider, is designed for deployment from C-130 or CH-47 aircraft. The JPADS (Joint Precision Airdrop System), a GPS-guided parachute, is also used for precision supply drops. However, the French glider would distinguish itself by its integration with the A400M, enabling serial airdrops and optimized material delivery over longer distances. By leveraging the glider’s autonomous flight capability and the A400M’s high-altitude drop capacity, the French Army could benefit from an innovative solution that significantly enhances airborne logistical operations. If successfully developed, this project could transform resupply capabilities by offering a reliable and autonomous method for delivering cargo to difficult or conflict-affected areas. This technology could also pave the way for future innovations in military transport and logistics, with potential applications in humanitarian missions, such as delivering medical supplies or essential resources in crisis situations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/french-army-explores-new-logistic-approach-in-contested-zones-with-airbus-a400m-supply-glider-airdrop-tests	2025-02-03T00:54:32-08:00

Initial soldier feedback was characterized as 'not overwhelmingly positive,' with officials suggesting that 'results from the lab environment and test ranges are very different from the tactical environment.' This feedback suggests that while the system may have shown potential in controlled testing, it faced challenges in real-world operational conditions. The U.S. Army continues to refine this technology, with a decision on a future Enduring High Energy Laser (HEL) system slated for 2026. The M-SHORAD system itself is a key part of the U.S. Army's short-range air defense strategy, designed to provide air defense against low-altitude threats, including rotary-wing aircraft, fixed-wing UAVs, and short-range ballistic missiles. The U.S. Army has been developing the system in increments, with each phase offering increased capabilities to meet evolving threats. Initially, the U.S. Army planned to field 144 M-SHORAD Increment 1 systems across four battalions, each equipped with 40 units, as well as support vehicles and personnel. The first systems were delivered to the 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment in 2021, with full operational capability achieved by late 2022. By 2024, the U.S. Army had started to deliver additional M-SHORAD systems as part of the planned expansion of the fleet. These deliveries were integral to the Army’s ongoing efforts to build up its air defense capabilities, ensuring that each battalion is fully equipped with the necessary vehicles, radar systems, and armament. In total, the U.S. Army intends to procure up to 162 M-SHORAD systems, with plans to expand the fleet to as many as 361 systems, depending on future decisions. The additional systems being delivered in 2024 are part of this ongoing expansion, aiming to improve the Army’s ability to counter low-altitude air threats in both domestic and overseas deployments. The M-SHORAD Increment 1, based on the M1126 Stryker combat vehicle chassis, is equipped with a range of armaments, including two AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles, four FIM-92 Stinger missiles, a 30 mm automatic cannon, and a 7.62 mm M-240 machine gun. The system also features a multi-mission radar capable of tracking both ground and aerial threats. However, the U.S. Army is planning to retrofit the system by replacing the Hellfire missile launcher due to concerns about wear and tear, which has led to potential safety issues. This retrofit will involve swapping the Hellfire launcher for a second Stinger missile pod, bringing the total number of Stinger missiles to eight per vehicle. Looking ahead, M-SHORAD Increment 2 will incorporate a 50-kilowatt directed energy laser system, representing a significant leap in air defense technology. The laser is designed to engage aerial threats as well as artillery and rockets, although there have been challenges in defending against these additional threats. The 50 kW laser system has been undergoing testing since 2019, and while it has proven effective against drones, it has not been as successful in countering other types of short-range threats like rockets and artillery. In response to these challenges, the U.S. Army continues to refine the laser system, with a decision on a future Enduring High Energy Laser (HEL) system expected by 2026. The next phase, M-SHORAD Increment 3, will introduce the Next-Generation Short Range Interceptor (NGSRI) to replace the FIM-92 Stinger missile, offering improved engagement range and accuracy. Additionally, the system will incorporate the XM 1223 Multi-Mode Proximity Airburst Munition (MMPA), which can target air, ground, and personnel threats. In March 2023, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies were selected to develop competing prototypes of the NGSRI, with the first operational demonstration scheduled for FY2026 and production expected to begin in 2027. The U.S. Army also issued a Request for Information (RFI) in May 2024 for M-SHORAD Increment 4, which aims to provide air defense capabilities for dismounted units. This increment will focus on creating a portable and deployable solution that can be airlifted via C-130 aircraft and integrated onto platforms such as the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) or robotic vehicles. The U.S. Army seeks responses for systems that can be operational by FY2027 to FY2028, with long-term goals extending to beyond 2035. With the increasing complexity of air threats, particularly from drones and loitering munitions, the U.S. Army is moving quickly to upgrade its M-SHORAD system. The development of the system’s various increments—ranging from improvements to Increment 1, to advances in directed energy with Increment 2, and the introduction of the next-generation interceptors in Increment 3—will bolster the U.S. Army's air defense capabilities. Increment 4’s focus on dismounted capabilities will ensure the U.S. Army’s readiness for a variety of future combat scenarios. As these advancements unfold, ongoing testing and soldier feedback will be crucial to refining M-SHORAD and adapting it to the fast-changing landscape of modern warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-to-enhance-m-shorad-short-range-air-defense-systems-based-on-lessons-from-ukraine-conflict	2025-02-02T03:08:30-08:00

The system’s versatility extends to its integration with different combat systems, from standalone operations to full integration within a larger air defense network. This ensures that the SIMBAD-RC can operate effectively as a part of a layered defense strategy or as a standalone system providing critical self-defense capabilities. This flexibility enhances its utility across different mission types and operational environments. The SIMBAD-RC system operates with the MISTRAL missile, which is renowned for its high supersonic speed and short interception time. The missile has an interception range of up to 8,000 m and can engage targets at altitudes of up to 6,000 m, making it highly effective against both low-flying threats and high-altitude targets. The missile's minimum interception range is 500 m, ensuring that it can engage fast-moving threats even at very close range. The MISTRAL surface-to-air missile carries a 3 kg warhead, coupled with a laser proximity and impact fuse, allowing it to engage and neutralize targets with high precision. The fire-and-forget capability of the missile further ensures that once launched, the missile autonomously homes in on its target, giving naval personnel more flexibility to focus on other operational tasks or engage additional threats. The decision to integrate the SIMBAD-RC system into the Hauturiers ships comes at a time when naval warfare is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic. Several factors underscore the growing need for enhanced air defense in modern maritime operations. The rise of advanced anti-ship missiles, drones, and other aerial threats has made air defense a critical priority for naval forces. The proliferation of hypersonic missiles, capable of evading traditional missile defense systems, further elevates the need for effective short-range protection solutions like the SIMBAD-RC. The missile's speed and accuracy offer the flexibility to intercept such threats at close range before they can reach their targets. In addition to countering traditional air threats, the SIMBAD-RC system provides a highly effective defense against asymmetric threats, which are becoming more prevalent in modern naval operations. Smaller, less conventional adversaries, including insurgents and non-state actors, are increasingly deploying low-cost, high-impact UAVs or cruise missiles. The SIMBAD-RC provides a cost-effective solution to counter such threats, ensuring that the French Navy's ships are adequately protected in a wide range of operational environments. The system also offers an effective inner-layer defense to complement the larger, more complex air defense systems installed on French warships. By placing multiple layers of defense around critical vessels, the Navy can ensure that no single point of failure compromises the ship's security. This layered approach allows warships to maintain defense readiness even if their primary air defense systems are overwhelmed. The integration of the SIMBAD-RC system will significantly enhance the French Navy's ability to defend against a broad array of airborne threats, while also complementing the Navy's existing defense strategies. This is particularly important as the Navy operates in high-risk environments such as the Mediterranean and the Indo-Pacific region, where the threat of missile strikes and UAVs is an increasing concern. With this new system, the French Navy will be better equipped to respond to these challenges and ensure the safety and effectiveness of its fleet. This procurement is also part of France’s broader military strategy to maintain its autonomy in defense capabilities, particularly in areas outside of traditional NATO protection structures. While NATO provides collective defense, the need for French forces to be able to defend themselves independently on the global stage is paramount. The SIMBAD-RC system aligns with this strategy, providing French warships with robust self-defense capabilities even in the absence of immediate allied support. The acquisition of the SIMBAD-RC system for the French Navy Hauturiers multirole patrol ships and combat support vessels represents a critical step in enhancing the French Navy's air defense capabilities. By integrating this highly effective, multi-threat capable system, France ensures that its naval forces are prepared to meet the increasing challenges of modern naval warfare. With its ability to engage a range of airborne threats, from missiles to drones, and its adaptability across various ship types, the SIMBAD-RC will play a key role in maintaining the operational readiness and strategic effectiveness of the French Navy’s fleet for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/french-navy-enhances-air-defense-with-new-simbad-rc-mistral-missile-launchers-for-its-ship	2025-01-31T06:41:21-08:00	
UK to sell HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark to Brazil Raising Concerns Over Amphibious Capability	According to information published by Daily Mail on January 26, 2025, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is reportedly preparing to sell two of its amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, to Brazil for a sum that undervalues their prior maintenance and refit costs. This move, part of a broader cost-cutting strategy, raises questions about the Royal Navy’s future amphibious capabilities and the strategic implications of offloading key assets at a time of increasing global instability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's Albion-class amphibious transport dock HMS Albion. (Picture source: UK MoD) HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark are the UK’s sole remaining dedicated amphibious warfare ships, capable of deploying Royal Marines, vehicles, and equipment in contested environments. These vessels, commissioned in the early 2000s, are designed for expeditionary operations, humanitarian assistance, and power projection. Their potential sale reduces the Royal Navy’s ability to conduct independent amphibious operations, shifting reliance onto allied forces or alternative, less capable platforms. The decision aligns with the MoD’s ongoing modernization efforts, which prioritize emerging technologies, multi-role platforms, and cost-efficiency. However, the absence of a direct replacement for these vessels could leave the UK with a gap in its ability to conduct large-scale amphibious landings without significant support from allied navies, particularly the United States and NATO partners. Over the past 14 years, the UK has invested heavily in maintaining and upgrading both ships, with reported expenditures exceeding £132 million, plus additional planned refits estimated at £72 million for HMS Bulwark before its premature decommissioning. The reported £20 million sale price raises concerns about the financial rationale behind the decision, given that their combined replacement cost would be several times higher. While the ships are nearing the later stages of their service life, their hulls and core systems remain operationally viable, particularly with further upgrades. Brazil’s potential acquisition suggests that these vessels still hold significant operational value, raising the question of why the UK considers them surplus while another navy sees them as a strategic asset. The decision to retire these ships follows a broader Royal Navy restructuring aimed at prioritizing multi-role platforms, including the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, Type 31 frigates, and Future Commando Force concepts. These initiatives focus on distributed lethality, smaller amphibious platforms, and integration with air and cyber capabilities. However, these concepts have yet to fully replace the strategic utility of dedicated amphibious assault ships. The Royal Marines’ ability to conduct major amphibious operations traditionally relied on these platforms for deploying armored vehicles, logistics, and troops ashore in contested environments. Without them, future operations may be constrained to littoral strike roles utilizing smaller support ships and aviation assets, limiting the scale and flexibility of UK expeditionary warfare. For Brazil, acquiring HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark would significantly enhance its amphibious and power projection capabilities. The Brazilian Navy currently operates an aging fleet, including the amphibious transport dock Bahia (ex-French Siroco). The addition of two Albion-class vessels would provide Brazil with greater capacity for humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and military operations in the South Atlantic, particularly concerning territorial security and regional partnerships. This transfer would also reinforce Brazil’s defense ties with the UK, following previous acquisitions such as the aircraft carrier São Paulo (ex-French Foch) and other Royal Navy vessels. It positions Brazil as a leading naval power in South America, capable of deploying forces at a strategic distance.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/uk-to-sell-hms-albion-and-hms-bulwark-to-brazil-raising-concerns-over-amphibious-capability	2025-01-31T06:23:36-08:00

Germany’s future IRIS-T Block II air-to-air missile to improve target tracking and accuracy	As reported by Diehl Defence on January 31, 2025, the German Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology, and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) and the company signed a contract at the end of December 2024, for the development and series production of the IRIS-T Block II missile system. The agreement was finalized within a short timeframe through coordination between the IRIS-T Project Management Office (PMO), BAAINBw, and Diehl Defence. Germany is the lead nation in this development program, with Sweden, Spain, and Italy also participating. The BAAINBw signed the contract on behalf of this multinational consortium.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new IRIS-T Block II air-to-air missile will receive a new seeker, updated electronics, and a data link capability (Picture source: Diehl Defence) In June 2024, the German company Diehl Defence announced that the IRIS-T Block II would incorporate a new seeker, updated electronics, and a data link capability. The German parliament approved financing for this program in December 2024, leading to the contract signing in late December 2024. Diehl Defence has also disclosed details about the IRIS-T SLX air-defense system, designed to engage incoming air-launched weapons and their carrier aircraft. Revealed at the ILA Berlin Air Show in June 2024, this system is expected to intercept targets at distances of up to 50 km and altitudes of up to 30 km. The system is projected to become operational within four years, with the capability to engage cruise missiles and helicopters. The IRIS-T (InfraRed Imaging System – Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled) is a European short-range air-to-air missile developed in cooperation between Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Norway. Since its introduction in 2005, more than 5,000 units have been delivered, and the system is currently in service with the air forces of 13 nations. It is integrated into multiple aircraft platforms, including the Eurofighter Typhoon, Gripen, F-16, Tornado, EF-18, KF-21, and F-5E, and is designed for use against both aircraft and incoming air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles. The development of the IRIS-T followed Germany’s reunification when Western analysts studied MiG-29A fighters inherited from the former East German Air Force. These aircraft were equipped with the Soviet-designed R-73 air-to-air missile, which surprised experts with its superior maneuverability, off-boresight targeting capabilities, and extended range compared to the AIM-9L/M Sidewinder, the standard missile used by NATO at the time. This led the German Ministry of Defence to study the continued relevance of close-range aerial engagements despite advancements in long-range detection and engagement technologies. Simulations indicated that visual-range combat remained likely due to factors such as the limited identification capabilities of modern aircraft, complex air situations involving multiple national forces, and the necessity of visual confirmation before engagement. This realization played a critical role in Germany’s decision to withdraw from the AIM-132 ASRAAM program in 1989, as its focus on extended-range engagements was deemed outdated. Instead, Germany sought to develop a missile with superior agility and close-combat capabilities, leading to the IRIS-T program in collaboration with Italy, Sweden, Greece, Canada, and Norway. In April 1996, Bodenseewerk Gerätetechnik (BGT) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with these partner nations, with Germany funding 50% of the development costs. Initial tests were conducted using Sidewinder missiles modified with IRIS-T seekers. The Bundestag approved the project in December 1997, with Germany contributing 46% of the budget, followed by Italy (20%), Sweden (18%), Greece (8%), Canada (4%), and Norway (3%). Spain replaced Canada in the program at the end of 2001, and in 2003, the partner nations signed a procurement contract worth €1 billion. Full-scale production began in the early 2000s, with Germany receiving the first operational missiles in 2005. The development of the IRIS-T followed Germany’s reunification, when Western analysts studied MiG-29A fighters equipped with the Soviet-designed R-73 air-to-air missile, which were inherited from the former East German Air Force. (Picture source: Russian social media) Early missiles could only engage targets from the rear, but this changed with the AIM-9L Sidewinder, which introduced all-aspect engagement, allowing it to target threats from multiple angles. The hit probability improved to 73% during the Falklands War but later declined due to the introduction of infrared countermeasures, as seen in the Second Gulf War, where effectiveness fell to 23%. To counter this, modern infrared-guided missiles, including the IRIS-T, use imaging infrared seekers that can differentiate between decoys and actual targets. The IRIS-T also integrates helmet-mounted sighting systems, allowing pilots to designate targets up to 90° off-boresight. Like the Python-5, it has a lock-on-after-launch capability, enabling engagement of targets beyond the aircraft’s immediate field of view. The missile can receive target data via the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) and adjust its trajectory accordingly. Designed for close combat, interception, and self-defense, the IRIS-T is a fire-and-forget short-range air-to-air missile with thrust vector control and an advanced infrared seeker. The seeker combines a focal plane array with a mechanical scan, enhancing resistance to countermeasures such as IR decoys and blinding lasers. The missile’s lock-on-after-launch (LOAL) mode and inertial navigation system allow engagement of targets beyond the seeker’s initial field of view. Moreover, the missile has a squint angle range of ±90° and can engage targets behind the launch platform within 0.5 seconds. Equipped with an 11.4 kg fragmentation warhead triggered by impact or a Ku-band radar proximity fuse and a propulsion system enabling rapid acceleration to speeds up to Mach 3, the IRIS-T is capable of intercepting fast, maneuvering aerial threats, including aircraft and missiles, at ranges of up to 25 km. Germany remains the primary operator, with an initial order of 1,250 missiles and an additional 1,280 ordered under a framework agreement extending until 2030. Other current operators include Austria (25 missiles), Brazil (unknown number), Greece (350), Italy (444), Norway (150, now transferred to Ukraine), Saudi Arabia (1,400, plus 150 ordered in 2024), South Africa (25), Spain (700), Sweden (450, including the IRIS-T SLS for ground-based air defense), Thailand (220), and Ukraine (unknown number). The missile has been integrated into various aircraft fleets, with five of the seven Eurofighter nations using it. Norway retired its IRIS-T stock in 2022, transferring its missiles to Ukraine. Future operators include Hungary, which is integrating the missile into its JAS 39 Gripen MS20 Block II modernization program, and South Korea, which has tested the IRIS-T on the KF-21 fighter, with a successful test firing announced in May 2024. Romania has also conducted trials with the missile on the IAR-99SM. Several countries operate or have ordered the ground-based IRIS-T SLM and SLS variants. Sweden has fielded the IRIS-T SLS since 2016, while Germany operates one IRIS-T SLM fire unit, with five more on order and two on option. Ukraine has received four IRIS-T SLM systems and is set to receive additional units, with Norway committing $92 million for a battery. Egypt operates seven IRIS-T SLM systems, with a further order for 400 missiles and 10 IRIS-T SLX systems approved in 2021. Austria, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, and Switzerland have placed orders or are negotiating procurement. This missile is also part of the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), with Germany, Latvia, Estonia, Norway, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia participating. Additionally, the IRIS-T's cost is lower compared to the PAC-3 MSE (priced at approximately €3.7 million per unit), as Germany is said to pay approximately €400,000 per missile, covering 46% of development costs. Germany remains the primary operator of the IRIS-T, with an initial order of 1,250 missiles and an additional 1,280 ordered under a framework agreement extending until 2030.

Keen Sword 2025: Lockheed Martin Integrates Aegis for Faster Networked Fire Control Across Land and Maritime Forces	According to information published by Lockheed Martin on January 29, 2025, the Keen Sword exercise near mainland Japan provided a critical testbed for validating the role of the Virtualized Aegis Weapon System (VAWS) in a networked, multi-domain fires environment.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Virtualized Aegis Weapon System (VAWS) integrates seamlessly with joint fire control networks during Keen Sword, demonstrating advanced CJADC2-enabled long-range strike coordination between U.S. and JSDF maritime and land forces. (Picture source: Samantha Rosales) By integrating Aegis with joint U.S. and Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) fire control systems, the exercise demonstrated key advancements in Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2), particularly in accelerating kill-chain processes and enhancing cross-domain targeting interoperability. Aegis' role in Keen Sword focused on fire control automation and digital C2 integration across maritime and land domains. Traditionally, long-range fires coordination across service branches relies on manual processes, introducing latency in targeting cycles. VAWS eliminated these inefficiencies by establishing a direct, digital fire control interface with the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). This integration allowed for the near-instantaneous transmission of engagement orders and targeting data between naval and ground units, ensuring that sensor-derived information was processed and acted upon in real time.

Norwegian-Owned Ship Silver Dania Detained in Norway over Suspected Baltic Sea Cable Sabotage	According to information published by NRK on January 31, 2025, Norwegian authorities have ordered the cargo ship Silver Dania to dock in Tromsø following a legal request from Latvia. The vessel, owned by the Bergen-based company Silver Sea and registered under the Norwegian flag, is suspected of involvement in the deliberate destruction of an undersea fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and Sweden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Norwegian-owned cargo ship Silver Dania detained in Tromsø amid allegations of involvement in Baltic undersea cable sabotage. (Picture source: Silversea) The Baltic Sea has become a battleground for hybrid warfare, with repeated incidents targeting undersea infrastructure. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, multiple cases of unexplained damage to communication cables, energy pipelines, and power transmission lines have signaled a shift toward asymmetric conflict tactics. The Nord Stream pipeline explosions demonstrated the vulnerability of seabed infrastructure, prompting NATO and European defense planners to reinforce undersea security measures. The detention of Silver Dania is the latest event in a series of escalating maritime security threats. The vessel, built in 1989 and measuring 113.4 meters in length and 17.75 meters in width, operates between St. Petersburg and Murmansk, a region of strategic importance for Russian maritime logistics and military transport. AIS tracking data from MarineTraffic revealed that Silver Dania made an unexplained stop west of Senja before proceeding to Tromsø, a pattern that raised suspicions among authorities monitoring undersea infrastructure. The ship’s movements align with previous cases where unidentified vessels were detected near fiber-optic cables before disruptions occurred, adding to speculation that commercial ships may be repurposed for sabotage under the guise of regular cargo operations. Targeting undersea communication cables presents a direct security challenge, affecting not only national governments but also military coordination, banking systems, and civilian internet access. NATO and European intelligence agencies have increasingly warned that these attacks could serve as probes to test Western responses to maritime sabotage. The nature of the Baltic Sea, with its shallow depth and high concentration of military and commercial activity, makes it an ideal zone for covert operations. The damage to the Latvia-Sweden cable follows similar incidents involving Finnish and Estonian infrastructure, reinforcing concerns that these disruptions are part of a broader strategic campaign rather than isolated technical failures. In response to the growing threat, NATO has deployed additional naval forces to the Baltic, including warships equipped with sonar and surveillance capabilities designed to monitor vessel activity near critical underwater assets. The alliance has also expanded the use of underwater drones and seabed sensors to detect unauthorized operations in high-risk areas. The detention of Silver Dania suggests a shift toward more aggressive enforcement measures against suspected sabotage vessels, reflecting a heightened awareness of the role commercial ships may play in modern hybrid conflicts. The investigation into Silver Dania will determine whether the vessel was actively involved in sabotage or if it was merely operating in a sensitive area at the wrong time. Regardless of the outcome, the case highlights the evolving nature of maritime threats in the Baltic Sea. With underwater infrastructure increasingly viewed as a frontline in modern conflict, securing these assets has become a priority for European defense strategies. The possibility that state-affiliated actors are leveraging commercial shipping for intelligence gathering and sabotage underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and stricter maritime controls in regions where critical infrastructure is most vulnerable.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/norwegian-owned-ship-silver-dania-detained-in-norway-over-suspected-baltic-sea-cable-sabotage	2025-01-31T03:41:35-08:00

Sweden’s Largest Military Aid Package to Ukraine: Strategic Impact of CB90 Combat Boats	According to information published by the Swedish government on January 30, 2025, Sweden’s decision to provide Ukraine with its largest military aid package to date, including 16 additional Combat Boat 90s (CB90s), represents a strategic enhancement of Ukraine’s maritime and riverine capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Sweden doubles its donation of CB90 combat boats to Ukraine, strengthening its riverine and coastal warfare capabilities in the fight against Russian forces. (Picture source: Saab) By doubling the previous donation of these high-speed assault craft, Sweden is reinforcing Ukraine’s ability to conduct operations in contested waterways, a domain that has become increasingly significant in the war against Russia. The addition of these vessels will improve Ukraine’s mobility, special operations capabilities, and ability to disrupt Russian supply lines along rivers and coastal areas. The CB90, originally developed by Swedish shipbuilder Dockstavarvet, is a highly maneuverable, shallow-draft vessel designed for fast-paced naval operations. Its aluminum hull, combined with twin waterjet propulsion, allows it to achieve speeds exceeding 40 knots while maintaining excellent agility in confined or shallow waters. This capability makes it particularly well-suited for riverine and littoral warfare, where traditional naval vessels struggle to operate effectively. The boat’s design prioritizes rapid deployment, making it a valuable asset for inserting and extracting troops, transporting equipment, and providing fire support in dynamic combat environments. It is also equipped with multiple weapons mounts, supporting machine guns, grenade launchers, and modular configurations for additional armament, such as anti-tank or air-defense systems. The operational environment in Ukraine necessitates such capabilities, particularly along the Dnieper River, which has become a key battleground. The river serves as both a natural barrier and a critical supply route, with Russian forces using occupied sections for logistics and troop movements. By deploying additional CB90s, Ukraine will be able to conduct rapid interdiction operations, ambush enemy convoys, and insert special forces for sabotage missions behind enemy lines. These boats will also enhance the mobility of Ukrainian forces in counter-offensive operations, allowing them to quickly seize and secure strategic river crossings and islands. Given the extensive use of drone reconnaissance and precision strikes in the conflict, the ability to reposition forces at high speed will be an essential tactical advantage. Beyond the Dnieper and its tributaries, Ukraine’s control of the Black Sea coastline remains a contested issue. Despite having lost much of its conventional naval fleet, Ukraine has adapted through asymmetric warfare, using maritime drones, missiles, and special operations to weaken the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The addition of CB90s enhances Ukraine’s ability to conduct raids, evacuate personnel under fire, and support amphibious operations. These vessels could also be integrated into combined operations with naval drones and missile-armed units, creating a hybrid force capable of challenging Russian dominance at sea. The fast insertion capability of these boats will be particularly useful for Ukrainian special forces, who have already demonstrated their ability to conduct covert operations in occupied Crimea and along Russia’s coastal installations. The broader impact of Sweden’s military aid package extends beyond the immediate tactical benefits. The CB90s symbolize a growing trend of Western military assistance adapting to the realities of modern warfare, where mobility, flexibility, and the ability to operate in multiple domains are becoming as crucial as heavy weaponry. Sweden’s decision to provide these boats suggests an increasing emphasis on supporting Ukraine’s ability to conduct unconventional operations, rather than just reinforcing static defenses.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/swedens-largest-military-aid-package-to-ukraine-strategic-impact-of-cb90-combat-boats	2025-01-31T01:24:00-08:00

Türkiye Advances Eurofighter Fighter Jet Acquisition with French Meteor Missiles Despite Greece’s Objections	Türkiye’s efforts to modernize its air force are advancing, with plans to acquire Eurofighter Typhoon European multinational fighter jets equipped with the advanced Meteor air-to-air missile, designed and manufactured by MBDA, a multi-national European group. This move has raised tensions in the region. Turkish media reports that despite opposition from Greece, France has approved the delivery of the Meteor missiles, which are set to enhance Türkiye’s air defense capabilities significantly.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A British Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet armed with the advanced Meteor missile, showcasing its long-range air-to-air combat capabilities. (Picture source: UK MoD) The Meteor missile, developed as part of a multinational partnership, is one of the most advanced air-to-air missiles in the world. It is designed to be compatible with a range of modern fighter aircraft, including the Eurofighter Typhoon, and provides a crucial edge in air superiority. The missile’s extended range, exceptional accuracy, and resistance to countermeasures make it an essential asset for modern air forces. The Meteor is a state-of-the-art active radar-guided missile developed by MBDA, a European missile manufacturer. It was designed to surpass the limitations of traditional air-to-air missiles by offering a significantly longer range, enhanced maneuverability, and superior resistance to electronic warfare. The missile is equipped with a sophisticated propulsion system that enables it to maintain speed and course over much greater distances than previous generation missiles, allowing for engagements at ranges exceeding 100 kilometers. A key feature of the Meteor is its unique 'ramjet' engine, which allows for sustained propulsion at long ranges, making it highly effective in intercepting fast-moving targets, such as enemy fighter jets, even at extended distances. Its active radar seeker also enables it to remain guided during the final engagement phase, even if the target maneuvers to evade the missile. This ensures that the Meteor can lock onto and strike targets with remarkable precision, even in complex electronic warfare environments. The missile's ability to engage targets at extended ranges means that it can be launched from beyond visual range (BVR), allowing the launching aircraft to maintain a safe distance from the enemy while still neutralizing the threat. This capability is essential in modern air combat, where the first missile launch often dictates the outcome of the engagement. The acquisition of Meteor missiles for Türkiye’s Eurofighter Typhoon jets will greatly enhance the nation's air combat capabilities, allowing it to engage enemy aircraft from beyond visual range with increased confidence and effectiveness. This improvement comes at a crucial time as Turkey continues to expand its defense infrastructure and strengthen its position in the region. The Meteor missile’s ability to defeat enemy aircraft at extended ranges provides Türkiye with a distinct strategic advantage, particularly in scenarios involving high-speed air combat and complex battlefield environments. Its advanced radar and seeker technology will also allow Turkish pilots to engage multiple targets simultaneously, improving the overall combat effectiveness of the Turkish air force. Despite the strategic benefits for Türkiye, the decision to equip its Eurofighter Typhoon fleet with Meteor missiles has sparked opposition from Greece, which views the move as a direct threat to its own security. The two nations, both NATO members, have long-standing territorial disputes, particularly over control of the Aegean Sea. The introduction of such advanced weaponry into Turkey’s arsenal is seen by Greece as a significant escalation in the balance of power in the region. Greece’s objections were reportedly a significant factor in delaying the missile transfer, as Greece has consistently expressed concerns over Turkey's growing military capabilities. The geopolitical implications of this sale have also drawn attention from other NATO members, as the alliance must balance the defense interests of its member states while managing internal tensions. However, recent reports suggest that Germany, which is also part of the Eurofighter consortium, has dropped its objections to the sale. France, as a key player in the missile’s production, has also given the green light for the inclusion of Meteor missiles in the Turkish deal. British officials, recognizing the strategic importance of the sale, reportedly lobbied Paris to approve the transfer, further cementing the multinational nature of the Meteor program. The approval for Turkey to acquire Meteor missiles for its Eurofighter Typhoon jets marks a significant milestone in the modernization of its air force. The Meteor missile’s long-range capabilities and advanced guidance systems make it one of the most formidable air-to-air weapons available today, enhancing Turkey’s ability to project power in the region. While the sale is likely to provoke further tensions with Greece, the deal also underscores the complexities of European defense collaboration, where strategic and political considerations intersect with military procurement. As Turkey moves forward with its plans to bolster its air force, the geopolitical implications of this missile transfer will likely continue to resonate across the NATO alliance and beyond.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/turkey-advances-eurofighter-fighter-jet-acquisition-with-french-meteor-missiles-despite-greeces-objections	2025-01-31T00:55:41-08:00

This modernization process replaces Soviet-era components with Western systems to enhance mobility, firepower, and situational awareness. The BTR-70DI, a Ukrainian modification of the BTR-70, features improved armor, Western diesel engines, and upgraded combat capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mista’s modernization efforts include replacing the original twin gasoline engines with Western diesel alternatives and integrating a new gearbox to improve fuel efficiency and operational range. (Picture source: Facebook/Rafał Bieńkowski) As reported by Aeromag Asia, Mista’s modernization efforts include replacing the original twin gasoline engines with Western diesel alternatives and integrating a new gearbox to improve fuel efficiency and operational range. Structural modifications include the addition of two side doors to facilitate faster troop deployment, replacing the small hatches of the original design. Observation and targeting systems have been upgraded with thermal imaging sights, modernized observation devices, and satellite navigation. Electronic warfare enhancements, such as anti-drone nets and jamming systems, have also been incorporated. Despite these modifications, the vehicles retain their amphibious capability. The BTR-70, originally designed in the Soviet Union, is an eight-wheeled armored personnel carrier developed as an improvement over the BTR-60PB. It entered service in 1976 with a fully enclosed, welded steel hull designed to transport mechanized infantry while providing fire support. It is armed with a 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine gun and a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun, housed in a small turret with 360-degree traverse. The vehicle was powered by two ZMZ-4905 gasoline engines with a combined 240 hp output, coupled with a six-speed manual transmission and all-wheel independent torsion-bar suspension. Its amphibious capability is facilitated by a water jet propulsion system. However, the BTR-70 had several design limitations, including its complex dual-engine configuration, limited mine resistance, and small side hatches, which made troop deployment difficult under fire. To address these deficiencies, Ukraine’s Mykolaiv Armored Plant developed the BTR-70DI, featuring two FPT Iveco Tector diesel engines (Euro-3) delivering a total of 300 hp, paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Also known as BTR-7, its hull incorporates NATO-standard mine protection rated at STANAG 4569 levels 3A and 3B.

(Picture source: Facebook/Rafał Bieńkowski) Compared to its predecessor, the BTR-60PB, the BTR-70 saw relatively limited production, as it retained some of the earlier vehicle’s shortcomings, such as the dual gasoline engines and restricted troop entry and exit points. These issues became evident during combat, particularly in the Soviet–Afghan War, leading to the introduction of the BTR-80 in 1984. The BTR-80 featured a single 260-horsepower diesel engine and an improved drivetrain, prompting the cessation of BTR-70 production the same year. The Soviet Union exported the BTR-70 to Afghanistan, East Germany, Hungary, and Romania, with Romania producing a local variant, the TAB-77. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many BTR-70s were inherited by post-Soviet states or re-exported. Some countries have retired their fleets, such as Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania, while others have extended their service life through modernization programs, including Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. Currently, Turkmenistan operates the largest fleet of BTR-70s, with approximately 300 units, followed by Russia with around 200. Azerbaijan has 132 units, while Pakistan retains up to 120. Belarus maintains approximately 64 units, North Macedonia 56, and Kyrgyzstan 45, including standard BTR-70s and upgraded BTR-70M models. Mongolia operates 40, Armenia 36, while Georgia and Uzbekistan each have 25. Other operators include Mexico with 26, Ghana and Zambia with 20 each, Tajikistan with up to 20, and Nicaragua and Sudan with smaller numbers. Ukraine, having inherited a substantial number from the Soviet Union, has pursued multiple modernization initiatives, including the BTR-70DI, BTR-70M, BTR-70 KBA-2, BTR-70T, and BTR-70 Varan armored personnel carriers, as well as the BTR-70Di-02 Svityaz command vehicle, the BMM Ark armored ambulance and the BREM-2000 (or BREM-7K), an armored recovery vehicle. The source of the 150 BTR-70DI modernized by Mista is most likely Ukraine, as this specific variant seems to have not been exported to any country, though differences exist in the choice of armament. There has been no official confirmation regarding the recipient of these modernized vehicles, but Ukraine remains the most probable operator, as Mista is also involved in producing the Oncilla, a Polish variant of the Ukrainian Dozor-B 4x4 armored personnel carrier. The upgrades, including Western diesel engines, reinforced protection, and electronic warfare enhancements, align with Ukraine’s operational needs. Additionally, reports confirm that vehicles matching this configuration have been observed in service with Ukraine’s 151st Separate Mechanized Brigade, suggesting that these modernized BTR-70s have been delivered to the Ukrainian military.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-modernizes-150-ukrainian-btr-70di-8x8-armored-personnel-carriers-to-improve-their-effectiveness	2025-01-30T08:01:11-08:00

Trump Administration’s Defense Chief reaffirms US Commitment to AUKUS in talks with Australia	According to information published by the US DoD on January 29 2025, the United States has reaffirmed its long-term commitment to the AUKUS defense pact under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, signaling continuity in the trilateral partnership between the U.S., Australia, and the United Kingdom.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link While docked at HMAS Stirling Navy Base on Garden Island, the crew of the Virginia-class fast-attack submarine USS Mississippi (SSN 782), assisted by explosive ordnance support specialists from Thales Australia, carefully loaded an inert Tomahawk missile training shape into the vessel. (Picture source: US DoD) AUKUS Pillar I, which focuses on the Royal Australian Navy’s transition to nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs), remains the most strategically significant aspect of the agreement. Australia is set to operate a hybrid fleet consisting of U.S. Virginia-class SSNs, delivered in the early 2030s, followed by the introduction of the SSN-AUKUS, a next-generation submarine based on the British SSN(R) design but incorporating U.S. combat systems and nuclear propulsion technology. The integration of S9G pressurized water reactors, derived from U.S. Virginia-class and Ohio-class submarines, ensures that Australia’s SSNs will maintain parity with American and British counterparts in terms of power output, submerged endurance, and operational tempo. These submarines will be optimized for low-acoustic signature propulsion, advanced sonar processing, and high-bandwidth secure communication systems, making them a core component of Indo-Pacific undersea deterrence. The Trump administration’s continued backing suggests that Australia’s nuclear propulsion capability development—including the establishment of domestic reactor sustainment facilities—will remain a priority, with an emphasis on workforce training, regulatory harmonization, and classified material handling protocols. Beyond submarines, AUKUS Pillar II expands the scope of allied defense cooperation into multi-domain warfare capabilities, emphasizing the co-development of advanced weapon systems, electronic warfare integration, and AI-enhanced battle networks. One of the primary areas of collaboration involves hypersonic and counter-hypersonic missile systems, where the U.S. is leveraging its experience with the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system and the U.K.’s high-speed glide vehicle research to accelerate Australia’s indigenous long-range strike capability. The Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise, central to AUKUS Pillar II, is focusing on establishing an Australian production line for next-generation munitions, ensuring logistical resilience for long-range precision fires. This includes the joint manufacturing of AGM-158B JASSM-ER, the integration of PrSM (Precision Strike Missile) variants, and potential Australian involvement in DARPA’s Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) successor program. The technological convergence under AUKUS also extends to networked warfare, with a key emphasis on the integration of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)-compliant battle management systems. The U.S. and Australia are working to align their C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) architectures, enabling real-time sensor fusion and multi-domain strike coordination. As part of this effort, AUKUS partners are pursuing a common MQ-28 Ghost Bat autonomy framework, allowing AI-driven sensor-sharing across unmanned platforms, further enhancing distributed lethality concepts within the Indo-Pacific battlespace. Another critical component of AUKUS is force posture realignment, particularly the expansion of U.S. rotational deployments in northern Australia. The U.S. Marine Rotational Force-Darwin (MRF-D) is evolving beyond a training contingent into an expeditionary force with prepositioned stocks of Naval Strike Missiles (NSM), HIMARS rocket artillery systems, and integrated air defense assets. Simultaneously, the enhancement of RAAF Base Tindal and HMAS Stirling as key operational nodes for U.S. and allied SSNs ensures that Australia becomes a strategic hub for undersea warfare operations, supporting not only its own fleet but also forward-deployed U.S. and U.K. assets. The Trump administration’s reaffirmation of AUKUS signals that these basing arrangements will continue, likely accompanied by increased investment in rapid deployment infrastructure, secure data exchange networks, and cross-domain ISR capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/trump-administrations-defense-chief-reaffirms-us-commitment-to-aukus-in-talks-with-australia	2025-01-30T07:19:41-08:00

At that time, military officials took measured steps to deter any potential threat, reaffirming the UK’s commitment to safeguarding its territorial waters. The swift and coordinated response on both occasions reflects a broader strategy to counter growing Russian naval activities in the region. The UK government has labeled this latest incident as another example of increasing Russian aggression, which threatens not only its allies abroad but also domestic security. The heads of MI6 and the CIA recently issued a joint statement warning that Russia is waging a 'reckless campaign' of sabotage across Europe. This includes periodic incursions of Russian military aircraft into airspace monitored by the UK. On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 undersea cable between Finland and Estonia was damaged—an act that many analysts believe was caused by a vessel in Russia’s shadow fleet. Such incidents have heightened concerns about Moscow’s intentions and its growing focus on targeting Western infrastructure. British officials have reiterated that Russia remains the most pressing and immediate threat to national security. Addressing Parliament, a senior government representative assured both lawmakers and the British people that any threat would be met with strength and resolve. 'We are delivering on the foundation of security in our plan for change by making Britain secure at home,' they stated. After leaving UK waters, Yantar passed through the Dover Strait and entered Dutch waters. British defense forces continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with NATO allies. This latest encounter comes as part of an ongoing pattern of Russian military activity near British territory. In September 2024, RAF Typhoons scrambled to intercept two Russian Bear F strategic bombers operating near UK airspace, demonstrating the ongoing vigilance required to counter potential threats. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) service is also playing a crucial role in safeguarding offshore infrastructure. The multi-role ocean surveillance ship RFA Proteus has been instrumental in tracking foreign vessels of interest, reinforcing the UK’s ability to detect and deter potential threats. With tensions between NATO and Russia escalating, the UK is expected to continue strengthening its maritime and aerial surveillance efforts, ensuring that any future incursions by vessels like Yantar are met with a swift and decisive response. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of modern security threats and the importance of maintaining robust defenses against potential adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-uk-deploys-navy-ships-and-submarine-to-shadow-russian-spy-ship-yantar-in-british-waters	2025-01-30T02:50:36-08:00	
Japan’s First F-35B Carrier Landings Backed by UK and US Naval Aviation Experts	According to information published by Forces News on January 21, 2025, a Royal Navy pilot has been actively assisting Japan in its transition to operating the F-35B Lightning II, providing expertise in flight testing and operational procedures to ensure the aircraft’s seamless integration into Japan’s maritime forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Royal Navy pilot supports Japan’s transition to F-35B Lightning II operations, conducting advanced flight trials to optimize carrier integration aboard the newly converted JS Kaga. (Picture source: UK MoD) Japan has been operating the F-35A, the conventional takeoff and landing variant, for several years. However, the introduction of the F-35B represents a shift towards carrier-based air power, as the aircraft’s short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability enables operations from smaller decks and forward-deployed bases. Unlike the F-35A, the B variant incorporates a shaft-driven lift fan behind the cockpit and a rotating rear nozzle for vertical thrust, allowing it to land and take off in confined spaces. These design modifications necessitate specialized pilot training and ship integration trials to determine the aircraft’s full operational effectiveness. The ongoing trials include advanced deck landing procedures that are not typically associated with fixed-wing naval aviation, such as rearward landings and lateral deck approaches, which test the aircraft’s ability to operate in constrained environments.

Australia's Naval Power Grows as NUSHIP Eyre begins sea trials for strategic patrol operations	According to information published by WarshipCam on January 28, 2025, the Royal Australian Navy's second Arafura-class offshore patrol vessel, NUSHIP Eyre (OPV 204), has officially commenced its builder’s sea trials off the coast of Adelaide.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Australian Navy's Arafura-class offshore patrol vessel NUSHIP Eyre. (Picture source: Luersen Australia) This milestone follows its launch on November 22, 2023, at the Osborne Naval Shipyard, where it underwent extensive outfitting and systems integration before taking to the sea for evaluation. As part of the Arafura-class offshore patrol vessel program, NUSHIP Eyre was built to replace the aging Armidale-class patrol boats, providing the Royal Australian Navy with a more capable and versatile platform for border security, law enforcement, and regional security operations. The Arafura-class vessels are based on the Lürssen OPV80 design, a well-proven model optimized for Australian operational requirements. The start of sea trials involves extensive testing of all critical systems, including propulsion, navigation, communications, and weapons systems, ensuring the vessel meets the Royal Australian Navy’s performance and safety standards. These trials will assess its maneuverability, endurance, and seaworthiness under real-world operational conditions. Engineers and naval experts will monitor the ship’s response to different scenarios, including high-speed maneuvers, emergency stops, and weapons trials. The tests will also evaluate the vessel's modular mission capabilities. The Arafura-class program was initially intended to deliver twelve offshore patrol vessels, but a strategic defense review led to a reduction in the number of ships to six. Despite this adjustment, the class remains a key element of the Royal Australian Navy’s modernization plans, strengthening its ability to conduct long-range patrols and enforce maritime security in Australia's extensive exclusive economic zone. With a displacement of approximately 1,640 tonnes and an overall length of 80 meters, the Arafura-class OPVs are significantly larger and more capable than the vessels they replace. They are designed to operate with a core crew of 40 but can accommodate up to 60 personnel when needed for specialized missions.

Equipped with a 25mm main gun and additional machine guns, the ships are primarily focused on patrol and enforcement operations but can be adapted for a variety of mission profiles, including disaster relief and intelligence gathering.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/australias-naval-power-grows-as-nuship-eyre-begins-sea-trials-for-strategic-patrol-operations	2025-01-29T07:44:52-08:00	
British Navy overhauls Combat Systems to improve threat detection after Monitoring Russian Vessel	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 28, 2025, the Royal Navy is undergoing an enhancement of its combat management capabilities through a £285 million contract awarded to BAE Systems, aimed at maintaining and modernizing its Combat Management Systems (CMS).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's Combat Management System. (Picture source: Crown Copy) This upgrade will be implemented across several key vessels, including the Type 23 frigates, Type 45 destroyers, Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, and the next-generation Type 26 frigates. The modernization effort is designed to ensure that Royal Navy warships can effectively detect, track, and neutralize threats in increasingly complex and contested maritime environments. The CMS serves as the core of a warship’s combat capability, integrating information from sensors, radar, sonar, and electronic warfare systems into a single, cohesive operational picture. As naval threats evolve to include advanced missile systems, stealth technology, electronic warfare tactics, and cyber operations, a capable CMS is essential to maintaining tactical superiority. The system enables naval personnel to monitor the battlespace in real time, process large volumes of data, and respond rapidly to threats. Operators rely on the CMS for decision support in navigation, weapons direction, target tracking, and threat analysis, making it one of the most critical components in modern naval warfare. A major aspect of this upgrade program involves the introduction of RECODE (Reportedly Enhanced Combat Operational Decision Engine), which will significantly enhance the Royal Navy’s ability to process and analyze combat data. By integrating artificial intelligence-driven analytics and automation, RECODE improves the speed and accuracy of threat evaluation and weapon assignment. Modern warships must be able to react to hostile actions within seconds, making the ability to process sensor data and execute defensive or offensive measures in real time a crucial capability. With enhanced situational awareness and a refined tactical picture, the upgraded CMS will improve response efficiency, reducing human workload and the risk of operator error. The modernization effort also includes advancements in navigation and blind pilotage capabilities, allowing ships to maneuver more effectively in GPS-denied environments, which is particularly relevant in electronic warfare scenarios. Weapon direction and control systems will also see improvements, ensuring more precise targeting for missiles, naval guns, and countermeasure deployment. By integrating these elements into a unified command structure, the Royal Navy enhances its ability to respond to both asymmetric threats, such as drone swarms and small fast-attack boats, and conventional threats from submarines, aircraft, and warships. This announcement follows a recent Royal Navy operation in which British forces tracked the Russian intelligence-gathering ship Yantar as it moved through UK waters. The ability to monitor, track, and analyze the movements of potentially adversarial vessels demonstrates the importance of having an advanced CMS capable of handling complex surveillance and threat detection tasks. Given the increasing frequency of such encounters, particularly with near-peer adversaries, the modernization of combat management capabilities is not only a defensive necessity but also a strategic imperative. The Royal Navy’s commitment to digital transformation extends beyond just CMS upgrades. The integration of data fusion technologies, AI-driven automation, and next-generation electronic warfare systems reflects a broader effort to enhance fleet-wide interoperability and operational effectiveness. As the Type 26 and Type 31 frigates enter service, these new platforms will be equipped with advanced digital infrastructure, allowing seamless coordination with existing warships. Ensuring that legacy vessels remain technologically competitive is equally important, as the transition to a fully modernized fleet takes time. Investments in CMS modernization also align with the UK’s strategic vision for maritime security, which emphasizes deterrence, power projection, and rapid response capabilities. Future conflicts are expected to be characterized by high-speed engagements, cyber warfare, and multi-domain operations, making the ability to rapidly process and act on intelligence a key factor in mission success. Beyond direct combat applications, an upgraded CMS also enhances a warship’s role in intelligence gathering, reconnaissance, and network-centric warfare. The ability to integrate with allied naval forces and share real-time data across joint task forces ensures that Royal Navy assets remain a crucial part of multinational security operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/british-navy-overhauls-combat-systems-to-improve-threat-detection-after-monitoring-russian-vessel	2025-01-29T06:02:12-08:00	
Iran tests new Badr anti-tank guided missile to modernize its infantry strike capabilities	As reported by Patarames on January 28, 2025, Iran has conducted the first publicly documented test of its new Badr anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). The system, which appears to be a modified version of the Almas missile, features a reduced caliber from 130 mm to 110 mm. The Badr ATGM is a single-operator, fire-and-forget weapon with an operational range of up to two kilometers, designed to counter armored vehicles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Compared to the earlier Almas missile, the Badr’s lighter design enables a single soldier to carry and deploy this fire-and-forget weapon without additional personnel or setup while maintaining the ability to penetrate up to 60 centimeters of armor at a range of up to two kilometers. (Picture source: Twitter/Fatherland9_) The caliber reduction has led to discussions about weight reduction and improved portability for individual operators. The lighter design allows a single soldier to carry and deploy the system without additional personnel or setup. Available specifications indicate that the Badr missile can penetrate up to 60 centimeters of armor. The missile has a flight duration of 13 seconds and a total weight of approximately 15 kilograms, contributing to its ease of use. During a recent Iranian military exercise in the western region of the country, the Badr ATGM was tested alongside other weapon systems. The exercise, conducted in the Qasr Shirin to Naft Shahr axis, included joint operations using platforms such as Ababil and Arash Nezaja attack drones. These unmanned systems were used in coordinated attacks and target destruction missions, demonstrating efforts to integrate precision-guided munitions into military operations. Brigadier General Karim Cheshak, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations of the Iranian Army Ground Forces, stated that the Badr missile was one of the new weapons evaluated during the exercise. The new Badr anti-tank guided missile system is expected to replace older models, such as the Saeghe ATGMs, which have been used by Iranian forces and allied groups in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon. This suggests that the Badr ATGM may follow a similar deployment pattern. Footage of the missile launch has been analyzed, with some suggesting that the Badr ATGM employs a high-angle attack trajectory, possibly indicating a top-attack capability. While not officially confirmed, this feature would improve effectiveness against armored vehicles by targeting less protected areas. Additionally, the reduction in caliber compared to the Almas (a copy of the Israeli ATGM) is not easily visible but contributes to reduced weight and increased portability. Some commentators have noted that stability during launch is crucial for operators, but the fire-and-forget capability simplifies its use by eliminating the need for manual guidance after launch. Iran's development of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) dates back to the 1970s with the acquisition of American BGM-71 TOW missiles in 1971. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Iran sought to develop indigenous ATGM capabilities, leading to the production of the Toophan missile, a reverse-engineered variant of the TOW. The Toophan became the foundation of Iran’s ATGM industry, with serial production beginning in the late 1980s. Additionally, Iran developed the Raad missile, modeled after the Soviet 9M14M Malyutka (AT-3b Sagger), which entered mass production in 1988 and was publicly unveiled in 1997. Over time, Iran expanded its ATGM arsenal, introducing more advanced variants of the Toophan and other systems with improved guidance and penetration capabilities. In recent years, Iran has expanded its anti-tank capabilities through the development and deployment of multiple missile systems. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) introduced a ground-launched version of the Almas anti-tank missile in July 2021, a top-attack system with an 8-kilometer range. In April 2023, the IRGC test-fired the Sadid-365, a guided anti-tank missile with a similar 8-kilometer range. In February 2024, Iran unveiled the Shafaq missile system, designed to engage armored targets at distances of up to 20 kilometers. These developments indicate Iran's efforts to improve its precision-guided anti-armor systems and increase the operational range of its anti-tank weapons. Additionally, Iran has renewed its focus on developing indigenous missile systems, including the hypersonic Fatah, the Paveh, and the ballistic Khorramshahr-4 missile, to support its defense strategy and enhance the capabilities of its armed forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/iran-tests-new-badr-anti-tank-guided-missile-to-modernize-its-infantry-strike-capabilities	2025-01-29T05:01:13-08:00

Spain Marks a Decade of Patriot System Deployment in Türkiye Under NATO Command	On January 26, 2025, Spain marked the tenth anniversary of its participation in the NATO Support to Türkiye mission, an initiative aimed at strengthening Türkiye’s air defense under NATO operations. Since 2015, Spanish armed forces have maintained a continuous presence in Adana with a PATRIOT surface-to-air missile battery, operating under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the operational control of Allied Air Command. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The PATRIOT system, designed to intercept and neutralize various airborne threats, plays a crucial role in this mission (Picture source: NATO) This ongoing commitment reflects Spain’s active role within NATO and its contribution to the collective security of its allies. Over the past ten years, the mission has required 21 rotations and involved nearly 3,000 Spanish military personnel, deployed successively to support the protection of Turkish airspace. NATO Support to Türkiye was established to enhance Türkiye’s air defense capabilities with the PATRIOT missile system, an integral component of NATO’s air defense network, designed to counter aerial and ballistic threats. The mission traces its origins to 2013 when the Turkish government requested assistance from NATO due to security risks stemming from the conflict in Syria. Following a decision by NATO foreign ministers, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands deployed PATRIOT batteries to counter ballistic threats. In 2015, Spain took over the deployment, stationing a unit in Adana, where it continues its mission today. Spain currently operates three PATRIOT missile batteries. The first was acquired second-hand from Germany in 2004, followed by two more in 2014, enhancing Spain’s capability to meet NATO air defense requirements. One of these batteries has been permanently stationed in Türkiye since 2015, ensuring continuous surveillance and protection of Turkish airspace. To further strengthen these capabilities, Spain received authorization in October 2023 to acquire four additional PATRIOT PAC-3+ systems for €2.67 billion. This acquisition aligns with efforts to modernize air defense systems and address evolving threats. The PATRIOT system, designed to intercept and neutralize various airborne threats, plays a crucial role in this mission. It includes a passive electronically scanned array radar (AN/MPQ-53 or AN/MPQ-65), an AN/MSQ-104 control station, launchers mounted on M860 semi-trailers towed by M983 HEMTT trucks, and missiles housed in launch containers. Its ability to detect, track, and engage enemy targets makes it a key asset in safeguarding Turkish airspace. With a range of 70 km and an interception altitude exceeding 24 km, the PATRIOT system is capable of countering tactical ballistic missiles, aircraft, and unmanned aerial threats. The PAC-3 variant, featuring direct-impact technology, provides increased precision against ballistic missiles, while each launcher can carry up to four PAC-2 missiles or sixteen PAC-3 missiles, significantly enhancing the system’s firepower. Its rapid deployment capability—less than an hour—and resistance to electronic countermeasures ensure an effective and responsive defense. The continued Spanish deployment in Türkiye relies on close cooperation between NATO allies. As the host nation, Türkiye provides the operational framework for Spanish forces to carry out their mission effectively. Additionally, logistical support from the U.S. Air Force’s 39th Air Base Wing, based in Incirlik, plays a vital role in maintaining the system’s operational readiness. This collaboration underscores the broader alliance commitments to regional and international security. During the ceremony marking this milestone, officials highlighted Spain’s contribution to the mission.

Analysis: President Trump Orders Next-Gen Missile Shield: How US Plans to Defend Against New Missile Threats?	U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to develop a 'next-generation missile defense shield' to protect the U.S. from aerial threats, including hypersonic weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and cruise missiles. The executive order, signed on January 28, 2025, directs the U.S. Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed plan within 60 days, outlining the technology, deployment strategy, and budget for this ambitious project.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Integrated Battle Command System continues to demonstrate its transformative Air and Missile Defense integration capability through participating in the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor live fire flight tests. LTAMDS is a new, advanced sensor developed to integrate into the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture and will replace the current Patriot radar. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The initiative, being informally called 'America’s Iron Dome,' seeks to reinforce U.S. homeland defense by integrating advanced interception technologies and potentially even space-based defenses. However, the plan raises several key questions: How will it differ from existing U.S. missile defense systems? What additional protection does America actually need? And is such an initiative even feasible given current military capabilities and budget constraints? The United States already has one of the most advanced and layered air and missile defense architectures in the world, protecting against various threats ranging from enemy aircraft to ballistic missiles. This system comprises land, sea, and space-based assets that work together to detect, track, and neutralize potential threats. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is the U.S.'s primary defense against long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched by adversaries like North Korea, China, and Russia. It is based in Alaska and California, with 44 interceptor missiles designed to engage incoming threats outside the Earth's atmosphere in mid-flight. However, the GMD system has been criticized for inconsistent test results and limited capacity against multiple incoming missiles or decoys. Deployed on U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system can intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system uses the SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 interceptors and is crucial for defending the U.S. fleet and key allies such as Japan and South Korea. Aegis Ashore installations in Romania and Poland also serve as land-based missile defense sites against regional threats. Meanwhile, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their final phase before impact. It is deployed in locations such as Guam, South Korea, and the U.S. mainland, providing additional protection for key military installations. Unlike Israel’s Iron Dome, THAAD does not counter short-range threats like drones and artillery. The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system is widely used for defending against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and enemy aircraft. Patriots have been deployed in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific to counter threats from adversaries such as Iran and North Korea. However, their effectiveness against hypersonic missiles remains a concern. For short-range air defense, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) is used to defend Washington, D.C., and key locations against cruise missiles, drones, and aircraft. The Avenger system, mounted on Humvees, provides mobile low-altitude protection against drones and helicopters. Beyond ground-based defenses, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) provides early missile warning by detecting heat signatures from launches around the globe. Future Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensors (HBTSS) will enhance tracking and targeting of hypersonic weapons. Trump’s new directive aims to create a more comprehensive defense system that goes beyond the existing regional and strategic defenses currently in place. Unlike Israel’s Iron Dome, which specializes in intercepting short-range rockets and artillery, Trump’s version is expected to address ICBMs, hypersonic missiles, and long-range cruise missiles. The system may incorporate directed energy weapons (lasers) and space-based interceptors to neutralize threats earlier in flight. Current defenses are focused on military installations and strategic sites. Trump’s proposal might include localized air defense systems for major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. The plan could involve integrating AI and advanced radar networks to detect and neutralize incoming threats faster. However, several challenges and concerns exist. Missile defense is expensive. The existing GMD program alone has cost over $67 billion, and THAAD and Aegis programs also require billions in maintenance and upgrades. A nationwide missile shield could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, raising concerns about affordability and congressional approval. Technical feasibility is also a major concern. Intercepting hypersonic missiles is extremely difficult. China and Russia are rapidly advancing their hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) programs, and current U.S. defenses struggle to track and intercept them. Space-based interceptors, while promising, have not yet been proven effective in real-world scenarios. Geopolitically, Russia and China have strongly opposed U.S. missile defense expansions, arguing that such systems could destabilize global strategic balance. A more advanced U.S. missile shield might provoke adversaries to develop more offensive missile capabilities, triggering a new arms race. Trump’s new missile defense initiative marks a major shift in U.S. national security strategy, aiming for comprehensive homeland protection beyond current regional defenses. While enhancing air defense is crucial given the rise of hypersonic and advanced missile threats, the plan faces significant technical, financial, and geopolitical hurdles. As the Pentagon prepares its report within 60 days, the world will be watching closely to see whether Trump’s vision for a next-generation missile shield will become a revolutionary step in U.S. defense—or an unattainable dream.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-president-trump-orders-next-gen-missile-shield-how-us-plans-to-defend-against-new-missile-threats	2025-01-29T03:58:16-08:00	
Spanish Navy’s Flagship to Operate SIRTAP Drone for Next-Gen Carrier-Based Drone Missions	According to information published by Airbus on January 28, 2025, Airbus and Navantia have launched an initiative to integrate the SIRTAP tactical unmanned aerial system (UAS) into the Juan Carlos I (L61) amphibious assault ship. This effort focuses on seamless integration with the ship’s combat systems, secure real-time data transmission, and safe launch and recovery procedures in maritime conditions. The initiative reflects a broader trend in modern naval warfare, where unmanned systems play an increasingly critical role in surveillance, reconnaissance, force projection, and operational flexibility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Spanish drone SIRTAP on the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I. (Picture source: Airbus Defence) The core of the integration lies in linking SIRTAP with the SCOMBA combat management system, which acts as the command and control backbone of the ship. This requires adapting the UAV’s data transmission capabilities to work within the ship’s sensor fusion and fire control network, ensuring real-time situational awareness across all operational units. The challenge involves optimizing latency-free communication between the UAV and onboard operators, allowing for effective reconnaissance and target acquisition. This will demand a robust, encrypted data link capable of resisting electronic warfare threats, ensuring that adversaries cannot disrupt ISR operations through jamming, cyber intrusions, or signal spoofing. Operating a fixed-wing UAV from a ship like the Juan Carlos I requires precise launch and recovery adaptations. The ship’s flight deck, originally designed for Harrier fighter jets and helicopters, lacks the catapult systems typically used for fixed-wing UAVs. Airbus and Navantia must either develop a dedicated net or arrestor-based recovery system or modify SIRTAP’s software for precision-assisted landings using optical, radar, and inertial navigation cues. Stability during takeoff and landing is further complicated by the ship’s movement, deck pitching, and unpredictable wind patterns, requiring advanced stabilization algorithms and real-time course corrections to ensure successful drone operations in varying sea states. The flight control software and autonomous guidance system must be modified to integrate with the ship’s aviation coordination framework. This includes adapting the UAV’s autopilot to work with ship-based navigation radars and inertial stabilization systems, ensuring precise positioning even in rough seas. The ability to execute automated landings with AI-assisted adjustments for wind conditions, deck movement, and aircraft deconfliction is critical, especially when operating in a mixed-aircraft environment. With existing air operations including AV-8B Harrier II jets, NH90 helicopters, and SH-60 Seahawk helicopters, the introduction of a UAV requires new air traffic control protocols, ensuring that drone launch and recovery do not interfere with manned aircraft operations. Expanding the ISR capabilities of Juan Carlos I, SIRTAP will provide beyond-line-of-sight reconnaissance, essential for anti-submarine warfare, maritime interdiction, amphibious assault coordination, and early warning threat detection. The UAV’s ability to track surface contacts, monitor littoral zones, and relay real-time intelligence to deployed forces significantly extends the ship’s operational reach, reducing reliance on traditional airborne surveillance assets. With its multi-sensor payload, including electro-optical, infrared, and maritime radar systems, SIRTAP can detect and track naval threats, identify irregular maritime activity, and provide force protection against asymmetric threats such as swarm drone attacks or small fast-attack craft. The integration of an automated launch and recovery system (ALRS) will be essential for enabling repeatable, reliable UAV operations at sea. The lack of a dedicated runway means SIRTAP will require either a shipborne recovery system using arresting cables, nets, or a robotic arm-assisted capture mechanism, or modifications that allow short-roll landings on the deck with rapid retrieval. Launch operations must also account for deck stability, wave motion, and wind interference, requiring adaptive flight control settings based on real-time meteorological and ship movement data. With increasing reliance on network-centric warfare, ensuring secure UAV communication and data sharing within the Spanish Navy’s fleet-wide tactical network is crucial. SIRTAP’s integration must support multi-platform interoperability, allowing data to be distributed not just to the Juan Carlos I but also to supporting assets such as frigates, offshore patrol vessels, and allied maritime task forces. To achieve this, Airbus and Navantia will likely implement tactical datalink protocols similar to NATO’s Link 16 or Link 22 standards, ensuring that ISR feeds can be shared with joint and coalition forces for enhanced situational awareness and coordinated mission execution. The introduction of SIRTAP aboard Juan Carlos I represents a technological leap in Spanish naval doctrine, marking the first true integration of a tactical UAV into a Spanish Navy amphibious and power projection platform. Beyond its immediate ISR benefits, the program paves the way for future UAV deployments across Spain’s surface fleet, including potential applications aboard the F-110 frigates and BAM offshore patrol vessels. The knowledge gained from integrating a fixed-wing UAV into a naval aviation environment will inform future unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) programs, shaping the next generation of manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) concepts in Spanish maritime operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/spanish-navys-flagship-to-operate-sirtap-drone-for-next-gen-carrier-based-drone-missions	2025-01-29T03:55:11-08:00

The F-35’s structural integrity, fire suppression systems, and redundant flight controls further enhance pilot safety, ensuring that even in the event of a crash, pilots have the highest chance of survival. The Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where the crash occurred, plays a strategic role in U.S. and allied military operations, particularly in Indo-Pacific air defense and Arctic security. The base was selected in 2016 to host 54 F-35A aircraft, making it a key hub for fifth-generation fighter operations in the region. The F-35A Lightning II, the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant, is known for its stealth capabilities, advanced sensor fusion, and networked combat systems, making it a critical asset in modern air warfare. While the F-35 program has faced technical challenges and occasional accidents, it continues to evolve with software upgrades, avionics improvements, and enhanced pilot training. Each crash is followed by a detailed investigation to improve safety protocols and address any mechanical or pilot-related issues. The findings from the Eielson AFB crash will contribute to further improvements in operational readiness and flight safety. The most recent F-35 crash before this one occurred on September 17, 2023, when a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B crashed in South Carolina after the pilot ejected due to a flight control malfunction. That incident gained widespread attention because the aircraft continued flying on autopilot for nearly 60 miles before crashing in a remote area. Other notable crashes include the December 1, 2022, crash in Texas, where an F-35B suffered an issue during a vertical landing test, and the October 19, 2022, crash in Utah, where an F-35A crashed after pilot disorientation led to a loss of control. Despite these incidents, the F-35 program remains the most widely adopted fifth-generation fighter aircraft worldwide. The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, along with international operators like the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Italy, and Israel, continue to expand their fleets, reaffirming confidence in the aircraft’s combat effectiveness and safety record. The latest crash at Eielson AFB is unlikely to impact long-term operations, but it serves as a reminder of the inherent risks of high-performance military aviation and the continuous efforts to improve flight safety across the F-35 fleet.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/f-35-nears-1-100-deliveries-as-15th-crash-in-alaska-confirms-safety-record-remains-strong	2025-01-29T01:25:35-08:00

For the first time, F-35 stealth fighters from all three nations will operate together in the Cope North exercise, scheduled from February 3 to 21 at Andersen Air Force Base. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan will deploy six F-35As, two E-2D Hawkeye early warning aircraft, a KC-46A Pegasus tanker, and 250 personnel from the 3rd Air Wing, Airborne Warning and Control Wing, and 3rd Tactical Airlift Group (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) Organized under the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) command, this exercise aims to enhance interoperability between the participating forces and strengthen their ability to conduct complex operations in a modern combat environment. The focus will be on aerial combat and large-force employment, providing an opportunity for pilots and command structures to refine their coordination against opponents with similar capabilities. General Hiroaki Uchikura, Chief of Staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), emphasized the importance of this training in evaluating strategies and tactics against comparable threats. The F-35A Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole stealth fighter developed by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. Air Force under the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. As the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant of the F-35 family, it is designed for air superiority, precision strikes, and close air support. Equipped with advanced stealth, cutting-edge avionics, and real-time sensor fusion, the F-35A is capable of operating in contested environments, detecting and engaging targets beyond visual range (BVR). Its AN/APG-81 AESA radar, Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provide enhanced situational awareness, complemented by the Helmet-Mounted Display System (HMDS), which projects tactical data directly onto the pilot’s visor. The F-35A carries a diverse array of armaments, including an internal M61A2 Vulcan 20mm cannon, AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, as well as GBU-31 JDAM and GBU-39 SDB guided bombs for precision strikes. The integration of the AGM-88 HARM missile allows it to conduct suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions. Designed for interoperability with allied forces, the aircraft has been adopted by multiple nations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Norway, and other NATO and strategic partners. Powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135-PW-100 engine, it reaches speeds of Mach 1.6 with a combat range of over 2,200 km, making it a key asset in modern air operations. Japan will deploy six F-35As, accompanied by two E-2D Advanced Hawkeye early warning aircraft and a KC-46A Pegasus tanker, with approximately 250 personnel from the 3rd Air Wing, the Airborne Warning and Control Wing at Misawa Air Base, and the 3rd Tactical Airlift Group at Miho Air Base. Cope North, first launched in 1978 as a bilateral U.S.-Japan training exercise, has evolved into a large-scale multinational operation, incorporating Australia in 2012. In 1999, the exercise moved from Misawa to Guam in response to expanding operational requirements, allowing for larger deployments and more comprehensive combat simulations. The increasing role of the F-35 in joint operations reflects the three nations’ commitment to strengthening deterrence capabilities in the region. In 2023, the JASDF deployed two F-35s to Australia for the first time, seen as a preparatory step for potential future deployments. This rapid relocation capability holds strategic importance amid growing regional security concerns. The vulnerability of Japanese air bases to ballistic and cruise missile threats has led Japan to explore alternative operational strategies to ensure continuity in a conflict scenario. The potential use of allied bases, particularly in Australia and Guam, would enable more effective force dispersion in case of hostilities. Andersen Air Force Base, located at a greater distance from China, serves as a key hub for trilateral air operations. However, the expansion of China’s long-range strike capabilities has prompted the United States to consider additional options, such as Wake Island, to bolster its defense posture. This exercise highlights a significant shift in military cooperation within the Indo-Pacific. The joint deployment of F-35s by these three nations underscores their shared objective of maintaining regional security and stability amid evolving threats. Through Cope North, the air forces of the United States, Japan, and Australia continue efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, reinforcing operational readiness and enhancing mutual capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/f-35s-from-three-nations-conduct-joint-drills-in-guam-to-strengthen-indo-pacific-air-operations	2025-01-29T00:34:47-08:00

US Navy's Medium Landing Ship (LSM) Program: Transforming Amphibious Warfare for Indo-Pacific	The Navy Medium Landing Ship (LSM) Program: Background and Issues for Congress, published on January 23, 2025, examines the Navy’s initiative to develop a fleet of 18 to 35 cost-effective amphibious vessels, a key component of the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy, aimed at enhancing U.S. operational agility in Indo-Pacific maritime environments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The US Navy's new Medium Landing Ship (LSM) will play a pivotal role in supporting the Marine Corps' island-hopping operations under the Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy in the Indo-Pacific. (Picture source: US Congress) The U.S. Navy’s Medium Landing Ship (LSM) program, formerly known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW) initiative, is a crucial component of the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy. Designed to operate in contested maritime environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, the program aims to procure between 18 and 35 amphibious ships. These vessels will enhance the Marine Corps’ ability to rapidly deploy, maneuver, and sustain small, mobile units as part of the broader U.S. military concept of Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO). The Navy’s proposed FY2025 budget includes $268.1 million to procure the lead ship in the program. Subsequent vessels are expected to be less costly due to the distribution of nonrecurring engineering and design costs, with per-ship costs stabilizing around $152.5 to $155.7 million by FY2029. The first ship in the class, named LSM-1 'McClung' in honor of Major Megan M. L. McClung, a Marine Corps officer killed in action during the Iraq War, is expected to be delivered in February 2029, following a contract award in March 2025. The LSM program emphasizes affordability, simplicity, and operational efficiency. The ships are smaller and less expensive to operate than traditional amphibious vessels like the LHA, LHD, and LPD classes. They are designed with a shallow draft, enabling them to operate in littoral waters and beach directly onshore. Each ship will have the capacity to transport 50 Marines, 648 short tons of equipment, and provide approximately 8,000 square feet of deck cargo space. Equipped with a helicopter landing pad, roll-on/roll-off beaching capability, and light defensive armament, the LSM is tailored for the Marine Corps’ vision of swift, distributed, shore-to-shore operations. The LSM is essential to the Marine Corps’ EABO strategy, which focuses on small, platoon-sized units maneuvering across island chains to deny adversaries sea control. These units are envisioned to operate from remote bases, conducting missions such as firing anti-ship cruise missiles, providing forward arming and refueling for aircraft, and delivering intelligence and early warning capabilities. The LSM’s ability to transport, sustain, and support these forces will play a pivotal role in countering potential adversaries, particularly China, in the Western Pacific. Congressional oversight of the program has intensified, with concerns about cost estimates, schedule risks, and design stability. Historical challenges with lead-ship construction in Navy programs, such as significant cost overruns and delays, remain a point of contention. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected higher per-ship costs than the Navy’s estimates, with a potential average cost of $340-430 million compared to the Navy’s projection of approximately $150 million per ship for the first eight vessels. In December 2024, the Navy canceled its original Request for Proposals (RFP) for the LSM program due to higher-than-expected bids and is now exploring the acquisition of non-developmental vessels as an interim solution. Efforts to refine the program include examining the possibility of adapting existing Army Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) or using commercially available designs to meet operational needs. Army watercraft, such as the General Frank S. Besson-class and Runnymede-class vessels, have been identified as potential options for bridging the capability gap. These vessels, already equipped with beaching capabilities and significant cargo capacity, could provide a cost-effective alternative while the Navy works to refine the LSM’s final design. The industrial base implications of the program are another critical aspect under congressional review. The Navy has indicated a preference for having a single shipyard build all LSMs but remains open to multi-yard construction if it expedites delivery or reduces costs. The program has the potential to distribute shipbuilding work across multiple U.S. yards, fostering competition and strengthening the industrial base. However, lawmakers have expressed concerns that delays or design immaturity could lead to costly rework and jeopardize the program’s long-term affordability. The Marine Corps has also explored interim solutions to address the operational gap before the LSM becomes operational. These include chartering civilian vessels, using existing Navy platforms like the Expeditionary Fast Transport (T-EPF), and experimenting with commercially available stern landing vessels. These bridging efforts aim to support Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs), which have already begun forming in regions like Hawaii, where they are tasked with testing the EABO concept in realistic scenarios. Despite the program’s challenges, the LSM remains a critical investment for the future of U.S. naval and amphibious operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navys-medium-landing-ship-lsm-program-transforming-amphibious-warfare-for-indo-pacific	2025-01-28T07:23:30-08:00

However, the program faces challenges, including rising costs, procurement delays, and evolving operational requirements, prompting heightened scrutiny from Congress and defense stakeholders. The TAGOS-25 class ships are designed to gather undersea acoustic data using the advanced Surveillance Towed-Array Sensor System (SURTASS). This data supports ASW missions by providing critical insights into submarine activities, particularly from near-peer adversaries such as China and Russia. The current TAGOS fleet comprises five vessels—four Victorious-class ships commissioned between 1991 and 1993, and one Impeccable-class ship commissioned in 2000. All are homeported in Yokohama, Japan, and feature the Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) design, which enhances stability in high seas, an essential attribute for extended surveillance operations. The new TAGOS-25 class builds on this legacy, employing a larger and faster SWATH design to improve operational efficiency. Named the Explorer class in January 2025, the first two ships, Don Walsh and Victor Vescovo, honor pioneers in exploration, reflecting the Navy’s acknowledgment of the critical role these vessels will play in charting the future of undersea surveillance. The Navy plans to procure seven Explorer-class ships to replace the five aging vessels, but procurement schedules have been adjusted, with the second ship deferred from FY2025 to FY2026. The revised schedule anticipates the procurement of one ship annually from FY2026 to FY2029 under the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), with the final two ships planned beyond this timeline. Cost escalation has become a major concern. The estimated cost of the first TAGOS-25 ship has risen to $789.6 million, marking an increase of nearly 82% over initial projections. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, and higher non-recurring engineering expenses are cited as contributing factors. Additionally, procurement costs for the sixth and seventh ships have been adjusted upward to reflect these trends, raising questions about whether similar adjustments will be necessary for earlier ships in the class. The first ship’s design and construction have also faced delays, with a reported one-year setback raising concerns about the program’s overall schedule. The Navy awarded Austal USA a $113.9 million contract in May 2023 for the design of the TAGOS-25 class, with options for up to seven ships. If all options are exercised, the total contract value could reach $3.2 billion. In May 2024, Austal received a $516 million contract modification for long-lead materials and construction of the first ship, signaling progress but also highlighting the financial complexity of the program. The decision to defer FY2025 funding for the TAGOS-25 program has drawn attention from Congress. Lawmakers have expressed concerns over the implications of this delay on fleet readiness, particularly as adversaries continue to modernize their submarine capabilities. The deferral aligns with broader budgetary adjustments but underscores the importance of maintaining momentum in delivering these critical assets. Strategically, the TAGOS-25 program is essential to countering submarine threats from adversaries like China, which has made significant advancements in its nuclear-powered attack submarine fleet. The Explorer-class ships will provide enhanced surveillance capabilities, ensuring the Navy remains at the forefront of undersea warfare and maritime dominance. While the program promises to strengthen the Navy’s ability to monitor global undersea activities, challenges such as cost growth, schedule delays, and shifting procurement timelines must be addressed to ensure its success.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navy-tagos-25-explorer-class-ships-cost-overruns-delays-and-strategic-importance-in-anti-submarine-warfare	2025-01-28T06:26:33-08:00

The Fennek’s advanced capabilities make it an essential asset in modern military operations, particularly for NATO forces operating in sensitive and high-risk areas like the Baltic region. Lithuania, as part of NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) initiative, has been hosting multinational troops since 2017. This initiative was launched as a direct response to increasing Russian aggression and instability in the region. The presence of NATO forces in Lithuania ensures that the alliance can respond rapidly to any security challenges that may arise in the Baltic region, particularly in light of Lithuania's proximity to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The eFP mission is not just about deterring aggression; it also aims to promote stability and cooperation within NATO, enhancing the alliance's collective defense capabilities through joint exercises, shared resources, and regular training. As of January 2025, the NATO eFP Battle Group in Lithuania comprises approximately 1,200 personnel from Germany, Norway, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. The German Armed Forces lead the eFP mission, contributing a substantial number of infantry and support units. Norway, for its part, provides artillery and logistical support, while the Czech forces contribute armored units and infantry, enhancing the brigade’s overall combat power. The Netherlands, with the addition of the Fennek reconnaissance vehicles, continues to play a vital role in strengthening the unit’s intelligence-gathering and surveillance capabilities. This multinational composition of forces is a key feature of NATO's eFP strategy, providing both operational flexibility and a powerful demonstration of collective defense. The Fennek vehicles, with their advanced reconnaissance systems, play a vital role in improving the overall intelligence-gathering capabilities of the eFP Battle Group. In an era of complex and evolving threats, the ability to monitor and assess the battlefield in real time is crucial for maintaining a credible deterrence and ensuring NATO's readiness to respond to any challenges.

Trump Launches Iron Dome Project to Protect US From Ballistic Missiles	On January 27, 2025, in a speech delivered in Miami, President Donald Trump announced the launch of an ambitious missile defense project aimed at protecting the United States from a wide range of threats, including ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missiles. Dubbed the 'Iron Dome for America,' the initiative draws inspiration from Israel's well-known system designed to intercept rockets and short-range missiles while incorporating advanced technologies tailored to the specific needs of the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The partnership between Raytheon Technologies and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has led to the development of the SkyHunter, a U.S.-adapted version of Israel’s Iron Dome (Picture source: Army Recognition) In an executive order signed the same day, Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to submit a detailed plan within 60 days for this defense shield. Among the proposed solutions are space-based interceptors, underscoring the administration's interest in leveraging space technologies for national defense. 'The United States will not remain passive in the face of countries like China and Russia advancing militarization in space,' Trump stated, linking this initiative to earlier efforts during his first presidency, such as the creation of the Space Force in 2019. Trump emphasized that the system would provide unparalleled protection, similar to the Israeli Iron Dome, which has demonstrated its effectiveness by intercepting thousands of rockets launched from Gaza and Lebanon. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in collaboration with Israel Aerospace Industries, the Iron Dome relies on the EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptor missiles to counter short-range threats with an interception rate close to 90%. However, many experts argue that simply replicating the Iron Dome technology would not be sufficient to defend a nation as vast as the United States, which primarily faces threats from intercontinental and hypersonic missiles. These advanced threats demand more sophisticated solutions, potentially including orbital platforms and laser defense systems. The current geopolitical environment, marked by the growing missile capabilities of China and Russia and the proliferation of advanced missile technologies, highlights the need for an adaptable and robust defense system. Space-related threats, such as anti-satellite weapons and hypersonic missiles capable of evading conventional systems, have further driven the Trump administration to explore innovative defensive measures. In 2024, Israel demonstrated the effectiveness of a multi-layered defense system during an attack involving over 300 Iranian drones and ballistic missiles. This approach, combining the Iron Dome with the David’s Sling and Arrow systems, may serve as a model for the U.S. However, adapting this concept to the scale and complexity of U.S. defense requirements poses significant challenges. Since 2019, the U.S. Army has acquired two Iron Dome batteries to protect specific strategic bases from localized attacks. The partnership between Raytheon Technologies and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has led to the development of the SkyHunter, a U.S.-adapted version of Israel’s Iron Dome. Designed to intercept and neutralize rockets, artillery shells, drones, and short-range missiles, the SkyHunter retains the key features of the Iron Dome, including the EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptors. However, it has been tailored to meet specific U.S. requirements. As part of this collaboration, Raytheon localized part of the production process, establishing a manufacturing facility in Arizona to produce critical components such as the Tamir interceptors. This move not only strengthens the U.S. defense industrial base but also ensures compliance with congressional mandates for domestic production, making the SkyHunter a vital asset in America’s layered defense strategy. Trump has insisted that this new system will be fully designed and manufactured domestically, highlighting the importance of national technological capabilities. However, the financial, technological, and strategic hurdles remain considerable. Developing a defense shield incorporating space-based interceptors will require extensive research and significant funding, raising concerns about the feasibility of achieving such a goal within a reasonable timeframe. While the concept of an 'Iron Dome for America' represents a recognition of modern threats, its realization faces numerous challenges. This project has the potential to become a pivotal development in U.S. national defense, but its success will depend on overcoming technical, financial, and political obstacles in the coming months.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/trump-launches-iron-dome-project-to-protect-us-from-ballistic-missiles	2025-01-28T01:14:43-08:00	
Analysis: Iran's confirmation of Su-35 fighter jet purchase could threaten US air superiority in the Middle East	As reported by Radio Farda on January 27, 2025, Iran officially confirmed the purchase of Russian Su-35 fighter jets. General Ali Shadmani, Deputy Chief of Staff at the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, announced that the acquisition aims to strengthen the country's air, land, and naval forces, including a. He did not disclose the number of aircraft purchased or their delivery status. This statement marks the first official confirmation from a senior Iranian official regarding the deal, which Army Recognition had hinted over the past two years as being aimed at countering Israeli variants of the American F-35 Lightning II, F-15 Eagle, and F-16 Fighting Falcon.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Su-35's Irbis-E radar, a passive electronically scanned array, is one of its key advantages, as it can detect and track up to 30 targets simultaneously and engage up to eight, with a maximum detection range of 400 kilometers for larger targets. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) Iran’s efforts to acquire modern Russian fighter jets date back to 2007, when it explored purchasing Su-30MK aircraft, but these discussions were halted by international sanctions and concerns over Iran's nuclear program. Attempts in 2015 to procure Su-30SM jets, including requests for domestic production rights, also failed. Iranian media previously reported that personnel began training on Su-35 operations in Russia in 2022. In 2023, reports surfaced that Iran and Russia had finalized a deal for Su-35SE fighters, following Iran’s provision of drones and missile technology to Russia during the Ukraine conflict. Initially, 25 Su-35SE jets were ordered, but this number was later increased to 50. The first two jets were delivered in late 2024, signaling the beginning of their integration into Iran’s air force as replacements for older American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, acquired in the 1970s. These new jets will complement Iran's existing fleet, which includes Russian MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft, as well as domestically produced models like the Saeqeh and Kowsar. Iran has made significant upgrades to its airbases to accommodate the Su-35SE. Notably, the first two Su-35SE jets were delivered disassembled by cargo plane to Tehran, where they were subsequently assembled at Hamadan Air Base. This base, also referred to as the 3rd Tactical Air Base, now features new, larger hangars specifically designed for these larger aircraft. Additionally, Iran has constructed fortified facilities, including the underground Eagle 44 airbase unveiled in early 2023, to enhance the security and operational readiness of its air assets, including its Su-35s. These facilities are strategically located near Tehran, key nuclear sites, and regions requiring rapid air defense response, ensuring that the new fighters can operate securely and effectively while reducing vulnerability to airstrikes in centralized locations. Alongside the Su-35SE, Iran has acquired Yak-130 trainer aircraft, with deliveries starting in 2023, and Mi-28 attack helicopters, reportedly for use by the Revolutionary Guard Corps. In October 2024, reports also indicated that Iran has expressed interest in Su-30 fighter jets and may seek a license production agreement for both Su-35 and Su-30 aircraft, with plans for producing between 48 and 72 units. However, economic constraints and technical challenges make the feasibility of domestic production uncertain. While the F-35I Adir's stealth features reduce its radar cross-section, the Su-35SE's infrared search and track (IRST) system can detect aircraft based on heat signatures, potentially mitigating this advantage. (Picture source: Twitter/J.J.) Iran and Russia have been increasingly strengthening their military and economic ties in recent years, particularly in the face of Western sanctions. In early 2024, Iran joined the BRICS geopolitical bloc, aligning itself more closely with nations seeking alternatives to the Western-led global order. The comprehensive strategic partnership agreement signed between Tehran and Moscow emphasizes joint military efforts against common threats, intelligence exchanges, and collaboration to counter sanctions. For instance, Iran has supported Russia with drones and ballistic missiles during the conflict in Ukraine, while Russia has reciprocated with the delivery of modern assets, including the Murmansk-BN electronic warfare system to counter Israeli F-35s. The Su-35SE is an export version of the Sukhoi Su-35, a 4+ generation multirole fighter jet developed as a modernization of the Su-27 Flanker. It incorporates modern avionics, twin Saturn AL-41F1S afterburning turbofan engines, and thrust-vectoring nozzles, which contribute to its maneuverability. The Irbis-E radar, a passive electronically scanned array, can detect and track up to 30 targets simultaneously and engage up to eight, with a maximum detection range of 400 kilometers for larger targets. The Su-35 is equipped with 12 hardpoints, supporting a payload of up to 8,000 kilograms, including air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, and a 30mm GSh-30-1 internal cannon. While not designed as a stealth aircraft, it features electronic countermeasure systems aimed at disrupting enemy radar and missile systems, improving its operational survivability. With a combat radius exceeding 2,000 kilometers and the ability to launch the R-37M missile, capable of tracking targets at ranges up to 400 kilometers, the Su-35 allows Iran to project power across the region, including the Straits of Hormuz and beyond, as well as conduct extended air patrols over the Persian Gulf. These capabilities could improve Iran's ability to monitor and potentially challenge Turkish, Israeli, and US naval operations in the region, secure key air corridors, and provide air support to allied forces in conflict zones such as Syria. The Su-35’s combination of advanced radar and missile systems also strengthen Iran’s ability to counter air incursions and defend strategic sites. Additionally, its deployment at fortified bases such as Hamadan Air Base and Eagle 44 ensures the security and operational readiness of the aircraft, which could influence the defense strategies of regional adversaries, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, while reshaping the balance of air power in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Su-35SE offers specific capabilities that could be considered advantageous against the Israeli variants of the American F-35 Lightning II, F-15 Eagle, and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Its Irbis-E radar can detect targets at ranges up to 400 kilometers, which may allow it to identify non-stealth aircraft such as the F-15I Ra'am and F-16I Sufa before being detected. In beyond-visual-range (BVR) scenarios, the Su-35SE's R-37 missiles have a longer range compared to the AIM-120D missiles used by these fighters. In within-visual-range (WVR) engagements, its thrust-vectoring engines enable high maneuverability, which could provide an advantage over the F-15I and F-16I. While the F-35I Adir's stealth features reduce its radar cross-section, the Su-35SE's infrared search and track (IRST) system can detect aircraft based on heat signatures, potentially mitigating this advantage. Actual combat performance would depend on factors such as pilot expertise, mission objectives, and supporting systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/analysis-irans-confirmation-of-su-35-fighter-jet-purchase-could-threaten-us-air-superiority-in-the-middle-east	2025-01-28T01:01:49-08:00

US Army Revises Future XM-30 Combat Vehicle Requirements to Counter Lessons from Ukraine Conflict	The U.S. Army has requested to update its technical requirements for the future XM-30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle (MICV), taking into account the valuable lessons learned from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War. These updates are aimed at addressing the evolving threats posed by anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which have had a devastating impact on modern armored vehicles. Among the key updates is the integration of advanced active protection systems (APS) designed to shield the vehicle from these emerging threats. However, the question remains: will these APS be sufficient to address the full spectrum of dangers that have emerged in the Ukraine conflict? The XM-30’s design reflects a broader trend of adapting military hardware to counter the vulnerabilities exposed by recent combat operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment participate in a virtual simulation at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, offering feedback on potential crew configurations for the XM30 Combat Vehicle. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The XM-30 is a rebranding of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program, which was initiated to replace the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV). The Bradley, in service since 1981, has long been an essential platform for U.S. mechanized infantry units, providing mobility, fire support, and the ability to engage enemy combat vehicles. Over the years, it has undergone several upgrades, but it has now reached the technological limits of its capacity to integrate new electronics, armor, and defensive systems. Past efforts to replace the Bradley, including the Future Combat System (FCS) and Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) programs, were canceled due to cost overruns and programmatic challenges. The OMFV program, which began with the goal of creating a next-generation fighting vehicle, was designed with optionally manned capabilities. This means that the vehicle could operate with or without a crew, depending on the operational situation. This flexibility is essential in modern warfare, where unmanned systems and semi-autonomous technologies are becoming increasingly significant. The optional manning concept would allow the vehicle to operate remotely, minimizing risks to the crew in high-threat environments. The OMFV aimed to provide a versatile platform that could maneuver soldiers, engage in close combat, and deliver lethality while operating alongside unmanned systems. On June 26, 2023, after completing the initial digital design phase, the Army officially redesignated the OMFV as the XM-30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle. The XM-30 will be an integral part of the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) and is slated to replace the M-2 Bradley to provide the capabilities needed to engage and defeat near-peer adversaries. The XM-30 will not only transport soldiers but will also enhance their effectiveness in combat through its advanced technology, including the ability to control robotics and semi-autonomous systems. The vehicle’s optionally manned design ensures that it can operate with or without a crew, depending on the mission requirements. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has revealed a series of lessons about the vulnerability of armored vehicles to modern weapon systems. ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided Missiles) and UASs (Unmanned Aerial Systems) have emerged as primary threats to traditional armored platforms, with Ukrainian forces making extensive use of systems like the Javelin and NLAW to destroy Russian tanks and IFVs. At the same time, drones have proven to be an especially lethal threat, often used for precision strikes against armored vehicles. These platforms, which can fly at low altitudes and strike vulnerable targets with guided munitions, have highlighted the need for armored vehicles to evolve in response to these emerging threats. The vulnerability of armored vehicles to ATGMs is particularly concerning. These missiles, which can be launched from a distance by enemy forces in hidden or mobile positions, have been highly effective against tanks and IFVs. Similarly, UAS have demonstrated their ability to conduct precision strikes against armor, often targeting vulnerable points like turret rings or the tops of vehicles, where the armor is thinner. These new threats emphasize the importance of developing Active Protection Systems (APSs) that can detect and neutralize incoming projectiles before they reach their targets. In response to these threats, the XM-30 will be equipped with advanced APS designed to defend against ATGMs, rockets, and projectiles. APS are systems that use a combination of sensors and countermeasures to intercept and destroy incoming threats. These systems can include radar-guided interceptors, jammers, and even high-energy projectiles designed to neutralize missiles and rockets. The Army has identified APS as essential to the XM-30’s design to protect the vehicle from the types of threats that have become increasingly common in modern conflict. The integration of APS into the XM-30 is a direct response to the lessons learned from the Ukraine conflict, where drones and ATGMs have significantly impacted the effectiveness of armored vehicles. While APS like the Iron Fist or AMAP-ADS have shown promise in countering ATGMs, the challenge remains in adapting these systems to deal with the variety of threats now present on the battlefield, especially the diverse and fast-moving drones. UAS, with their low cost and high versatility, can be used to harass armored vehicles from a variety of angles, making them difficult targets for traditional defense systems. To address these challenges, the APS on the XM-30 will likely combine both kinetic and electronic countermeasures to address a broad range of threats. In addition to APS, the XM-30 will likely incorporate advanced electronic warfare capabilities to counter the growing threat of drones. These systems could include jammers that disrupt drone communications and guidance systems, or even directed-energy weapons (DEWs) designed to disable or destroy small drones mid-flight. With drones being used increasingly in swarms, APS will need to be adaptive and responsive, capable of distinguishing between threats and neutralizing them in real-time. The development of the XM-30 also highlights broader trends in armored vehicle design, particularly the shift toward multi-functional platforms that can operate alongside autonomous systems and integrate robotics. The vehicle is designed not only to transport soldiers and engage in combat but also to control and coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles and robotic systems on the battlefield. This approach allows for more flexible and dynamic operations, especially in complex, fast-moving combat environments. In the face of emerging threats and changing warfare dynamics, the XM-30 represents a significant evolution in infantry fighting vehicles. By incorporating advanced active protection systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and semi-autonomous features, it promises to enhance the survivability and lethality of U.S. forces in future conflicts. The lessons learned from the Russia-Ukraine War have played a pivotal role in shaping the XM-30’s design, ensuring that it will be better equipped to face the challenges posed by modern anti-tank systems and drones. As these technologies continue to evolve, the XM-30 will serve as a cornerstone of future U.S. Army operations, providing a new level of capability for mechanized infantry and setting the standard for next-generation combat vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-revises-future-xm-30-combat-vehicle-requirements-to-counter-lessons-from-ukraine-conflict	2025-01-27T09:34:12-08:00

This move reflects a deepening commitment by the U.S. to support Ukraine in its efforts to counter Russian invasion, though it also presents a challenge to the Army’s own armored vehicle fleet modernization. In response to the transfer, the U.S. Army has committed to replacing each of the 900 M-113s sent to Ukraine with new AMPVs (Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles), a platform designed to provide superior mobility, protection, and survivability for U.S. forces in combat. The AMPV is part of a broader effort to modernize the Army’s armored vehicle fleet and to replace legacy systems like the M-113 with more advanced, capable platforms. The AMPV family includes five distinct variants, each tailored to support different operational roles within Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs). These variants include the M1283 General Purpose (GP) variant, designed to support infantry during mounted and dismounted operations; the M1284 Medical Evacuation (ME) variant, which is equipped for CASEVAC operations; the M1285 Medical Treatment (MT) variant, a mobile surgery suite; the M1286 Mission Command (MCmd) variant, which enhances command and control capabilities; and the M1287 Mortar Carrier (MC) variant, which provides immediate mortar fire support. Each variant is engineered to offer increased operational flexibility, improved protection, and better survivability, ensuring U.S. forces are better equipped for the modern battlefield. However, replacing 900 M-113s with AMPVs presents several challenges for the U.S. Army. The AMPV program, which aims to procure a total of 2,897 units, has faced production delays and cost overruns in the past. A 2020 report highlighted struggles with meeting the Army's production targets while keeping per-vehicle costs within budget. With the additional demand for AMPVs to replace the M-113s sent to Ukraine, the Army’s production timeline will likely need to be accelerated, potentially straining an already tight schedule. This could result in further delays in fulfilling existing requirements for both Active Duty and National Guard units, which depend on the AMPV for modernization and readiness. The National Guard, in particular, could face significant challenges. Many of the M-113s being transferred are in use by National Guard Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), and sending these vehicles abroad could leave gaps in the Guard's vehicle inventory. This situation could affect operational readiness, as the Army National Guard plays a vital role in both domestic defense and overseas deployments. The Army will need to quickly backfill National Guard units with AMPVs, which may be difficult given the already stretched production schedule. Given the potential impacts on Army readiness, it is highly likely that Congress will scrutinize the AMPV program. Lawmakers are expected to raise concerns about the effects of the M-113 transfers on the Army’s ability to meet its operational requirements, particularly regarding the National Guard’s readiness. If the production of AMPVs is delayed or the per-vehicle costs rise due to the increased demand, there may be questions about the sustainability of the Army’s modernization efforts. Congressional oversight could lead to hearings or policy discussions to assess whether the Army’s one-to-one replacement strategy is feasible in the long term. The decision to transfer 900 M-113s and 300 armored medical vehicles to Ukraine demonstrates the U.S.’s ongoing support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. While these vehicles will provide much-needed resources for Ukraine’s defense, the impact on the Army’s modernization efforts cannot be overlooked. As the U.S. Army moves forward with replacing these vehicles with AMPVs, the balance between supporting Ukraine’s defense needs and maintaining U.S. military readiness will be critical. The Army will need to manage the production timeline carefully, ensure that costs remain manageable, and mitigate any disruptions to the National Guard’s operational capabilities. The U.S. Army’s plan to replace M-113s sent to Ukraine with AMPVs represents a significant step in both U.S. security assistance and military modernization. However, this move carries substantial implications for the Army’s production schedule, costs, and readiness, particularly within the National Guard. As these challenges unfold, Congress will likely play a key role in ensuring that U.S. defense capabilities are not compromised while supporting allies abroad. The Army’s ability to navigate these issues will determine whether this strategy is sustainable in the long term, balancing modernization with readiness and international commitments.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-to-replace-m-113-tracked-armored-vehicles-sent-to-ukraine-with-next-generation-ampv-combat-vehicles	2025-01-27T09:04:54-08:00

Spain Equips Its Paratroopers with New EIMOS Mortars Mounted on VAMTAC All-Terrain Vehicles	On January 22, 2025, Spain's 'Almogávares' VI Paratrooper Brigade (BRIPAC) became one of the first Spanish military units to be equipped with the new EIMOS mortars mounted on the VAMTAC ST5 all-terrain vehicle. This new fire support system was officially received by the BRIPAC at the end of 2024, marking an important step in strengthening the operational capabilities of the Spanish Army's infantry units. This was reported by Infodefensa on January 22, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The EIMOS mortars are mounted on the VAMTAC ST5 all-terrain vehicle. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The EIMOS (Expal Integrated Mortar System) is currently in use by the Second Paratrooper Battalion 'Roger de Lauria' at the Paracuellos de Jarama base near Madrid. The system is used for training purposes, and more units are expected to be delivered soon. This delivery comes from the nearby Park and Maintenance Center of Wheeled Vehicles (PCMVR) nº 1, where Rheinmetall Expal Munitions, the system’s supplier, handed over the equipment to the Spanish Army. In preparation for the new system, a small team of BRIPAC personnel attended a specialized maintenance training course last year at Rheinmetall Expal’s plant in Albacete. Additionally, members of both the Second Paratrooper Battalion and the 'Príncipe' Infantry Regiment no. 3, part of the 'Galicia' VII Brigade, also underwent a two-week technical training course at the BRIPAC’s facilities, conducted by Rheinmetall Expal technicians. The 'Galicia' VII Brigade is currently leading the Spanish contingent within the Multinational Brigade Slovakia (MN BDE SVK), a deployment that replaced the BRIPAC’s participation. In this multinational context, a support fires section equipped with the veteran Soltam Cardom mortar system, produced by the Israeli company Elbit, is deployed. This system also utilizes the VAMTAC ST5 as its mobile platform, which is planned to be replaced in the future by the EIMOS system. At the end of 2023, the Spanish Army’s Logistic Support Command (MALE) signed a contract with Rheinmetall Expal Systems for the acquisition of an initial batch of EIMOS mortars, valued at €8.2 million (approximately €10 million including VAT). The system is one of the fundamental components of the Army’s modernization, having been selected, evaluated, and tested within the framework of the 'Fuerza 35' project. This experimental unit, reporting to the 'Alfonso XII' Brigade no. II of the Spanish Legion has also received its share of the first batch of EIMOS mortars. The EIMOS is a solution developed by Expal (now part of Rheinmetall Expal Munitions) to fulfill a research and development program launched by Spain’s Ministry of Defence. It is designed to meet the needs of the Spanish Army and Navy (Marine Infantry) and provide a modern self-propelled mortar system. One of the most remarkable features of the EIMOS system is its fully automated firing control and 360º aiming capability, allowing for precise firing without requiring the vehicle to change its position or orientation. This advanced functionality enhances the 'shoot and scoot' tactic—firing support shots and quickly relocating to avoid counter-battery fire. The choice of the VAMTAC ST5, the Spanish military’s standard 4x4 armored platform, ensures seamless integration of the EIMOS system, especially for logistical support and maintenance. This is a key advantage for international deployments, such as Spain’s current involvement in Slovakia. Traditionally, most of the Spanish Army’s mortars require fixed emplacement, with entry and exit times that can limit the responsiveness of fire support operations. The EIMOS, however, allows for highly accurate firing on the move, eliminating the need for hydraulic mounts for stabilization during firing. Thus, compared to systems like the Soltam Cardom, positioning times are reduced. Positioning and firing calculations are fully automated via the TALOS Command and Control System, which is also used by the Spanish Army’s field artillery units, ensuring interoperability across different platforms and enhancing operational efficiency. The EIMOS system represents a major leap in the Spanish Army’s mortar capabilities, offering increased mobility, precision, and operational flexibility. As the Army continues to modernize to meet the demands of modern warfare, the EIMOS system is set to play a key role in ensuring effective and rapid fire support, both in national and international operations. With more units expected to be delivered, the EIMOS system is destined to strengthen the capabilities of Spain’s armed forces in the years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/spain-equips-its-paratroopers-with-new-eimos-mortars-mounted-on-vamtac-all-terrain-vehicles	2025-01-27T01:00:38-08:00	
Ukraine’s Revolutionary Drone Carriers Transform Robotic Warfare	According to information published by The Telegraph on January 23, 2025, Ukraine is pioneering a new era of robotic warfare with the deployment of drone carriers, a breakthrough technology that may redefine modern military operations. Leveraging innovative unmanned systems, the Ukrainian military has showcased the operational debut of satellite-controlled unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) equipped with smaller, one-way attack drones. This development exemplifies the ingenuity driving Ukraine’s defense efforts amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ukrainian Naval Drone Magura V5. (Picture source: Ukrainian MoD) Last month, the Ukrainian Navy executed a daring raid on Russian-occupied oil platforms in the Black Sea. This operation introduced USVs equipped with first-person-view (FPV) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Each USV carried at least four FPV drones, each armed with a small payload of explosives. These drones were launched mid-mission to strike Russian surveillance equipment and personnel stationed on the platforms. With its limited naval fleet, the Ukrainian Navy faces significant challenges in countering Russia’s Black Sea dominance. USVs provide a cost-effective solution, costing just $250,000 per unit. Although many are intercepted by Russian defenses, even a handful of successful missions can result in devastating consequences for Russian assets. This strategy has proven highly effective, with the Russian Black Sea Fleet losing approximately one-third of its pre-war ships due to relentless Ukrainian strikes. The incorporation of FPV drones into USVs adds a new layer of offensive capability, allowing these vessels to target land-based Russian defenses and infrastructure with precision. Recent developments have further enhanced the USVs’ capabilities. On New Year’s Eve, a Ukrainian USV equipped with defensive armaments successfully shot down a Russian helicopter. The integration of weapons such as guns and anti-aircraft missiles demonstrates the versatility of these platforms. Now, the addition of FPV drones introduces a crucial land-attack capability, enabling USVs to strike targets beyond the reach of their onboard explosives. These drones, weighing only a few pounds, can travel up to five miles and deliver pinpoint attacks on vehicles, equipment, and personnel. As Ukraine continues to refine and deploy these advanced systems, the broader implications for warfare are profound. The use of cost-effective, expendable drone carriers is a game-changer, offering smaller militaries the ability to challenge larger adversaries in asymmetric conflicts. For Russia, these advancements pose a significant threat, particularly as Ukraine’s drone technology evolves and expands. The loss of key naval assets and critical infrastructure will likely compel Moscow to adapt its defensive strategies. Ukraine’s success in integrating USVs and UAVs underscores the importance of innovation and adaptability in modern warfare. With the potential to further extend the capabilities of these platforms, the Ukrainian military is not only defending its sovereignty but also setting a precedent for the future of combat operations worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/ukraines-revolutionary-drone-carriers-transform-robotic-warfare	2025-01-27T00:58:07-08:00	
Poland’s Interest in Airbus A400M Revives Export Prospects for European Transport Aircraft	According to information published by the specialized site Hartpunkt on January 24, 2025, Poland has expressed interest in acquiring the Airbus A400M military transport aircraft. This development comes amid the challenges faced by the European program, which was launched more than fifteen years ago to modernize the airlift capabilities of its partner nations' armed forces. Facing financial and industrial difficulties, the A400M program may find a significant opportunity through a potential Polish order, offering renewed export prospects for this strategic aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An A400M AAR refuels two Eurofighter of 73 Tactical Air Force Wing equipped with Guided Bomb Unit (Picture source: Bundeswehr) In 2010, the A400M program, already encountering significant challenges, was saved through an agreement between Airbus and its seven main client nations: France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Turkey. These nations provided an additional €3.5 billion in funding, partly in the form of repayable advances contingent upon future exports. At the time, Airbus had high ambitions, aiming to sell between 400 and 500 A400M aircraft. However, fifteen years later, the results are modest, with only two export contracts secured: two aircraft for Kazakhstan and another two for Indonesia, which also holds an option for four more units. National decisions to reduce orders have further impacted production outlooks. In both Spain and France, initial commitments have been scaled back. According to France's 2024-2035 military programming law, the French Air and Space Force is now expected to receive 35 aircraft by 2035, well below the originally planned 50 units. Despite this, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu has reaffirmed the strategic importance of the A400M for French forces, while emphasizing the need to secure new export contracts to ensure the program’s economic viability and maintain the production chain. The Airbus A400M is a versatile military transport aircraft designed by Airbus Military to meet the tactical and strategic needs of modern armed forces. Equipped with four Europrop TP400-D6 turboprop engines, it can carry up to 32 tons of equipment, heavy machinery, or armored vehicles over distances of 2,300 nautical miles at a maximum speed of 780 km/h. Its adaptable cargo bay can accommodate up to 108 paratroopers, helicopters, or a mix of troops and cargo, while its onboard systems enable autonomous operations, even on short or rough airstrips. The aircraft can also undertake missions such as medical evacuation, aerial refueling, and transport in crisis zones. The A400M incorporates advanced technologies, including a night-vision-compatible glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and modern defensive aids such as radar and infrared detectors, electronic countermeasures, and flare dispensers. Its robust and innovative design, including composite wings and woven-fiber propellers, makes it more efficient and reliable than its predecessors. Capable of operating at low altitudes or up to 11,300 meters, it offers flexibility, performance, and reduced operating costs, meeting the demands of both military and humanitarian missions. Despite these recognized capabilities, the A400M has struggled to attract new clients in Europe, where countries like the Netherlands and Sweden have opted for Embraer's C-390 Millennium to modernize their aging C-130 Hercules fleets. In this context, Poland presents a significant opportunity for Airbus. The country, seeking to replace its second-hand C-130E/H aircraft acquired from the United States, has been identified by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius as a potential client. During a visit to Airbus's Bremen facility, which produces the A400M’s fuselage, Pistorius confirmed a 'very specific interest' from Poland and noted that discussions are ongoing. Reports suggest that the Polish Air Force could consider acquiring ten aircraft. However, the A400M program faces substantial challenges. German labor unions warn that production could cease as early as 2027 or 2028 if no strategic decisions are made. This outlook raises concerns, particularly for workers at the Bremen facility, a key site in the aircraft's manufacturing process. Following Pistorius's visit, A400M program director Gerd Weber emphasized the critical situation. While Germany, as the largest operator with 53 aircraft, has met its contractual obligations, export orders remain insufficient to offset reduced purchases from historical clients such as Spain and France. This situation has also highlighted tensions over the distribution of production value. According to observers cited by Hartpunkt, it is problematic that France and Spain retain equivalent shares in production despite their reduced orders, as this contradicts the usual European practice of proportional value distribution in defense projects. In response, German unions have proposed relocating the A400M’s final assembly line from Seville to Bremen, adding to the existing challenges among European partners. Amid this uncertain environment, Airbus and its partner nations are intensifying efforts to promote the A400M internationally. German Defense Minister Pistorius has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to supporting the export of this strategic aircraft, while negotiations with Poland offer a potential lifeline for the program. Nonetheless, the A400M’s future depends on swift decisions and strengthened cooperation among stakeholders to overcome the economic and industrial challenges threatening its continuity. Poland’s interest in the A400M represents a significant opportunity for Airbus in the context of declining orders and uncertainties about production sustainability. However, the situation remains critical, requiring urgent action to safeguard this emblem of European aeronautical industry—one that embodies shared technological ambitions yet faces the realities of global markets and shifting national priorities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/polands-interest-in-airbus-a400m-revives-export-prospects-for-european-transport-aircraft	2025-01-27T00:32:08-08:00

Breaking News: US Greenlights MK-84 Bombs for Israel Despite US President Donald Trump's Foreign Military Sales Pause	On January 25, 2025, The New York Times reported that despite a temporary three-month halt on foreign military sales imposed by President Donald Trump, the U.S. government is preparing to proceed with a significant shipment of bombs to Israel. This shipment will include 1,800 MK-84 bombs, a variant of the general-purpose bomb that has been used extensively by the U.S. and allied forces for decades. According to an anonymous White House official, the 900 kg (2,000-pound) bombs are set to be delivered to Israel as part of continued U.S. military support following the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An Israeli F-35I fighter jet from the 5601 Testing Squadron, equipped with Mk-84 bombs fitted with GBU-31 JDAM kits, prior to a bomb release test. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The MK-84 is an American-made high-explosive, general-purpose bomb with a weight of around 900 kg (2,000 pounds), making it one of the largest bombs in the U.S. arsenal. This bomb is designed to deliver a massive payload of explosives, capable of devastating both hardened and soft targets. The bomb is filled with a large charge of trinitrotoluene (TNT) or an explosive equivalent and is known for its extensive blast radius and ability to penetrate deep into structures before detonating. Due to its sheer destructive power, the MK-84 is often employed against large infrastructure targets such as military installations, enemy supply lines, and heavily fortified structures. However, despite its combat effectiveness, the MK-84 is generally considered too lethal for urban combat, particularly in densely populated areas. Its blast radius and potential for collateral damage are significant concerns, especially when dealing with targets near civilian zones. U.S. military officers have expressed reservations about deploying such powerful ordnance in environments where minimizing civilian casualties is a priority. For this reason, its use in Gaza, where Hamas operates in urban settings, has sparked ongoing debates within defense circles about its appropriateness. The U.S. decision to supply Israel with the MK-84 bombs is part of a broader military support strategy that has included various munitions throughout the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. This support is crucial as Israel continues to confront a complex battlefield, where Hamas has built a vast network of tunnels and underground facilities in densely populated areas. While critics argue that the MK-84’s destructive power can lead to heavy civilian casualties, proponents stress its utility against Hamas’s fortified positions. The bombs’ ability to target hardened structures such as tunnels, weapon caches, and command centers provides the Israeli military with a critical advantage in neutralizing Hamas’s infrastructure. The MK-84 bomb is a versatile weapon that can be deployed by several different aircraft platforms, making it an asset in joint operations across various theaters of war. It is typically dropped by aircraft equipped with specialized bomb racks, and it is compatible with a wide range of combat aircraft, including the U.S. and Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighters, which are key components of the Israeli Air Force’s tactical capabilities. These aircraft are capable of delivering a wide range of ordinance, including the MK-84, with precision targeting systems, ensuring that the bombs are released with maximum effectiveness. Israel’s advanced F-35 stealth fighters are also capable of carrying and deploying the MK-84. With its advanced avionics and stealth capabilities, the F-35 can deliver this heavy ordinance with minimal risk of detection, making it particularly useful in high-stakes operations where stealth and surprise are paramount. Additionally, while the U.S. B-52 bomber, though not currently in active service with Israel, can also carry the MK-84, its use would likely be limited to larger, strategic bombing missions, as would be the case with the B-1B Lancer and B-2 Spirit bombers, which are also capable of deploying the MK-84. The MK-84 bomb shipment comes at a critical time as Israel continues its military operations in Gaza. Following the U.S. government's pause on foreign military sales, the shipment of these bombs signals a return to normalcy in defense aid. Throughout the Biden administration's tenure, the U.S. has sent a variety of munitions to Israel, including precision-guided munitions, bombs, and ammunition, to help bolster its defense against Hamas and other militant groups operating in the region. Notably, the Biden administration has faced internal and external pressures regarding the continued supply of weapons to Israel, particularly due to concerns over civilian casualties. However, U.S. officials have justified their support by emphasizing the need to ensure Israel’s right to self-defense and its ability to combat threats posed by Hamas. While the MK-84 bomb remains one of the most powerful and destructive bombs in the U.S. arsenal, its role in modern warfare is balanced by its potential for collateral damage. As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, the use of such heavy ordnance in urban environments will likely remain a contentious issue, but its effectiveness in striking heavily fortified targets in Gaza ensures its continued presence in Israel’s military inventory. With the resumption of bomb shipments, the U.S. is reinforcing its strategic partnership with Israel as both nations work to address the ongoing security threats in the Middle East.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-us-greenlights-mk-84-bombs-for-israel-despite-us-president-donald-trumps-military-sales-pause	2025-01-26T07:34:47-08:00

Breaking News: Iran Demonstrates Fajr-5 Rocket Launcher for Sea Mine Laying Threatening Global Maritime Security	On January 25, 2025, Iranian state television unveiled a striking new tactic the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) employed during their naval exercises: using the Fajr-5 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) to lay sea mines. This novel application of Iran’s well-known artillery rocket system raised eyebrows within military circles, as it introduces a highly efficient method of deploying sea mines over a broad area at long distances. Traditionally, sea mines have been deployed using specialized naval vessels or aircraft. Still, Iran’s adaptation of the Fajr-5 MLRS to deliver mines offers an innovative approach that could have profound implications for both regional and global maritime security.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Fajr-5 Multiple Launch Rocket System MLRS in Action: Iranian forces demonstrate the deployment of sea mines during a naval exercise, showcasing a new capability for maritime security threats. (Picture source: Iranian TV) The Fajr-5 MLRS is an Iranian-made, medium-range multiple launch rocket system designed to deliver large-scale artillery rocket fire over significant distances. It is part of Iran’s efforts to bolster its conventional artillery and missile capabilities, offering a cost-effective yet powerful means of conducting bombardment operations. Typically, the Fajr-5 is mounted on a truck-based platform, making it highly mobile and capable of rapid deployment in a variety of terrain. The system is capable of firing rockets that range from 80 to 100 kilometers, depending on the specific variant. These rockets can carry a variety of payloads, including high-explosive fragmentation, anti-personnel, and, as seen in recent exercises, sea mines. The Fajr-5’s launch platform is designed to fire multiple rockets in quick succession, delivering a saturation effect to overwhelm targets over a wide area. The flexibility and mobility of the Fajr-5 make it particularly useful in asymmetric warfare, allowing Iran to strike high-value targets while remaining elusive quickly. Additionally, the system has been adapted for use in several theaters of conflict, reflecting its versatility and importance in Iran’s military doctrine. While it has conventional uses in targeting ground forces and infrastructure, the recent demonstration of its ability to lay sea mines marks a notable evolution in its tactical application. The recent Iranian naval exercise showcased the Fajr-5 launching several rockets, each carrying sea mines designed to disrupt naval operations and commercial shipping. This marks a significant shift in Iran’s naval strategy, adding a new layer to its already sophisticated array of asymmetric tactics. Using MLRS to lay mines allows for a highly mobile and effective means of creating minefields, without relying on more detectable or vulnerable platforms like dedicated mine-laying ships. The ability to rapidly deploy mines over a large area with the Fajr-5 makes this method a powerful tool for disrupting naval traffic, particularly in regions like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a vital passage for global oil shipments. Sea mines, in general, have long been a weapon of choice in asymmetric warfare. They are particularly effective in chokepoints or high-traffic maritime areas where they can significantly hinder the movement of enemy naval forces or commercial shipping. By using a rocket artillery system to deploy these mines, Iran has found a way to enhance its capacity for maritime denial, particularly in critical corridors like the Strait of Hormuz or the Bab-el-Mandeb. Given the importance of these waterways in global energy transit, the ability to use rockets to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines could have disastrous economic and geopolitical consequences. Iran’s development of this capability is not entirely unprecedented, though it is relatively unique. Countries like Russia have also employed artillery-based systems for laying mines. Russia’s Zemledeliye system, for instance, uses rocket artillery to deploy mines in both land and sea environments. This method allows for the rapid establishment of minefields and can be employed to target both land forces and maritime vessels. Such systems have become increasingly important in modern warfare, particularly for nations and militias that lack the resources to compete with superior naval powers directly. The concept of using missile-launched sea mines is gaining traction in many parts of the world, with countries like North Korea and Ukraine also having explored similar methods to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries. Despite this, Iran's application of the Fajr-5 to lay sea mines is particularly significant due to the strategic context in which it is deployed. The ability to lay mines using MLRS systems can significantly alter the balance of power in maritime regions, particularly in the Middle East. For instance, if Iran’s MLRS capabilities were to be shared with proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthi rebels in Yemen, these groups could gain access to a highly effective method of disrupting the flow of global energy. In fact, it is precisely in these contested regions that the tactical advantage of laying mines without the need for traditional naval assets becomes most apparent. Groups that might otherwise be unable to challenge the naval might of Western powers could employ such systems to effectively cut off vital maritime routes, creating uncertainty and economic disruption on a global scale. The use of the Fajr-5 MLRS for laying sea mines underscores the broader strategic shift towards asymmetric warfare in which countries and non-state actors are increasingly relying on low-cost, high-impact tactics to undermine superior military forces. This tactic, while not entirely unique, adds to the growing trend of countries and factions leveraging missile systems in unconventional ways to achieve tactical goals. For Iran, which is already well-versed in asymmetric naval tactics, the ability to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines enhances its power projection in strategic maritime regions. The global ramifications of this new development could be far-reaching. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil supply passes, could become a highly contested zone. The ability to rapidly lay sea mines in such areas could give Iran—or any actor equipped with similar technology—substantial leverage over global shipping and energy flows. In times of conflict, such minefields could cripple naval operations, halt commercial shipping, and disrupt the global economy. As tensions in the region continue to simmer, this new capability becomes a tool of naval denial, forcing adversaries to reconsider their strategies in regions where free passage has traditionally been guaranteed. Iran’s recent demonstration of using the Fajr-5 MLRS to lay sea mines represents a game-changing development in modern naval tactics. While missile-based mine-laying is not entirely new, the use of the Fajr-5 system for this purpose adds a new layer of asymmetric warfare to Iran’s already extensive military playbook. The potential for other nations or proxy groups to adopt similar strategies raises serious questions about the future of maritime security, particularly in regions vital to global trade and energy. As more nations and militant groups gain access to such technologies, the world may see an increasing number of missile-laid minefields, which could reshape the landscape of modern naval warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-demonstrates-fajr-5-rocket-launcher-for-sea-mine-laying-threatening-global-maritime-security	2025-01-26T02:05:03-08:00	
Exclusive: US Navy USS Lyndon B. Johnson Destroyer to Integrate Hypersonic Missiles Enhancing Modern Naval Warfare	The U.S. Navy's USS Zumwalt class destroyer is poised for a major leap in combat capabilities with the integration of hypersonic missile systems. According to a recent report from Interesting Engineer, the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, a ship within the Zumwalt-class, is set to undergo rigorous testing as the first at-sea platform equipped with the next-generation hypersonic missile system. This significant milestone underscores the Navy’s ongoing modernization efforts and its commitment to fielding cutting-edge technology. The integration of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system, a key component of the U.S. military’s hypersonic capabilities, will position the Zumwalt-class as a formidable force in future naval combat.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USS Lyndon B. Johnson Zumwalt-class destroyer undergoes significant modernization, with the two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems replaced by hypersonic missile launchers, enhancing its offensive capabilities for long-range precision strikes. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Zumwalt class is a series of advanced guided-missile destroyers designed with versatility in mind. These ships are built to handle various missions, from precision strikes to air and missile defense. Recognized for their stealthy appearance, Zumwalt-class ships feature a reduced radar cross-section, which allows them to operate covertly and evade detection in hostile environments. The class is equipped with advanced technologies, such as an integrated power system, a highly efficient hull shape, and the capacity to deploy both conventional and sophisticated weaponry. Initially intended to be equipped with a 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS) for shore bombardment, the Zumwalt-class ships have undergone significant modifications to suit modern naval warfare needs better. These changes have transformed the ships into highly adaptable platforms capable of housing more advanced weapon systems. Hypersonic missiles represent a transformative shift in naval warfare, and their inclusion in Zumwalt-class destroyers will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the fleet. Hypersonic weapons are defined as projectiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5—five times the speed of sound. This extreme velocity, combined with their maneuverability, makes hypersonic missiles incredibly difficult for traditional missile defense systems to intercept. As such, they offer a significant advantage over conventional missiles. In the context of naval warfare, hypersonic missiles bring several strategic benefits. First, their high speed drastically reduces the reaction time available to enemy defense systems, making it more difficult for adversaries to mount an effective countermeasure. Hypersonic missiles are also highly maneuverable during flight, enabling them to adjust their trajectories unpredictably, further complicating interception efforts. Additionally, these missiles are capable of long-range precision strikes, allowing naval forces to target critical assets from distances well beyond the reach of conventional weapons. The CPS system, for example, is designed to strike targets over 1,000 nautical miles away, which is ideal for engaging adversary targets in highly contested regions without the need for close proximity. The speed and unpredictability of hypersonic missiles also allow for surprise attacks, overwhelming enemy defenses before they can react. The transformation of the Zumwalt class destroyer to accommodate hypersonic missile systems began in 2023, marking a pivotal step in the Navy’s strategic shift. The first phase of this modernization involved removing the ship's original 155mm AGS, which had proven to be ineffective for modern operational needs. In its place, four vertical launch system (VLS) missile tubes were installed. Each VLS tube is capable of launching three hypersonic missiles, providing the Zumwalt class with the ability to carry up to 12 of these advanced munitions. This redesign required substantial modifications, including reconfiguring the ship’s bow to house the new missile tubes and integrating systems that can support hypersonic launches. Despite these changes, the ship’s rear gun mount, equipped with an auto-loading system, remains intact, preserving its multi-role combat flexibility. The inclusion of hypersonic missiles positions the Zumwalt class as a dominant offensive platform. According to Captain Lawler, the integration of the CPS weapon system makes the Zumwalt-class destroyer the 'foremost offensive surface combatant,' capable of delivering long-range precision strikes against high-value targets in future naval operations. With these enhancements, the Zumwalt class will play a crucial role in the Navy's ability to project power in maritime theaters, capable of striking strategic targets with unmatched speed and accuracy. The comparison between hypersonic and conventional missiles reveals significant advantages for the former. Conventional missiles, such as cruise or ballistic missiles, typically travel at subsonic or supersonic speeds, giving adversaries ample time to detect and intercept them. In contrast, hypersonic missiles' extreme speed makes them far more challenging to counter. Furthermore, conventional missiles tend to follow more predictable ballistic paths, making them easier to track. Hypersonic missiles, however, can alter their trajectory mid-flight, allowing them to avoid interception and penetrate even the most sophisticated missile defense systems, such as Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense or THAAD. The operational profile of the Zumwalt-class destroyer will be radically altered with the addition of hypersonic missiles. While traditional missile-equipped destroyers focus on anti-air warfare or strike missions, Zumwalt-class destroyers equipped with hypersonic weapons will be able to conduct precision strikes at far greater ranges, providing a near-guaranteed success rate against high-priority, time-sensitive targets. The ability to deliver powerful blows from such a distance offers a level of flexibility and survivability that was previously unattainable with conventional systems. With the integration of hypersonic missile systems, Zumwalt-class destroyers, especially the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, are set to become an essential part of the U.S. Navy's future combat strategy. These advanced missiles provide unprecedented speed, range, and flexibility, ensuring that Zumwalt class ships will be capable of executing rapid, precise strikes while maintaining resilience against enemy defenses. As the U.S. Navy continues to push the boundaries of technological innovation, the deployment of hypersonic missiles represents a pivotal moment in enhancing naval power projection. This transformation guarantees that the U.S. Navy will maintain its status as a dominant force in global naval warfare, ensuring operational superiority for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/exclusive-us-navy-uss-lyndon-b-johnson-destroyer-to-integrate-hypersonic-missiles-enhancing-modern-naval-warfare	2025-01-25T08:09:54-08:00

Exclusive: China Conducts Field Tests of New Hurricane-3000 High-Power Microwave Weapon to Counter Drone Swarms	Following its unveiling at the Zhuhai Airshow in November 2024, China's NORINCO (China North Industries Group Corporation) has taken a significant step forward in counter-drone technology with the Hurricane-3000 High-Power Microwave (HPM) Weapon System. Recent reports confirm that the Chinese defense company has conducted field tests of this new system, designed to counter the growing threat posed by drone swarms. However, despite the promising results, the Hurricane-3000 has not yet entered active service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA - Chinese Army).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chinese-made Hurricane-3000, NORINCO's advanced high-power microwave system, demonstrated in field tests to counter drone swarms by disabling UAVs' electronics. (Picture source: Jesus Roman X account ) The growing use of drones in modern warfare, as highlighted by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, has underscored the vulnerability of military forces to drone swarms, which are being used for reconnaissance, strikes, and even kamikaze-style attacks. Both sides in the conflict have increasingly turned to UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to gain tactical advantages, leading military forces around the world to seek advanced countermeasures. As the use of drones escalates, the demand for systems capable of neutralizing swarming UAVs has become critical. The Hurricane-3000 is NORINCO’s response to this evolving challenge. The system leverages high-power microwave energy to disable or destroy drones by targeting their electronic components, rendering them inoperable. Unlike traditional missile-based systems, which can be costly and prone to collateral damage, HPM weapons provide a cost-effective, precise, and low-risk solution for neutralizing multiple drone threats simultaneously. NORINCO’s field tests of the Hurricane-3000 have shown promising results, especially in scenarios where rapid neutralization of drone swarms is required. Mounted on a high-mobility chassis, the weapon is equipped with a powerful microwave array capable of generating intense electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) to disrupt the control systems of small UAVs. The system is able to detect targets up to 6 kilometers away and optically track them within a 4-kilometer range. Even micro-drones beyond 3 kilometers can be precisely locked onto and neutralized. Zheng Xuyang, an expert from NORINCO, explained that, unlike a conventional microwave oven that heats food within a 30-centimeter range, the Hurricane-3000 has an effective range of 3 kilometers, 10,000 times that of a household microwave. The system operates similarly to a microwave oven by emitting high-power microwave beams to carry out electromagnetic attacks on the targets, instantly burning out their electronic components and control units. The system operates at speeds approaching that of light, enabling near-instant destruction of targets. This makes it highly effective, whether neutralizing individual drones or inflicting large-scale damage on drone swarms. In one test, a small UAV was disabled mid-flight, validating the system’s operational effectiveness. The Hurricane-3000 has been demonstrated to engage a wide range of UAV sizes, from small reconnaissance drones to larger, more advanced models used for precision strikes. Additionally, the system's rapid response capability ensures that it can handle fast-moving aerial threats with minimal delay. Unlike conventional counter-drone systems, which require precise targeting and can be disrupted by weather conditions, the Hurricane-3000 operates effectively in diverse environments, making it a versatile addition to future defense arsenals. The system’s high-power microwave beam also functions like a 'hemispherical mosquito net' with a 3-kilometer radius, offering protection against saturation drone attacks. This feature could be particularly valuable when dealing with large swarms of UAVs, effectively preventing any incursions into protected airspace. While the Hurricane-3000 has yet to be integrated into the PLA’s (People's Liberation Army - Chinese army) operational inventory, its field test success has sparked significant interest within military circles. The PLA has increasingly prioritized anti-drone capabilities, particularly in the context of urban and battlefield defense, where UAVs pose a unique challenge. China’s growing emphasis on directed-energy weapons, such as the Hurricane-3000, aligns with broader trends in military modernization. Directed-energy systems, including high-power microwave and laser weapons, are seen as key enablers of next-generation warfare, capable of efficiently countering increasingly sophisticated drone threats.

India’s Submarine Revolution: German-Indian Collaboration Brings AIP to Navy	According to information published by Reuters on January 23, 2025, the German-Indian joint venture led by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender for India's ambitious $5 billion Project-75(I) submarine program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link German built Type 214 submarine. (Picture source: TKMS) India’s Project-75(I) is one of the most ambitious and long-awaited defense acquisition programs, aimed at revitalizing the country’s submarine fleet to counter growing threats in the Indian Ocean region. With a budget of $5 billion, the program seeks to procure six next-generation diesel-electric attack submarines equipped with cutting-edge technologies, including air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. Following a rigorous evaluation process, the joint venture between German shipbuilder ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender, after the Spanish consortium of Navantia and Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) failed to meet critical requirements. The program was envisioned as an extension of the original Project-75, under which MDL collaborated with French company Naval Group to produce six Scorpène-class submarines. These submarines, while a significant leap forward at the time, lack AIP technology, which is now critical for modern naval operations. The objective of Project-75(I) is to develop a new class of conventional submarines that can stay submerged for extended periods, enhance stealth capabilities, and feature cutting-edge weapons and sensor systems. Despite its urgency, the project has faced delays spanning more than a decade due to procurement hurdles, technological complexities, and debates over the degree of technology transfer required under the 'Make in India' initiative. TKMS brings to the table its highly advanced Type 214 submarine, a proven platform that has been adopted by navies in Germany, Greece, South Korea, and Turkey. The Type 214 features an advanced hydrogen fuel cell-based AIP system, which enables the submarine to remain submerged for up to two weeks without surfacing. This system operates silently, significantly reducing the submarine’s acoustic signature, a critical factor in modern anti-submarine warfare. Navantia proposed a design based on its S-80 Plus submarine, which is still under development and has yet to achieve operational deployment. The S-80 Plus relies on a bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, which converts bio-ethanol into hydrogen for powering fuel cells. While innovative, this system has not been field-proven to the extent of TKMS's AIP technology. Moreover, Navantia’s design faced setbacks in the past, including issues with buoyancy calculations that delayed Spain’s own submarine program. These technical challenges may have undermined confidence in their ability to meet the Indian Navy’s rigorous specifications. In terms of industrial partnership, Larsen &amp; Toubro is a leading Indian defense company with significant expertise in shipbuilding and engineering. However, its collaboration with Navantia was relatively nascent compared to the established relationship between TKMS and MDL, which had successfully navigated previous submarine-building challenges under Project-75. The centerpiece of the competition was the AIP system, a transformative technology for diesel-electric submarines. Conventional submarines without AIP must surface or use a snorkel to recharge their batteries, making them vulnerable to detection. AIP systems, by contrast, allow prolonged underwater endurance and enhanced stealth. The hydrogen fuel cell system used by TKMS is regarded as one of the most mature and efficient AIP technologies available. It operates silently, generates no vibrations, and produces minimal heat, making detection by thermal and acoustic sensors difficult. Navantia’s bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, while innovative, introduces potential complexities in fuel management and system integration. Its unproven track record compared unfavorably to TKMS’s operationally validated system, which has seen years of deployment and performance refinement. Both contenders proposed submarines capable of carrying heavyweight torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, and land-attack cruise missiles. TKMS’s Type 214 is already compatible with a range of munitions, including the DM2A4 SeaHake torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The S-80 Plus, while theoretically offering similar versatility, is still undergoing integration testing for many of these systems. On the sensor front, both designs emphasized advanced sonar suites, electronic warfare capabilities, and integrated combat management systems. However, TKMS’s submarines benefit from operational feedback from multiple navies, whereas the S-80 Plus remains in developmental stages. With a rapidly aging fleet and increasing threats from China's expanding submarine force and Pakistan’s AIP-equipped Agosta-class submarines, the Indian Navy urgently requires these advanced platforms. Selecting a proven design like the Type 214 minimizes developmental risks and ensures timely delivery. If negotiations proceed as planned, the first submarine from Project-75(I) could enter service within three to five years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indias-submarine-revolution-german-indian-collaboration-brings-aip-to-navy	2025-01-24T07:02:18-08:00

However, a notable omission in the agreement is a mutual defense clause, which differentiates it from Russia's agreements with other allies such as North Korea and Belarus. This absence highlights the underlying mistrust that continues to define the relationship between Moscow and Tehran. Despite their collaboration, the two nations have a complex history of competing regional ambitions and divergent priorities on the global stage, which have prevented a fully integrated alliance. While the agreement establishes a legal framework for formalizing and potentially expanding their cooperation, its practical impact appears limited. On one hand, Russia remains heavily reliant on Iranian military support to sustain its operations in Ukraine, as it continues to face international isolation and resource depletion. On the other hand, Iran benefits from Russian military technology and expertise to modernize its defense infrastructure and strengthen its position in the region. However, analysts from British Intelligence emphasize that structural obstacles, including mutual suspicion and differing strategic goals, are likely to hinder any significant enhancement of their partnership. As a result, the collaboration between Russia and Iran is seen as pragmatic rather than transformative, driven by immediate necessities rather than a long-term alignment of interests. In summary, the agreement between Russia and Iran reflects an effort to deepen an already well-established relationship, particularly in the defense sector. However, the challenges identified by British Intelligence underscore the fragile and limited nature of this alliance. While the accord provides a mechanism for formalizing cooperation, its ability to overcome mutual distrust and geopolitical tensions remains uncertain. This development exemplifies a partnership shaped more by necessity than by mutual confidence, reflecting the complex dynamics of two nations navigating a hostile international environment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/british-intelligence-reveals-strategic-partnership-between-russia-and-iran-despite-persistent-tensions	2025-01-24T00:48:38-08:00

This prototype, attributed to the Kalashnikov Group, employs a Kamaz 5350 Patrol 6x6 armored vehicle equipped with 16 transport-launch containers. It is designed to launch up to 64 drones rapidly using a tube-based system. The Lancet drones, developed by Zala Aero Group, feature guidance systems for reconnaissance and precision strikes and can carry high-explosive, thermobaric, or HEAT warheads, with a range of 40 km and speeds up to 300 km/h. The MLDS also includes dual UAV operator stations and supports swarm technology for coordinated target engagement. Globally, similar systems have been developed. South Korea has created two systems: a modular drone carrier based on a Kia K151 Raycolt, and a Drone Multiple Launcher capable of deploying drones for attack and surveillance. Integrated with the Chunmoo MLRS and L-SAM systems, this platform includes modular launch pads for small and medium-sized drones. In the United States, the Navy’s LOCUST program has developed swarm-enabled launchers, capable of deploying up to 31 drones in 40 seconds for autonomous or semi-autonomous operations. The Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is advancing the Air-Launched Effects program, enabling mid-air deployment of drones from platforms such as the MQ-9 Reaper for ISR and strike missions. This system comprises a minimum of 14 loitering munitions, two reconnaissance drones, and sixteen gas-dynamic launch mechanisms to avoid the logistical and safety challenges associated with pyrotechnic boosters. (Picture source: Kalashnikov) China has also showcased swarm technology with a modified Dongfeng Mengshi CTL181A vehicle, equipped with 48-tube launchers for kamikaze drones, and a new variant of the FAW MV3 6x6 truck, which carries and launches the recently unveiled ASN-301 loitering munition. These drones can operate individually or in coordinated swarms and are designed for autonomous strikes on ground and infrastructure targets. Israel has introduced the MCL Viper system by SpearUAV, which deploys drones from various platforms for reconnaissance and electronic warfare without exposing operators. Germany’s Rheinmetall has developed a containerized launcher for Hero loitering munitions, designed for deployment in various operational environments, including naval and land-based scenarios. Mobile drone launcher systems, such as the Kalashnikov KUB-SM, offer practical advantages for UAV operations by enabling launches in constrained environments without the need for traditional runways. These systems use pneumatic or gas-dynamic launch mechanisms, avoiding the logistical and safety challenges associated with pyrotechnic boosters. Designed for missions ranging from reconnaissance to precision strikes, they support rapid deployment and recovery of drones while maintaining operational capability in adverse weather conditions, including strong winds of up to 15 m/s and extreme temperatures. This functionality ensures efficient UAV operations across diverse and remote locations.

Flash News: US Navy Arleigh Burke destroyer USS Spruance scores impressive missiles & UAVs downs in Red Sea Battle	According to information published by the US DoD on January 18, 2025, the USS Spruance (DDG-111), an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, emerged from a recent engagement in the Red Sea bearing thirteen new mission marks. These marks signify a successful defense against a diverse and complex array of threats, underscoring the ship's readiness and its crew's proficiency in operating naval systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS Spruance (DDG-111) returns to port bearing 13 mission marks after successfully intercepting ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs in a high-stakes engagement against Houthi forces in the Red Sea. (Picture source: US DoD) At the core of the USS Spruance’s defense is the Aegis Combat System, a fully integrated combat management system designed to process vast amounts of sensor data and coordinate the ship’s weapons to neutralize diverse threats. The Aegis system is centered around the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar and the ship’s command and control suite, which collectively provide rapid detection, tracking, and engagement across multiple domains. The AN/SPY-1D(V) radar is a high-power, multi-function phased-array radar that operates in the S-band frequency range. It is capable of detecting and tracking hundreds of targets simultaneously, including low-observable threats such as sea-skimming cruise missiles and high-altitude ballistic missiles. The radar’s phased-array technology eliminates the need for moving parts, allowing it to maintain constant surveillance over its area of coverage. During the engagement, this radar was responsible for detecting inbound threats at their maximum range, providing critical early-warning data. Once threats were detected, the Aegis Command and Decision Suite processed the data and classified the targets based on their threat level. The system’s real-time processing capability enables rapid assignment of weapons to targets, prioritizing engagements based on speed, proximity, and lethality. This ensures that the ship’s defenses are neither overwhelmed nor misallocated during a multi-vector attack. The interception of three anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) by the USS Spruance represents a significant technological achievement. Ballistic missiles follow a high-arcing trajectory and typically re-enter the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often exceeding Mach 5. These characteristics make them extremely challenging targets, requiring precise timing and advanced intercept technology. The Aegis BMD system, an upgraded component of the ship’s combat suite, provides the capability to track and intercept ballistic missiles during their midcourse or terminal phase. When the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar detected the inbound ASBMs, the Aegis system calculated their trajectory, speed, and re-entry path. This data was shared with regional and space-based sensors through the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), creating a unified threat picture. To neutralize the ASBMs, the Spruance likely launched Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors from its Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). The SM-3 is a hit-to-kill interceptor designed specifically for ballistic missile engagements. It uses a multi-stage booster to achieve high velocity and deploys a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) in the missile’s terminal phase. The KKV does not carry an explosive warhead; instead, it relies on sheer kinetic energy to destroy the target by colliding with it at high speed. For terminal-phase threats closer to the ship, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) could have been employed. The SM-6 is a dual-role missile capable of intercepting both ballistic and air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles, at extended ranges. Its active radar seeker and advanced guidance system make it particularly effective in dealing with maneuvering re-entry vehicles (RVs). The interception of three anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) further illustrates the Spruance’s layered defensive architecture. Cruise missiles, which fly at low altitudes and often use terrain-following radar to evade detection, are designed to overwhelm shipboard defenses with speed and maneuverability. The SPY-1D(V) radar played a pivotal role in detecting these missiles despite their low-altitude flight paths and potentially stealthy designs. Upon detection, the Aegis system assigned Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) interceptors for mid-range engagements. The SM-2 employs semi-active radar homing, guided by the ship’s radar, to track and intercept the target. Its dual-thrust rocket motor provides the necessary speed and range to engage cruise missiles before they reach their terminal phase. For threats that penetrated closer to the ship, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) likely came into play. The ESSM is designed for point defense and is capable of engaging highly maneuverable targets at short ranges. Its active radar seeker provides high accuracy, while its advanced control surfaces enable rapid course adjustments to counter evasive maneuvers. Additionally, the ship’s Mk 99 Fire Control System directed the engagement, ensuring precise guidance of each interceptor. This system uses radar illuminators to 'paint' the target, providing the SM-2 and ESSM with continuous updates on the target’s location and trajectory during flight. The successful interception of seven UAVs showcased the Spruance’s ability to counter the growing use of drones in asymmetric warfare. UAVs are often deployed in swarms to saturate defenses and are particularly challenging to detect due to their small radar cross-sections and erratic flight patterns. The ship’s Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) likely played a central role in UAV defense. The CIWS, commonly referred to as 'Phalanx,' is a 20mm Gatling gun mounted on a swiveling turret. It is radar-guided and designed for last-ditch defense against incoming threats. Operating at a rate of up to 4,500 rounds per minute, the CIWS can effectively destroy small, fast-moving targets like UAVs at ranges of 1-2 kilometers. Electronic warfare measures, such as the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), complemented kinetic defenses. SEWIP provides advanced electronic attack capabilities, allowing the ship to disrupt the command, control, and navigation systems of UAVs. By jamming communication links, SEWIP can render drones ineffective without expending munitions. The Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) on the USS Spruance provides the foundation for its multi-mission flexibility. With 96 launch cells, the ship can carry a mix of interceptors, land-attack missiles, and anti-submarine weapons, tailored to mission requirements. The VLS uses a 'hot launch' system, where missiles are ignited within the cell and expelled upward through a hatch. This system allows for rapid, sequential launches, ensuring the ship can respond to high-intensity engagements like the one in the Red Sea. The ability to switch seamlessly between different types of munitions—such as SM-2 for air defense, SM-3 for ballistic missile defense, and ESSM for point defense—gives the Spruance unmatched tactical flexibility.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-us-navy-arleigh-burke-destroyer-uss-spruance-scores-impressive-missiles-uavs-downs-in-red-sea-battle	2025-01-23T03:50:54-08:00

Critical Undersea Infrastructure Defense: Finland Sends FNS Pori to NATO Mission	According to information published by NATO on January 22, 2025, Finland has taken a decisive step in enhancing NATO’s maritime operations by deploying the Hamina-class missile boat FNS Pori to join Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1) as part of the Baltic Sentry operation.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Finnish Navy's Hamina-class missile boat. (Picture source: Finnish MoD) The Baltic Sentry operation is a direct response to mounting security concerns in the region, particularly the protection of critical undersea infrastructure, such as pipelines and communication cables, that underpin European economies. Finland’s participation represents a significant enhancement of NATO’s operational capabilities in the Baltic, a maritime domain where both conventional and hybrid threats are becoming more frequent. The Baltic Sea’s security dynamics have undergone profound changes since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The region has become a hotspot for military activity, economic pressure, and covert operations. Incidents such as the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2022 underscored the vulnerabilities of undersea infrastructure and highlighted the need for comprehensive security measures. The FNS Pori, one of four Hamina-class missile boats in the Finnish Navy, is particularly suited for operations in the Baltic Sea. Unlike larger NATO vessels designed for deep-ocean engagements, the Pori is built for effectiveness in the shallow, congested, and strategically constrained waters of the Baltic. Its design reflects Finland’s decades of experience in defending its own 1,100-kilometer Baltic coastline. The Pori’s stealth capabilities give it an operational edge. Its reduced radar and infrared signatures allow it to operate undetected in environments where surveillance is high and threats are often unconventional. This stealth, combined with its speed and maneuverability, makes the Pori highly effective for coastal patrol, interdiction, and rapid-response missions. Armed with RBS-15 anti-ship missiles, the Pori can strike targets at long range, providing a deterrent against surface threats. Its Bofors 57 mm Mk3 naval gun offers versatility in engaging smaller vessels, unmanned systems, and airborne threats. The ship is also equipped with advanced surface-to-air missiles, ensuring it can provide point defense for itself and other assets within its operational area. Unlike traditional deployments of larger frigates and destroyers, the use of the Pori demonstrates a tailored approach to addressing specific regional challenges. This is particularly relevant as NATO increasingly focuses on hybrid threats, such as the sabotage of undersea infrastructure, cyber operations targeting maritime systems, and the use of drones in contested waters. Despite its advantages, the deployment of the Pori highlights ongoing challenges in securing the Baltic. The region’s small size and interconnectedness mean that any maritime operation must be coordinated carefully to avoid escalating tensions. The presence of Russian naval forces in the area adds an additional layer of complexity, as their activities often blur the line between conventional and irregular operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/critical-undersea-infrastructure-defense-finland-sends-fns-pori-to-nato-mission	2025-01-23T01:55:26-08:00	
Israel's Rafael upgrades its Trophy active protection system to counter kamikaze drones	During the Defence IQ International Armoured Vehicles (IAV) conference, held in Farnborough, UK, from January 21 to 23, 2025, the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defence Systems announced an upgrade to its Trophy Active Protection System (APS) to intercept drones. According to a company representative, the enhancement addresses challenges posed by low-altitude aerial threats, including commercially available drones, kamikaze drones, and larger fixed-wing UAVs. The upgrade, requiring software adjustments and minor hardware changes, is compatible with existing systems used by operators in the United States and Europe.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2017, the Trophy APS had accumulated 50,000 operational hours since its introduction in 2011, showcasing its effectiveness in both low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) During testing, the upgraded Trophy system, mounted on a 30 mm turret, successfully intercepted a jet-powered fixed-wing drone classified between classes 2 and 3. The drone approached in a near-vertical dive. Rafael emphasized that these enhancements were achieved without altering the system’s core hardware. In addition to drone interception, Trophy has been updated based on operational experience, including lessons learned from conflicts in Gaza and northern Israel. These improvements address the system’s performance against short-range threats in urban environments and long-range threats such as ATGMs in open terrain. A representative of EuroTrophy—a joint venture between Rafael, GDELS, and KNDS to market Trophy in Europe—stated that the system has achieved high interception rates during conflicts. The venture is working to integrate Trophy onto platforms like the MGCS and ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles, as well as three European 8x8 armored vehicles. The representative noted that Trophy contributes to operational effectiveness by providing consistent vehicle protection, which is critical for mission continuity. They also highlighted the operational challenges commanders face when vehicle losses threaten the success of an operation. The Trophy APS, also known as 'Windbreaker,' was developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems in collaboration with Elta Systems to counter modern anti-armor threats such as ATGMs, RPGs, and other anti-tank weapons. Development began in the 1980s to enhance the survivability of armored vehicles in urban and open battlefields, with the system becoming operational in 2009 and achieving its first recorded interception in 2011. Variants have been developed for different vehicle weight classes, including Trophy HV for heavy vehicles, Trophy MV for medium vehicles, and Trophy LV for light vehicles. Trophy's functionality is based on the Elta EL/M-2133 fire-control radar, which uses four flat-panel antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. When detecting an incoming projectile, it calculates the approach vector, threat type, time to impact, and angle. Rotating launchers deploy Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) in a precise pattern to neutralize threats at a safe distance. The system counters ATGMs, high-explosive anti-tank rounds, RPGs, and similar threats. It can engage multiple threats simultaneously on stationary and moving vehicles and integrates with C4I systems and remote-controlled weapons stations. Newer models feature automated reloading for consecutive engagements. By 2023, the production of the Trophy APS increased to 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month, as it has been deployed on tanks like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4, the American Abrams, the German Leopard 2A7A1 and 2A8, as well as the British Challenger 3. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) The Trophy APS has been operational since 2011, demonstrating success in low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. It has intercepted threats like Kornet ATGMs and RPG-29s. By 2017, Trophy accumulated 50,000 operational hours, and by 2023, production reached 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month. The radar system can share data with other vehicles, enabling improved threat coordination and targeting. It can identify whether a projectile will miss its target, withholding countermeasures and sharing data for tactical use. Reports suggest it offers protection against certain top-attack missiles and is used in Israel and the U.S. However, the Trophy APS has limitations. It cannot counter kinetic energy penetrators and is vulnerable to direct top-down attacks, as demonstrated in 2023 when drones dropped grenades on protected vehicles. Its weight, approximately 500 kilograms, may impact the performance of lighter vehicles. The use of EFPs poses risks to nearby infantry, complicating operations involving dismounted soldiers. Techniques such as rapid successive missile firings, ultra-close-range RPG attacks, and supersonic projectiles have exploited system weaknesses. Conflicts in 2023 and 2024 highlighted instances where the system was overwhelmed, with video evidence showing some failures. Rafael representatives emphasized that despite its new anti-drone capability, Trophy alone cannot provide comprehensive air defense against drones. They advocate a layered defense strategy incorporating mobility, lethality, and survivability, supported by technologies like lasers, electromagnetic spectrum control, and hard- and soft-kill systems. This approach aims to address the growing challenges posed by drones, including swarms and top-attack threats, which complicate operations for maneuver forces. Production of Trophy APS began in Israel in 2007 and in the U.S. in 2012, with a combined output of 40 systems and 500 countermeasures per month by 2023. Since 2010, it has been deployed on platforms like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4 tanks, Namer APCs, and U.S. M1A2 Abrams tanks. It has been tested on Stryker APCs and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The lighter Trophy MV/VPS version was developed for medium and light vehicles, while the Trophy LV is designed for vehicles under 8 tons. It has been integrated into Germany's Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and is included in orders for the Leopard 2A8. The UK has signed contracts to evaluate it for Challenger 3 tanks. Other potential operators include Croatia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/israels-rafael-upgrades-its-trophy-active-protection-system-to-counter-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-23T01:47:31-08:00

Royal Navy Confronts Russian Ship in Channel as UK Strengthens Undersea Security	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 22, 2025, the Royal Navy recently intercepted and tracked the Russian spy ship Yantar as it moved through the English Channel. This latest development reflects the UK’s intensified efforts to counter potential threats to undersea infrastructure, which is increasingly seen as a target of strategic importance. Yantar, known for its specialized surveillance capabilities, has been under scrutiny for its potential to interfere with critical assets such as undersea cables and pipelines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 22010-class intelligence ship and a Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset. (Picture source: UK MoD) This is not the first encounter between Yantar and British forces. Late last year, the vessel was observed lingering near key infrastructure in UK waters, prompting the Royal Navy to send a submarine to surface near Yantar and issue a pointed warning. Following that incident, the vessel left UK territory for the Mediterranean. Its return this week has reignited concerns over its intentions, leading to its close monitoring by the frigate HMS Somerset as it transited the Channel. The broader context for these developments is the rising tension over the security of offshore infrastructure across Europe. Undersea cables, which carry the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic, and pipelines, essential for energy supplies, have become focal points of geopolitical vulnerability. Recent damage to the Estlink2 undersea cable between Estonia and Finland has heightened these concerns, prompting NATO to launch new measures to protect these critical assets. The UK is playing a leading role in these efforts, deploying advanced capabilities to deter and monitor threats. As part of the NATO Baltic Sentry initiative, the UK is contributing advanced P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and Rivet Joint surveillance platforms. These assets are designed to bolster reconnaissance and response capabilities in regions where the risk to undersea infrastructure is particularly acute. At the heart of Britain’s response is a new AI-driven system known as Nordic Warden. This technology, recently activated, leverages real-time data from a variety of sources to track and analyze ship movements, assessing the potential risks posed by suspicious vessels. Nordic Warden has been specifically configured to monitor Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet,' a network of tankers used to evade sanctions by transporting oil and gas to international buyers. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy’s RFA Proteus, equipped with submersible drones, has been a critical component in safeguarding undersea assets. Proteus, which previously shadowed Yantar during its activities in UK waters, remains on the front lines of undersea surveillance and inspection, ensuring that cables and pipelines remain secure. These efforts also dovetail with international sanctions targeting Russia’s economic lifelines. The UK has taken a prominent role in sanctioning vessels involved in evading restrictions, including tankers used to fund Russia’s ongoing military operations in Ukraine.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/royal-navy-confronts-russian-ship-in-channel-as-uk-strengthens-undersea-security	2025-01-23T01:01:34-08:00

This integration effort is part of Lockheed Martin's continued commitment to innovation and modernization, ensuring that the U.S. Air Force maintains its technological edge in combat situations. Justin Taylor, Vice President of the F-22 program at Lockheed Martin, also expressed the company's pride in continuing its partnership with the Air Force, particularly in advancing the capabilities of the F-22 to sustain U.S. air superiority. The F-22 Raptor, a fifth-generation fighter jet, has long been the cornerstone of the U.S. Air Force's air dominance capabilities. Entering service in 2005, the F-22 was specifically designed to maintain air superiority by combining stealth technology, supercruise (the ability to fly at supersonic speeds without using afterburners), and advanced avionics. These features allow the F-22 to evade radar detection, engage targets at long distances, and outmaneuver adversaries in close combat, all while maintaining a low radar profile. The addition of the IRDS system further enhances these capabilities, ensuring that the F-22 will continue to dominate in the ever-evolving battlefield. One of the key advantages of the F-22 is its sensor fusion, which allows it to seamlessly integrate data from its radar, infrared systems, and electronic warfare tools. This combination gives the pilot an unparalleled level of situational awareness, allowing them to track and engage enemy aircraft, missiles, and ground-based threats before being detected themselves. The aircraft’s advanced radar, which operates in both air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, works in conjunction with its infrared systems, including the newly integrated IRDS, to provide a complete picture of the battle space. Compared to other fighter jets in the U.S. Air Force’s fleet, the F-22 Raptor stands out due to its focus on air superiority. While the F-35 Lightning II is also a fifth-generation stealth fighter, it is designed as a multirole aircraft, with a broader mission set that includes close air support, strike missions, and intelligence gathering. The F-22, in contrast, was purpose-built to ensure that the U.S. military maintains unchallenged control of the skies, particularly in high-intensity air-to-air combat scenarios. In terms of speed and agility, the F-22 outperforms many of its peers. The jet's thrust-vectoring engines, combined with its lightweight airframe and advanced flight control systems, allow it to perform high-G maneuvers that would be impossible for many other aircraft to match. Its ability to fly at supersonic speeds without using afterburners gives it a significant edge in terms of range and fuel efficiency, while its stealth features ensure it can operate in contested environments without detection. While the F-22 has been a critical asset for the U.S. Air Force, it is not the only advanced fighter in the service. The F-15EX Eagle II, a modernized version of the iconic F-15, and the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a workhorse of the U.S. Air Force for decades, continue to play vital roles in combat operations. However, both of these aircraft lack the F-22’s level of stealth, sensor fusion, and supercruise ability. The F-15EX and F-16, while highly capable and versatile, are designed more for multirole missions, including air-to-ground operations, rather than pure air dominance. In terms of pure air-to-air combat capability, the F-22 remains the undisputed leader of the U.S. Air Force’s fleet. Lockheed Martin's ongoing role in modernizing the F-22 ensures that the aircraft will remain at the cutting edge of technology. As the Air Force works to extend the service life of the F-22, integrating new systems like the IRDS is critical in ensuring that the Raptor remains relevant in future combat environments. Lockheed Martin’s focus on continuous innovation and upgrades will ensure that the F-22 can maintain its superiority over the long term, addressing emerging threats and maintaining the U.S. Air Force’s air dominance. The new $270 million contract to integrate the IRDS system into the F-22 Raptor is a significant step in maintaining the aircraft’s status as the premier air superiority fighter in the U.S. Air Force. As the military continues to face increasingly advanced adversaries, upgrades like the IRDS will ensure that the F-22 remains a formidable force in the skies. With its unparalleled combination of stealth, agility, and sensor capabilities, the F-22 will continue to serve as a critical component of the U.S. Air Force’s air superiority strategy for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/next-generation-lockheed-martin-infrared-sensors-to-boost-us-f-22-raptors-survivability-and-lethality	2025-01-23T00:40:47-08:00

This agreement marks the first large-scale adoption of APEX ammunition, underscoring its strategic importance in contemporary armament systems. According to Reijo Bragberg, Executive Vice President of Nammo’s Small and Medium Caliber division, the ammunition is effective across various targets, including armored vehicles and fortified structures, due to its versatile design. The 25 mm x 137 APEX PGU-47/U stands out for its innovative design, which integrates armor-piercing and explosive effects in a single projectile. It features a tungsten carbide penetrator and a delayed-action explosive warhead, maximizing internal damage through blast, fragmentation, and incendiary effects. This versatility allows it to effectively engage diverse targets, such as armored, semi-armored, and lightly fortified structures. Additionally, the ammunition includes a tracer function that improves firing accuracy and supports missions requiring visible warning shots, such as air policing. In terms of performance, the APEX ammunition incorporates several unique features. Its optimized aerodynamics enhance range and accuracy, while its advanced dual-safety fuze (FMU-171/U) ensures safe arming and delayed detonation within targets. The ammunition remains effective even in glancing impacts, setting it apart from traditional designs. Its exclusive compatibility with the F-35A further highlights its suitability for modern combat scenarios. The development of the APEX ammunition is the result of nearly two decades of research and development by Nammo, conducted in collaboration with Norwegian partners such as the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (FMA) and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI). This extensive testing and qualification process ensures its safe and effective integration into F-35A operations. The RAAF recently acquired 72 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, benefiting from the latest technological advancements. In December 2024, the final nine aircraft delivered were the first to feature the 'Technology Refresh 3' upgrade, which prepares the fleet for Block 4 enhancements. These upgrades introduce expanded capabilities and systems designed to address emerging threats, bolstering Australia’s operational readiness in an evolving geopolitical context. This agreement with Nammo reflects Australia's broader efforts to modernize its military arsenal while collaborating with international defense industry partners. The introduction of APEX ammunition into the Australian forces demonstrates the increasing importance of innovative solutions to meet current strategic challenges. These munitions are expected to play a critical role in future RAAF operations, enhancing its ability to effectively engage a variety of targets in both air and ground scenarios. The partnership between Nammo and the RAAF also highlights the evolving demands of modern military operations and the adoption of advanced technologies for next-generation platforms like the F-35A. With deliveries expected to continue through 2027, this project strengthens Nammo's position in the advanced armament market. It prepares the Australian forces to address the challenges of future conflicts, emphasizing the significance of international collaboration in the defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/australia-strengthens-military-capabilities-with-nammos-apex-ammunition-for-f-35a	2025-01-23T00:17:09-08:00
