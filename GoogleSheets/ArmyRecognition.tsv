US Navy Eyes Patriot Missiles to Counter China’s Hypersonic Threats in Pacific	According to information published by The Economic Times on October 25, 2024, the U.S. Navy is advancing plans to deploy Patriot interceptor missiles on its warships, Amid rising security concerns over China’s potential use of advanced hypersonic weapons in the Indo-Pacific. This move is intended to counter the growing threat of Chinese missile technology, specifically anti-ship ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles capable of evading traditional defense systems, according to two senior defense officials.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of US Navy warships. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Patriot missiles, particularly the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) variant, are already employed by the U.S. Army for land-based air defense. These interceptors, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, offer agility and the capability to target highly maneuverable threats, positioning them as a potential solution to counter hypersonic advancements anticipated in Chinese arsenals. Integrating these interceptors into naval defense systems signals a notable shift in U.S. military strategy as tensions in the Indo-Pacific persist and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) rapidly modernizes its capabilities. The addition of the PAC-3 interceptors to the Navy's arsenal is seen as essential to expanding the layered defense system on U.S. vessels. Demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors has soared, driven by a heightened interest from foreign governments and the U.S. Army’s ambition to more than double production in the coming years. Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3’s manufacturer, is exploring avenues to increase production, including plans for a new production line for missile seekers in Florida. This facility would supplement Boeing’s existing manufacturing of seekers, and production for PAC-3 could eventually include Japan, a key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific region. The PAC-3's compact size, agility, and advanced 'hit-to-kill' technology—which allows the interceptor to destroy threats by direct impact rather than proximity detonation—make it well-suited for combating high-speed ballistic and hypersonic missiles. These interceptors would enhance existing capabilities aboard U.S. ships to target and neutralize fast-moving threats. The U.S. Navy has already conducted preliminary virtual tests of PAC-3 interceptors aboard a 'virtual Aegis ship,' using the Mk. 70 vertical launcher system, which is foundational for naval missile launches. However, the interceptors have yet to be physically deployed on a vessel, and additional testing is required to synchronize PAC-3 systems with the Navy's SPY-1 radar, a key component of the Aegis missile defense system. The PAC-3 interceptors have demonstrated significant capabilities in recent conflicts, successfully intercepting high-speed threats such as Russia’s Khinzal missiles in Ukraine. The missile’s success has spurred interest in incorporating it into the Navy’s defenses, adding a cost-effective layer against the sophisticated hypersonic and ballistic missiles developed by China. China’s missile capabilities, particularly the DF-21D 'carrier killer' and the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, are a central security concern for U.S. forces in the Pacific. The DF-27, which can cover a range of up to 5,000 miles, features an aerodynamic warhead that can maneuver, complicating defense strategies. This missile could pose a direct threat to U.S. naval forces and moving targets alike. While the Navy’s existing SM-6 missiles can reach targets in space, the PAC-3, though limited in range, offers greater agility due to rockets positioned near its nose, enabling it to respond effectively to high-speed threats in lower altitudes. The introduction of PAC-3 MSE interceptors could supplement these existing capabilities, enhancing the layered defense necessary to address the evolving threat environment in the Indo-Pacific.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-eyes-patriot-missiles-to-counter-chinas-hypersonic-threats-in-pacific	2024-10-25T05:18:04-07:00

Earlier reports, such as Tasnim in November 2023, confirmed Iran’s acquisition of Russian aircraft, including Mil Mi-28 attack helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 training jets. According to Sardar Seyed Mehdi Farhi, Deputy Minister of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, these acquisitions are part of ongoing efforts to enhance Iran’s military aviation capabilities, particularly focusing on helicopter upgrades and improvements to night flying and avionics systems. Farhi also mentioned the work of Iran’s Helicopter Support and Renovation Company (Panha) over the past three decades. This development aligns with discussions held in January 2023 between Igor Levitin, a special assistant to the Russian president, and Iran’s First Vice President, Mohammed Mokhbar. During this meeting, Levitin expressed Russia’s readiness to pursue joint helicopter production with Iran. Amir Mojtaba Rouhani, CEO of Panha, had previously noted Iran’s regional leadership in helicopter maintenance services. In June 2023, Iranian Air Force Commander Amir Hamid Vahedi, in an interview about the Su-35, stated, 'We need the said Sukhoi jet, but we don’t know when it will arrive.' Vahedi referred to the construction of underground air bases, such as 'Oryol 44,' designed to protect the country’s fighter jets from potential attacks, including bunker-buster munitions. He indicated that these bases are strategically located to ensure operational safety and readiness. Vahedi also highlighted the modernization of Iran’s fleet of F-4 and F-14 aircraft, focusing on radar upgrades and extending the range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Iran’s Air Force currently operates a diverse fleet of fighter jets, including American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, as well as Russian-made MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft. The fleet also includes domestically produced jets like the HESA Saeqeh and Kowsar. The recent acquisitions of Mil Mi-28 helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 trainers represent further steps in diversifying Iran’s air capabilities. The first two Yak-130 aircraft were delivered on September 11, 2023, and stationed at Shahid Babaei Air Base in Isfahan, central Iran. These jets are intended to facilitate the training of Iranian pilots in operating advanced Russian-made fighter jets, including the Su-35. In recent years, Iran has been working toward acquiring Su-35 fighter jets from Russia. Although there have been multiple reports about anticipated deliveries, Iranian officials have denied these claims. In April 2024, Tehran refuted reports that 12 Su-35 jets would be delivered imminently, which had been circulated in Iranian media and later retracted by the country’s Student News Network (SNN). Similar expectations were reported earlier in January 2023, indicating that the jets would arrive by March, yet the deliveries were postponed. Despite these delays, confidence in the eventual delivery of Su-35 fighter jets remains strong, bolstered by Iran’s successful procurement of Yak-130 trainers and Mil Mi-28 helicopters in November 2023. The Su-35’s specifications include enhanced avionics and radar systems designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 2.25 and an operational range of 3,600 kilometers, featuring an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar that allows for tracking multiple targets. As part of these efforts, the Yak-130 trainer has been integrated into the fleet alongside the planned acquisition of Su-35 fighter jets. These additions represent a significant step in Iran’s strategy to upgrade its air capabilities amid ongoing scrutiny and increasing attention to its defense partnerships with Russia. The United States has expressed concerns over the expanding cooperation between the two countries, particularly within the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Iran, however, has denied supplying weapons to Russia for use in the conflict. Regardless of these accusations, the growing defense cooperation between Russia and Iran is shaping regional military dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/iran-to-produce-su-30-and-su-35-fighter-jets-following-russias-agreement	2024-10-25T03:36:30-07:00

Three NATO Countries Commit to Lithuania in Air Defense Rotation Agreement	The Lithuanian Ministry of Defense has confirmed that starting next year, three NATO allies will send their air defense systems as part of a rotational deployment. Details, shared by Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas on Žinių Radijas radio, indicate that these rotations aim to ensure a nearly continuous presence of NATO’s air defense capabilities in the Baltic states. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kasčiūnas confirmed that the Netherlands would be among the participating countries, though he did not specify the others (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) Kasčiūnas confirmed that the Netherlands would be among the participating countries, though he did not specify the others. When asked about potential Swedish involvement—particularly relevant as Lithuania strengthens military ties with Sweden through the acquisition of CV90 infantry fighting vehicles—the minister stated he could not confirm this possibility at this time. Germany, with its advanced Patriot systems and strong commitment to regional security, is a likely participant, as are the United States, which also has significant air defense capabilities. Poland, neighboring Lithuania, possesses modern Patriot systems and could be another key actor in these rotations. Additionally, France, equipped with SAMP/T systems, and potentially Sweden, now a NATO member and strengthening military links with Lithuania, are also plausible candidates. The rotational air defense initiative, approved by NATO last year, aims to bolster security in the Baltic Sea region by addressing rising security challenges. This rotation model seeks to offset the lack of permanent air defense systems in the Baltic states by maintaining a steady presence of allied forces, providing enhanced protection against potential threats. The Netherlands has previously deployed its long-range Patriot system at Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania this summer as part of the BALTCON24 exercise. This deployment marked a significant step toward closer cooperation between the two nations. Kasčiūnas also mentioned the possibility of a regular Patriot deployment from the Netherlands for exercises in Lithuania, underscoring the strategic value of this partnership. Alongside NATO's rotational deployments, Lithuania is actively strengthening its own air defense. Two agreements signed in October 2024 with European manufacturers reflect this commitment. The first, signed with Saab Dynamics on October 1, secures additional short-range air defense systems, RBS 70 NG, based on portable missiles, for approximately €130 million. These systems offer increased mobility and responsiveness against low-altitude aerial threats. The second agreement, concluded with Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace, involves the acquisition of the NASAMS medium-range system, valued at around €234 million. Originally scheduled for 2030, this acquisition was advanced by seven years through additional funding, allowing for early deployment of these essential capabilities. NASAMS will enhance the air defense of Lithuanian armed forces, providing improved coverage against mid-range aerial threats.

South Korea reveals supersonic air-to-surface missile to strengthen fighter jets exports	On October 24, 2024, at the Sacheon Air Show, the South Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) unveiled a supersonic air-to-surface missile for the first time. This unveiling comes amidst concerns over delays in weapons integration, which have affected the export competitiveness of domestic fighter jets such as the FA-50 and the KF-21. However, the new missile offers promising export potential and may help strengthen the position of Korean defense exports in international markets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. (Picture source: YouTube/슈퍼소닉TV) The supersonic air-to-surface missile is designed to be mounted on aircraft and can strike key ground targets with precision from long range. Similar to missiles like the Cheonryong developed by LIG Nex1 and Germany’s Taurus, this missile performs the same fundamental task. However, unlike subsonic air-to-surface missiles that fly at speeds of 700–1,100 km/h, the newly unveiled missile reaches supersonic speeds of Mach 2.5, or around 3,000 km/h, making it much harder to detect and intercept. With a range of 300 km, the missile can hit its target in just about five minutes after launch, significantly reducing the reaction time for enemy defenses. The missile is also expected to incorporate stealth technology, making it less detectable by enemy radar. One of the key features enabling such high speeds is the ducted ramjet engine. This innovative propulsion system combines the advantages of jet and rocket engines, using atmospheric oxygen instead of carrying an onboard oxidizer. This design not only simplifies the structure but also allows for longer burn times and faster speeds compared to traditional jet engines. Another notable characteristic of this missile is its modular design, which enables it to perform multiple functions. By simply swapping modules, the missile can be configured to engage either ground targets or enemy ships. The missile’s seeker, equipped with both radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, further enhances its ability to accurately strike targets in various weather conditions and amidst electronic countermeasures. Although the missile displayed at the air show was a test model rather than a final product, it represents a significant step forward. Weapons intended for aircraft integration typically require extensive software development and flight testing, which incurs substantial costs. To address this, ADD has been using test models for preliminary drop and flight tests. Flight tests of this new missile are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. (Picture source: 23.BLT) According to the data released by ADD, the missile has been under development since 2022, with full completion expected by 2026. Flight tests are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. Key defense contractors such as Hanwha Aerospace and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) are participating in the missile's development. Once integrated with the FA-50, the supersonic air-to-surface missile will offer an unparalleled capability within its class, significantly boosting the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jet. In contrast, rival jets like the F-16V and JAS-39E Gripen currently only operate subsonic air-to-surface missiles. While France’s Rafale can carry supersonic air-to-surface missiles, these are equipped with nuclear warheads, making them unsuitable for export. As a result, the supersonic missile will be an exclusive asset for the FA-50 and KF-21. Countries that have already purchased the FA-50, such as Poland, are expected to express interest in this missile as well. For instance, the South Korean Air Force (ROKAF) first deployed the FA-50 in 2014, assigning 20 units to an Air Force wing. ROKAF ordered a total of 60 FA-50s, and in 2014, the aircraft successfully conducted a test firing of an AGM-65 Maverick missile. Indonesia signed a contract in 2011 for 16 T-50i aircraft, a variant of the FA-50 with light attack capabilities, followed by additional orders in 2021. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute to the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jets. (Picture source: Twitter/KalisGo) Iraq also signed a contract for 24 FA-50IQ variants in 2013, receiving the first batch in 2017, though operational challenges delayed their deployment until 2022. The Philippine Air Force procured 12 FA-50PH units in 2014, and since 2017, these aircraft have been used in various combat operations, including airstrikes against terrorist positions. Additional orders are being considered as part of the PAF's Flight Plan 2028. Several other countries have purchased or shown interest in the FA-50. Thailand ordered a total of 12 T-50TH units, with deliveries starting in 2018. Poland is acquiring 48 FA-50 aircraft to replace its aging MiG-29 and Su-22 fleets, with deliveries beginning in 2023. Malaysia finalized a contract for 18 FA-50 Block 20 aircraft in 2023, with the possibility of future orders. Other nations expressing interest or considering the FA-50 include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brunei, Colombia, Croatia, Egypt, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, Spain, Slovakia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Vietnam. Some of these countries have explored options for joint production, while others are considering the FA-50 for advanced tactical and training purposes. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute not only to the enhancement of military power but also to the growth of defense exports. By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. Therefore, this new supersonic air-to-surface missile is poised to play a key role in both augmenting South Korea’s military strength and expanding its defense exports, marking a significant upgrade of the FA-50's capacities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/south-korea-reveals-supersonic-air-to-surface-missile-to-strengthen-fighter-jets-exports	2024-10-25T01:34:31-07:00

US Marines Integrate Moving Stock Aiming System to Enhance Rifle Accuracy Against Drones	The U.S. Marines are exploring an automated targeting system for standard infantry rifles, aimed at improving every soldier’s capacity to defend against the rising threat of drones on the battlefield. The ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS) innovation incorporates an automatic adjustment mechanism to fine-tune the aiming point, optimizing precision against unmanned aerial threats. Currently undergoing tests with the 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii, this equipment marks a significant advancement for accurately targeting moving threats, which are often challenging to counter through traditional methods. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marine fires a ZeroMark Fire Control System attached to an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle during a live-fire demonstration on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Oct. 23, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Developed by New York-based startup ZeroMark, founded in 2022, the ZeroMark FCS has received investment from prominent backers, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Ground Up Ventures, and benefits from $7 million in funding for research and development. The system relies on sophisticated machine vision technology, with electro-optical cameras and LiDAR sensors to detect and track targets in real time. The system’s distinct feature lies in its motorized buttstock, which adjusts the rifle’s angle to optimize shooting accuracy, allowing the shooter to target drones more effectively. Unlike existing assisted-aiming systems like the SMASH 2000 series from Israeli firm Smart Shooter, ZeroMark’s FCS uses advanced vision algorithms to steer the weapon’s barrel, even making slight angular adjustments to maximize shot alignment. ZeroMark’s technology, described as a 'fire control system,' includes a small computer and motorized stock. CEO Joel Anderson explains that this motorized stock creates a virtual pivot between the shoulder and rifle, allowing small degree adjustments to refine shot trajectory and compensate for both drone and shooter movement, as well as variations caused by noise or torque. Installation on any rifle takes just 30 seconds, potentially making drone defense a manageable task for the average soldier. Anderson states that the system 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting an 18-meter-diameter circle,' making such skills accessible to a broader range of soldiers. A former U.S. Navy member and the first security director of MongoDB, Anderson says he drew inspiration for ZeroMark after driving a Tesla with autopilot and wondering why similar technology wasn’t available to soldiers. Seeing a growing need for anti-drone solutions, he presented the prototype to a16z partners, who encouraged him to launch the startup in 2022. ZeroMark’s development is focused solely on countering offensive drones. While acknowledging that the concept of a weapon 'that never misses' may be controversial, Anderson clarifies that the company avoids marketing its systems to law enforcement, stating: 'I don’t believe the world is ready for that, nor am I. I don’t want to see AI-enabled weapons in police hands.' To mitigate potential misuse, the company has incorporated remote management, license-based activation, and fleet management features to ensure responsible use. FCS units are already in use by private security firms to protect assets like boats against potential drone threats related to piracy. ZeroMark is in talks to send its devices to Ukraine and is engaging in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense for testing and evaluation that could lead to larger orders. Beyond self-targeting capabilities, Anderson envisions ZeroMark software being applied in other contexts, such as cameras capable of identifying drone types, origin, or payload. In the long term, he envisions integrating the system into head-up displays or auditory interfaces to deliver real-time critical information to soldiers. Anderson sums up his vision: 'Large systems like aircraft carriers don’t win wars. They help project power but don’t capture Husseins, don’t kill Bin Ladens, don’t bring hostages home; soldiers do... and I want them to be as untouchable as an F-22 in the sky.'	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-marines-integrate-moving-stock-aiming-system-to-enhance-rifle-accuracy-against-drones	2024-10-25T00:50:07-07:00

US confirms 3000 North Korean soldiers moved to Russia for military training	On October 23, 2024, during a press conference, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the deployment of these 3,000 North Korean soldiers to eastern Russia. According to reports, these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan region in North Korea to Vladivostok, a major port in eastern Russia. They were then transferred to various military training centers in eastern Russia, where they are currently undergoing intensive training. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning (Picture source: KNCA) The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning. Fears of these troops engaging in combat alongside Russian forces have heightened concerns about further escalation in the war in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin echoed this concern, stating that this development would be a 'serious step' after North Korea had already supplied arms to Russia. The exact nature of the North Korean soldiers' mission, who are currently in training, remains unclear. This situation arises as Russia seeks to bolster its military capabilities in a conflict that has become protracted. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, the war has escalated, causing significant casualties on both sides, while remaining largely focused on the eastern front of Ukraine. The potential arrival of North Korean soldiers could mark a significant shift in this war of attrition. The U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation and has briefed Ukrainian authorities as well as international partners. Kirby added that should these North Korean soldiers enter combat, they would become 'legitimate targets' for the Ukrainian forces. The deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia is seen by many observers as a sign of weakness on the part of the Kremlin. The decision to turn to Pyongyang, a largely isolated state on the international stage, reflects the difficult position in which Moscow finds itself after more than two years of conflict. Relying on North Korean human resources further highlights Russia’s growing dependence on marginal alliances, even as its losses on the battlefield continue to mount. The South Korean government, for its part, has expressed concern about the potential military technology Russia might offer North Korea in exchange for this military support. Some experts suggest that Moscow could provide advanced military technologies to Pyongyang, particularly in the areas of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which would significantly enhance the threat posed by North Korea to the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has also indicated that this deployment could involve up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers by the end of the year. Despite denials from both Moscow and Pyongyang regarding troop deployments or arms transfers, the international community, especially NATO, views this growing military alliance between Russia and North Korea as a major concern. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been invited to Brussels to share intelligence on these developments with NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-confirms-3000-north-korean-soldiers-moved-to-russia-for-military-training	2024-10-24T01:10:49-07:00

(Picture source: Chinese MoD) The Type 903A supply ships are integral to the PLA Navy’s logistics, designed to support naval operations through extensive replenishment functions. The Kekexilihu is equipped to deliver a wide array of supplies, including fuel and essential materials, while also facilitating helicopter operations. Replenishment operations Replenishment at sea (RAS) plays a crucial role in modern naval warfare by enabling fleets to remain operational far from their home bases for extended periods. This capability extends the endurance of naval forces by allowing them to resupply with fuel, ammunition, food, and other essential stores without returning to port, thus maintaining their presence in the operational area and maximizing combat effectiveness. During major naval campaigns like World War II, RAS allowed fleets, such as the U.S. Navy’s Task Force 58, to remain engaged in continuous operations, including long-range strikes against Japan, by refueling and resupplying at sea. The ability to conduct underway replenishments meant that fleets could avoid the lengthy transit times to distant bases, which would otherwise limit their operational tempo. By the end of the war, the U.S. had refined RAS to include not just fuel but also ordnance, enabling sustained high-tempo operations over vast distances​. In more recent conflicts, such as the Falklands War, the critical nature of RAS was highlighted when the British Navy operated 7,000 miles from home. The success of this operation relied heavily on the Navy’s ability to sustain its fleet through effective resupply at sea. Similarly, today’s complex naval missions—ranging from humanitarian aid to high-intensity conflict—depend on the logistical support provided by RAS to maintain forward-deployed naval forces​. Moreover, replenishment operations are not without risks. Ships involved in RAS are highly vulnerable, as their ability to maneuver is limited while they are connected for resupply. This vulnerability underscores the importance of coordination, precision, and technology, as modern RAS systems increasingly emphasize safety and reliability​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-supply-ship-kekexilihu-conducts-helicopter-replenishment-during-maritime-drill-in-yellow-sea	2024-10-24T00:50:54-07:00	
Leave SCAF for GCAP: Germany’s Growing Alliance with UK in Combat Drone Technology	The strategic relationship between Germany and the United Kingdom has taken on new following the announcement of the Trinity House Agreement on October 23, 2024. This defense agreement focuses on joint development efforts, particularly creating a combat drone. The collaboration between the two countries could signal a shift in Germany's defense alignment, as it also encompasses areas related to both the SCAF (Système de Combat Aérien du Futur) and GCAP (Global Combat Air Programme) projects. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance (Picture source: Leonardo ) In November 2023, rumors surfaced suggesting that Germany might abandon the SCAF program in favor of joining GCAP. Despite official denials, the Trinity House Agreement seems to bolster these claims by intensifying defense ties between Germany and the UK, including joint land-based weapons projects and drone development. The SCAF Project, also known as FCAS (Future Combat Air System), is a large-scale European initiative involving France, Germany, and Spain. It aims to develop a next-generation air combat system, expected to be operational around 2040. This program is based on a 'system of systems' approach, including three main components: the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), unmanned systems called Remote Carriers (RC), and a digital infrastructure known as the Combat Cloud. The NGF, led by Dassault Aviation, will serve as the central platform for advanced combat missions, assisted by RC drones that provide specific support capabilities. The Combat Cloud will enable integrated communication between all system elements, optimizing data management and decision-making, even in contested environments. The objective is to strengthen European technological sovereignty and ensure autonomous defense capabilities for future threats. The GCAP Project, launched in 2022, is a competing initiative led by the UK, Italy, and Japan. The goal is to develop a sixth-generation fighter that can operate alongside unmanned systems, combat drones, and advanced intelligent weapons. Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance. The project aims to replace the UK and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons and Japan's Mitsubishi F-2 by 2035. It benefits from industrial expertise provided by partners such as BAE Systems, Leonardo, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries​. While both programs aim to develop next-generation air combat capabilities, they differ in structure and ambition. SCAF focuses on enhancing European interoperability between existing platforms like the Rafale and Eurofighter, while GCAP involves broader cooperation with a focus on transnational alliances beyond Europe. However, delays in the SCAF program could lead to Germany reorienting part of its efforts toward projects that address its more immediate needs. The Trinity House Agreement, presented by the UK Ministry of Defense as a significant step for European security, underscores the growing importance of cooperation between the two largest European defense investors. In addition to enhanced joint exercises, the agreement includes provisions to protect critical underwater infrastructure and marks the first-ever temporary deployment of German P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in Scotland, bolstering the UK's surveillance capabilities. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon (Picture source: Army Recognition) A major component of this agreement is the defense industry collaboration, including plans for a large-caliber weapons manufacturing facility in the UK and joint work on ground-based drones (UGVs). This initiative could pave the way for British participation in the Franco-German MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) project. The agreement also emphasizes the rapid development of new, more precise long-range weapons systems. Although the German Defense Ministry has been vague on this point, these projects could fall under the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, which the UK recently joined. The Trinity House Agreement also touches on air defense cooperation, with plans to integrate British and German systems to better protect European airspace from long-range missile threats. Despite the UK's current limitations in this domain, as noted in a recent report, this cooperation could enhance collective security in Europe. One of the most notable aspects of this agreement is the commitment to developing autonomous aerial drones that can operate in coordination with fighter aircraft. Although Germany had initially planned to collaborate with France on the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS) project, Berlin's decision to purchase P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Boeing ended that initiative. The agreement with the UK could signal a shift toward solutions more tailored to the specific needs of both nations. The German Ministry of Defense clarified that these drones will be developed in close cooperation with allies, particularly France, as part of SCAF's third pillar, which Germany oversees. This pillar focuses on drones and connected effectors. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon. Although the technical details of this project remain undisclosed, it appears to align with the goals of the Trinity House Agreement. Finally, supporting Ukraine remains a central objective for both countries. This agreement reaffirms their commitment to providing Ukraine with the military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Concrete initiatives include integrating modern missile systems into the Sea King helicopters donated by Germany and closer collaboration between the UK and German defense industries to support Ukraine's war effort.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/leave-scaf-for-gcap-germanys-growing-alliance-with-uk-in-combat-drone-technology	2024-10-24T00:27:21-07:00

This development offers a lower-cost option for military operations where affordability and mobility are essential factors. This technical vehicle, also referred to as a non-standard tactical vehicle (NSTV), was presented during a visit by Nigerian officials in July 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In this setup, the Hilux-based Cirit system could be effective against lighter targets, providing an alternative to traditional military vehicles. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Toyota Hilux is known for its durability and reliability in conflict zones, often serving as a weapon carrier or 'technical' (an improvised light fighting vehicle typically based on a pickup) in asymmetric warfare. Its widespread use is due to its robustness, ease of repair, the availability of parts globally, and its ability to operate in difficult terrain. This makes it a practical option for both insurgent groups and military forces with limited access to more advanced vehicles. The Hilux became prominent during the 1980s in the Chadian-Libyan conflict, later known as the 'Toyota War,' where it played a role in Chad's success against Libya’s conventional forces. Since then, it has been commonly used in modern conflicts, often equipped with heavy machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and other weaponry, providing a mobile firepower option. Its usage has been observed across various groups, from rebel forces in Africa and the Middle East to special operations forces from different countries. The Toyota Hilux in this configuration has been modified to carry a turret on its flatbed, equipped with four Cirit missiles. Aselsan’s Karakurt electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) system is installed on top of the cabin, which includes a laser designator for target acquisition. This EO/IR system improves the vehicle's capability to identify and engage targets, offering a cost-effective alternative to more expensive and heavily armed systems like the KMC, which fires UMTAS anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs).

Poland introduces SA-35MM counter-drone air defense system using programmable ammunition	At the inaugural International Armament Congress, held from October 21 to 25, 2024, in Kraków, Poland, defense company Pit-Radwar presented a new 35mm self-propelled artillery system equipped with programmable ammunition. Designed to integrate into the evolving air defense architecture of the Polish Armed Forces, this system aims to enhance very short-range air defense (VSHORAD) capabilities against modern aerial threats, including drones, aircraft, and cruise missiles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The SA-35MM achieves a 97% hit probability using programmable ABM ammunition, with just seven projectiles releasing over 50 subprojectiles each. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The newly unveiled system, named the SA-35MM, combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system. It features an independent optoelectronic target-tracking system called ZGS-35, a hybrid fire control system with the TUGA radar, and optoelectronic sensors. Mounted on a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform, the system is developed to engage a wide spectrum of air targets performing maneuvers in course, speed, and altitude within the fire zone, enabling effective short-term anti-aircraft defense of stationary strategic assets, troop concentrations, and mobile units. The SA-35MM is particularly effective against low-cost, small, and very small targets, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (including kamikaze drones). The system is compatible with Polish air defense systems and is capable of autonomous target engagement, offering a high level of automation and remote control capabilities. Its design allows for fast mission readiness and deployment without manual alignment. The AM-35mm automatic cannon has a rate of fire of 550 rounds per minute and features a two-sided, chained ammunition feeding system with a magazine capacity of 2 x 100 rounds. It can immediately switch between two types of ammunition, typically sub-caliber FAPDS-T (Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot with Tracer) and programmable Air Burst Munition (ABM), allowing it to effectively combat various airborne and ground threats. The cannon is reduced in size and weight by utilizing carbon fiber technology, and it can operate autonomously via its own remote-control console or integrated with a combat management system. The ZGS-35 optoelectronic tracking system includes an infrared thermal imaging camera, a daylight camera, a high-repetition laser rangefinder, a video tracker, and a short-range interrogator. These components enable accuracy in dynamic object tracking, allowing the system to perform combat operations in various weather conditions, both day and night. The tracking head has an operational range in elevation from -10° to 85° and can perform continuous 360° rotation in azimuth. It provides range readout limits from a minimum of 200 meters to a maximum of 30,000 meters, with a ranging rate of 30 Hz. The SA-35MM combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system and a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The TUGA radar, part of the hybrid fire control system, operates on continuous wave modulation by frequency (FMCW) with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna in the X-band. This radar technology uses low transmitted signal power, making it difficult to detect by enemy reconnaissance devices, thus increasing operational security. Despite its low power and compact size, the TUGA radar has a detection range from 50 meters to 50 kilometers and can detect small drones at distances up to 5 kilometers. The development of this artillery system is a collaborative effort involving Pit-Radwar, the Military University of Technology, and the defense company Mesko. The project is co-financed by Poland's National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR), as part of Competition no. 12/2022 for projects in development works for state defense and security. The Tactical and Technical Assumptions have been approved by the AU Chief, with the objective to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system. The implementation period spans from December 20, 2022, to June 20, 2025. During the congress, Pit-Radwar conducted demonstrations showcasing the system's capabilities. One test involved targeting a small unmanned aerial vehicle located 1,000 meters away, with an angular size of 0.5x2.0 milliradians. The AG-35 cannon achieved a dispersion of no more than 0.5 milliradians, closely matching the dimensions of the drone, demonstrating the system's precision. Field test results indicated that achieving a 99% probability of hitting the target with at least one projectile required firing 24 rounds of typical TP-T/FAPDS-T ammunition. In contrast, using programmable ABM ammunition, firing only seven projectiles achieved a probability of hitting at the level of 97%, with each projectile releasing over 50 subprojectiles. This represents a significant reduction in ammunition consumption while maintaining a high probability of target destruction. The objective is to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system, before June 20, 2025. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) Pit-Radwar proposed integrating the 35mm cannon into self-propelled artillery systems mounted on the AS-35 wheeled chassis. Two configurations for very short-range air defense (VSHORAD) batteries were suggested. The first, an artillery battery, would consist of four self-propelled SA-35 guns, a WG-35 fire control vehicle, a command vehicle, and a preliminary detection radar such as the Soła or Bystra systems. The second, a rocket-artillery battery, would include self-propelled Poprad missile systems enhanced with anti-drone technologies and a K-band tracking radar, in addition to the artillery components. The SA-35MM system operates autonomously, equipped with its own fire control system based on the ZGS-35 optoelectronic tracking and aiming head. The integrated optoelectronic tracking head ensures accuracy in dynamic object tracking through its sensors, which include thermal imaging and daylight cameras, a laser rangefinder, and a video tracker. The system also features a communication and data transmission subsystem, enabling radio and cable communication with the battery command and control system and the WG-35 fire control vehicle, allowing for remote control from a portable terminal. The drive subsystems of the gun and the optoelectronic tracking head are designed with advanced drive units and dedicated electronic controllers, providing high dynamics and precision of movement. An inertial navigation subsystem, including GPS, ensures accurate positioning and continuous measurement of azimuth angle, inclination, and tilt. The system also includes a non-kinetic UAV neutralization system and emphasizes cost-efficiency by reducing logistics and personnel requirements, thereby lowering life-cycle costs. Public and expert reactions at the congress reflected interest in the potential implementation of the system. The presentation of this new 35mm air defense system underscored its significant advantage in reducing ammunition consumption while maintaining effectiveness, especially when compared to 23mm caliber systems. This efficiency is largely attributed to the use of programmable ammunition in the 35mm system, enhancing precision and operational capability. Observers expressed hope that the program would be carried out consistently, with some anticipating the first batteries to be operational by 2026. Others highlighted the necessity for mass production to ensure the security of key facilities and troops, especially given the increasing use of drones in modern conflicts, such as in Ukraine, Gaza, or Lebanon.

Taiwan's Huilong unmanned submarine revealed with hidden torpedo launch capabilities	According to information published by Liberty Times Net on October 23, 2024, recent developments surrounding the 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) have revealed that the platform may possess more capabilities than previously disclosed.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a submarine. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Military enthusiasts recently captured photographs of the vessel docked in a floating dry dock, providing the first clear view of its submerged structure. Notably, the images revealed two torpedo launch tubes at the bow, suggesting a combat potential previously unconfirmed. The 'Huilong' UUV, a collaborative effort between Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) and Lungteh Shipbuilding, has already undergone two sea trials. The newly surfaced images, taken during its current dry-dock operations, clearly display the bow with two square-shaped torpedo launch tube openings, arranged symmetrically. One of these tubes had its hatch open, and nearby, two yellow U-shaped cradles were observed, likely intended for loading or testing torpedoes. During its first sea trial, the bow of the 'Huilong' was reportedly covered, and the vessel exhibited an unusual floating posture, raising speculation that it had not yet been fully outfitted. However, by the second trial, the vessel appeared more streamlined and balanced, leading experts to believe that the torpedo systems had since been installed. Named after the 'Huilong Project' initiated in 2020, this UUV platform is believed to displace around 100 tons, with a length of approximately 30 meters and a beam of 6 meters. Officially completed in late 2023, the project is part of a broader government effort to harness domestic innovation in both military and civilian dual-use technologies and to expand the use of marine resources. While primarily a test platform designed to validate various scientific and technological developments, the 'Huilong' is not classified purely as an armed combat submarine. However, the recent revelations of its armament suggest that its capabilities extend beyond basic testing functions, offering flexibility and potential for future applications. The implications of these findings, combined with the vessel's modularity, make the 'Huilong' a key platform to watch in the region's growing interest in unmanned naval technologies. Unmanned Underwater Vehicles The KRONOS SUB and the Chinese UUV-300CD are two key concepts in the development of unmanned submarines with the potential to launch torpedoes. The KRONOS SUB, developed by Italian company DRASS Group, is designed as a fully autonomous unmanned submarine. It aims to provide underwater combat capabilities, including launching torpedoes, making it one of the first serious contenders for such a role. The UUV-300CD, developed by China, represents another notable leap in unmanned underwater combat technology.

British army Intel Reports Russia's Escalation in Use of One-Way Attack Drones Against Ukraine	According to a report published by the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) Intelligence Service on September 23, 2024, Russia launched over 1,300 One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (OWA-UAVs) into Ukraine during September alone. This marks the highest number of such drone strikes in a single month since the beginning of the conflict, signaling a significant escalation in the use of these unmanned aerial systems. The British MoD warns that, based on the current rate of operations, it is almost certain that Russia will surpass this figure in October 2024, reflecting a growing trend of intensified aerial assaults against Ukrainian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Debris of a Russian Shahed-136 (Geran-2) drone scattered across a Ukrainian field. (Picture source: Russian Social Network) While it remains unclear whether Russia can sustain this aggressive rate of OWA-UAV (One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles ) strikes throughout the year, intelligence reports suggest that Moscow is likely expanding its capacity to produce these drones domestically. Previously reliant on Iranian-supplied UAVs, Russia is believed to be increasing its production capabilities to maintain and even amplify its ability to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine. This shift in supply lines is seen as part of a broader strategy to mitigate the risks of sanctions and supply chain disruptions, giving Moscow a more resilient capability to sustain its drone warfare efforts. OWA-UAVs, often colloquially referred to as 'kamikaze drones,' are primarily employed to strike critical Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly energy facilities. These drones, due to their low cost and ability to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory, have proven effective in disrupting energy supplies and damaging critical civilian infrastructure, particularly ahead of the harsh winter months. This has put enormous pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems, which are tasked with countering both conventional missile strikes and these swarming UAVs. In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, several Russian One-Way Attack (OWA) drones, or loitering munitions, have been deployed, each with specific technical features. The Shahed-136 (Russian designation: Geran-2), developed by Iran, is one of the most frequently used OWA drones. It is known for its delta-wing design, giving it a distinctive appearance. The Shahed-136 is powered by a small engine, typically the MD-550, and has a range of about 2,500 kilometers. It carries a warhead of approximately 40-50 kilograms and is designed to strike static targets such as infrastructure and supply depots. While its speed is relatively low (about 185 km/h), its main strength lies in the ability to be deployed in large numbers, making it difficult for defense systems to intercept all of them​. The Shahed-131 (Russian designation: Geran-1) is a smaller version of the Shahed-136 and shares much of the same design, though with a smaller payload and range. It has a range of about 900 kilometers and carries a warhead weighing around 10-15 kilograms. It also features a delta-wing design and is primarily used for shorter-range attacks on military targets​. Russia’s domestically produced Lancet drone, developed by ZALA Aero, features more advanced targeting capabilities compared to the Shahed drones. The Lancet is equipped with electro-optical systems for greater precision and can carry a payload of up to 3 kilograms, depending on the model. It has a range of up to 40 kilometers and a speed of about 110 km/h. It is designed for tactical strikes on specific targets such as artillery, vehicles, and air defense systems. The Lancet’s modular design allows it to be used for both surveillance and attack missions​. Each of these drones plays a crucial role in Russia’s strategy in Ukraine, especially in targeting rear positions and forcing Ukraine to expend significant resources on air defense. Despite their widespread use, many of these drones have been intercepted by Ukrainian defense systems, but their low cost and mass deployment make them a persistent threat​. The increased tempo of drone attacks is likely aimed at exhausting Ukrainian air defense resources, compelling Ukraine to divert attention from other threats, such as ballistic and cruise missile strikes. In addition, these drone assaults are part of Russia's broader strategy to weaken Ukraine’s economic resilience, particularly by targeting its energy grid. The surge in drone attacks is raising significant concerns in Kyiv and among Ukraine's Western allies. Ukrainian officials have warned that the continuous targeting of energy infrastructure could lead to widespread blackouts, severely impacting both civilian life and military operations. As winter approaches, such attacks on power stations, substations, and other critical utilities could lead to further humanitarian challenges, especially in regions already hard-hit by the war. Ukraine has requested additional Western support, particularly in the form of advanced air defense systems capable of intercepting these UAVs. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are working to adapt their tactics to counter the evolving drone threat, employing electronic warfare and anti-drone systems to mitigate the impact. As Russia escalates its OWA-UAV campaign, Ukraine faces increasing pressure on multiple fronts. The British MoD’s report highlights not only the unprecedented scale of these drone attacks but also the potential for further intensification as Russia builds up its domestic production capabilities. With winter looming and infrastructure already under strain, the coming months could prove to be a critical period in the ongoing conflict, with both sides seeking to gain the upper hand in a war of attrition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/british-army-intel-reports-russias-escalation-in-use-of-one-way-attack-drones-against-ukraine	2024-10-23T01:58:54-07:00

Originally expected to last four years, the RCOH was delayed due to various issues, including supply chain disruptions and the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing completion to May 2023. This overhaul extended the carrier's service life and upgraded it to support newer technologies, including the F-35C fighter jet. After completing RCOH in May 2023, the George Washington conducted sea trials and pre-deployment certifications. In April 2024, it embarked on a deployment as part of the U.S. Navy’s Southern Seas 2024 exercise, sailing around South America and engaging in joint exercises with several Latin American navies. This operation was part of the carrier’s transition back into forward-deployed service in the Indo-Pacific. By October 2024, the carrier began its final transit to Yokosuka, Japan, where it will replace USS Ronald Reagan as the forward-deployed naval forces carrier for the U.S. 7th Fleet. This marks the second time the George Washington has served in this role, having previously been stationed in Japan from 2008 to 2015.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uss-george-washington-conducts-pacfire-in-pacific-tests-phalanx-ciws-on-simulated-targets	2024-10-23T01:40:45-07:00

The E-7 has been selected by NATO as its next command and control aircraft, and the RAF’s Wedgetails will contribute to NATO’s Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Force. After departing Southend Airport, the Wedgetail returned to STS Aviation Services in Birmingham for additional modifications and is scheduled to undergo further testing and evaluation before entering full service in 2025. This aircraft will serve as the most advanced AEW&amp;C platform for the RAF, providing the UK with expanded airborne surveillance capabilities to improve situational awareness. Wing Commander McDonnell, Officer Commanding VIII Squadron, noted the significance of the UK’s first painted Wedgetail, highlighting that it represents a step toward achieving operational capability. The RAF’s Wedgetail fleet will operate under No. 8 Squadron and be stationed at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, alongside the nine Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Both the Wedgetail and Poseidon are based on the Boeing 737-700 increased gross weight (IGW) airframe, known for its reliability and reduced maintenance requirements. The 737 series benefits from a global supplier base and support network, which supports the long-term operation of these fleets. RAF Lossiemouth has undergone infrastructure upgrades to accommodate the Wedgetail, including a maintenance facility built by McLaughlin &amp; Harvey. This facility supports both the Wedgetail and Poseidon fleets, and at its peak employed over 175 people, with involvement from five Scottish subcontractors. The facility was officially opened in September 2024 and is expected to support the AEW&amp;C fleet for at least 20 years. The first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. (Picture source: Boeing) The UK’s decision to acquire the E-7 began in October 2018, when the British government entered discussions with Boeing to replace its aging E-3D Sentry fleet. These discussions also involved potential cooperation with Australia, which already operated the Wedgetail. The decision to proceed without a competitive tender process led to some criticism, including concerns over favoritism toward Boeing. Saab, a competitor, expressed opposition, stating it could offer its Erieye system on an Airbus A330 MRTT platform. Despite this, in March 2019, the UK finalized a $1.98 billion deal (approximately $2.33 billion in 2023) to purchase five Wedgetail AEW1 aircraft. In December 2020, reports indicated that the UK might reduce its Wedgetail order from five to three aircraft. This reduction was confirmed in the 2021 Integrated Defence Review, raising concerns that only one aircraft might be available for operational tasking at a time. However, in February 2023, Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston suggested the order might eventually increase to five aircraft depending on future requirements. Initially, Marshall Aerospace was selected to carry out airframe modifications, but the company withdrew in May 2020. Boeing then contracted STS Aviation Group’s UK branch to complete the modifications in Birmingham, where more than 100 specialists are converting two commercial airliners, with the remaining aircraft being newly built. Each conversion takes around 24 months, and the first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. Sharing key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER, the E-7 has undergone several modifications to fulfill its AEW&amp;C role, including the addition of ventral fins to balance the radar’s weight and countermeasures mounted on the nose, wingtips, and tail. (Picture source: British MoD) The E-7 Wedgetail shares key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER and is intended to provide the UK with AEW&amp;C capabilities beyond those offered by ground-based systems and fighter aircraft sensors. The Wedgetail is already in service with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the South Korean Air Force, and the Turkish Air Force, and has also been selected by the United States Air Force and NATO to replace aging fleets. The E-7 has undergone several modifications to fulfill its AEW&amp;C role, including the addition of ventral fins to balance the radar’s weight and countermeasures mounted on the nose, wingtips, and tail. It is also equipped with in-flight refueling capabilities, enabling longer mission durations. The aircraft’s cabin includes eight operator consoles, though the Australian fleet uses up to ten. The UK variant is expected to follow a similar configuration to support efficient mission management. The E-7’s primary feature is its Northrop Grumman Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar, housed in a distinctive dorsal fin atop the Boeing 737 Next Generation airframe. This radar provides 360-degree coverage and allows for simultaneous tracking of airborne and maritime targets. It can operate in all weather conditions, with a maximum range exceeding 600 kilometers in look-up mode. The radar also features an ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) capability with a range of over 850 kilometers at 9,000 meters, as well as integrated Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capabilities extending up to 300 nautical miles (555.6 km).

Since its debut in 1978, over 4,500 units have been sold to 25 countries, making it one of the most widely sold fighter jets in the world. However, as a fourth-generation fighter, the F-16 lacks the stealth and advanced electronic warfare systems featured in the KF-21. Its price is estimated at $43 million per unit, making it a less expensive option compared to the South Korean fighter. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is known for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and a range of precision-guided missiles. One of its notable features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing improved detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry various air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfights. With its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X can lock onto targets from extreme angles, making it highly effective in close combat. This combination of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate both long-range and short-range engagements. The F-16 compensates for its older design with better maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures against radar-guided threats. Its agility, combined with helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to target enemies by looking at them, gives the F-16 an advantage in close combat. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, its ability to engage multiple targets at different ranges and its integrated defensive measures provide a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While the Philippines have shown interest in acquiring the F-16, other factors may influence their decision. The country aims to eventually acquire the F-35, regarded as the most advanced fighter jet in operation. The Philippines may choose the F-16 as a stepping stone toward future F-35 procurement. However, the U.S. government strictly controls the sale of the F-35, and some nations, including the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, have had their requests denied. Korea Aerospace Industries is also leveraging its previous success in military aircraft exports. In 2014, KAI delivered 12 FA-50s to the Philippines and has since provided logistical and military support, including maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. Similar models have also been sold to countries such as Poland and Malaysia. KAI hopes to build on this success by offering similar services, including system and weapon upgrades for the KF-21, should the Philippines choose to purchase it. Currently, the KF-21 is limited to air-to-air combat. KAI plans to add air-to-ground capabilities by 2028, with mass production of upgraded versions expected to follow. If KAI secures the contract to supply 10 aircraft to the Philippines, it would mark the first export of the KF-21, a significant milestone for South Korea’s defense industry, which aims to become the third-largest arms exporter within the next five years. The KF-21 Boramae is a joint project between South Korea and Indonesia, aimed at developing a next-generation supersonic fighter with homegrown technology for key components. A prototype was unveiled in April 2021, and mass production is expected to begin by the end of this year, with the first delivery to the South Korean Air Force scheduled for the second half of 2026.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/south-koreas-kf-21-and-lockheed-martins-f-16-shortlisted-for-philippines-fighter-jet-contract	2024-10-22T00:24:05-07:00	
Focus | Russia’s war in Ukraine triggers Sweden’s biggest defense investment since Cold War	On October 15, 2024, the Swedish government introduced its defense strategy for 2025–2030. The plan allocates 170 billion SEK (€14.9 billion) for military defense and 35.7 billion SEK (€3.1 billion) for civil defense, aiming to raise defense spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2028. It also includes a gradual increase in conscription, targeting 10,000 conscripts annually by 2030 and up to 12,000 by 2035​.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2035, the wartime organization of the Swedish Armed Forces is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. (Picture source: Sweden MoD) Sweden’s transition from military neutrality to full NATO membership has evolved over recent years, particularly in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This shift in policy represents a significant change from Sweden’s traditional stance, which had prioritized neutrality during the Cold War. Sweden began enhancing its defense posture in 2015 and further increased support to Ukraine after the invasion. As part of its integration into NATO, Sweden has aligned its national defense strategy with collective defense obligations. This transition has involved increasing military readiness, modernizing key systems, and preparing to support NATO operations. The new plan reflects Sweden’s commitment to NATO’s collective security framework. This article examines the details of Sweden's 2025–2030 defense budget, which includes significant investment in military upgrades, expansion of personnel, and improvements across various defense sectors. The strategy aims to strengthen Sweden’s military capabilities and civil defense infrastructure. Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided approximately €4.2 billion of military aid to Ukraine across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. (Picture source: 45oabr) Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, totaling 48 billion SEK (approximately €4.206.600.000) across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. This experience underscores the importance of maintaining stockpiles and rapidly replenishing donated equipment, which explains why the new defense strategy highlights the need for logistical support in prolonged conflicts. The Swedish government has committed 75 billion SEK (€6.572.812.500) over three years (2024–2026) for military assistance to Ukraine, covering financial donations, soldier training, and procurement through the Defense Materiel Administration. Sweden’s participation in capability coalitions (focusing on drones, maritime security, and demining) further demonstrates its dedication to supporting Ukraine's defense. For Swedish authorities, the conflict also highlights the critical role of civilian defense, emphasizing societal resilience and cyber defense. To protect critical infrastructure, the new defense strategy includes the creation of a national cybersecurity center to counter Russian cyberattacks. Another lesson from Ukraine is the importance of technological adaptability in warfare. Rapid integration of new technologies and modifications to existing systems are seen as crucial. The Ukraine conflict also revealed the high resource consumption associated with intense warfare, particularly in terms of ammunition and other vital supplies. Consequently, Sweden plans to collaborate with the defense industry and government to enhance readiness for innovation, ensuring stockpiles of key materials and systems with long delivery times. Additionally, the strategy recognizes the significance of layered air defense and long-range strike capabilities. The strategy emphasizes improving intelligence, particularly in reconnaissance and surveillance, with the Swedish Air Force set to receive new reconnaissance aircraft. The value of unmanned aerial systems in Ukraine has prompted Sweden to plan for their expanded use in operations to enhance situational awareness and mobility. For instance, this has led BAE Systems Hägglunds and UAV manufacturer Airolit to join forces in integrating autonomous drone surveillance capabilities into the CV90 combat vehicle. The Swedish government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) One of the most critical aspects of Sweden’s defense strategy is the significant expansion of conscription and personnel within the Swedish Armed Forces. By 2035, the wartime organization is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. To achieve this, the annual intake of conscripts will gradually increase, with targets of 10,000 conscripts by 2030 and 12,000 between 2032 and 2035. This expansion highlights the government's view that conscription is essential to maintaining the Swedish Armed Forces at a level sufficient for national defense and meeting NATO commitments under Article 3. The government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. Additionally, a fourth testing center will be established to manage the increased recruitment and testing of conscripts. In line with Sweden's integration into NATO, conscripts may participate in the alliance's collective defense efforts. In an Article 5 scenario, Swedish conscripts could be deployed internationally to support NATO operations. This represents a shift in Sweden’s defense approach, with conscripts expected to contribute to collective defense beyond national borders. The Swedish defense strategy further emphasizes improving the unit turnover system, ensuring operational units remain ready through refresher training exercises. The Total Defense Conscription and Testing Agency will play a key role in reaching the increased conscription targets and preparing the forces for both peacetime and wartime scenarios. Efforts to retain personnel and address current shortages are also part of the strategy. These include increasing the number of professional officers and group leaders, expanding officer training programs, and boosting civilian staffing to free military personnel for tasks requiring specific expertise. By addressing these challenges, Sweden aims to build a defense force capable of fulfilling both national and NATO obligations in the future. Priorities for the Swedish Army include modernizing the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle, acquiring additional combat vehicles and tanks such as the STRV 122 and STRV 123A, and upgrading artillery and air defense systems by 2030.

(Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The U.S. Army's Next Generation Howitzer (NGH) project is part of an ongoing effort to modernize its artillery systems, specifically focusing on a new, more mobile, and lethal 155mm howitzer. This initiative comes after the termination of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program in early 2024, which had faced technical difficulties. The NGH program aims to develop a system capable of greater range, mobility, and survivability, particularly suited for future near-peer conflicts expected around 2040 and beyond. One of the key features of this project is the emphasis on a truck-mounted platform, which would allow for better mobility and integration with fast-moving units like Stryker formations. The U.S. Army's fiscal year 2025 budget request has allocated $8 million for early-stage studies and hardware development, with evaluations scheduled to take place in the coming years. Industry players such as BAE Systems, Elbit America, and Rheinmetall are among those expected to participate in competitive evaluations to propose solutions. The goal is to develop a self-propelled howitzer system that can be produced domestically by 2030. This system would replace aging towed howitzers like the M777, which, while effective, lack the mobility needed for modern, rapidly evolving battlefields​. The SIGMA howitzer, developed by Israeli defense company Elbit Systems, is a state-of-the-art, fully automated, self-propelled artillery system. Designed around the 155mm NATO-standard caliber, the SIGMA system has been optimized for both range and precision, playing a critical role in modern military operations that require fast, mobile, and highly accurate artillery support. SIGMA's key strength lies in its automation and mobility. Unlike traditional towed artillery or less mobile tracked systems, SIGMA is mounted on a wheeled platform, allowing for quicker repositioning on the battlefield. This increased mobility is essential in environments where artillery units must quickly adapt to changing tactical situations and avoid enemy counter-fire. The system's automation minimizes the need for large crews and allows it to rapidly load, aim, and fire without significant human intervention. This not only reduces manpower requirements but also increases operational efficiency. The SIGMA system is equipped with advanced targeting and ballistic systems, enabling it to strike targets at ranges of up to 40 km, depending on the ammunition used. This range can be extended with specialized munitions like rocket-assisted projectiles. Furthermore, the system's network-centric design integrates seamlessly with broader military command-and-control infrastructures, allowing it to receive targeting data from sources like drones and ground-based radar, enabling precise and coordinated strikes. Elbit Systems began production of the SIGMA in the early 2020s, with the system aimed at replacing older artillery platforms in Israel and other nations' arsenals. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have reportedly been among the first to deploy SIGMA, with deliveries beginning around 2023, after an extensive development and testing phase. While the system is relatively new, it is designed for versatile use, from direct fire support to counter-battery operations and precision strikes against high-value targets.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-elbit-america-proposes-israeli-made-sigma-155mm-for-us-army-ngh-artillery-program	2024-10-21T07:39:21-07:00

North Korea Develops Drones Equipped with Reverse-Engineered American Hellfire Missiles	North Korea is intensifying its efforts in military drone development by equipping its unmanned systems with reverse-engineered copies of American Hellfire missiles. This information, shared by Brigadier General Patrick Costello during the 2024 United States Army Association conference, has raised significant concerns in the U.S., particularly regarding the growing threats in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft over the Nevada Test and Training Range and fires an Air-to-Ground Missile-114 Hellfire missile on August 30, 2023 (Picture source: US DoD) According to General Costello, North Korea's newly revealed drones not only resemble U.S. models like the MQ-9 Reaper and the RQ-4 Global Hawk, but they are also equipped with missiles modeled after the AGM-114 Hellfire, a guided air-to-surface missile used on U.S. drones. Costello noted that Pyongyang has focused on developing drones that weigh approximately 600 kilograms or less, fitting into the categories of small to medium-sized drones with multirole capabilities. These statements follow North Korea's display of two drones in July 2023, which garnered attention due to their striking resemblance to U.S. models. While the exact capabilities of these drones and their missiles remain unclear, the U.S. military now believes they were developed with some knowledge of American technologies. Videos released by North Korean state media showed one of the drones firing missiles closely resembling the Hellfire, further drawing comparisons in the West. This development comes as the U.S. military braces for the growing threat posed by drones, a phenomenon that has intensified in recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine. General Costello emphasized that the technological transfers and relationships observed in ongoing conflicts, particularly between North Korea and Russia, warrant close monitoring. Russia, which is engaged in the war in Ukraine, could benefit from North Korea’s new capabilities to bolster its military arsenal. General David Stewart, Director of the Joint Counter-UAS Office, also noted that drone threats have now become an integral part of modern military environments, regardless of the conflict zone. In response, the U.S. Department of Defense has requested a budget of $2.4 billion for unmanned aerial systems in the 2025 fiscal year. Various branches of the U.S. military are also seeking additional funding to develop counter-drone technologies, with an unfunded request for $741 million in this fiscal year alone.

Companies like Anduril, led by Palmer Luckey, have signed multibillion-dollar contracts with U.S. Special Operations Command to provide counter-drone technologies. Recently, the Pentagon awarded the company another $250 million contract for 500 reusable drones and associated jamming technologies. North Korea’s advances in military drones, combined with its progress in missile reverse-engineering, present significant challenges for the U.S. and its allies. Although these North Korean drones are less sophisticated than their American counterparts, they still pose a serious threat in conflict scenarios, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. As the U.S. continues to strengthen its drone defense capabilities, it is becoming evident that mastery of this technology by nations like North Korea could redefine the nature of modern conflicts. U.S. intelligence services recently confirmed the extent of North Korean reverse-engineering during the October 2024 U.S. Army Association conference. At the event, **Business Insider** revealed that North Korea had modeled its Saetbyol-4 and Saetbyol-9 drones after the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These North Korean drones were first observed during a July 2023 military parade, where one was filmed launching missiles similar to the Hellfire. While it remains unclear how Pyongyang acquired these technologies, U.S. officials suspect espionage or the recovery of parts from conflict zones. This situation is especially concerning as North Korea could potentially share these weapons with Russia, aiding Moscow’s war efforts in Ukraine. Recent reports also suggest that North Korean arms were used in the October 7, 2024, attacks by Hamas, further amplifying concerns that these American drone copies could fall into hostile hands. In addition to drone development, North Korea successfully tested a solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) on January 14, 2024, equipped with a hypersonic warhead. This advancement in ballistic missiles represents a major strategic threat to the U.S., as these missiles are capable of reaching targets such as Guam and are more difficult to intercept due to their rapid launch capability and hypersonic speed. These military advancements are occurring amidst increasing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has recently taken political steps, such as calling for a constitutional amendment to challenge the status of South Korea as a separate state. Although North Korea asserts it is not seeking war, it also indicates it will not avoid one if necessary. These developments suggest that Pyongyang’s growing military capabilities could further destabilize an already fragile regional situation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-develops-drones-equipped-with-reverse-engineered-american-hellfire-missiles	2024-10-21T06:52:23-07:00

According to Austin, the system is 'in place' and can be quickly made operational, though specific details on its current readiness were not provided. THAAD adds an important layer to Israel’s defense system, complementing existing systems like the Patriot by covering larger areas and intercepting threats at ranges of up to 200 kilometers. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile system is designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of up to 150 km and ranges between 150 and 200 km. It is a transportable ground-based system equipped with eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 radar for target detection, and a control and communication center to manage operations. THAAD uses hit-to-kill technology, where the missile's kinetic energy neutralizes incoming warheads either within or outside the atmosphere. Developed by Lockheed Martin, THAAD was first deployed in 2008. Several U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and more recently Germany and Japan, have acquired or integrated THAAD into their air defense systems. With its high mobility and ability to intercept at high altitudes, THAAD plays a critical role in protecting military forces, infrastructure, and civilian populations from ballistic missile threats. Israeli sources indicate that the system is already operational, with up to three batteries in use. These reports come amid rising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation, which could prompt an Israeli military response. While the scope of future Israeli strikes remains unclear, Austin emphasized the importance of de-escalating tensions while continuing to meet Israel’s defense needs. He also noted that the U.S. is diplomatically working to reduce tensions between Iran and Israel, though any military actions would ultimately be Israel’s decision.

This deployment involves approximately 100 U.S. personnel, putting American forces on the ground in Israel and deepening U.S. involvement in the region. The deployment of THAAD signals a significant shift as the U.S. moves from a supportive role to a more active defense posture, potentially placing American forces at greater risk should hostilities intensify. Developed in the 1990s and operational since 2008, this missile defense system includes truck-mounted launchers, radar systems, and fire control components. Each battery consists of six launchers, each equipped with eight interceptors. THAAD is specifically designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at high altitudes, providing a critical defense layer against Iranian missile threats. The deployment of THAAD to Israel demonstrates the continued U.S. commitment to Israel’s defense, particularly in light of the growing missile threats from Iran. The Pentagon has confirmed that the THAAD system will soon be fully operational and capable of defending Israeli airspace. Despite the complexity of the situation, the U.S. continues to prioritize diplomatic efforts aimed at reducing tensions while maintaining a robust defense posture in the region. This development also coincides with a warning from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Israeli officials, urging them to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The U.S. has made clear that continued military support will depend on significant efforts to address the humanitarian crisis, and Israel has since facilitated the entry of aid trucks into Gaza.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-says-thaad-anti-missile-system-is-now-in-place-in-israel	2024-10-21T01:49:05-07:00	
Chinese DF-31AG Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Launched from Hainan Island	On September 25, 2024, China's Ministry of National Defense announced that the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) had conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the South Pacific. This exercise, described as part of China's annual training plan, drew attention due to its unusual launch site: Hainan Island. The missile, a DF-31AG, traveled an estimated 11,700 km before landing in the Pacific, marking the first time since 1980 that China has targeted this area during an ICBM test. The last such event involved a DF-5 missile launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An image of the DF-31AG launch was released by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on September 25, 2024 (Picture source: PLA) The launch has sparked discussions regarding China’s nuclear posture and its advancing military modernization. Navigation warnings and trajectory calculations quickly identified that the missile had been fired from northeast Hainan Island, a location not typically used for ICBM launches and lacking a permanent ICBM brigade. This unusual choice suggests that China used a mobile launcher for the test, likely a DF-31AG, as confirmed by images released shortly after the event. The DF-31AG is a modernized version of the DF-31, China’s first solid-fuel ICBM, introduced in 2017 to replace earlier models. The DF-31AG is mounted on an eight-axle mobile transporter, which offers improved maneuverability and requires less logistical support than previous versions. The Dong Feng 31 (DF-31), also known as CSS-9 according to NATO classification, is a mobile, long-range ICBM developed by China. This three-stage missile, powered by solid fuel, was designed in the 1980s as a successor to the DF-4. First unveiled during China's National Day Parade in 1999, the DF-31 is housed in a large container mounted on an eight-wheeled trailer, providing significant operational flexibility. With an estimated range of 8,000 to 11,700 kilometers, it can strike targets across much of the continental United States, giving China a second-strike nuclear capability that is difficult to counter. The missile's accuracy is estimated at around 150 meters for mobile launches and 100 meters for silo-based launches. The DF-31 can carry a single 1-megaton nuclear warhead or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), capable of delivering three to four warheads with yields ranging from 20 to 150 kilotons. It uses an inertial navigation system coupled with stellar and GPS updates to improve precision. In terms of mobility, the missile is transported on HY4430 trailers towed by off-road trucks designed to operate in rugged conditions. The DF-31 remains a central component of China's nuclear deterrent, offering rapid strike capabilities and an extended range, making it difficult to neutralize. An image of the DF-31AG missile driving on Hainan Island shortly after the launch (Picture source: X Channel @Resonant_News) The DF-31AG used a cold-launch method, where the missile is ejected from its canister using compressed gas before its engine ignites. This method makes it more challenging to geolocate the exact launch site, as there are no burn marks left on the ground. This test is significant for China, which has not conducted an ICBM test in the Pacific for over four decades, typically opting for high-apogee tests within its own borders. The missile was likely transported from the Shaoyang brigade, about 800 km from Hainan, via rail and sea before being driven to the final launch site. Analysis of images and videos identified a probable launch area near Wenchang, on Hainan Island, which appears to be part of a newly developed military training zone, reinforcing the strategic importance of this location for future observations. The decision to launch an ICBM from Hainan could serve multiple purposes, such as allowing a full-range test without debris fallout or overflight of other countries. This test may also be part of a broader PLARF strategy to restore credibility following internal issues such as corruption scandals and leadership changes. Furthermore, by conducting this test as part of a military drill rather than a technological development program, China may be aiming to demonstrate combat readiness while reinforcing its status as a global nuclear power. The Pentagon confirmed it had received prior notice of the launch, which could set a precedent for future risk-reduction communications. It remains to be seen whether China will continue conducting such tests outside its borders and whether it will maintain this policy of pre-launch notifications to relevant states.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/chinese-df-31ag-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-launched-from-hainan-island	2024-10-21T00:51:27-07:00

North Korean Hwasong-9 Ballistic Missiles Reportedly Used By Russia To Target Ukraine	Credible reports have emerged indicating that North Korea’s Hwasong-9 medium-range ballistic missiles have been deployed against Ukrainian targets. According to an update shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six leader and renowned military analyst, these North Korean missiles have been used on Ukrainian territory since November of last year.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hwasong-9 is a medium-range ballistic missile developed by North Korea based on the Hwasong-6 (Scud-C) design. It is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile capable of striking targets up to 500-700 kilometers away . (Picture source: MDAA website) Pfarrer's report highlights the potential deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, with North Korea's provision of strategic missile support representing a notable escalation. North Korea's Hwasong-9 missiles are a critical component of its ballistic missile arsenal, developed indigenously from the earlier Hwasong-6, which is itself a variant of the Soviet-era Scud-C missile. The Hwasong-9 is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile (SSM) capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. It was designed to improve on the Hwasong-6, which North Korea has had in its inventory for several decades. The Hwasong-9 has an estimated range of around 500-700 kilometers, allowing it to strike targets within short to medium distances. The missile's mobility and versatility are key attributes, as it is mounted on a transport erector launcher (TEL), allowing for rapid repositioning and surprise launches. This development demonstrates North Korea’s long-standing strategy of adapting foreign technology, like the Scud-C, to suit its own military needs and ambitions. It also raises significant concerns about the ongoing transfer of military technologies between countries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. North Korea has played a significant role in supplying munitions for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, reportedly providing about half of the large-caliber ammunition used on the battlefield in 2024. Ukrainian sources indicate that over 2 million rounds of ammunition were supplied, alongside KN-23 ballistic missiles, which were utilized in dozens of strikes across Ukraine during the winter of 2023-2024. In May 2024, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed through debris analysis that Russia was indeed deploying North Korean missiles, following a summit between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin in September 2023. The deployment of the Hwasong-9 against Ukraine marks the first clear instance of North Korea’s military involvement in the conflict. The specific targets struck by these missiles remain unclear, but such an involvement suggests a growing alignment between Russia and North Korea, particularly in military terms. This alliance has been developing since the start of the war, with Russia reportedly seeking North Korean arms and ammunition to bolster its military supplies, strained by more than a year and a half of intense fighting in Ukraine. For Ukraine, the addition of a new type of ballistic missile to the conflict adds another layer of complexity to its defense strategy. Ukraine has largely relied on air defense systems provided by Western allies to intercept Russian missile strikes. However, the inclusion of North Korean systems, such as the Hwasong-9, will likely force Ukraine to adapt further, as it is unfamiliar with North Korean missile technology.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korean-hwasong-9-ballistic-missiles-reportedly-used-by-russia-to-target-ukraine	2024-10-20T11:34:40-07:00

Breaking News: North Korean Soldiers in Russia Receive Russian Gear for Future Deployment in Ukraine	Recent video reports have emerged suggesting that North Korea has deployed thousands of soldiers to Russia's Far East, potentially preparing them for involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Videos circulating on social media and messaging platforms purportedly show North Korean soldiers being equipped with Russian military gear and training alongside Russian forces. One such video, published on Telegram, has been geolocated to the garrison of the 127th Motor Rifle Division in Sergeevka, approximately 130 kilometers north of Vladivostok. The footage appears to depict North Korean troops engaging in training exercises, fueling speculation about their potential deployment to Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korean soldiers in Russia are seen receiving Russian individual military gear, reportedly in preparation for future deployment in Ukraine. (Picture source: Telegram Video) According to South Korean intelligence sources cited by Yonhap News Agency, an estimated 12,000 North Korean soldiers, including special forces units, are currently in Russia. These troops have reportedly formed four combat brigades and are undergoing intensive training in Eastern Russia. The training is said to encompass a range of combat skills suited for the conflict in Ukraine, including urban warfare tactics, reconnaissance operations, and the handling of Russian military equipment. The soldiers are reportedly acclimating to the operational environment they might face in Ukraine, including familiarization with the terrain and climate conditions. North Korea maintains one of the world's largest standing armies. The Korean People's Army (KPA) is estimated to have approximately 1.2 million active-duty personnel as of 2023. This sizable force is complemented by a reserve component that could bring the total number of military personnel to over 6 million, including paramilitary organizations and reserves. The KPA comprises ground forces, navy, air force, strategic rocket forces, and special operations forces. The ground forces alone account for most active-duty personnel, with around 950,000 soldiers. North Korea's military strategy emphasizes large numbers of infantry and artillery units, fortified defenses, and the capability to conduct asymmetric warfare. Military analysts note that North Korean troops are known for their rigorous training and discipline. Their potential involvement could bring a new dimension to the conflict, given their experience in asymmetric warfare and special operations. Including special forces units suggests an emphasis on operations requiring specialized skills, such as sabotage, infiltration, and close-quarters combat. Deploying 12,000 troops represents a fraction of North Korea's military manpower but could have strategic implications depending on their roles and integration with Russian forces. The international community has expressed concern over these developments. South Korean officials have highlighted the potential destabilizing effects on regional security. 'We are closely monitoring the situation,' a spokesperson for South Korea's Ministry of National Defense stated. 'The deployment of North Korean troops abroad, especially in a conflict zone, is a serious matter.' The United States and European nations have also reacted cautiously. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department commented, 'Any involvement of North Korean forces in the Ukraine conflict would be deeply concerning and would represent a significant escalation.' If the reports are accurate, the deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia could have significant implications. The addition of North Korean troops could bolster Russian capabilities in Ukraine, potentially impacting the balance of power on the ground. This move could also signify a deepening alliance between Russia, North Korea, and potentially other nations, complicating diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict. The international community may need to reassess security strategies in light of new alliances that are forming that challenge existing geopolitical norms. Despite the circulating reports, there has been no official confirmation from Russian or North Korean authorities regarding the presence or intended deployment of North Korean soldiers. Experts urge caution in interpreting these reports without verified information. 'While these reports are alarming, it's important to approach them with a critical eye,' said Dr. Emily Carter, a senior analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'We need concrete evidence before drawing conclusions about North Korea's involvement.' As the situation develops, the international community watches closely for further evidence and official statements. The potential involvement of North Korean forces in Ukraine adds a complex layer to the conflict, with far-reaching implications for international relations and global security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-north-korean-soldiers-in-russia-receive-russian-gear-for-future-deployment-in-ukraine	2024-10-19T04:41:52-07:00

Key activities include the replacement of batteries and various onboard systems critical to their functionality.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Netherlands Navy's Walrus class submarine. (Picture source: Dutch MoD) The Royal Netherlands Navy is undergoing a significant upgrade of its submarine fleet, centered around the Orka-class program. This new class of submarines will replace the aging Walrus-class, which has been in service since the 1990s. The contract for this project was awarded to the French Naval Group in 2024, following a competitive and extensive procurement process. The agreement includes the construction of four submarines that will enhance the Navy’s underwater capabilities. These submarines are part of the Barracuda family and will be diesel-electric variants specifically designed to meet the Netherlands' operational requirements. The new submarines, named Orka, Zwaardvis (Swordfish), Barracuda, and Tijgerhaai (Tiger Shark), will strengthen the Royal Netherlands Navy's strategic autonomy and submarine warfare capabilities. The first two submarines are expected to be delivered within the next decade. This program is not just about defense modernization; it also represents a significant collaboration between the French Naval Group and the Dutch maritime industry, highlighting the Dutch government’s efforts to maintain a strong defense industrial base. The Orka-class will be integral to NATO’s strategic deterrence efforts in the North Atlantic. The contract value is estimated at €5.4 billion, and the first two submarines should be operational by the early 2030s, ensuring that the Netherlands continues to maintain a capable and modern submarine fleet well into the future. Technical comparison The Walrus-class submarines have a displacement of around 2,800 tons, while the Barracuda-class, designed specifically for the Netherlands, has a significantly larger displacement of approximately 5,300 tons. This size difference allows the Barracuda class to carry more advanced systems, larger payloads, and have greater endurance. In terms of propulsion, both submarine classes are diesel-electric, but the Barracuda class benefits from more advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) technology. This allows the Barracuda submarines to remain submerged for longer periods, providing a strategic advantage in stealth and operational flexibility, whereas the Walrus-class has more limited underwater endurance due to its older propulsion technology. Stealth and sensor technology have also seen major improvements in the Barracuda class. The newer submarines are designed to be much quieter and harder to detect compared to the Walrus class. Additionally, the Barracuda class comes equipped with six torpedo tubes, allowing for a broader range of offensive capabilities, including anti-ship and land-attack options, a significant step up from the Walrus class's more limited armament.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-netherlands-navy-shares-photos-of-walrus-class-submarine-maintenance	2024-10-18T06:39:10-07:00	
Poland Receives New South Korean Homar-K Chunmoo Multiple Rocket Launchers for Artillery Units	On October 7, 2024, Poland received four Homar-K launchers as part of an order for 218 modules signed in 2022. This delivery is part of Poland's ongoing modernization of its artillery systems, developed in cooperation with international partners. The Polish Armed Forces are set to receive eight additional modules by the end of the year, reflecting the continued progress in integrating these systems into the country's artillery units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Polish Homar-K Chunmoo Multiple Rocket Launcher (Picture source: Hanwha Defense) The Homar-K is a Polish adaptation of the K239 Chunmoo multiple launch rocket system, originally designed by South Korea. This Polish version is distinguished by its integration on a Jelcz 8x8 chassis, replacing the original South Korean Doosan chassis, reflecting Poland's intent to localize the production of its military equipment. The Homar-K modules are integrated at the Huta Stalowa Wola (HSW) factory, with production becoming increasingly localized. In fact, under a second contract signed in April 2024, 72 new modules are to be delivered, 60 of which will be fully constructed in Poland. This local adaptation extends beyond just the chassis. The Homar-K launchers are capable of firing a wide range of rockets and ballistic missiles. Among these weapons are the guided CGR-080 rockets with a 239 mm caliber and a range of 80 km, and the short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) CTM-290, capable of hitting targets up to 290 km away. These rocket systems benefit from a GPS-assisted navigation system, ensuring an accuracy of around 15 meters for the CGR-080 and only 2 meters for the CTM-290. The versatility of the Homar-K is further enhanced by its ability to integrate unguided 122 mm rockets, commonly used with systems like the WR-40 Langusta or the BM-21 Grad. One of the major strengths of the Homar-K is its firepower. Each launcher can fire six 239 mm rockets in 30 seconds, providing formidable area saturation capabilities. Additionally, developments are underway to integrate new rockets with ranges of up to 200 km, or even more for 400 mm rockets, which are currently in development. The technical specifications of the Homar-K make it particularly effective on the battlefield. Weighing 31 tons, this system is 9 meters long, 2.9 meters wide, and 3.3 meters tall.

With a transmission system provided by Allison Transmission, the Homar-K is capable of maneuvering across difficult terrains, enhancing its operational flexibility. The crew, consisting of three personnel, is protected by armor compliant with STANAG 4569 Level 2 standards, using a combination of steel, ceramics, and polymer composites to resist ballistic threats and shrapnel. The modernization of Polish artillery through the acquisition of systems like the Homar-K is part of a broader strategy to replace aging equipment inherited from the Soviet era. In October 2022, the Polish Armaments Agency signed an agreement with Hanwha Aerospace for the purchase of 288 K239 Chunmoo launchers, with the first modules being integrated in Poland. This ambitious program continues with the signing of a new agreement in April 2024, which includes the delivery of 72 additional launchers by 2029, bringing the total number of launchers to 290 units. At the same time, cooperation between Poland and South Korea also extends to the production of munitions. In 2024, during the KADEX International Defense Exhibition, WB Group, a Polish company, and Hanwha Aerospace signed an agreement to establish a joint venture for the local production of CGR-080 rockets, intended for the Homar-K. This initiative highlights the importance for Poland to achieve strategic autonomy in its munitions production while strengthening its ties with its South Korean partners. The delivery on October 7 included four Homar-K launchers from an order of 218 modules signed in 2022. In total, the Korean side has produced and delivered 42 units (one of which, mounted on a Jelcz chassis, remained in Korea for testing), providing the 1st Artillery Regiment and the 18th Artillery Brigade with equipment already integrated at HSW. Eight additional modules are expected to be delivered this year. These deliveries position the Polish army as one of the most modern in Europe in terms of artillery capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-receives-new-south-korean-homar-k-chunmoo-multiple-rocket-launchers-for-artillery-units	2024-10-18T05:46:53-07:00	
Britain Joins European Cooperation for Long-Range Missile Development	The war in Ukraine continues to shift the military balance in Europe, prompting NATO to intensify its response. On October 17, 2024, Britain officially announced its participation in a program for developing long-range missiles alongside Germany, France, Poland, and other European partners. This initiative aims to address a gap in military stockpiles highlighted by the conflict in Ukraine, where the use of long-range missiles has become strategically important. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. (Picture source: MBDA) British Defense Secretary John Healey confirmed this commitment during a meeting with his NATO counterparts in Brussels. He explained that the UK is formally joining the long-range missile development program, which is intended to improve the integration of European air defense systems, enhancing their collective effectiveness. According to Healey, these missiles will provide capabilities far beyond those currently available to participating nations, in line with NATO's broader goal of strengthening deterrence and protecting Europe. At the NATO summit in Washington in July, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland had already signed a letter of intent to collaborate on developing missiles with a range of more than 500 kilometers. Military sources at the time indicated that the goal was to create a new land-based cruise missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers to meet NATO's deterrence requirements. Britain's participation underscores the importance of the program as Europe seeks to protect itself against external threats, particularly from Russia. As part of this cooperation, the United States and Germany also announced that starting in 2026, they will temporarily deploy U.S. long-range missiles on German soil, including SM-6, Tomahawk missiles, and developmental hypersonic weapons. This deployment, criticized by Moscow as a 'very serious threat' to Russian national security, is seen as a temporary measure until Europe develops its own long-range missiles. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. Moscow has increased cross-border strikes, while Kyiv has responded by targeting sites within Russian territory. Existing European stocks of cruise missiles, such as Britain's Storm Shadow, France's Scalp, and Germany's Taurus, which have a range of around 500 kilometers, have become critical in addressing these escalating threats. Alongside the missile development program, Healey also confirmed that Britain is ready to quickly deploy troops to Estonia, if necessary, to bolster NATO's eastern flank against the Russian threat. The UK has already prepared thousands of troops for rapid deployment to strengthen security along the Russian border. This additional military commitment reflects Britain's intention to play a key role in European defense at a time when tensions with Moscow remain high.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/britain-joins-european-cooperation-for-long-range-missile-development	2024-10-18T05:38:02-07:00

UK imposes largest sanctions yet on Russian oil tankers targeting shadow Fleet	According to information published by the UK government on October 17, 2024, the United Kingdom has announced its most extensive sanctions package yet, targeting Russian oil and gas tankers linked to President Vladimir Putin's so-called 'shadow fleet.' The move aims to cripple a network of vessels that has circumvented previous sanctions, fueling Russia's economy and military operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian crude oil tanker NS Bora. (Picture source: Fleetphoto) Eighteen oil tankers and four liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers have been added to the sanctions list, making it the largest single action to date against Russia’s maritime fleet. These vessels will be barred from accessing British ports and services, bringing the total number of sanctioned Russian ships to 43. This network of tankers is crucial for maintaining Russian oil exports, a significant source of revenue funding its ongoing war in Ukraine. The United States and Canada have joined the UK’s 'Call to Action' initiative, first announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in July, which now has 47 signatories. These countries are working together to address the shadow fleet's violation of international safety standards and the potential environmental hazards it poses, such as the risk of oil spills. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the importance of cutting off Russia’s financial lifelines, noting that the shadow fleet poses a threat not only to maritime safety but to the global economy. As a result of the sanctions, Russia’s state-controlled shipping giant, Sovcomflot, has been scrambling to evade penalties by renaming and reassigning its vessels. Despite these efforts, many ships have been forced to idle in international waters, unable to unload their cargo or generate revenue. This development has added strain to Russia's energy sector, where flagship companies like Gazprom have already reported significant losses, including a $6.9 billion net deficit in 2023—their first in over two decades. The sanctions also extend beyond the shadow fleet, targeting key players in Russia's gas industry, such as Rusgazdobycha JSC. Background The UK's latest sanctions on Russia’s 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers represent a critical escalation in the effort to cripple the financial resources fueling President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. These measures are part of a broader campaign, which has already blocked Russia from accessing over $400 billion in assets and revenues since the start of the war. The shadow fleet, a collection of vessels designed to evade sanctions and continue the illicit trade of Russian oil, has become a primary target, with the UK's actions disrupting operations of vessels that have collectively transported billions in oil since February 2022​. This crackdown aligns with wider international efforts, with the US, Canada, and several European countries backing the UK's initiative to halt Russia’s oil trade. Notably, the shadow fleet comprises ships operating under complex management systems often based in non-Western jurisdictions, making enforcement challenging.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uk-imposes-largest-sanctions-yet-on-russian-oil-tankers-targeting-shadow-fleet	2024-10-18T03:39:36-07:00

Next-Generation Missile Vessels These vessels are designed as missile corvettes, emphasizing speed, stealth, and firepower, making them essential for coastal defense and maritime strike operations. Their development comes at a time when regional naval competition, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, is intensifying, necessitating robust platforms capable of both offensive and defensive roles. At the core of the NGMVs' capabilities is their propulsion system, utilizing a Combined Diesel and Gas (CODAG) arrangement. This setup integrates the General Electric LM2500 gas turbine with two Pielstick 12PA6 STC6 diesel engines, providing both high-speed operation and efficient cruising capabilities. The LM2500 is widely used in naval platforms globally, known for its reliability and power output, allowing the NGMVs to reach speeds of 35 knots. This high speed is essential for rapid response operations and ensuring the vessel's ability to evade threats or quickly position itself for missile strikes. The vessels have a range of 2,800 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 25 knots, making them suitable for extended patrols and operations in the Indian Ocean. The stealth characteristics of the NGMVs are a critical aspect of their design. These vessels feature reduced radar cross-sections, which makes them harder to detect by enemy surveillance systems. Coupled with advanced infrared suppression systems, they are equipped to minimize their visibility in multiple detection spectra, giving them a tactical advantage in high-threat environments. In terms of armament, the NGMVs are outfitted with a diverse array of offensive and defensive systems. The primary weapon system consists of 8 BrahMos or NASM-MR anti-ship missiles. The BrahMos, a supersonic cruise missile developed jointly by India and Russia, is one of the fastest missiles of its kind, capable of delivering devastating strikes against enemy surface ships or coastal installations. With a range exceeding 300 kilometers and traveling at speeds of Mach 3, the BrahMos provides a formidable offensive capability, ensuring the NGMVs can engage enemy vessels from significant distances while remaining outside the range of many defensive systems. For anti-aircraft defense, the NGMVs are equipped with 32 Vertical Launch Short-Range Surface-to-Air Missiles (VL-SRSAM), a system designed to intercept incoming missiles and aircraft. This system is complemented by a variety of close-in defense measures, including two AK-630M Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS), which provide a last line of defense against incoming missiles or small fast-attack craft. These fast-firing rotary cannons are capable of neutralizing threats at close range, protecting the vessel in high-intensity combat scenarios. Additional defensive firepower is provided by two OFT 12.7 mm M2 stabilized remote-controlled guns, enhancing the ship's ability to engage smaller surface threats such as fast patrol boats. In terms of sensor and fire control systems, the NGMVs are outfitted with multiple radars designed for surface and air surveillance. The Lynx-U2 fire control radar is integrated with the missile and gun systems to provide precise targeting information, ensuring accurate engagement of enemy threats. This is further supported by an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system, which allows the ship to passively detect and track targets based on their infrared signatures, offering an additional layer of surveillance that is not dependent on radar emissions. Electronic warfare and decoy systems also play a vital role in the NGMVs' defense strategy. The Kavach decoy system is employed to confuse and divert incoming anti-ship missiles by creating a cloud of radar-reflective chaff.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indian-navy-selects-ge-aerospace-lm2500-engines-for-next-generation-missile-vessels	2024-10-18T02:46:05-07:00

France and United Arab Emirates in Talks for Joint Financing of Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development	According to the French newspaper La Tribune on October 16, 2024, France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are engaged in discussions on joint financing for the development of the future Rafale F5 fighter jet standard. This potential partnership, initiated within the informal framework of the 'Rafale Club,' would allow the UAE to participate in the evolution of the French fighter, thus strengthening the strategic bond between the two nations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development Program (Picture source: French MoD) The military relationship between France and the UAE has deepened over the decades, based on strategic cooperation and mutual trust that extend far beyond arms contracts. This alliance is notably illustrated by the permanent presence of French forces in the UAE since 2009, symbolizing a partnership that spans training, intelligence, and joint operations. The UAE has become a major partner for France in the Gulf region, supported by large-scale military contracts, such as the 2021 agreement for the purchase of 80 Rafale F4 aircraft, valued at more than €16 billion—the largest arms export contract in French history. Abu Dhabi would benefit from direct involvement in future innovations of the aircraft, also providing financial relief for the French Ministry of Armed Forces in a context of budgetary constraints. France’s Ministry of Armed Forces recently announced the start of Rafale F5 development without disclosing the details of these advanced discussions with the UAE. This co-financing would cover only non-sovereign elements of the Rafale, leaving France with exclusive control over critical components. In return for this cooperation, the UAE is considering an additional order of 20 Rafales, complementing the 80 aircraft acquired in 2021 under a historic contract, including Mica NG and Black Shaheen missiles. Led by the General Directorate of Armament (DGA), the Rafale program aims to launch the F5 standard in the next decade. This new version introduces significant advancements in connectivity and data processing to enhance the operational capabilities of client air forces. This upgrade will include a new radar, a state-of-the-art electronic warfare system, advanced optronic sensors, and the integration of the ASN4G missile for French forces. Additionally, the Rafale F5 will be supported by a stealth combat drone inspired by the Neuron demonstrator, designed to assist the aircraft in penetrating enemy defenses. This companion drone, a key feature of the F5 standard, will be engineered for maximum stealth and advanced connectivity, allowing operations over extended ranges thanks to aerial refueling. Its mission, enhanced by native integration of artificial intelligence, will enable direct collaboration with the Rafale in adaptive combat strategies, providing a foundational component of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This potential partnership with the UAE arises as France seeks to optimize its defense budget for the 2024–2030 period, with a €413 billion military programming budget. In 2023, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu discussed the possibility of Rafale Club members contributing to development costs while ensuring sovereignty over critical components. This shared financing would also strengthen France’s relations with Rafale clients, while maintaining national control over sensitive elements. Expected by 2030, the Rafale F5 fighter jet will succeed the F4 standard, addressing modern threats for both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence missions within the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS). It represents a new generation of connected fighters, integrating interoperable systems with other ground and aerial platforms. For the UAE, this project represents not only a military upgrade but also an extension of their cooperation with France in defense, consolidating their position as one of France's privileged allies. The UAE Armed Forces are among the best-trained and most capable among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. While Iran remains a major strategic concern, partly due to an ongoing dispute over islands in the Strait of Hormuz, the UAE has shown an increasing capacity to project influence and engage militarily beyond its borders. Their involvement in conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as their crucial role in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, has reinforced their experience and strategic approach to managing military risks. This orientation towards international engagement is supported by foreign bases, including a French base and a South Korean contingent, as well as diversified defense relations, particularly with Israel, Turkey, and China, while maintaining a primary partnership with the United States. According to Military Balance 2024, the UAE’s air fleet reflects these ambitions, with an advanced inventory of 148 combat aircraft sourced from American and European suppliers. The fleet includes 54 F-16E Block 60 fighter jets and 24 F-16F Block 60 models, known as the Desert Falcon, along with 50 French-made Mirage 2000-9 fighter aircraft in various configurations, including DAD, EAD, and RAD models for reconnaissance missions. The UAE will gradually replace its Mirage 2000-9 fleet with Rafale F4s, with initial deliveries expected by 2027.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/france-and-united-arab-emirates-in-talks-for-joint-financing-of-next-gen-rafale-f5-fighter-jet-development	2024-10-17T06:30:31-07:00

The H225M’s survivability is enhanced by a radar warning receiver, missile approach warning system, laser warning receiver, and chaff/flare dispensers. (Picture source: Army Recognition) According to the Ministry of Defence, the decision to reduce the order was necessary to remain within the allocated budget, which ranges between 1 and 2.5 billion euros. Customization and adaptation costs for the Caracal to meet the unique demands of special operations have been higher than anticipated. This adjustment, communicated to Dutch parliament members, shows the need for various contracts to equip the helicopter with advanced mission systems. Although Airbus Helicopters remains the program’s primary contractor, the Dutch Defence Ministry also plans complementary contracts to equip nine of the helicopters with specific capabilities. Among the selected suppliers, Israel’s Elbit Systems will provide a proven self-protection suite already installed on the Gulfstream G650ER and future C390M transport aircraft for Dutch Defence. This suite will enhance the Caracal’s survivability against modern threats. Additionally, radio equipment from the American group L3 Harris will be integrated through the Foxtrot program, ensuring secure communications and improved interoperability with allied forces. Airbus Helicopters, in partnership with the Netherlands and Germany, is also developing a new mission computer to centralize all data flows in a single display, facilitating real-time decision-making. The acquisition of these helicopters includes infrastructure and training programs. Next-generation simulators will be implemented through a separate program starting next year, aiming to increase training hours from 700 for the current Cougar fleet to between 2,000 and 3,000 for the Caracal, preserving the aircraft while enhancing pilot and operator readiness for critical missions. This adjustment will impact the operational capacity of the 300 Special Operations Squadron. While the initial plan anticipated the ability to conduct two simultaneous missions over six months, the current configuration limits capacity to one long-term mission, with a second short-term mission possible if needed. This change reflects Defence’s intent to maximize capabilities within budget constraints, taking into account rising integration costs and logistical challenges. Anticipated delivery delays also stem from technical challenges associated with integrating numerous mission systems and high demand on Caracal’s production lines internationally. The Dutch Ministry of Defence acknowledges that further delays cannot be ruled out, though contractual safeguards aim to minimize this risk. In the worst case, an extension of the Cougar helicopters’ operational life may be considered to offset scheduling delays. With the acquisition’s preparatory phase now complete, a final agreement with Airbus Helicopters is expected next month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/netherlands-confirms-a-reduced-order-of-h225m-caracal-helicopters-for-special-forces	2024-10-17T06:13:43-07:00

According to Alpha Defense, this potential agreement is at an advanced stage, with sources indicating that India is actively negotiating to finalize it in the near future.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link India Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Pralay missile, developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), is an advanced short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile, primarily designed for tactical use in combat conditions. Launched in 2015, the Pralay program represents a strategic advancement for India’s missile arsenal, incorporating sophisticated quasi-ballistic trajectory adjustments that allow the missile to evade interceptors and anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses. The missile has already successfully completed several tests, with the first two conducted in December 2021 and a third in November 2023, each demonstrating the missile’s accuracy, payload capacity, and terminal maneuverability. The Pralay's unique quasi-ballistic trajectory enables it to shift from a traditional ballistic path to a flatter trajectory after launch, making interception more difficult by reducing its radar profile. This feature, combined with high speed and terminal maneuverability, brings the Pralay closer to the Russian Iskander-M missile, which has proven effective in recent conflicts, notably in Ukraine. The Pralay shares characteristics with the Iskander-M, such as a CEP (Circular Error Probable) of around 10 meters, highlighting its high accuracy and ability to evade air defenses. India and Russia have long-standing collaboration in missile technology, a partnership that has significantly shaped India's missile capabilities. One of the most notable outcomes of this cooperation is the BrahMos missile, developed jointly by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyenia. Launched as the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, the BrahMos demonstrates both high speed and precision, making it a valuable asset in India’s arsenal. This collaboration has allowed India to integrate Russian expertise in propulsion and guidance systems with its own indigenous technological advancements, setting a foundation for India's development of future missile systems. Russia’s involvement in India’s missile program has also extended through technology transfers and support in ballistic missile defense research, further strengthening India's defense capabilities and boosting its strategic autonomy in missile production. To comply with international arms control regulations, India has committed to limiting export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 kilometers and a payload capacity not exceeding 500 kilograms. This adherence to missile technology control guidelines requires technical modifications to the Pralay system, an adaptation that India is actively pursuing. Powered by a solid-fuel motor and integrating maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MaRV) technology, the missile can carry payloads ranging from high-explosive fragmentation warheads to runway denial submunitions. These capabilities enable it to effectively target and neutralize critical military infrastructure such as radar installations, command centers, and forward airstrips, with enhanced precision and lethality. Armenia’s interest in acquiring the Pralay missile stems from its need to counterbalance the capabilities acquired by Azerbaijan through its purchase of LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missiles developed by Israel Aerospace Industries. With a range of 400 kilometers and a CEP of 10 meters, the LORA missile represents a significant threat to Armenia’s strategic assets. The Pralay’s compatibility with various warhead types and its advanced guidance system, using both inertial navigation and a DSMAC (Digital Scene-Matching Area Correlation) seeker for increased accuracy, provide Armenia with an adequate response to Azerbaijan’s missile capabilities. A distinctive feature of the Pralay is its fused silica radar dome (RADOME), which enhances its evasion capabilities and survivability in hostile airspace. The jet vane thrust vector control system allows the Pralay to perform evasive maneuvers in the terminal phase, effectively countering enemy defense systems. Additionally, the Pralay includes two sets of small fins that help reduce its radar signature, further complicating interception efforts. The Indian Pralay missile and the Israeli LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missile are two quasi-ballistic systems with short to medium range, but their performances and capabilities differ in several aspects. The Pralay has a theoretical range between 150 and 500 km, with a payload capacity ranging from 350 kg to 700 kg, allowing it to target strategic installations such as radars, command centers, and airstrips. However, to comply with international arms control regulations, India has limited export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 km and a payload not exceeding 500 kg. This technical adaptation, necessary to adhere to missile technology control guidelines, ensures that exported versions meet international standards. The LORA, on the other hand, has a maximum range of 400 km and a payload capacity of approximately 570 kg. This missile was operationally used by Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, demonstrating high accuracy with a CEP of 10 meters, particularly on targets such as bridges and critical infrastructure. Its guidance system, using GPS and TV imaging in the terminal phase, ensures high precision, although it remains potentially vulnerable to electronic countermeasures. Thus, the Pralay prioritizes better terminal maneuverability to evade interceptions, while the LORA stands out for its extreme precision in targeted strikes, with each featuring specific adaptations according to their usage contexts and regulatory requirements. The Indian armed forces have shown strategic interest in the Pralay missile, with substantial orders from both the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. In 2022, the Indian Ministry of Defense approved the purchase of 120 missiles for the Air Force, followed in 2023 by the acquisition of a regiment of 250 missiles for the Army, intended to strengthen tactical capabilities along sensitive borders with China and Pakistan. If the agreement with Armenia is finalized, this country would become the first international buyer of the Pralay missile, marking a historic milestone in Indian defense exports. Defense relations between India and Armenia have considerably strengthened in recent years, illustrated by the transfer of sophisticated weaponry to meet Armenia's growing security needs in a tense regional context. In 2020, India sold Armenia four Swathi radars, capable of detecting and locating enemy artillery fire, as well as M982 Excalibur precision artillery shells, enhancing Armenia’s defensive and retaliatory capabilities. Armenia is also interested in ATAGS (Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System) howitzers developed by DRDO, which offer extended range and increased accuracy, with the capability to fire projectiles up to 48 km. The addition of ATAGS would strengthen Armenia's offensive capabilities, complementing its current arsenal. Additionally, the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, also developed by DRDO, has attracted significant interest from Armenia. Capable of launching a salvo of twelve rockets in less than 45 seconds and reaching a range of 40 to 75 km depending on the variant, the Pinaka would provide mobile and versatile firepower, ideal for saturation strikes and ground support missions. Integrating the Pinaka would further strengthen Armenia's tactical options, while consolidating India as a key partner in defense.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/armenia-could-be-first-country-to-acquire-indias-home-made-pralay-quasi-ballistic-missile	2024-10-17T04:52:13-07:00

UK maintains Challenger 3 Tank schedule toward 2030 full capability	As reported by the UK Defence Journal on October 11, 2024, the British Ministry of Defence has confirmed the continued progress of the Challenger 3 main battle tank program, in response to questions from Danny Kruger, MP for East Wiltshire, regarding the review's potential impacts on the program and recent discussions with the Army Board. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Luke Pollard clarified that the Challenger 3 is set to achieve Initial Operating Capability by 2027, with Full Operating Capability expected by 2030.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Pollard noted that the Strategic Defence Review aims to align future capability development with the UK’s security needs. As part of this process, the Ministry will provide regular updates to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Secretary of State for Defence, with a comprehensive final report anticipated by mid-2025. This review is intended to ensure that the UK’s defense infrastructure supports both current and future requirements. The Challenger 3, developed by the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL), represents an upgrade of the existing Challenger 2 tanks rather than the deployment of entirely new vehicles. The program evolved from the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme (LEP), designed to improve mobility, lethality, and survivability for continued use through the 2030s. The primary modification in the Challenger 3 is the integration of a new turret with a 120mm L55A1 smoothbore gun, replacing the previous L30A1 rifled gun. This modification aligns with NATO standards, improving interoperability, although it requires a new kinetic energy round to be developed in collaboration with Germany, as the smoothbore system is incompatible with current Challenger 2 ammunition. Initial deliveries of pre-production Challenger 3 tanks began in early 2024, with live-firing trials starting in Germany in April. The British Army is scheduled to receive a total of 148 tanks, with the first units entering service in 2025. The project’s estimated cost is approximately $1.17 billion, and it is expected to support around 300 jobs at RBSL’s Telford facility, with an additional 450 positions across the UK defense supply chain.

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system. The tank also features upgraded targeting systems for the commander and gunner, including advanced thermal imaging. While the adoption of the smoothbore gun introduces an ammunition compatibility issue, the Ministry of Defence has partnered with German defense companies to develop a new Enhanced Kinetic Energy (EKE) round, suitable for both the Challenger 3 and the Leopard 2 tanks. The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. The Challenger 3 continues this progression with modular armor upgrades and enhanced survivability features, including Active Protection Systems (APS). Previous trials on the Challenger 2 tested APS such as the Rheinmetall ROSY Rapid Obscurant System and the MUSS system, providing a basis for their integration into the Challenger 3. Additionally, the Challenger 3 is powered by a Perkins CV12-9A 26.1-liter V12 diesel engine, delivering 1,500 bhp, and utilizes a David Brown Santasalo TN54E transmission system with updated components. The development of the Challenger 3 reflects the UK's approach to modernizing its existing tank fleet rather than procuring new models from other countries. In a 2021 report, the Defence Select Committee noted challenges in the LEP, including budget overruns and delays. Later that year, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would upgrade 148 Challenger 2 tanks into Challenger 3 models through a contract with RBSL valued at £800 million. This contract solidified the selection of Rheinmetall’s upgrade proposal, which includes the 120mm smoothbore gun. Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system.

US Global Strike Command's B-2 Bombers return to combat for first time since 2017 against Houthis in Yemen	On October 16, 2024, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) carried out a series of precision airstrikes on underground weapons storage facilities in areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-backed Houthi forces, marking the first combat use of the B-2 stealth bombers since 2017. These facilities housed conventional weapons used by the Houthis in attacks on U.S. and international vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. (Picture source: US DoD) According to the US Central Command, the strikes aimed to limit the Houthis' ability to target maritime traffic in this strategically significant region, which affects both commercial shipping and regional stability. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that the operation, which included various U.S. Air Force and Navy assets, focused on five fortified underground storage locations within Yemen, housing missiles, weapons components, and munitions. According to OSINTdefender, the mission involved B-2 bombers from the 13th Bomb Squadron of the 509th Bomb Wing, part of the US Air Force's Global Strike Command, and the 131st Bomb Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard, flying from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. These bombers were equipped with 2,000-pound Mark-84 bombs modified with Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits for precision targeting of these deeply buried sites. Each B-2 is designed to carry up to 20 tons of bombs, providing significant strike capability at long ranges. The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes near Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and in the stronghold of Saada, though they provided no immediate details on damage or casualties. CENTCOM stated that initial assessments suggested no civilian casualties. The Houthis have used underground facilities in these areas, including tunnels originally constructed to store Scud missiles. These tunnels were reportedly expanded to accommodate the group's weapons storage, further complicating efforts to disrupt their capabilities. The B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. strikes were also seen as a signal to Iran, a supporter of the Houthi movement. In recent years, Iran has conducted missile attacks against Israel, and the B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. The Houthis have continued to attack merchant vessels in the Red Sea since October 2023, and CENTCOM’s strikes align with efforts to secure these waters against further disruptions to commercial shipping. The Houthis claim their attacks target vessels linked to Israel, the U.S., and the U.K., citing these countries' involvement in the Gaza conflict, although some targeted vessels have not been directly connected to the conflict. Additionally, Houthi attacks have seized one vessel, sunk two others, and led to the deaths of four sailors, prompting ongoing concerns about the group’s impact on maritime security. The Northrop B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy strategic bomber developed under the Advanced Technology Bomber program in the late 1970s. Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. Originally intended to replace the Mach 2-capable B-1A, the B-2 program faced significant delays and rising costs, leading to extensive debate in Congress. The B-2 can carry up to 18,000 kg of ordnance, including conventional and nuclear payloads, and has a maximum unrefueled range of 11,000 km, with a service ceiling of 15,000 m. (Picture source: US DoD) Ultimately, the planned production was reduced from 132 units to 21, reflecting changing strategic priorities after the Cold War. Entering service in 1997, the B-2 made its combat debut during the Kosovo War in 1999 and has since been deployed in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The B-2’s flying wing design, which lacks both a fuselage and tail, contributes to a reduced radar cross-section and increased aerodynamic efficiency, enabling extended range operations. The aircraft’s structure includes radar-absorbing materials and advanced flight controls for stability, allowing a two-person crew to operate the bomber. Maneuverability is achieved through a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust, supporting the aircraft’s low radar profile. The B-2 is equipped with the AN/APQ-181 radar, which provides multi-mode functionality to support navigation and target acquisition. During the RIMPAC 2024 exercise, the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit bomber also employed the QUICKSINK maritime strike capability, designed to sink surface vessels with modified JDAM precision-guided bombs, marking the first publicly reported test of this system. Conducted during the second SINKEX exercise, the test demonstrated the B-2’s capability in maritime strike roles. Developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, QUICKSINK converts JDAMs into precision-guided bombs equipped with GPS-assisted INS guidance, a radar seeker, and an Imaging Infrared camera, allowing them to target moving maritime threats. Ongoing modernization programs for the B-2, supported by a recent $7 billion contract with Northrop Grumman, focus on enhancing defensive and communication systems to address emerging threats, including cyber risks.

Textron Creates Next-Gen XM204 Top Attack Mine System for Tactical Obstacles Against Tanks	At the AUSA 2024 exhibition, held from October 9 to 11 in Washington, D.C., the American company Textron is presenting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) System, a new type of system developed under the U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program to block enemy armored vehicles by deploying mines. Equipped with autonomous sensors, the XM204 TA can launch mines to create complex tactical obstacles, combining top and bottom attacks. Its mobility could be further enhanced through drone transport, as demonstrated at the event.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Textron XM204 Top Attack Mine System could be further enhanced through drone transport (Picture source: Army Recognition) Textron’s XM204 Top Attack (TA) system marks a significant advancement in terrain-shaping obstacle technology, designed to meet the U.S. Army’s temporary requirements for top-attack anti-vehicle capabilities, specifically to support U.S. Army Europe Command (USAREUR). Used as a standalone solution or in conjunction with other systems, it enables the creation of complex obstacles by combining top and bottom attacks, especially when deployed alongside the XM343 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) system. The operational concept of the XM204 TA involves several steps: once manually armed, the system activates its ground sensors and submunitions to autonomously detect, track, and engage multiple vehicle targets. Its detection and tracking process relies on seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors, paired with an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead for top attack, maximizing its effectiveness against weaker vehicle armor. The operational stages include target detection, submunition deployment, engagement area scanning, target confirmation, EFP charge activation, and, ultimately, target destruction. The U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program aims to develop and deploy defense systems that create tactical obstacles to slow down, divert, or immobilize enemy armored vehicles on the battlefield. These obstacles, which include technologies such as the XM204 Top Attack (TA) system, are designed to be autonomous and used in diverse operational scenarios to enhance the combat brigades' counter-mobility capabilities. The TSO allows forces to create temporary yet effective barriers that exploit specific terrain areas to block the advance of enemy armored formations, particularly in open and sparsely vegetated environments. The XM204 Top Attack (TA) is an autonomous anti-vehicle system designed to attack armored vehicles from above, targeting their vulnerability in the upper armor. After being manually activated by a soldier, the XM204 uses a combination of seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors to detect, track, and identify enemy vehicles within a 100-meter radius. When a target is confirmed, the system deploys submunitions equipped with explosively formed penetrator (EFP) charges to engage and neutralize the vehicle. The EFP detonates either above or near the target, maximizing the damage to render the vehicle inoperable. Designed to function autonomously after activation, the XM204 is resistant to active protection systems, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and deactivation attempts. It is also equipped with programmable self-destruct timers (4 hours, 48 hours, or 15 days), ensuring the area’s safety after engagement. This system thus allows the creation of effective obstacles against armored vehicles in strategic zones without requiring continuous monitoring. The XM204 TA features a 'Zone of Authority' (ZOA) with a 100-meter diameter, providing extensive engagement area coverage. It is designed to resist active protection systems, smoke, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and mechanical deactivation attempts, making it a robust counter-mobility tool suitable for varied terrains and conditions. The system is also recoverable, reusable, and equipped with visual safety indicators to alert on its arming status. The XM204 can be deployed quickly by hand and is resistant to unauthorized handling. It also offers three manually programmable self-destruct durations—four hours, forty-eight hours, or fifteen days—to meet specific mission requirements in the field. This system will be fielded for the first time in the U.S. Army during the 2025 fiscal year, thus meeting the Army’s modernization priorities, including long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, and soldier lethality. Mounting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) on a drone would provide significant strategic advantages by increasing its range, mobility, and flexibility on the battlefield. While the system is currently limited to manual and ground-based deployments, integration on a drone would enable the XM204 to be transported over long distances, precisely positioned in hard-to-reach or hazardous areas, and used to create anti-vehicle obstacles in regions where ground forces cannot safely intervene. Additionally, the drone could relocate or reposition the XM204 based on enemy movements, optimizing its autonomous multi-target engagement capability through its advanced seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors. This combination with a drone would transform the XM204 into a dynamic, responsive defense system capable of creating mobile obstacles and adapting to the evolving needs of a modern combat environment. Several stakeholders are involved in the development of this system, including the Project Manager Close Combat Systems (PM CCS) within the Joint Program Executive Office for Armaments and Ammunition, in collaboration with Textron Defense Systems and centers of excellence such as the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence. The Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center also provides critical functions within the program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/textron-creates-next-gen-xm204-top-attack-mine-system-for-tactical-obstacles-against-tanks	2024-10-16T03:28:09-07:00

What’s new in Canada’s upgraded Leopard 2A6MC2 Main Battle Tank?	As noted by Jeff2146 on October 15, 2024, the German television network ARD 1 recently aired footage believed to show the first public appearance of Canada’s Leopard 2A6M C2 tanks during a tour of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) facilities. The Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN is an upgraded Canadian variant of the German Leopard 2A6 main battle tank, created by converting 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks under a $76 million contract with KMW. This overhaul includes upgrades to optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces, replacing outdated analog technology with modern components to improve their operational lifespan.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN overhaul includes upgrades to optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces, replacing outdated analog technology with modern components to improve the operational lifespan of the Leopard 2A6M CAN. (Picture source: ARD 1) In February 2023, Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand stated that Canada plans to replace the Leopard 2 tanks sent to Ukraine, though specific timelines for these acquisitions have not been disclosed. Meanwhile, Canada is preparing to upgrade its remaining Leopard 2 tanks through a Leopard Long Term Support Contract (LTSC), which aims to keep the fleet operational until 2035. Department of National Defence spokesperson Jessica Lamirande explained that the LTSC will include maintenance, upgrades, supply chain management, and technical support. At that time, the contract was estimated between $730 million and $1.09 billion, or approximately $44 million to $64 million per year. Canada released an Advanced Contract Award Notice in August 2022, awarding KMW a sole-source position for the LTSC, with a formal contract published on September 13, 2024, valued at $710,732,013.98. The LTSC encompasses various Leopard 2 models within Canada’s military, including main battle tanks like the 2A4 CAN, 2A4M CAN, 2A6M CAN, and 2A6M C2 CAN, as well as Leopard 2 ARV CAN armored recovery vehicles, Leopard 2 AEV CAN engineering vehicles, and specialized equipment such as the Mine Clearing Roller System (MCRS), Track Width Mine Plow (TWMP), dozer blades, add-on armor, and slat armor. Canada is preparing to upgrade its remaining Leopard 2 tanks through a Leopard Long Term Support Contract (LTSC), which aims to keep the fleet operational until 2035. (Picture source: ARD 1) Maintenance responsibilities will involve systems integration, engineering, configuration and obsolescence management, depot-level inspections, and spare parts supply. The contract also specifies the provision of technical and field service representatives, who will provide in-depth support and guidance for the maintenance processes. Additionally, Canada awarded KMW a separate contract worth $76 million in June 2022 to repair, overhaul, and convert 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks to align with the 2A4M configuration. The modifications include updating optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces with more modern components, as the existing analog technology is considered obsolete. According to available information, the first conversion was completed and accepted by Canada in 2022, establishing a reference model for the rest of the fleet. Conversion work on the remaining 19 tanks began at FFG Canada’s Bathurst facility in spring 2023, with completion expected by the end of 2025. These upgraded tanks will be designated as Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN. The LTSC encompasses various Leopard 2 models within Canada’s military, including main battle tanks like the 2A4 CAN, 2A4M CAN, 2A6M CAN, and 2A6M C2 CAN, as well as Leopard 2 ARV CAN armored recovery vehicles and Leopard 2 AEV CAN engineering vehicles. (Picture source: ARD 1) As reported by Army Recognition in October 2023, modernization efforts for the Leopard 2 fleet are under consideration, with Army Lt. Col. Chloeann Summerfield indicating that further upgrades will cost over $620 million. These enhancements may include improvements to protection, surveillance, target acquisition, firepower, and mobility. Canada expects to issue a request for industry bids by 2028, with the first upgraded tanks anticipated to be operational by 2030. This modernization aims to align Canadian Leopard 2 configurations with those of NATO allies to enhance interoperability. Financial considerations are a significant factor in the Canadian government’s plans for its tank fleet. Canada’s defense budget is already allocated toward major projects, such as the procurement of F-35 fighter jets, surface combatant ships, and P-8 patrol aircraft, limiting available funds for new tank acquisitions. Although the government announced plans to replace the tanks sent to Ukraine, no further information has been released, and financial constraints may delay this process. Canadian defense analyst Martin Shadwick has highlighted that Canada’s approach to tanks has varied over time, noting that a 2003 decision to retire the Leopard fleet was reversed in favor of lighter vehicles, only to be reinstated when tanks were deployed in Afghanistan. The future of Canada’s tank fleet remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether Canada will acquire new tanks in the immediate future. To address maintenance needs, Canada has increased the use of contracted Field Service Representatives (FSRs) from KMW since 2018, allowing for specialized technician support at Army facilities across the country. Additionally, adjustments to the training and management of Canadian technicians are intended to strengthen maintenance capabilities and ensure sufficient technical support during periods of increased demand. The Canadian Army has emphasized that these changes are part of broader efforts to maintain the operational readiness of the Leopard 2 fleet, with the LTSC anticipated to play a critical role in sustaining the tanks until their projected end-of-service date in 2035. The Leopard 2A6M CAN C2 seems to retain the weaponry of the Leopard 2A6M CAN, which is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun and two 7.62mm machine guns. (Picture source: ARD 1) Currently, Canada operates 74 Leopard 2 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) in three main variants: 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. Additionally, 52 older Leopard 1C2 tanks remain in storage. In addition to these tanks, the Canadian Army has around 30 recovery and engineering vehicles, including 5 Buffalo Armoured Engineering Vehicles (AEVs) and 18 Wisent 2 vehicles, as well as 12 BPz-3 Büffel Armoured Recovery Vehicles (ARVs). With 8 tanks donated to Ukraine and 15 Leopard 2A4 tanks now deployed to Eastern Europe as part of NATO’s bolstered presence since the onset of the Ukraine conflict, questions have arisen about the readiness and condition of Canada’s remaining tanks. National Defence spokesperson Dan Le Bouthillier emphasized that Leopard 2 tanks, like other heavy vehicles, require extensive maintenance and inspections. On average, these tanks spend about 30% of their time in maintenance, which includes scheduled inspections. In response to reports that Canada was allegedly cannibalizing certain tanks to maintain others, Le Bouthillier clarified that such practices are only permitted under specific and urgent circumstances, with authorization from local commanders. He noted that no Leopard 2 tanks have been permanently decommissioned to support other units. Canada's defense policy contends with limited defense spending and a complex security environment. In 2023, the defense budget was about 1.38% of GDP, below NATO’s 2% target. However, Canada ranks seventh in NATO for absolute defense spending, with some modest increases in outlays planned. Plans include doubling its NATO Enhanced Presence Battlegroup in Latvia by 2026 and committing more than $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine, along with continuing training under Operation Unifier. Currently, Canada operates 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. (Picture source: Canadian MoD) The Leopard 2A6M CAN is a Canadian version of the German Leopard 2A6 main battle tank, deployed in 2007 to address operational needs in Afghanistan. Canada initially assessed its Leopard C2 tanks but determined that they were insufficient for the region's conditions, particularly due to a lack of air conditioning, which impacted crew performance. Consequently, Canada arranged for the German Bundeswehr to loan twenty Leopard 2A6 tanks, which were then modified by KMW to include mine protection and other adjustments to meet Canadian Army requirements. This deployment aimed to enhance vehicle protection and provide a more suitable platform for Canadian forces in Afghanistan's demanding operational environment. The Leopard 2A6M CAN includes several modifications unique to this variant. Enhancements consist of a mine protection package to reinforce the tank's underside, specific communications and anti-IED jamming equipment mounted on the turret, and stand-off slat armor for additional defense. An air conditioning unit and cooling vests were later added to reduce heat strain on the crew, alongside Saab Barracuda camouflage mats to decrease heat absorption by 50 percent. The initial twenty tanks were on loan from Germany, configured with MG3 machine guns, while subsequent tanks, procured from the Netherlands, were integrated with C6 GPMGs for consistency with Canadian forces. Upon returning to Canada in 2011, features like ECM boxes and slat armor were removed, yet the Canadian Army retained and continues to modify these tanks. In terms of specifications, the Leopard 2A6M CAN is equipped with a 1,500-horsepower MTU diesel engine and RENK transmission, enabling a top speed of 68 km/h and a range of 550 km on roads. It is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun, with a wide range of elevation, and two 7.62mm machine guns. The tank, weighing 62.3 tons in combat, can traverse obstacles up to 1.1 meters high and 3 meters wide. Other features include modular and composite armor, NBC protection, and options for additional modular armor. These characteristics contribute to the tank’s operational capabilities in various combat scenarios.

US Navy Demonstrates New At-Sea Missile Reloading System for Warships	According to information published by the US DoD on 7, October, 2024, the Navy showcased a groundbreaking rearming system designed to reload warships at sea, in a recent demonstration at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Sailors from the Navy and USS Chosin (CG 65) demonstrate reloading a MK 41 Vertical Launching System cell. (Picture source: DVIDS) The event featured the Transferrable Rearming Mechanism (TRM), which successfully transferred a missile canister along cables to simulate the reloading of a ship’s MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) cell. This demonstration involved sailors from the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group and crew members from the USS Chosin (CG 65). The TRM allows for at-sea replenishment of munitions, potentially reducing the time a warship would need to spend in port for resupply. Comments This capability enhances both strategic and tactical flexibility. Strategically, the Navy can maintain a forward presence without frequent interruptions for resupply, keeping vessels on station longer and increasing mission endurance. Tactically, the ability to rearm during operations enables quicker adaptation to evolving threat environments. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where maintaining a constant missile loadout is critical, such as anti-air warfare, missile defense, and strike operations. From an operational standpoint, the TRM could significantly reduce dependency on fixed supply chains, allowing task forces to operate further from logistical bases. This reduces vulnerabilities, as adversaries may target supply hubs or transit routes in an effort to limit naval power projection. In contested regions, where port access might be constrained, the TRM provides a degree of independence from shore-based infrastructure, improving the Navy's ability to operate in hostile environments. However, the implementation of at-sea rearming will require adjustments. First, the technical and procedural aspects of using such a system in real-world conditions, especially during combat or high-threat scenarios, need to be thoroughly validated. Safety and efficiency concerns in transferring heavy missile canisters across cables in potentially rough seas will also require attention. Training sailors to operate the system effectively and integrating it into existing replenishment doctrines will be key to realizing its potential. In terms of broader strategic implications, the TRM contributes to the concept of distributed maritime operations (DMO). By decentralizing logistical capabilities, the Navy can distribute forces more widely across a theater.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-demonstrates-new-at-sea-missile-reloading-system-for-warships	2024-10-14T05:07:21-07:00

This arrival establishes VMFA-533 as the Marine Corps’ second operational F-35B squadron on the East Coast and the first operational F-35B squadron at MCAS Beaufort.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35B Block 4's arrival establishes the VMFA-533 as the Marine Corps’ second operational F-35B squadron on the East Coast and the first operational F-35B squadron at MCAS Beaufort. (Picture source: US DoD) Prior to this, only the US Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 operated F-35 aircraft at the station, focusing on core introduction and fighter/attack training for new F-35 pilots. VMFA-533, known as 'America’s Squadron' for its red, white, and blue insignia, has a history that dates back to 1943. It was initially commissioned as Marine Night Fighter Squadron 533 (VMF[N]-533) and has operated various aircraft over the decades, including the F6F Hellcat, F7F Tigercat, F2H Banshee, F9F Cougar, and A-4 Skyhawk. In 1965, the squadron transitioned to the A-6 Intruder and was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron 533 (VMA-533). In 1992, it converted to the F/A-18 Hornet, remaining an F/A-18 unit for 31 years until its redesignation to VMFA-533 in September 2023. Since then, the squadron has completed preparations for the F-35 transition, including achieving 'Safe for Flight' certification. The arrival of the F-35B to VMFA-533 initiates deliveries to MCAS Beaufort’s operational squadrons and continues the 2nd MAW’s transition from legacy fixed-wing tactical aircraft to the F-35 platform. The F-35 Lightning II, developed by Lockheed Martin as part of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program starting in 1995, aimed to create a versatile stealth fighter to replace multiple aging aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the A-10 Thunderbolt II, the F/A-18 Hornet, and the AV-8B Harrier II. Lockheed Martin's X-35 was chosen over Boeing's X-32 in 2001, leading to the creation of three variants: the F-35A is the Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variant, featuring an internal cannon and optimized for maneuverability. The F-35B is the Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) version, with a unique lift fan for vertical flight capabilities. Lastly, the F-35C, the Carrier Variant (CV), is built for catapult launches and arrested landings on aircraft carriers, with larger wings for better low-speed control and the longest range among the three models. The F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft was developed to replace aging vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft such as the AV-8B Harrier II. (Picture source: USMC) In the US armed forces, the F-35A variant is operated by the United States Air Force, with 1,763 planned units. It is currently based at multiple locations, including Moody AFB, Eglin AFB, and Hill AFB, among others. Key wings include the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill AFB, the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, and units across the Air Education and Training Command. The Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard also host squadrons at various bases, supporting both training and operational missions globally. The F-35B is operated by the United States Marine Corps, with 340 aircraft planned. The Marine Corps utilizes this variant at installations like Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni in Japan, MCAS Yuma in Arizona, and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina. Notable Marine Fighter Attack Squadrons (VMFAs) include VMFA-121, VMFA-242, and VMFA-211, which are deployed on amphibious assault ships and forward bases, providing flexibility for rapid deployment in varied combat environments. The F-35C is the carrier-capable variant designed for the United States Navy and Marine Corps, with 260 Navy and 80 Marine Corps aircraft planned. The Navy operates F-35Cs from NAS Lemoore in California, with squadrons such as VFA-97, VFA-115, and VFA-125, while Marine Corps squadrons like VMFA-311 and VMFA-314 are based at MCAS Miramar. This variant is built for catapult launches and arrested landings on aircraft carriers, featuring larger wings for improved low-speed control and the longest range among the three variants, enhancing the Navy's capabilities for extended maritime operations. The F-35B is operated by the United States Marine Corps, with 340 aircraft planned. The Marine Corps utilizes this variant at installations like Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni in Japan, MCAS Yuma in Arizona, and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina. (Picture source: USMC) The F-35B, specifically, is the world’s first operational supersonic STOVL aircraft, capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings due to its integrated Rolls-Royce Lift System. This system includes a lift fan, drive shaft, and a Three-Bearing Swivel Module that allows for vectoring the engine’s thrust downwards for vertical flight. The F-35B can transition between conventional flight and STOVL mode, which is vital for operations from shorter runways or amphibious assault ships. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 27,300 kg and can perform vertical landings with a gross weight limit of 18,415 kg. The F-35B has a wingspan of 10.7 meters, a length of 15.4 meters, and an internal fuel capacity of 6,045 kg, which is less compared to the F-35A and F-35C. Its range on internal fuel is approximately 900 nautical miles (1,670 km), and it has a combat radius of 469 nautical miles (845 km). The F-35B is equipped with advanced avionics such as the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), enhancing its situational awareness and target acquisition capabilities. The F-35B's internal weapons bay, which is slightly smaller than those of the other F-35 variants to accommodate the lift fan, can carry two AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles and two 1,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) or other compatible payloads while maintaining stealth. Additionally, it supports a variety of external weapon configurations, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder for air-to-air engagements, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and up to two 1,500-pound weapons on its outermost wing pylons. For close air support, the F-35B is fitted with an optional 25 mm GAU-22/A gun pod, mounted externally on the aircraft’s centerline. The F-35B is capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings due to its integrated Rolls-Royce Lift System, which includes a lift fan, drive shaft, and a Three-Bearing Swivel Module that allows for vectoring the engine’s thrust downwards for vertical flight. (Picture source: USMC) Initiated in 2019, the Block 4 upgrade for the F-35 introduces over 75 enhancements, marking the most significant modernization phase for the F-35 Lightning II to date. Specifically, it increases the fighter's missile carriage by incorporating systems like the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile and the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, expanding its combat reach and flexibility. The Block 4 suite also includes the AN/APG-85 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which provides enhanced detection capabilities, and upgrades to the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) for improved 360-degree situational awareness. These upgrades enable the F-35 to carry a wider range of precision-guided munitions, allowing it to engage both air and ground targets more effectively. Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3) serves as the backbone of Block 4, providing a major overhaul to the F-35’s computing and data-processing systems. At the heart of TR-3 is a new Integrated Core Processor (ICP) developed by Lockheed Martin, which offers over 25 times the processing power of its predecessor. This ICP is paired with a new Panoramic Cockpit Display and an enhanced Memory System, supporting advanced applications and enabling the integration of future technologies. TR-3 also introduces an open mission systems architecture, making the F-35 more adaptable to rapid updates and capable of hosting additional software-driven capabilities, such as advanced sensor fusion and AI-assisted targeting. The upgrade package is completed by the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) by Pratt &amp; Whitney, which addresses the cooling and thrust needs generated by the new Block 4 capabilities. The ECU provides increased bleed air (compressed air taken from the engine) required for the jet's enhanced electronic systems, while simultaneously boosting engine durability and fuel efficiency, allowing for an expected $40 billion in lifecycle cost savings. This enables the F-35 to operate at higher temperatures and power levels, optimizing the platform for sustained, high-intensity missions.

Iran Missile Strikes on Israel Reveal Limits of Ballistic Missile Threat in Modern Warfare	According to information published by Business Insider on October 12, 2024, Iran's recent missile strikes on Israel highlight a growing debate about the effectiveness of ballistic missiles in modern warfare. Despite their ability to deliver sudden, destructive blows, the real-world impact of these weapons appears to be less decisive than their reputation suggests.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crane clearing debris from Iranian missiles fired on Israel. (Picture source: Twitter account of Israel Defense Forces) In two high-profile attacks, Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, yet the results were underwhelming. In April, a barrage of 300 missiles and drones was largely intercepted by Israeli and allied defense systems, while a subsequent strike in October saw a higher percentage of missiles breaching defenses but causing minimal damage overall. While these attacks made headlines with their dramatic visuals—explosions, fiery streaks across the sky—the aftermath tells a different story. Critical infrastructure remains functional, public morale appears undeterred, and the Israeli military continues its operations. This mirrors the experience of Ukraine, which has endured repeated Russian missile attacks over two years without a collapse in its fighting capacity. Such resilience raises questions about whether the threat posed by ballistic missiles is overstated. Ballistic missiles have long been feared for their potential to strike without warning, following a high-arcing path before slamming into targets at high speed. This threat, dating back to World War II with Nazi Germany's V-2 rockets, has only grown as more countries—31 at present—develop their own missile capabilities. Yet, history shows that ballistic missiles, despite their lethality, rarely decide wars on their own. Whether in the 1980s Iran-Iraq conflict, the 2015 Houthi missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, or recent conflicts involving Israel and Ukraine, missile barrages have inflicted damage but failed to break the will of the targeted populations. Modern ballistic missiles are more accurate than their historical counterparts, aided by advanced guidance systems like GPS. Still, even high-tech missiles often miss precise targets, and the damage inflicted is often limited compared to the massive bombing raids of previous wars. In World War II, for example, Allied forces dropped millions of tons of bombs on Germany without compelling surrender, showing that even overwhelming firepower from the air has its limits. Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, reportedly numbering around 3,000, may seem formidable on paper, but in practice, even a simultaneous launch of all these weapons would face significant interception and accuracy issues. Furthermore, the damage caused by those that do get through would likely be less than a single large-scale bombing raid from the past. Ballistic missiles remain a potent symbol of military power, and their proliferation is a legitimate concern, especially if used to target infrastructure or as a means of political coercion. However, as Iran's attacks on Israel suggest, these weapons alone are unlikely to secure a decisive victory in war.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iran-missile-strikes-on-israel-reveal-limits-of-ballistic-missile-threat-in-modern-warfare	2024-10-14T03:10:16-07:00	
North Korea Attempts to Down South Korean Modern Drone with Old KS-19 Anti-Aircraft Guns	On October 13, 2024, according to Yonhap, North Korea ordered its artillery units, including eight brigades stationed near the South Korean border, to be on high alert and prepared to engage in response to alleged South Korean drone incursions over Pyongyang. North Korea’s General Staff directed these brigades, which reportedly include older KS-19 100mm anti-aircraft guns, to be fully armed and set in wartime configuration. Pyongyang accused South Korea of flying drones over its capital multiple times earlier in the month. In a statement, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry warned that any further incursions would be met with a military response, describing such actions as 'acts of war.'Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link South Korea RQ-101 Songgolmae fixed-wing UAV from Korea Aerospace Industries (Picture source: Wikimedia) Meanwhile, South Korea denied any airspace violations, condemning North Korea's recent use of propaganda balloons and waste-filled devices across the border, which South Korea views as provocations disrupting the security of its border regions. This exchange of accusations has intensified tensions along the Demilitarized Zone, with both countries expanding their military drone programs. While North Korea has made drone development a strategic priority, recently unveiling a suicide attack drone, South Korea is preparing to counter potential escalations with its own advancements in drone technology. The South Korean military employs a variety of High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE) drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, primarily to monitor North Korean military activities and potential security threats. These drones play a critical role in enhancing South Korea’s border surveillance, maritime monitoring, and intelligence capabilities. Among the HALE assets is the RQ-4 Global Hawk, capable of operating at high altitudes for extended periods, providing broad-area coverage with real-time intelligence over long distances. For medium-altitude operations, South Korea utilizes MALE drones such as the KUS-FT, developed by Korea Aerospace Industries. The RQ-101 Songgolmae is a fixed-wing UAV designed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) primarily for reconnaissance. With a wingspan of 6.4 meters and a maximum takeoff weight of 290 kg, it has a range of up to 200 km and an endurance of approximately 6 hours. This drone is equipped with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras and GPS/INS navigation systems, which allow it to gather high-resolution images and real-time intelligence over long distances. Operating at altitudes of up to 4,500 meters, the Songgolmae is especially useful for monitoring the heavily militarized border areas, giving South Korea crucial surveillance capabilities without risking personnel​. South Korea, in collaboration with Boeing, is working on a new High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) drone development project designed to enhance its surveillance capabilities, particularly for monitoring North Korea. This initiative stems from a Memorandum of Understanding signed between South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Boeing in April 2023, aiming to build a South Korean-manufactured HALE UAV that benefits from Boeing's design expertise and technological support. The joint project intends to position South Korea at the forefront of advanced UAV production, with a focus on developing a model suited for long-endurance reconnaissance missions. South Korea's Air Force operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, a high-altitude, long-endurance platform developed by Northrop Grumman. The RQ-4 operates at altitudes up to 60,000 feet with a range of over 12,000 miles, equipped with advanced radar and infrared sensors for long-range surveillance. It can remain airborne for over 30 hours, covering extensive areas and providing high-resolution imaging, making it a valuable tool for observing North Korea's military movements. South Korea also uses KUS-FT drones, developed domestically by Korea Aerospace Industries. The KUS-FT operates at medium altitudes, up to 30,000 feet, with an endurance of around 24 hours. Equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors, it is designed for tactical reconnaissance and can conduct close monitoring along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), complementing the broader surveillance provided by HALE drones like the Global Hawk. South Korea’s drones are tailored for intelligence-gathering missions that allow for extended coverage of North Korean activities, including potential missile launch sites, military movements, and cross-border provocations. By leveraging drones with high-definition imaging, infrared vision, and real-time data links, the South Korean military can maintain a continuous, low-profile surveillance presence. These capabilities reduce the need for manned flights, minimizing risk while maximizing reach and responsiveness. Furthermore, United States operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones in collaboration with South Korea to monitor North Korean activities across the Korean Peninsula. These high-altitude, long-endurance UAVs are stationed at Sacheon Air Base in South Gyeongsang Province, where they serve as a crucial part of South Korea's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Delivered through a strategic partnership, four Global Hawks were supplied to South Korea's Air Force between 2019 and 2020, as part of a defense initiative to enhance South Korea’s monitoring capabilities against regional threats​. The Global Hawk drones, designed by Northrop Grumman, are equipped with high-resolution synthetic aperture radar and electro-optical/infrared sensors, allowing them to capture detailed images of large areas, including North Korean military installations and missile sites. This UAV fleet is capable of covering up to 100,000 square kilometers in a single flight, which is approximately the size of South Korea, enabling comprehensive border surveillance and intelligence sharing between U.S. and South Korean forces​. This collaboration not only enhances South Korea’s situational awareness along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) but also strengthens interoperability with U.S. forces, who are stationed in the region as part of a defense alliance. These joint efforts aim to maintain a high level of readiness against North Korean provocations, ensuring a rapid response to emerging threats in the region. North Korea’s recent provocations include frequent missile tests and the development of drones, which serve both strategic deterrence and as direct responses to perceived threats from South Korea and the U.S. In 2023 alone, North Korea test-fired a variety of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. The Hwasong-17, one of its most advanced ICBMs, is estimated to have a range of up to 15,000 kilometers and can potentially carry multiple warheads or countermeasures designed to evade missile defenses. This long-range capability adds to North Korea’s growing arsenal of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles that can target South Korea and U.S. bases in Japan. Additionally, North Korea has enhanced its maneuverable, solid-fueled missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept, posing a significant challenge to South Korean and U.S. missile defenses. Beyond missiles, North Korea has also advanced its drone program, often utilizing these unmanned aerial systems as tools of psychological and military provocation. The North has deployed drones capable of surveillance and, potentially, small payloads. This was evident in recent incidents where North Korean drones allegedly crossed into South Korean airspace, heightening tensions on the peninsula. Combined with North Korea’s efforts to send balloons with propaganda and waste materials into the South, these drones add a new layer to Pyongyang’s tactics, aiming to provoke and destabilize without direct engagement, a strategy that allows it to maintain pressure on its adversaries while avoiding immediate military escalation. These provocations underscore North Korea’s commitment to demonstrating its military capabilities and maintaining a high-stakes environment in the region. As a reminder on July 27, 2023, North Korea unveiled two new drones, the 'Morning Star-4' and 'Morning Star-9,' which closely resemble the U.S.-designed MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These drones, categorized as High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE), are intended for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and ground-strike missions. Despite significant challenges posed by U.N. sanctions, North Korea appears to have made strides in replicating these advanced models, possibly influenced by prior incidents involving captured U.S. drones in Iran. However, questions remain about the drones’ actual capabilities and North Korea’s access to advanced SATCOM technology, sparking speculation of potential foreign assistance. The capabilities of North Korean artillery brigades to shoot down South Korean surveillance drones are limited due to the anti-aircraft equipment available. North Korea primarily uses anti-aircraft guns like the ZU-23 23 mm and the KS-19 100 mm, which are designed to target low-flying aircraft rather than high-altitude drones. These systems lack the precision and tracking abilities needed to effectively engage modern MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) or HALE (High Altitude, Long Endurance) drones used by South Korea. To intercept surveillance drones operating at higher altitudes, North Korea would require modern surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) with radar or infrared guidance, capable of tracking high-speed targets over long distances. Although North Korea possesses older SAMs, such as the Soviet-era SA-2 and SA-3, these systems are not sufficiently accurate to reliably target modern drones. Consequently, South Korean high-altitude drones remain less vulnerable to North Korea’s conventional artillery defenses.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-attempts-to-down-south-korean-modern-drone-with-old-ks-19-anti-aircraft-guns	2024-10-14T02:46:25-07:00

(Picture source: Navy Recognition) This agreement includes joint efforts in military technology, particularly focusing on drones, a sector where Turkey has become a global leader. Erdoğan emphasized that Turkish drone technology, including the renowned Bayraktar TB2 systems, would be an integral part of this cooperation. Turkish Defense Industry in Balkan countries Several Balkan countries have purchased Bayraktar TB2 drones from Türkiye, reflecting the growing military ties between the region and Ankara. Kosovo, which has been working to strengthen its defense capabilities, received its first batch of Bayraktar TB2 drones in July 2023. This acquisition is viewed as a strategic move amid ongoing tensions with Serbia, and it has been reported that Kosovo bought five drones, although the exact number remains unconfirmed​. Albania also joined the ranks of Bayraktar TB2 buyers in 2022, purchasing three drones to support both military and civilian operations, including surveillance and firefighting efforts. Bosnia and Herzegovina recently followed suit, placing an order for at least six Bayraktar TB2 drones in 2024. This move is designed to bolster its defense capabilities amid the complex security dynamics of the Balkans. Turkey’s role is not without challenges. Its involvement in the defense sectors of both Serbia and Kosovo positions it at the center of regional tensions. The sale of advanced weapons to countries in close proximity, often with competing interests, requires a careful diplomatic balance. Turkey has used its military strength and its defense industry to foster partnerships, positioning itself as a reliable supplier of advanced military technology, but it must also be wary of exacerbating existing conflicts. In the Balkans, Turkish arms sales serve not only as an economic driver but also as a tool for increasing Ankara’s regional influence. The Balkan states, many of which are NATO members or aspirants, see Turkish military technology as a valuable addition to their security frameworks. Turkey’s defense industry policy in the Balkans is a calculated mix of economic strategy, geopolitical ambition, and military influence. As Turkey continues to expand its defense exports, its ability to manage the complex political landscape of the Balkans will be crucial to its long-term success in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/turkey-and-serbia-sign-defense-cooperation-agreement-focused-on-drone-technology	2024-10-14T02:15:11-07:00	
Germany Launches Technical Talks with Türkiye for Eurofighter Fighter Jet Sale	With German Chancellor Olaf Scholz scheduled to visit Türkiye on October 19, 2024, Germany has greenlit technical discussions with Türkiye for a potential sale of Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. This decision, taken in a confidential meeting by the German Federal Security Council, marks a shift from Berlin, which had previously blocked the sale over concerns that these aircraft could be used against Kurdish armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase (Picture source: Eurofighter) The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, multi-role combat aircraft developed by a European consortium composed of Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom under Eurofighter GmbH. Used by several European nations and Saudi Arabia, the Typhoon is designed to perform air superiority missions, airspace defense, interdiction, close air support, and reconnaissance. Its delta-wing configuration, combined with advanced control systems and optimized aerodynamic instability, delivers exceptional agility and speed, reaching up to 2,495 km/h. Equipped with two EUROJET EJ200 engines, the Typhoon offers robust power and redundancy for secure operations both in peacetime and in conflict. Technologically, the Typhoon stands out with its CAPTOR radar, a mechanically scanned system that can evolve to AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, providing long-range detection, advanced air-to-ground capability, and enhanced electronic protection. This radar offers a broad field of view optimized for both aerial and ground engagements. The Typhoon’s weaponry includes 13 hardpoints for missiles and bombs, with configurations tailored to mission requirements: air-to-air AMRAAM and ASRAAM missiles, anti-radar and anti-ship missiles, and guided bombs. This weapon system, coupled with advanced piloting controls such as voice-commanded VTAS (Voice Throttle and Stick), maximizes in-flight effectiveness and reduces pilot workload, enabling swift responses in demanding combat scenarios. The Eurofighter consortium, consisting of Germany, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom, fully supports the potential sale of 40 Eurofighters to Türkiye, valued at approximately $5.6 billion. The agreement gained momentum following a meeting between Chancellor Scholz and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the UN General Assembly in New York last month. The technical talks, expected to last about three weeks, will cover aircraft specifications, acquisition stages, personnel training, and maintenance and spare parts management protocols. The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase. Additionally, sources close to the matter indicate that Chancellor Scholz might be seeking an agreement to expedite the repatriation of approximately 15,000 Turkish nationals whose asylum requests were denied in Germany, thereby strengthening ties between Berlin and Ankara. Airbus, one of Eurofighter's main partners, has actively supported efforts to navigate political challenges. Simon Ward, head of Airbus in Türkiye, even suggested that Eurofighters could arrive in Türkiye sooner than anticipated. While the start of technical talks does not guarantee a finalized sale, this move is seen as a significant indication of Germany’s openness amid rising regional tensions, particularly with the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the ongoing Gaza crisis. Turkish defense officials suggest that acquiring the Eurofighter would provide Türkiye’s air force with AESA radar technology for the first time, significantly enhancing its capabilities. Turkish experts view the Eurofighter as an optimal interim solution while Türkiye awaits the integration of its domestic KAAN fighter jet and American F-16 Block 70s into its fleet. The outcome of these talks could also pave the way for broader military-economic partnerships between Germany and Türkiye, a development closely observed by other Eurofighter consortium members. In conclusion, this initiative marks a turning point in bilateral relations and highlights the complexity of defense negotiations in Europe, shaped by geopolitical dynamics and regional security imperatives.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/germany-launches-technical-talks-with-tuerkiye-for-eurofighter-fighter-jet-sale	2024-10-14T02:06:03-07:00	
Australia’s new AS9 Huntsman 155mm howitzer makes first appearance in South Korea for testing phase	As reported by Mason on October 12, 2024, the Australian variant of the K9A1, the AS9 Huntsman, was reportedly observed in South Korea for the first time. It is likely that the 155mm self-propelled howitzer was transported by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development (ADD), which is responsible for developing the K9 Thunder and conducting various testing and evaluation services.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Australian variant of the K9 Thunder, later known as the AS9, is set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, quality assessment tests for mass-produced military products, performance tests for export items, and performance enhancement evaluations. The prospect of Australia acquiring the South Korean K9 Thunder was first publicly discussed in June 2005, when discussions began between Australian and South Korean defense officials about potential trade opportunities, including the K9 Thunder and Australian naval gun ammunition. By August 2009, Samsung Techwin and Raytheon Australia became leading contenders for Australia’s Land 17 artillery replacement program, as other bidders did not provide sufficient detail. Testing of the K9 platform commenced in April 2010, and the vehicle successfully fired the M982 Excalibur, meeting key requirements for the program. The proposed Australian variant, later known as the AS9, was set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, and performance tests for export items. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) In June 2010, the K9 was announced as the preferred option for the Land 17 program. However, funding for the project was redirected due to floods in Queensland in 2011, leading to the program’s cancellation in 2012. In 2019, then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia planned to acquire 30 K9 howitzers and ten K10 ammunition resupply vehicles, although no specific timeline was provided at that time. In September 2020, Australia issued a tender for Hanwha Defense Australia to locally produce 30 K9 variants as part of the Land 8116 Phase 1 project. The Australian variant, based on the Norwegian K9 VIDAR, was to include enhancements first proposed in 2010, alongside up-to-date modifications. In December 2021, the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) and Hanwha Defense Australia formalized a $788 million contract for the production of 30 AS9 howitzers and 15 AS10 armored ammunition resupply vehicles at a new facility in Geelong, Victoria. Hanwha’s Geelong facility, the Hanwha Armoured Vehicle Centre of Excellence (H-ACE), began construction in April 2022. This 150,000-square-meter site includes a 1.5-kilometer test track and various R&amp;D areas, with plans to create 300 jobs for local specialists. Through international partnerships, including a $67 million deal with Norway’s Kongsberg Gruppen for Integrated Combat Solutions (ICS) and a contract with Hanwha Systems worth 20.8 billion KRW, Hanwha Defense Australia has integrated various systems into the AS9. The AS9 Huntsman, a 155mm/52-caliber self-propelled howitzer, has a maximum firing range of 40 kilometers with standard ammunition and can reach up to 60 kilometers with specialized rounds. (Picture source: Australian MoD) Mass production of the AS9 and AS10 began at H-ACE in 2024, and the first deliveries to the Australian Army are expected by 2027. The AS9 includes an enhanced suspension system, additional armor for increased protection, and a fire control system from Kongsberg, which allows for integration with other Australian defense assets. These modifications align with the Australian Army’s specific requirements and distinguish the AS9 from the original K9 Thunder. Capable of firing three rounds in 15 seconds and sustaining a rate of six to eight rounds per minute, the AS9 is also equipped with a semi-automated loading system.

South Korea Conducts Live Test of Taurus Missile Amid Rising Tensions with North Korea	Amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the South Korean Air Force (RoKAF) recently conducted live-fire drills featuring the German-designed Taurus missile. This exercise, held on October 8 and 10 over the Yellow Sea, has drawn international attention, especially from Ukraine, which has long expressed interest in acquiring such capabilities to counter Russian forces. These tests underscore Seoul's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid ongoing provocations from North Korea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Republic of Korea Air Force F-15K Slam Eagle, assigned to the 11th Fighter Wing, arrives for Korea Flying Training 2024 at Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, April 12, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) During the exercise, a Taurus missile was launched from an F-15K fighter jet, traveling over 400 kilometers to hit its designated target. A video released by RoKAF documented the entire process, from integrating the missile onto the aircraft to its launch. Beyond these live tests, RoKAF also implemented scenarios to intercept potentially hostile cruise missiles, involving both F-15K and F-35A Lightning II jets, though the exact number of aircraft used was not disclosed. The Taurus missiles demonstrated their ability to identify and track enemy cruise missiles moving at high speed and low altitude. The E-737 early warning and control aircraft played a crucial role, relaying real-time information to other aircraft and the central control center. This exercise, part of a broader training program to counter cruise missile threats, enhances South Korea’s defensive posture as tensions remain high. These missile drills follow a series of provocations from North Korea, including the deployment of propaganda balloons toward South Korea and threats to cut off ground and rail communications. North Korea also announced plans to fortify its border defenses, accusing South Korea and the United States of destabilizing actions. This South Korean military response recalls similar missile tests conducted in 2017 in reaction to North Korea's nuclear tests. The Taurus KEPD-350 missile, developed by Germany's MBDA in collaboration with Saab Bofors Dynamics, is designed for deep-strike missions. With a range exceeding 500 kilometers, it allows engagement of heavily fortified targets from a secure distance. Powered by the Williams P8300-15 turbofan engine, the missile combines precision with fuel efficiency.

This missile, weighing 1,400 kg and measuring 5.1 meters in length, can be deployed on various platforms, including the F-15K and Eurofighter Typhoon, enhancing South Korea’s strike capabilities. Integrating the Taurus missile into South Korea’s F-15K Slam Eagle fleet aligns with its 'kill chain' strategy, aimed at quickly neutralizing North Korean command centers and fortified positions housing nuclear or conventional missiles in the event of conflict. In 2023, South Korean defense firm LIG Nex1 and Taurus Systems signed an MoU to adapt the KEPD-350K missile for the FA-50 light attack aircraft, further expanding Seoul’s long-range strike options. In parallel, South Korea conducted interception exercises involving KF-16 and F-35A fighter jets coordinated with E-737 'Peace Eye' surveillance aircraft. These early warning aircraft, capable of tracking thousands of targets simultaneously, play a central role in detecting and neutralizing low-altitude cruise missiles that are challenging to detect and intercept. The F-35A’s advanced sensors and avionics are designed for effective operations in contested airspace, providing a higher probability of intercepting enemy missiles before they reach their targets. The KF-16, an upgraded version of the American F-16, is equipped with sophisticated radar and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, allowing precise interception of aerial threats. These exercises, part of a multi-layered defense strategy, highlight South Korea's readiness to respond swiftly to North Korean threats, which often involve low-altitude, fast-moving projectiles designed to evade detection. By showcasing advanced weaponry such as the Taurus missile, South Korea sends a clear message of deterrence to North Korea. South Korea appears well-prepared to respond to any escalation, with a highly capable air force equipped for precision strikes and defensive operations. The Taurus missile, with its ability to target strategic facilities, offers South Korea a critical technological advantage amid rising threats from Pyongyang. In summary, these missile tests and interception exercises underline South Korea’s commitment to reinforcing its defense and deterrence strategies against the persistent threats from North Korea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-conducts-live-test-of-taurus-missile-amid-rising-tensions-with-north-korea	2024-10-14T01:29:03-07:00

North Korea begins construction of large submarine possibly nuclear powered	According to information published by Yonhap News Agency on August 8, 2024, the South Korean military has confirmed that North Korea has initiated the construction of a large submarine near Sinpo, a key area for the regime's submarine operations in South Hamgyong Province.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kim Jong Un during an inspection visit to the Nampho shipyard. (Picture source: KCNA) On October 8th, officials revealed that analysis is underway to determine whether the vessel could potentially be nuclear-powered, a significant development given North Korea's past aspirations for such technology. According to reports, the new submarine is notably larger than the existing ones in North Korea's fleet. Although it is still in the early stages of construction, the exact displacement and capabilities will become clearer as the work progresses. One military source suggested that while crucial components like a nuclear reactor have not yet been installed, the increased size raises the possibility that this could be North Korea’s first nuclear-powered submarine. Earlier this year, in January, North Korea’s state newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported that Kim oversaw a test launch of submarine-launched cruise missiles and inspected ongoing work related to nuclear submarine development. Korean People's Navy The fleet includes a large number of conventionally powered submarines, with estimates suggesting around 70 to 90 vessels. While many of these are older models, like the Soviet-era Romeo-class submarines, North Korea has been modifying and upgrading them for more advanced roles, including missile delivery. A key recent development is the unveiling of the Hero Kim Kun Ok submarine, which was launched in September 2023. This vessel represents a significant modification of the Romeo class, with the addition of a missile compartment designed to carry up to 10 missiles. Although termed a 'tactical nuclear attack submarine' by North Korea, it is still diesel-powered, not nuclear-propelled. The Hero Kim Kun Ok is believed to be capable of launching both submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and potentially cruise missiles. North Korean Romeo-class The Type 033 Romeo-class submarine displaces 1,475 tons when surfaced and 1,830 tons while submerged. It measures 76.6 meters in length, with a beam of 6.7 meters and a draught of 5.2 meters. Powered by two diesel engines providing 2.94 MW (4,000 shp) and two electric motors, the submarine drives two shafts. It achieves a surface speed of 15.2 knots and a submerged speed of 13 knots. Its range extends to 14,484 km (9,000 miles) when traveling at 9 knots. The vessel is crewed by 54 personnel, including 10 officers. Its sensors include sonar and radar, and it is equipped with MRP 11-14 electronic warfare and decoy systems. The submarine is armed with eight 533 mm torpedo tubes, six located in the bow and two in the stern, capable of deploying up to 14 torpedoes or 28 mines.

US Army accelerates M113 replacement with new $184 Million AMPV order	On October 9, 2024, BAE Systems received a $184 million contract modification from the U.S. Army for an additional 48 Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV), building on the existing full-rate production agreement. The AMPV Family of Vehicles (FoV) is being introduced to replace the older M113 series in the U.S. Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), offering modernized capabilities in survivability, mobility, and interoperability. The contract modification will support the Army’s plan to expand its fleet of AMPVs, thereby modernizing and improving the operational flexibility of the ABCTs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV) program was initiated with a $383 million EMD contract in 2014, producing 29 prototypes before entering low-rate production to deliver 289 vehicles by 2020. (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV lineup includes five specialized variants, each designed for specific roles: the M1283 General Purpose (GP), M1284 Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), M1285 Medical Treatment Vehicle (MTV), M1286 Mission Command (MC), and M1287 Mortar Carrier. The M1283 GP variant is utilized for resupply, maintenance, and casualty evacuation operations. The M1284 MEV is equipped for medical evacuation, accommodating up to six ambulatory personnel or four patients on litters. The M1285 MTV functions as a mobile medical treatment facility, supporting battlefield care with equipment typically found in civilian ambulances. The M1286 MC variant supports mission command functions, enhancing command, control, and communication within the ABCT. The M1287 Mortar Carrier provides indirect fire support using the M121 Mortar System and the M95 Mortar Fire Control System. The AMPV program has been pursued to address the limitations of the M113, a platform that has been in service since the 1960s. Although versatile, the M113 has shown vulnerabilities in modern combat scenarios, particularly during the Iraq War where urban warfare tactics exposed its weaknesses. The Army subsequently adopted Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for active service. However, the AMPV is intended to offer enhanced off-road mobility, similar to that of the M2 Bradley and M1 Abrams, making it more suitable for a variety of operational environments. The AMPV program has been pursued to address the limitations of the M113, a platform that has been in service since the 1960s, but has shown vulnerabilities in modern combat scenarios, particularly during the Iraq War where urban warfare tactics exposed its weaknesses. (Picture source: US DoD) This follow-on order represents the Army’s shift in acquisition priorities, following the cancellation of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. Initially, the GCV was intended to replace M2 Bradley vehicles within the ABCT, but cost constraints led to a preference for the AMPV program, estimated to cost over $5 billion, compared to the $37 billion projected for the GCV program. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office highlighted the AMPV as a more feasible option, and the Army’s FY 2015 budget proposal reflected a reallocation of resources to focus on AMPV production. BAE Systems, in response to the contract modification, has expanded its production capabilities, particularly at its York, Pennsylvania facility. Alongside facilities in South Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, and Michigan, this network is designed to meet current and projected demand for AMPVs. The expansion aligns with the Army’s objective to gradually increase production, reaching full-rate production after an initial low-rate production phase that began in 2018. Production plans include an incremental ramp-up, from 57 vehicles in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 to 122 units annually by FY 2026 and FY 2027, before reducing in later years. The AMPV program’s phased approach began with a $383 million Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract awarded to BAE Systems in 2014. This phase produced 29 prototypes, followed by a low-rate production phase to supply 289 vehicles by 2020. General Dynamics initially contested the AMPV requirements, claiming the design favored the BAE Bradley chassis. However, the Army Materiel Command dismissed the protest, stating that BAE’s manufacturing of the M113 and Bradley provided certain logistical advantages that did not constitute preferential treatment. The AMPV’s modular design aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. (Picture source: US DoD) Following this decision, General Dynamics did not pursue further action through the Government Accountability Office but continued to advocate a mixed fleet concept to Congress. This proposal suggested combining tracked Bradley and wheeled Stryker vehicles, which General Dynamics argued could enhance mission flexibility and reduce life-cycle costs. The AMPV’s modular design allows for future upgrades in communications and electronic systems, supporting the Army’s strategy of leveraging commercial off-the-shelf components. This approach aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. By allowing for incremental upgrades, the Army plans to incorporate new technologies over time, including satellite communications, further integrating the AMPV into the digital battlefield. Looking forward, the AMPV program includes potential future variants designed for counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) roles. One such variant may feature the Leonardo DRS Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) turret, equipped with a 30mm XM914 cannon, a 7.62mm M240 machine gun, and Stinger missile launchers. This development aligns with the Army’s intent to adapt the AMPV for a range of defense scenarios within the ABCT framework, while also considering international interest in the platform. The AMPV shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for the US Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs). (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV continues to replace the M113 in Army units, such as the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division, which recently replaced over 130 M113s with AMPVs after completing necessary training. This replacement supports the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Modernization Priority, with AMPVs designed to withstand threats from mines, improvised explosive devices, and direct fire. Their design shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for ABCTs. BAE Systems has also developed additional variants to fulfill specific mission requirements. Recently, a turreted mortar variant was introduced, equipped with the Patria NEMO 120mm remote-controlled mortar system. This variant provides responsive fire support within the ABCT. With the full-rate production now underway, BAE Systems will continue to supply AMPVs to the U.S. Army, fulfilling both current operational needs and potential future requirements as the Army transitions its fleet to more modernized combat vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-accelerates-m113-replacement-with-new-184-million-ampv-order	2024-10-14T00:26:14-07:00

Breaking News: US Authorizes Deployment of THAAD Air Defense Missile in Israel to Counter Missile Threats from Iran	On Sunday, October 13, 2024, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had authorized the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to Israel at the direction of President Joe Biden. This move comes in response to recent escalations, including Iran's ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October of this year. Ryder emphasized that the deployment would strengthen Israel’s air defense capabilities amid heightened regional tensions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A U.S. Air Force Airman unloads an American THAAD air defense missile system from a C-17 Globemaster III at Nevatim Air Base, Israel, on March 1, 2019. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) This is not the United States' first deployment of THAAD in the region. President Biden directed a similar deployment last year, following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, to protect American troops and interests. The U.S. also deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 as part of a joint training and integrated air defense exercise. The new deployment adds to Israel’s already robust air defense systems, which include the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow 3 systems, designed to intercept threats ranging from short-range rockets to long-range missiles. THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase—right before impact—providing a crucial layer of defense against missile threats. THAAD’s key strength lies in its ability to intercept threats at both high altitudes and long ranges, making it particularly effective against ballistic missiles. The system can engage targets at ranges of up to 200 kilometers and at altitudes exceeding 150 kilometers, far beyond the reach of most missile defense systems, allowing it to neutralize warheads before they reenter the atmosphere. Iran possesses one of the largest and most diverse missile arsenals in the Middle East, comprising a wide range of short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles. The country has developed several missile systems, such as the Shahab, Ghadr, and Sejjil series, capable of striking targets throughout the region, including Israel and U.S. military bases. Some of Iran’s missiles, like the Shahab-3, have a range of over 1,000 kilometers, while more advanced systems like the Sejjil-2 have ranges that extend beyond 2,000 kilometers, potentially reaching parts of Europe. These missiles can carry conventional or, in a worst-case scenario, nuclear warheads, though Iran insists its missile program is defensive. In addition to ballistic missiles, Iran has also developed cruise missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept due to their low-altitude flight paths. Iran’s missile capabilities, combined with its ability to produce and modify these systems domestically, pose a significant strategic threat in the region, especially to adversaries like Israel and the United States. These missiles have been central to Iran’s military strategy, allowing it to project power and retaliate against potential threats without relying solely on conventional forces. Against Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, which includes a variety of long-range and medium-range systems, THAAD offers a significant defensive advantage. Its ability to intercept missiles at such high altitudes ensures that the debris or any remaining missile fragments fall harmlessly outside of populated areas. Paired with Israel’s existing air defense systems, THAAD adds another crucial layer of protection to Israel’s multi-tiered defense strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-us-authorizes-deployment-of-thaad-battery-in-israel-to-counter-missile-threats-from-iran	2024-10-13T14:39:46-07:00	
Breaking News: Ukrainian F-16 Fighter Wins First Air-to-Air Fight Shoots Down Russian Su-34	According to several reports published on social networks on October 13, 2024, an F-16 fighter jet operated by the Ukrainian Air Force shot down a Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber. This victory, Ukraine's first in air-to-air combat using the F-16, was achieved with the advanced AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, known for its infrared homing and high maneuverability. The AIM-9X, widely regarded for its lethality, gives the F-16 a significant edge in dogfights, able to engage enemy aircraft at high angles and within close-range combat scenarios.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Historic Moment: Ukrainian F-16 Claims First Air-to-Air Victory by Downing Russian Su-34 Fighter-Bomber The F-16 Fighting Falcon is renowned for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and an array of precision-guided missiles. One of its standout features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing enhanced detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry a range of air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfighting. Thanks to its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X's ability to lock onto targets from extreme angles makes it particularly lethal in close-quarters combat. This mix of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate in both long-range and short-range engagements​. Compared to other contemporary fighter aircraft, such as Russia’s Su-35 and MiG-31, the F-16 has certain advantages regarding agility and electronic warfare capabilities. While the Su-35 boasts superior long-range radar and missile systems, the F-16 compensates with its superior maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures to evade radar-guided threats. This agility, coupled with advanced helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to engage targets by simply looking at them, gives the F-16 a distinct advantage in close combat​. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable for a range of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, however, its ability to engage multiple targets at various ranges and its integrated defensive measures provides a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While Russian aircraft like the Su-35 may have superior radar range, the F-16’s electronic warfare and countermeasures systems, combined with its superior dogfighting agility and modern missile systems like the AIM-9X, allow it to compete effectively against modern Russian fighters in both defensive and offensive air operations​. The AIM-9X Sidewinder missile is a state-of-the-art air-to-air weapon that has revolutionized modern dogfighting. Its infrared (heat-seeking) guidance system allows it to detect and lock onto the heat signature of an enemy aircraft, typically from the engines, making it highly effective against fast-moving targets. What sets the AIM-9X apart from previous iterations is its 'high off-boresight' capability. This means that the pilot doesn’t need to be directly facing the enemy to fire; the missile can target and hit aircraft even at extreme angles relative to the jet's flight path. This off-boresight capability is paired with a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system, enabling the pilot to simply look at a target to guide the missile. This feature drastically reduces the reaction time needed in close air engagements, a critical advantage when pilots maneuver at high speeds and in high-threat environments. Moreover, the AIM-9X is known for its agility and ability to perform sharp turns, allowing it to stay locked onto highly agile enemy fighters. In addition to the AIM-9X, the F-16 itself offers a combination of speed, radar systems, and maneuverability that make it a formidable platform for air-to-air combat. Equipped with beyond-visual-range missiles (such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM) alongside the AIM-9X, the F-16 can engage enemies both at close range and from distances where visual contact is not required. This first victory in air-to-air combat for Ukraine marks a significant milestone in the conflict, demonstrating the growing capability of the Ukrainian Air Force thanks to NATO's continued support in terms of advanced weaponry and pilot training. The F-16, paired with the AIM-9X, offers a significant edge in aerial warfare against Russian aircraft like the Su-34, which are typically less maneuverable in close engagements​.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-wins-first-air-to-air-fight-shoots-down-russian-su-34	2024-10-13T08:20:31-07:00
