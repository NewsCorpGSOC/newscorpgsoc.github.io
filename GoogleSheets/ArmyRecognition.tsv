(Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The 30mm MCWS, developed by Oshkosh Defense, represents a significant leap in combat capabilities for the U.S. Army's Stryker platform. The primary armament of the system is the XM813 30mm chain gun, a powerful, automatic cannon capable of engaging a wide range of threats. The XM813 provides both single-shot and automatic firing modes, with a rate of fire of up to 200 rounds per minute. The cannon is highly versatile, designed to fire a variety of 30mm munitions, including armor-piercing rounds, high-explosive incendiary (HEI) shells, and programmable airburst munitions. This gives SBCTs the ability to effectively engage enemy infantry, light armor, fortifications, and even aerial threats such as drones and helicopters. In addition to the XM813, the MCWS also integrates a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun, providing supplemental firepower for engaging soft targets and infantry at close to medium ranges. The 7.62mm machine gun can be used independently of the 30mm cannon, allowing the crew to switch between weapons based on the nature of the target, which conserves ammunition for the primary weapon. The Stryker Double V Hull (DVH) is an upgraded version of the Stryker M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV), designed to enhance crew survivability and vehicle resilience against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and mines. The primary improvement in the DVH design is the double V-shaped hull, which helps to deflect blasts from underneath the vehicle, reducing the impact of explosions on the crew compartment. This hull design, along with enhanced armor and suspension upgrades, significantly increases the vehicle's protection against explosive threats, while maintaining the Stryker's mobility and versatility in combat. The DVH variant is part of ongoing efforts to improve the survivability and effectiveness of armored vehicles in modern conflict zones. At AUSA 2024, Oshkosh presented other armament integration on the MCWS turret such as Javelin Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) launcher. The Javelin missile system provides a highly effective solution for engaging and neutralizing heavily armored vehicles, including main battle tanks, from longer ranges. The combination of the 30mm cannon and the Javelin missile launcher transforms the Stryker vehicle into a multi-role platform capable of engaging diverse battlefield threats. In terms of targeting and fire control, the Oshkosh MCWS is equipped with an advanced fire control system that includes integrated day/night optics, thermal imaging, and a laser rangefinder. This ensures precise targeting and tracking in various environmental conditions and enhances the system’s accuracy over extended engagement ranges. The fire control system is linked to a stabilization system that allows the Stryker vehicle to engage targets while on the move, further improving combat effectiveness in dynamic battlefield situations. A crucial milestone in the development and fielding of the Oshkosh MCWS occurred in May 2024, when the system completed Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E). The rigorous testing phase allowed soldiers to evaluate the weapon system in real-world, operational conditions, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness on the battlefield. FOT&amp;E is a vital step in the acquisition process, providing direct feedback from soldiers and verifying that the system meets the Army’s stringent operational requirements. Soldiers’ assessments during FOT&amp;E highlighted the MCWS’s increased lethality, accuracy, and ease of use, reinforcing the system’s readiness for deployment. This comprehensive testing has paved the way for the system’s integration into active SBCT units.

France and United Arab Emirates in Talks for Joint Financing of Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development	According to the French newspaper La Tribune on October 16, 2024, France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are engaged in discussions on joint financing for the development of the future Rafale F5 fighter jet standard. This potential partnership, initiated within the informal framework of the 'Rafale Club,' would allow the UAE to participate in the evolution of the French fighter, thus strengthening the strategic bond between the two nations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development Program (Picture source: French MoD) The military relationship between France and the UAE has deepened over the decades, based on strategic cooperation and mutual trust that extend far beyond arms contracts. This alliance is notably illustrated by the permanent presence of French forces in the UAE since 2009, symbolizing a partnership that spans training, intelligence, and joint operations. The UAE has become a major partner for France in the Gulf region, supported by large-scale military contracts, such as the 2021 agreement for the purchase of 80 Rafale F4 aircraft, valued at more than €16 billion—the largest arms export contract in French history. Abu Dhabi would benefit from direct involvement in future innovations of the aircraft, also providing financial relief for the French Ministry of Armed Forces in a context of budgetary constraints. France’s Ministry of Armed Forces recently announced the start of Rafale F5 development without disclosing the details of these advanced discussions with the UAE. This co-financing would cover only non-sovereign elements of the Rafale, leaving France with exclusive control over critical components. In return for this cooperation, the UAE is considering an additional order of 20 Rafales, complementing the 80 aircraft acquired in 2021 under a historic contract, including Mica NG and Black Shaheen missiles. Led by the General Directorate of Armament (DGA), the Rafale program aims to launch the F5 standard in the next decade. This new version introduces significant advancements in connectivity and data processing to enhance the operational capabilities of client air forces. This upgrade will include a new radar, a state-of-the-art electronic warfare system, advanced optronic sensors, and the integration of the ASN4G missile for French forces. Additionally, the Rafale F5 will be supported by a stealth combat drone inspired by the Neuron demonstrator, designed to assist the aircraft in penetrating enemy defenses. This companion drone, a key feature of the F5 standard, will be engineered for maximum stealth and advanced connectivity, allowing operations over extended ranges thanks to aerial refueling. Its mission, enhanced by native integration of artificial intelligence, will enable direct collaboration with the Rafale in adaptive combat strategies, providing a foundational component of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This potential partnership with the UAE arises as France seeks to optimize its defense budget for the 2024–2030 period, with a €413 billion military programming budget. In 2023, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu discussed the possibility of Rafale Club members contributing to development costs while ensuring sovereignty over critical components. This shared financing would also strengthen France’s relations with Rafale clients, while maintaining national control over sensitive elements. Expected by 2030, the Rafale F5 fighter jet will succeed the F4 standard, addressing modern threats for both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence missions within the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS). It represents a new generation of connected fighters, integrating interoperable systems with other ground and aerial platforms. For the UAE, this project represents not only a military upgrade but also an extension of their cooperation with France in defense, consolidating their position as one of France's privileged allies. The UAE Armed Forces are among the best-trained and most capable among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. While Iran remains a major strategic concern, partly due to an ongoing dispute over islands in the Strait of Hormuz, the UAE has shown an increasing capacity to project influence and engage militarily beyond its borders. Their involvement in conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as their crucial role in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, has reinforced their experience and strategic approach to managing military risks. This orientation towards international engagement is supported by foreign bases, including a French base and a South Korean contingent, as well as diversified defense relations, particularly with Israel, Turkey, and China, while maintaining a primary partnership with the United States. According to Military Balance 2024, the UAE’s air fleet reflects these ambitions, with an advanced inventory of 148 combat aircraft sourced from American and European suppliers. The fleet includes 54 F-16E Block 60 fighter jets and 24 F-16F Block 60 models, known as the Desert Falcon, along with 50 French-made Mirage 2000-9 fighter aircraft in various configurations, including DAD, EAD, and RAD models for reconnaissance missions.

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Derived from the Cougar Mk2 model, the Caracal meets the demands of combat search and rescue (CSAR), special operations, and tactical transport missions (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) This adjustment, implemented due to budget constraints and specific requirements of the special operations forces, aims to tailor each helicopter to the missions of the elite 300 Special Operations Squadron. This compromise allows for the replacement of the aging Cougar helicopters, in service since 1996, though the first Caracals are only expected to arrive by early 2030. Full fleet delivery is projected for 2032, two years behind the initially planned schedule. The H225M Caracal, originally known as the Eurocopter EC725, is a medium-sized, twin-engine military helicopter developed by Airbus Helicopters. Derived from the Cougar Mk2 model, the Caracal meets the demands of combat search and rescue (CSAR), special operations, and tactical transport missions. After its maiden flight in November 2000, it entered service with the French Air Force in 2005. Its versatility and advanced avionics have since made it popular with military forces worldwide, including in Brazil, Malaysia, and Singapore. The H225M Caracal can carry up to 29 soldiers or a combination of personnel and cargo, with a total payload capacity of up to 4,750 kg for underslung loads. Inspired by the Cougar family, it incorporates several enhancements, such as a five-blade main rotor and a reinforced transmission gearbox, which increase its payload capacity, range, and speed. Powered by two Safran Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines, each delivering 2,382 horsepower, the helicopter reaches a maximum speed of 324 km/h. It has a range of around 1,200 kilometers with additional fuel tanks and can operate at altitudes up to 6,095 meters (20,000 feet), making it suitable for high-altitude missions. The cabin can be configured for various missions, including medical evacuations, with space to accommodate up to 11 stretchers. Equipped with advanced avionics, the H225M Caracal features a digital cockpit with multifunction displays, a digital map, and an autopilot system that eases pilot workload and supports operations in challenging environments.

The H225M’s survivability is enhanced by a radar warning receiver, missile approach warning system, laser warning receiver, and chaff/flare dispensers. (Picture source: Army Recognition) According to the Ministry of Defence, the decision to reduce the order was necessary to remain within the allocated budget, which ranges between 1 and 2.5 billion euros. Customization and adaptation costs for the Caracal to meet the unique demands of special operations have been higher than anticipated. This adjustment, communicated to Dutch parliament members, shows the need for various contracts to equip the helicopter with advanced mission systems. Although Airbus Helicopters remains the program’s primary contractor, the Dutch Defence Ministry also plans complementary contracts to equip nine of the helicopters with specific capabilities. Among the selected suppliers, Israel’s Elbit Systems will provide a proven self-protection suite already installed on the Gulfstream G650ER and future C390M transport aircraft for Dutch Defence. This suite will enhance the Caracal’s survivability against modern threats. Additionally, radio equipment from the American group L3 Harris will be integrated through the Foxtrot program, ensuring secure communications and improved interoperability with allied forces. Airbus Helicopters, in partnership with the Netherlands and Germany, is also developing a new mission computer to centralize all data flows in a single display, facilitating real-time decision-making. The acquisition of these helicopters includes infrastructure and training programs. Next-generation simulators will be implemented through a separate program starting next year, aiming to increase training hours from 700 for the current Cougar fleet to between 2,000 and 3,000 for the Caracal, preserving the aircraft while enhancing pilot and operator readiness for critical missions. This adjustment will impact the operational capacity of the 300 Special Operations Squadron. While the initial plan anticipated the ability to conduct two simultaneous missions over six months, the current configuration limits capacity to one long-term mission, with a second short-term mission possible if needed. This change reflects Defence’s intent to maximize capabilities within budget constraints, taking into account rising integration costs and logistical challenges. Anticipated delivery delays also stem from technical challenges associated with integrating numerous mission systems and high demand on Caracal’s production lines internationally. The Dutch Ministry of Defence acknowledges that further delays cannot be ruled out, though contractual safeguards aim to minimize this risk. In the worst case, an extension of the Cougar helicopters’ operational life may be considered to offset scheduling delays. With the acquisition’s preparatory phase now complete, a final agreement with Airbus Helicopters is expected next month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/netherlands-confirms-a-reduced-order-of-h225m-caracal-helicopters-for-special-forces	2024-10-17T06:13:43-07:00

The trials mark significant progress in developing Ukraine's naval capabilities, which are particularly focused on securing coastal waters and conducting multipurpose operations in the Black Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/ukrainian-corvette-hetman-ivan-mazepa-successfully-tests-helicopter-operations-with-sh-60-seahawk	2024-10-17T05:01:18-07:00	
Armenia Could Be First Country to Acquire India's Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile	On October 16, 2024, News.Az reported that the Indian Ministry of Defense authorized the export of Pralay quasi-ballistic missiles to Armenia, marking an important step in strengthening the defense partnership between India and Armenia. This decision, which has yet to receive official confirmation from the Armenian Ministry of Defense, reflects India's intent to conclude an agreement aimed at bolstering Armenia’s defensive capabilities in a context of regional tensions. According to Alpha Defense, this potential agreement is at an advanced stage, with sources indicating that India is actively negotiating to finalize it in the near future.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link India Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Pralay missile, developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), is an advanced short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile, primarily designed for tactical use in combat conditions. Launched in 2015, the Pralay program represents a strategic advancement for India’s missile arsenal, incorporating sophisticated quasi-ballistic trajectory adjustments that allow the missile to evade interceptors and anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses. The missile has already successfully completed several tests, with the first two conducted in December 2021 and a third in November 2023, each demonstrating the missile’s accuracy, payload capacity, and terminal maneuverability. The Pralay's unique quasi-ballistic trajectory enables it to shift from a traditional ballistic path to a flatter trajectory after launch, making interception more difficult by reducing its radar profile. This feature, combined with high speed and terminal maneuverability, brings the Pralay closer to the Russian Iskander-M missile, which has proven effective in recent conflicts, notably in Ukraine. The Pralay shares characteristics with the Iskander-M, such as a CEP (Circular Error Probable) of around 10 meters, highlighting its high accuracy and ability to evade air defenses. India and Russia have long-standing collaboration in missile technology, a partnership that has significantly shaped India's missile capabilities. One of the most notable outcomes of this cooperation is the BrahMos missile, developed jointly by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyenia. Launched as the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, the BrahMos demonstrates both high speed and precision, making it a valuable asset in India’s arsenal. This collaboration has allowed India to integrate Russian expertise in propulsion and guidance systems with its own indigenous technological advancements, setting a foundation for India's development of future missile systems. Russia’s involvement in India’s missile program has also extended through technology transfers and support in ballistic missile defense research, further strengthening India's defense capabilities and boosting its strategic autonomy in missile production. To comply with international arms control regulations, India has committed to limiting export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 kilometers and a payload capacity not exceeding 500 kilograms. This adherence to missile technology control guidelines requires technical modifications to the Pralay system, an adaptation that India is actively pursuing. Powered by a solid-fuel motor and integrating maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MaRV) technology, the missile can carry payloads ranging from high-explosive fragmentation warheads to runway denial submunitions. These capabilities enable it to effectively target and neutralize critical military infrastructure such as radar installations, command centers, and forward airstrips, with enhanced precision and lethality. Armenia’s interest in acquiring the Pralay missile stems from its need to counterbalance the capabilities acquired by Azerbaijan through its purchase of LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missiles developed by Israel Aerospace Industries. With a range of 400 kilometers and a CEP of 10 meters, the LORA missile represents a significant threat to Armenia’s strategic assets. The Pralay’s compatibility with various warhead types and its advanced guidance system, using both inertial navigation and a DSMAC (Digital Scene-Matching Area Correlation) seeker for increased accuracy, provide Armenia with an adequate response to Azerbaijan’s missile capabilities. A distinctive feature of the Pralay is its fused silica radar dome (RADOME), which enhances its evasion capabilities and survivability in hostile airspace. The jet vane thrust vector control system allows the Pralay to perform evasive maneuvers in the terminal phase, effectively countering enemy defense systems. Additionally, the Pralay includes two sets of small fins that help reduce its radar signature, further complicating interception efforts. The Indian Pralay missile and the Israeli LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missile are two quasi-ballistic systems with short to medium range, but their performances and capabilities differ in several aspects. The Pralay has a theoretical range between 150 and 500 km, with a payload capacity ranging from 350 kg to 700 kg, allowing it to target strategic installations such as radars, command centers, and airstrips. However, to comply with international arms control regulations, India has limited export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 km and a payload not exceeding 500 kg. This technical adaptation, necessary to adhere to missile technology control guidelines, ensures that exported versions meet international standards. The LORA, on the other hand, has a maximum range of 400 km and a payload capacity of approximately 570 kg. This missile was operationally used by Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, demonstrating high accuracy with a CEP of 10 meters, particularly on targets such as bridges and critical infrastructure. Its guidance system, using GPS and TV imaging in the terminal phase, ensures high precision, although it remains potentially vulnerable to electronic countermeasures. Thus, the Pralay prioritizes better terminal maneuverability to evade interceptions, while the LORA stands out for its extreme precision in targeted strikes, with each featuring specific adaptations according to their usage contexts and regulatory requirements. The Indian armed forces have shown strategic interest in the Pralay missile, with substantial orders from both the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. In 2022, the Indian Ministry of Defense approved the purchase of 120 missiles for the Air Force, followed in 2023 by the acquisition of a regiment of 250 missiles for the Army, intended to strengthen tactical capabilities along sensitive borders with China and Pakistan. If the agreement with Armenia is finalized, this country would become the first international buyer of the Pralay missile, marking a historic milestone in Indian defense exports. Defense relations between India and Armenia have considerably strengthened in recent years, illustrated by the transfer of sophisticated weaponry to meet Armenia's growing security needs in a tense regional context. In 2020, India sold Armenia four Swathi radars, capable of detecting and locating enemy artillery fire, as well as M982 Excalibur precision artillery shells, enhancing Armenia’s defensive and retaliatory capabilities. Armenia is also interested in ATAGS (Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System) howitzers developed by DRDO, which offer extended range and increased accuracy, with the capability to fire projectiles up to 48 km. The addition of ATAGS would strengthen Armenia's offensive capabilities, complementing its current arsenal. Additionally, the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, also developed by DRDO, has attracted significant interest from Armenia. Capable of launching a salvo of twelve rockets in less than 45 seconds and reaching a range of 40 to 75 km depending on the variant, the Pinaka would provide mobile and versatile firepower, ideal for saturation strikes and ground support missions. Integrating the Pinaka would further strengthen Armenia's tactical options, while consolidating India as a key partner in defense.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/armenia-could-be-first-country-to-acquire-indias-home-made-pralay-quasi-ballistic-missile	2024-10-17T04:52:13-07:00

UK maintains Challenger 3 Tank schedule toward 2030 full capability	As reported by the UK Defence Journal on October 11, 2024, the British Ministry of Defence has confirmed the continued progress of the Challenger 3 main battle tank program, in response to questions from Danny Kruger, MP for East Wiltshire, regarding the review's potential impacts on the program and recent discussions with the Army Board. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Luke Pollard clarified that the Challenger 3 is set to achieve Initial Operating Capability by 2027, with Full Operating Capability expected by 2030.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Pollard noted that the Strategic Defence Review aims to align future capability development with the UK’s security needs. As part of this process, the Ministry will provide regular updates to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Secretary of State for Defence, with a comprehensive final report anticipated by mid-2025. This review is intended to ensure that the UK’s defense infrastructure supports both current and future requirements. The Challenger 3, developed by the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL), represents an upgrade of the existing Challenger 2 tanks rather than the deployment of entirely new vehicles. The program evolved from the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme (LEP), designed to improve mobility, lethality, and survivability for continued use through the 2030s. The primary modification in the Challenger 3 is the integration of a new turret with a 120mm L55A1 smoothbore gun, replacing the previous L30A1 rifled gun. This modification aligns with NATO standards, improving interoperability, although it requires a new kinetic energy round to be developed in collaboration with Germany, as the smoothbore system is incompatible with current Challenger 2 ammunition. Initial deliveries of pre-production Challenger 3 tanks began in early 2024, with live-firing trials starting in Germany in April. The British Army is scheduled to receive a total of 148 tanks, with the first units entering service in 2025. The project’s estimated cost is approximately $1.17 billion, and it is expected to support around 300 jobs at RBSL’s Telford facility, with an additional 450 positions across the UK defense supply chain.

The tank also features upgraded targeting systems for the commander and gunner, including advanced thermal imaging. While the adoption of the smoothbore gun introduces an ammunition compatibility issue, the Ministry of Defence has partnered with German defense companies to develop a new Enhanced Kinetic Energy (EKE) round, suitable for both the Challenger 3 and the Leopard 2 tanks. The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. The Challenger 3 continues this progression with modular armor upgrades and enhanced survivability features, including Active Protection Systems (APS). Previous trials on the Challenger 2 tested APS such as the Rheinmetall ROSY Rapid Obscurant System and the MUSS system, providing a basis for their integration into the Challenger 3. Additionally, the Challenger 3 is powered by a Perkins CV12-9A 26.1-liter V12 diesel engine, delivering 1,500 bhp, and utilizes a David Brown Santasalo TN54E transmission system with updated components. The development of the Challenger 3 reflects the UK's approach to modernizing its existing tank fleet rather than procuring new models from other countries. In a 2021 report, the Defence Select Committee noted challenges in the LEP, including budget overruns and delays. Later that year, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would upgrade 148 Challenger 2 tanks into Challenger 3 models through a contract with RBSL valued at £800 million. This contract solidified the selection of Rheinmetall’s upgrade proposal, which includes the 120mm smoothbore gun. Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system.

US Global Strike Command's B-2 Bombers return to combat for first time since 2017 against Houthis in Yemen	On October 16, 2024, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) carried out a series of precision airstrikes on underground weapons storage facilities in areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-backed Houthi forces, marking the first combat use of the B-2 stealth bombers since 2017. These facilities housed conventional weapons used by the Houthis in attacks on U.S. and international vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. (Picture source: US DoD) According to the US Central Command, the strikes aimed to limit the Houthis' ability to target maritime traffic in this strategically significant region, which affects both commercial shipping and regional stability. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that the operation, which included various U.S. Air Force and Navy assets, focused on five fortified underground storage locations within Yemen, housing missiles, weapons components, and munitions. According to OSINTdefender, the mission involved B-2 bombers from the 13th Bomb Squadron of the 509th Bomb Wing, part of the US Air Force's Global Strike Command, and the 131st Bomb Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard, flying from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. These bombers were equipped with 2,000-pound Mark-84 bombs modified with Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits for precision targeting of these deeply buried sites. Each B-2 is designed to carry up to 20 tons of bombs, providing significant strike capability at long ranges. The Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel reported airstrikes near Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and in the stronghold of Saada, though they provided no immediate details on damage or casualties. CENTCOM stated that initial assessments suggested no civilian casualties. The Houthis have used underground facilities in these areas, including tunnels originally constructed to store Scud missiles. These tunnels were reportedly expanded to accommodate the group's weapons storage, further complicating efforts to disrupt their capabilities. The B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. strikes were also seen as a signal to Iran, a supporter of the Houthi movement. In recent years, Iran has conducted missile attacks against Israel, and the B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. The Houthis have continued to attack merchant vessels in the Red Sea since October 2023, and CENTCOM’s strikes align with efforts to secure these waters against further disruptions to commercial shipping. The Houthis claim their attacks target vessels linked to Israel, the U.S., and the U.K., citing these countries' involvement in the Gaza conflict, although some targeted vessels have not been directly connected to the conflict. Additionally, Houthi attacks have seized one vessel, sunk two others, and led to the deaths of four sailors, prompting ongoing concerns about the group’s impact on maritime security. The Northrop B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy strategic bomber developed under the Advanced Technology Bomber program in the late 1970s. Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. Originally intended to replace the Mach 2-capable B-1A, the B-2 program faced significant delays and rising costs, leading to extensive debate in Congress. The B-2 can carry up to 18,000 kg of ordnance, including conventional and nuclear payloads, and has a maximum unrefueled range of 11,000 km, with a service ceiling of 15,000 m. (Picture source: US DoD) Ultimately, the planned production was reduced from 132 units to 21, reflecting changing strategic priorities after the Cold War. Entering service in 1997, the B-2 made its combat debut during the Kosovo War in 1999 and has since been deployed in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The B-2’s flying wing design, which lacks both a fuselage and tail, contributes to a reduced radar cross-section and increased aerodynamic efficiency, enabling extended range operations. The aircraft’s structure includes radar-absorbing materials and advanced flight controls for stability, allowing a two-person crew to operate the bomber. Maneuverability is achieved through a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust, supporting the aircraft’s low radar profile. The B-2 is equipped with the AN/APQ-181 radar, which provides multi-mode functionality to support navigation and target acquisition. During the RIMPAC 2024 exercise, the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit bomber also employed the QUICKSINK maritime strike capability, designed to sink surface vessels with modified JDAM precision-guided bombs, marking the first publicly reported test of this system. Conducted during the second SINKEX exercise, the test demonstrated the B-2’s capability in maritime strike roles. Developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, QUICKSINK converts JDAMs into precision-guided bombs equipped with GPS-assisted INS guidance, a radar seeker, and an Imaging Infrared camera, allowing them to target moving maritime threats. Ongoing modernization programs for the B-2, supported by a recent $7 billion contract with Northrop Grumman, focus on enhancing defensive and communication systems to address emerging threats, including cyber risks.

Textron Creates Next-Gen XM204 Top Attack Mine System for Tactical Obstacles Against Tanks	At the AUSA 2024 exhibition, held from October 9 to 11 in Washington, D.C., the American company Textron is presenting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) System, a new type of system developed under the U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program to block enemy armored vehicles by deploying mines. Equipped with autonomous sensors, the XM204 TA can launch mines to create complex tactical obstacles, combining top and bottom attacks. Its mobility could be further enhanced through drone transport, as demonstrated at the event.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Textron XM204 Top Attack Mine System could be further enhanced through drone transport (Picture source: Army Recognition) Textron’s XM204 Top Attack (TA) system marks a significant advancement in terrain-shaping obstacle technology, designed to meet the U.S. Army’s temporary requirements for top-attack anti-vehicle capabilities, specifically to support U.S. Army Europe Command (USAREUR). Used as a standalone solution or in conjunction with other systems, it enables the creation of complex obstacles by combining top and bottom attacks, especially when deployed alongside the XM343 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) system. The operational concept of the XM204 TA involves several steps: once manually armed, the system activates its ground sensors and submunitions to autonomously detect, track, and engage multiple vehicle targets. Its detection and tracking process relies on seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors, paired with an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead for top attack, maximizing its effectiveness against weaker vehicle armor. The operational stages include target detection, submunition deployment, engagement area scanning, target confirmation, EFP charge activation, and, ultimately, target destruction. The U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program aims to develop and deploy defense systems that create tactical obstacles to slow down, divert, or immobilize enemy armored vehicles on the battlefield. These obstacles, which include technologies such as the XM204 Top Attack (TA) system, are designed to be autonomous and used in diverse operational scenarios to enhance the combat brigades' counter-mobility capabilities. The TSO allows forces to create temporary yet effective barriers that exploit specific terrain areas to block the advance of enemy armored formations, particularly in open and sparsely vegetated environments. The XM204 Top Attack (TA) is an autonomous anti-vehicle system designed to attack armored vehicles from above, targeting their vulnerability in the upper armor. After being manually activated by a soldier, the XM204 uses a combination of seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors to detect, track, and identify enemy vehicles within a 100-meter radius. When a target is confirmed, the system deploys submunitions equipped with explosively formed penetrator (EFP) charges to engage and neutralize the vehicle. The EFP detonates either above or near the target, maximizing the damage to render the vehicle inoperable. Designed to function autonomously after activation, the XM204 is resistant to active protection systems, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and deactivation attempts. It is also equipped with programmable self-destruct timers (4 hours, 48 hours, or 15 days), ensuring the area’s safety after engagement. This system thus allows the creation of effective obstacles against armored vehicles in strategic zones without requiring continuous monitoring. The XM204 TA features a 'Zone of Authority' (ZOA) with a 100-meter diameter, providing extensive engagement area coverage. It is designed to resist active protection systems, smoke, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and mechanical deactivation attempts, making it a robust counter-mobility tool suitable for varied terrains and conditions. The system is also recoverable, reusable, and equipped with visual safety indicators to alert on its arming status. The XM204 can be deployed quickly by hand and is resistant to unauthorized handling. It also offers three manually programmable self-destruct durations—four hours, forty-eight hours, or fifteen days—to meet specific mission requirements in the field. This system will be fielded for the first time in the U.S. Army during the 2025 fiscal year, thus meeting the Army’s modernization priorities, including long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, and soldier lethality. Mounting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) on a drone would provide significant strategic advantages by increasing its range, mobility, and flexibility on the battlefield. While the system is currently limited to manual and ground-based deployments, integration on a drone would enable the XM204 to be transported over long distances, precisely positioned in hard-to-reach or hazardous areas, and used to create anti-vehicle obstacles in regions where ground forces cannot safely intervene. Additionally, the drone could relocate or reposition the XM204 based on enemy movements, optimizing its autonomous multi-target engagement capability through its advanced seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors. This combination with a drone would transform the XM204 into a dynamic, responsive defense system capable of creating mobile obstacles and adapting to the evolving needs of a modern combat environment. Several stakeholders are involved in the development of this system, including the Project Manager Close Combat Systems (PM CCS) within the Joint Program Executive Office for Armaments and Ammunition, in collaboration with Textron Defense Systems and centers of excellence such as the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence. The Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center also provides critical functions within the program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/textron-creates-next-gen-xm204-top-attack-mine-system-for-tactical-obstacles-against-tanks	2024-10-16T03:28:09-07:00

What’s new in Canada’s upgraded Leopard 2A6MC2 Main Battle Tank?	As noted by Jeff2146 on October 15, 2024, the German television network ARD 1 recently aired footage believed to show the first public appearance of Canada’s Leopard 2A6M C2 tanks during a tour of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) facilities. The Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN is an upgraded Canadian variant of the German Leopard 2A6 main battle tank, created by converting 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks under a $76 million contract with KMW. This overhaul includes upgrades to optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces, replacing outdated analog technology with modern components to improve their operational lifespan.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN overhaul includes upgrades to optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces, replacing outdated analog technology with modern components to improve the operational lifespan of the Leopard 2A6M CAN. (Picture source: ARD 1) In February 2023, Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand stated that Canada plans to replace the Leopard 2 tanks sent to Ukraine, though specific timelines for these acquisitions have not been disclosed. Meanwhile, Canada is preparing to upgrade its remaining Leopard 2 tanks through a Leopard Long Term Support Contract (LTSC), which aims to keep the fleet operational until 2035. Department of National Defence spokesperson Jessica Lamirande explained that the LTSC will include maintenance, upgrades, supply chain management, and technical support. At that time, the contract was estimated between $730 million and $1.09 billion, or approximately $44 million to $64 million per year. Canada released an Advanced Contract Award Notice in August 2022, awarding KMW a sole-source position for the LTSC, with a formal contract published on September 13, 2024, valued at $710,732,013.98. The LTSC encompasses various Leopard 2 models within Canada’s military, including main battle tanks like the 2A4 CAN, 2A4M CAN, 2A6M CAN, and 2A6M C2 CAN, as well as Leopard 2 ARV CAN armored recovery vehicles, Leopard 2 AEV CAN engineering vehicles, and specialized equipment such as the Mine Clearing Roller System (MCRS), Track Width Mine Plow (TWMP), dozer blades, add-on armor, and slat armor. Canada is preparing to upgrade its remaining Leopard 2 tanks through a Leopard Long Term Support Contract (LTSC), which aims to keep the fleet operational until 2035. (Picture source: ARD 1) Maintenance responsibilities will involve systems integration, engineering, configuration and obsolescence management, depot-level inspections, and spare parts supply. The contract also specifies the provision of technical and field service representatives, who will provide in-depth support and guidance for the maintenance processes. Additionally, Canada awarded KMW a separate contract worth $76 million in June 2022 to repair, overhaul, and convert 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks to align with the 2A4M configuration. The modifications include updating optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces with more modern components, as the existing analog technology is considered obsolete. According to available information, the first conversion was completed and accepted by Canada in 2022, establishing a reference model for the rest of the fleet. Conversion work on the remaining 19 tanks began at FFG Canada’s Bathurst facility in spring 2023, with completion expected by the end of 2025. These upgraded tanks will be designated as Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN. The LTSC encompasses various Leopard 2 models within Canada’s military, including main battle tanks like the 2A4 CAN, 2A4M CAN, 2A6M CAN, and 2A6M C2 CAN, as well as Leopard 2 ARV CAN armored recovery vehicles and Leopard 2 AEV CAN engineering vehicles. (Picture source: ARD 1) As reported by Army Recognition in October 2023, modernization efforts for the Leopard 2 fleet are under consideration, with Army Lt. Col. Chloeann Summerfield indicating that further upgrades will cost over $620 million. These enhancements may include improvements to protection, surveillance, target acquisition, firepower, and mobility. Canada expects to issue a request for industry bids by 2028, with the first upgraded tanks anticipated to be operational by 2030. This modernization aims to align Canadian Leopard 2 configurations with those of NATO allies to enhance interoperability. Financial considerations are a significant factor in the Canadian government’s plans for its tank fleet. Canada’s defense budget is already allocated toward major projects, such as the procurement of F-35 fighter jets, surface combatant ships, and P-8 patrol aircraft, limiting available funds for new tank acquisitions. Although the government announced plans to replace the tanks sent to Ukraine, no further information has been released, and financial constraints may delay this process. Canadian defense analyst Martin Shadwick has highlighted that Canada’s approach to tanks has varied over time, noting that a 2003 decision to retire the Leopard fleet was reversed in favor of lighter vehicles, only to be reinstated when tanks were deployed in Afghanistan. The future of Canada’s tank fleet remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether Canada will acquire new tanks in the immediate future. To address maintenance needs, Canada has increased the use of contracted Field Service Representatives (FSRs) from KMW since 2018, allowing for specialized technician support at Army facilities across the country. Additionally, adjustments to the training and management of Canadian technicians are intended to strengthen maintenance capabilities and ensure sufficient technical support during periods of increased demand. The Canadian Army has emphasized that these changes are part of broader efforts to maintain the operational readiness of the Leopard 2 fleet, with the LTSC anticipated to play a critical role in sustaining the tanks until their projected end-of-service date in 2035. The Leopard 2A6M CAN C2 seems to retain the weaponry of the Leopard 2A6M CAN, which is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun and two 7.62mm machine guns. (Picture source: ARD 1) Currently, Canada operates 74 Leopard 2 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) in three main variants: 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. Additionally, 52 older Leopard 1C2 tanks remain in storage. In addition to these tanks, the Canadian Army has around 30 recovery and engineering vehicles, including 5 Buffalo Armoured Engineering Vehicles (AEVs) and 18 Wisent 2 vehicles, as well as 12 BPz-3 Büffel Armoured Recovery Vehicles (ARVs). With 8 tanks donated to Ukraine and 15 Leopard 2A4 tanks now deployed to Eastern Europe as part of NATO’s bolstered presence since the onset of the Ukraine conflict, questions have arisen about the readiness and condition of Canada’s remaining tanks. National Defence spokesperson Dan Le Bouthillier emphasized that Leopard 2 tanks, like other heavy vehicles, require extensive maintenance and inspections. On average, these tanks spend about 30% of their time in maintenance, which includes scheduled inspections. In response to reports that Canada was allegedly cannibalizing certain tanks to maintain others, Le Bouthillier clarified that such practices are only permitted under specific and urgent circumstances, with authorization from local commanders. He noted that no Leopard 2 tanks have been permanently decommissioned to support other units. Canada's defense policy contends with limited defense spending and a complex security environment. In 2023, the defense budget was about 1.38% of GDP, below NATO’s 2% target. However, Canada ranks seventh in NATO for absolute defense spending, with some modest increases in outlays planned. Plans include doubling its NATO Enhanced Presence Battlegroup in Latvia by 2026 and committing more than $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine, along with continuing training under Operation Unifier. Currently, Canada operates 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. (Picture source: Canadian MoD) The Leopard 2A6M CAN is a Canadian version of the German Leopard 2A6 main battle tank, deployed in 2007 to address operational needs in Afghanistan. Canada initially assessed its Leopard C2 tanks but determined that they were insufficient for the region's conditions, particularly due to a lack of air conditioning, which impacted crew performance. Consequently, Canada arranged for the German Bundeswehr to loan twenty Leopard 2A6 tanks, which were then modified by KMW to include mine protection and other adjustments to meet Canadian Army requirements. This deployment aimed to enhance vehicle protection and provide a more suitable platform for Canadian forces in Afghanistan's demanding operational environment. The Leopard 2A6M CAN includes several modifications unique to this variant. Enhancements consist of a mine protection package to reinforce the tank's underside, specific communications and anti-IED jamming equipment mounted on the turret, and stand-off slat armor for additional defense. An air conditioning unit and cooling vests were later added to reduce heat strain on the crew, alongside Saab Barracuda camouflage mats to decrease heat absorption by 50 percent. The initial twenty tanks were on loan from Germany, configured with MG3 machine guns, while subsequent tanks, procured from the Netherlands, were integrated with C6 GPMGs for consistency with Canadian forces. Upon returning to Canada in 2011, features like ECM boxes and slat armor were removed, yet the Canadian Army retained and continues to modify these tanks. In terms of specifications, the Leopard 2A6M CAN is equipped with a 1,500-horsepower MTU diesel engine and RENK transmission, enabling a top speed of 68 km/h and a range of 550 km on roads. It is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun, with a wide range of elevation, and two 7.62mm machine guns. The tank, weighing 62.3 tons in combat, can traverse obstacles up to 1.1 meters high and 3 meters wide. Other features include modular and composite armor, NBC protection, and options for additional modular armor. These characteristics contribute to the tank’s operational capabilities in various combat scenarios.

On September 12, 2024, Yoav Turgeman, CEO of Rafael, confirmed that the Iron Beam would be deployed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2025. This laser system will integrate with the Iron Dome, allowing coordination between missile interceptors and the laser-based system. According to Rafael, the Iron Beam can direct up to 100 kilowatts of laser power at aerial targets, destroying them in seconds. The effective range of the system, which can handle short- and medium-range threats, is up to 7 kilometers, depending on weather conditions and the type of target. The system has undergone tests, including those conducted by the IDF in 2022, demonstrating its ability to intercept drones, mortar bombs, and missiles. One notable aspect of the Iron Beam system is its lower cost per interception compared to traditional missile systems. Each use of the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, significantly less than the $40,000 to $50,000 per interception for the Tamir missiles used in the Iron Dome. The system also has an unlimited firing capacity, requiring no reloads, and reduces the potential for collateral damage by not producing debris from intercepted threats. This is particularly relevant in light of ongoing military engagements, where Israel has faced a shortage of Iron Dome missiles, and the economic impact of the Gaza conflict has exceeded $67.3 billion, according to Israeli economists. Each use of the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, significantly less than the $40,000 to $50,000 per interception for the Tamir missiles used in the Iron Dome. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Turgeman also highlighted the effectiveness of Rafael's Python 4 and Python 5 missiles, which have countered drones and cruise missiles during recent Iranian attacks. While the Python 4 missile has been in service for several decades, Rafael continues to develop the 'Skysonic' system, aimed at providing hypersonic interception capabilities. Rafael has been working on directed-energy systems for over 30 years. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, it is developing an enhanced version of the Iron Beam, which could achieve power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously. This development is funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. At AUSA 2024, Rafael confirmed that the 100kW version is entering production, with fielding expected by the end of next year. The Iron Beam, also known as 'Magen Or' or 'Shield of Light,' was first revealed at the Singapore Airshow in 2014. The system uses fiber laser technology to intercept various aerial threats, including short-range rockets, artillery, mortar bombs, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It can function as a stand-alone system or as part of a larger air defense network.

US Navy Demonstrates New At-Sea Missile Reloading System for Warships	According to information published by the US DoD on 7, October, 2024, the Navy showcased a groundbreaking rearming system designed to reload warships at sea, in a recent demonstration at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Sailors from the Navy and USS Chosin (CG 65) demonstrate reloading a MK 41 Vertical Launching System cell. (Picture source: DVIDS) The event featured the Transferrable Rearming Mechanism (TRM), which successfully transferred a missile canister along cables to simulate the reloading of a ship’s MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) cell. This demonstration involved sailors from the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group and crew members from the USS Chosin (CG 65). The TRM allows for at-sea replenishment of munitions, potentially reducing the time a warship would need to spend in port for resupply. Comments This capability enhances both strategic and tactical flexibility. Strategically, the Navy can maintain a forward presence without frequent interruptions for resupply, keeping vessels on station longer and increasing mission endurance. Tactically, the ability to rearm during operations enables quicker adaptation to evolving threat environments. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where maintaining a constant missile loadout is critical, such as anti-air warfare, missile defense, and strike operations. From an operational standpoint, the TRM could significantly reduce dependency on fixed supply chains, allowing task forces to operate further from logistical bases. This reduces vulnerabilities, as adversaries may target supply hubs or transit routes in an effort to limit naval power projection. In contested regions, where port access might be constrained, the TRM provides a degree of independence from shore-based infrastructure, improving the Navy's ability to operate in hostile environments. However, the implementation of at-sea rearming will require adjustments. First, the technical and procedural aspects of using such a system in real-world conditions, especially during combat or high-threat scenarios, need to be thoroughly validated. Safety and efficiency concerns in transferring heavy missile canisters across cables in potentially rough seas will also require attention. Training sailors to operate the system effectively and integrating it into existing replenishment doctrines will be key to realizing its potential. In terms of broader strategic implications, the TRM contributes to the concept of distributed maritime operations (DMO). By decentralizing logistical capabilities, the Navy can distribute forces more widely across a theater.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-demonstrates-new-at-sea-missile-reloading-system-for-warships	2024-10-14T05:07:21-07:00

(Picture source: US DoD) Prior to this, only the US Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 operated F-35 aircraft at the station, focusing on core introduction and fighter/attack training for new F-35 pilots. VMFA-533, known as 'America’s Squadron' for its red, white, and blue insignia, has a history that dates back to 1943. It was initially commissioned as Marine Night Fighter Squadron 533 (VMF[N]-533) and has operated various aircraft over the decades, including the F6F Hellcat, F7F Tigercat, F2H Banshee, F9F Cougar, and A-4 Skyhawk. In 1965, the squadron transitioned to the A-6 Intruder and was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron 533 (VMA-533). In 1992, it converted to the F/A-18 Hornet, remaining an F/A-18 unit for 31 years until its redesignation to VMFA-533 in September 2023. Since then, the squadron has completed preparations for the F-35 transition, including achieving 'Safe for Flight' certification. The arrival of the F-35B to VMFA-533 initiates deliveries to MCAS Beaufort’s operational squadrons and continues the 2nd MAW’s transition from legacy fixed-wing tactical aircraft to the F-35 platform. The F-35 Lightning II, developed by Lockheed Martin as part of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program starting in 1995, aimed to create a versatile stealth fighter to replace multiple aging aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the A-10 Thunderbolt II, the F/A-18 Hornet, and the AV-8B Harrier II. Lockheed Martin's X-35 was chosen over Boeing's X-32 in 2001, leading to the creation of three variants: the F-35A is the Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variant, featuring an internal cannon and optimized for maneuverability. The F-35B is the Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) version, with a unique lift fan for vertical flight capabilities. Lastly, the F-35C, the Carrier Variant (CV), is built for catapult launches and arrested landings on aircraft carriers, with larger wings for better low-speed control and the longest range among the three models. The F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft was developed to replace aging vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft such as the AV-8B Harrier II. (Picture source: USMC) In the US armed forces, the F-35A variant is operated by the United States Air Force, with 1,763 planned units. It is currently based at multiple locations, including Moody AFB, Eglin AFB, and Hill AFB, among others. Key wings include the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill AFB, the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, and units across the Air Education and Training Command. The Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard also host squadrons at various bases, supporting both training and operational missions globally. The F-35B is operated by the United States Marine Corps, with 340 aircraft planned. The Marine Corps utilizes this variant at installations like Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni in Japan, MCAS Yuma in Arizona, and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina. Notable Marine Fighter Attack Squadrons (VMFAs) include VMFA-121, VMFA-242, and VMFA-211, which are deployed on amphibious assault ships and forward bases, providing flexibility for rapid deployment in varied combat environments. The F-35C is the carrier-capable variant designed for the United States Navy and Marine Corps, with 260 Navy and 80 Marine Corps aircraft planned. The Navy operates F-35Cs from NAS Lemoore in California, with squadrons such as VFA-97, VFA-115, and VFA-125, while Marine Corps squadrons like VMFA-311 and VMFA-314 are based at MCAS Miramar. This variant is built for catapult launches and arrested landings on aircraft carriers, featuring larger wings for improved low-speed control and the longest range among the three variants, enhancing the Navy's capabilities for extended maritime operations. The F-35B is operated by the United States Marine Corps, with 340 aircraft planned. The Marine Corps utilizes this variant at installations like Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni in Japan, MCAS Yuma in Arizona, and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina. (Picture source: USMC) The F-35B, specifically, is the world’s first operational supersonic STOVL aircraft, capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings due to its integrated Rolls-Royce Lift System. This system includes a lift fan, drive shaft, and a Three-Bearing Swivel Module that allows for vectoring the engine’s thrust downwards for vertical flight. The F-35B can transition between conventional flight and STOVL mode, which is vital for operations from shorter runways or amphibious assault ships. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 27,300 kg and can perform vertical landings with a gross weight limit of 18,415 kg. The F-35B has a wingspan of 10.7 meters, a length of 15.4 meters, and an internal fuel capacity of 6,045 kg, which is less compared to the F-35A and F-35C. Its range on internal fuel is approximately 900 nautical miles (1,670 km), and it has a combat radius of 469 nautical miles (845 km). The F-35B is equipped with advanced avionics such as the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), enhancing its situational awareness and target acquisition capabilities. The F-35B's internal weapons bay, which is slightly smaller than those of the other F-35 variants to accommodate the lift fan, can carry two AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles and two 1,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) or other compatible payloads while maintaining stealth. Additionally, it supports a variety of external weapon configurations, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder for air-to-air engagements, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and up to two 1,500-pound weapons on its outermost wing pylons. For close air support, the F-35B is fitted with an optional 25 mm GAU-22/A gun pod, mounted externally on the aircraft’s centerline. The F-35B is capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings due to its integrated Rolls-Royce Lift System, which includes a lift fan, drive shaft, and a Three-Bearing Swivel Module that allows for vectoring the engine’s thrust downwards for vertical flight. (Picture source: USMC) Initiated in 2019, the Block 4 upgrade for the F-35 introduces over 75 enhancements, marking the most significant modernization phase for the F-35 Lightning II to date. Specifically, it increases the fighter's missile carriage by incorporating systems like the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile and the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, expanding its combat reach and flexibility. The Block 4 suite also includes the AN/APG-85 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which provides enhanced detection capabilities, and upgrades to the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) for improved 360-degree situational awareness. These upgrades enable the F-35 to carry a wider range of precision-guided munitions, allowing it to engage both air and ground targets more effectively. Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3) serves as the backbone of Block 4, providing a major overhaul to the F-35’s computing and data-processing systems. At the heart of TR-3 is a new Integrated Core Processor (ICP) developed by Lockheed Martin, which offers over 25 times the processing power of its predecessor. This ICP is paired with a new Panoramic Cockpit Display and an enhanced Memory System, supporting advanced applications and enabling the integration of future technologies. TR-3 also introduces an open mission systems architecture, making the F-35 more adaptable to rapid updates and capable of hosting additional software-driven capabilities, such as advanced sensor fusion and AI-assisted targeting. The upgrade package is completed by the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) by Pratt &amp; Whitney, which addresses the cooling and thrust needs generated by the new Block 4 capabilities. The ECU provides increased bleed air (compressed air taken from the engine) required for the jet's enhanced electronic systems, while simultaneously boosting engine durability and fuel efficiency, allowing for an expected $40 billion in lifecycle cost savings. This enables the F-35 to operate at higher temperatures and power levels, optimizing the platform for sustained, high-intensity missions.

Iran Missile Strikes on Israel Reveal Limits of Ballistic Missile Threat in Modern Warfare	According to information published by Business Insider on October 12, 2024, Iran's recent missile strikes on Israel highlight a growing debate about the effectiveness of ballistic missiles in modern warfare. Despite their ability to deliver sudden, destructive blows, the real-world impact of these weapons appears to be less decisive than their reputation suggests.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crane clearing debris from Iranian missiles fired on Israel. (Picture source: Twitter account of Israel Defense Forces) In two high-profile attacks, Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, yet the results were underwhelming. In April, a barrage of 300 missiles and drones was largely intercepted by Israeli and allied defense systems, while a subsequent strike in October saw a higher percentage of missiles breaching defenses but causing minimal damage overall. While these attacks made headlines with their dramatic visuals—explosions, fiery streaks across the sky—the aftermath tells a different story. Critical infrastructure remains functional, public morale appears undeterred, and the Israeli military continues its operations. This mirrors the experience of Ukraine, which has endured repeated Russian missile attacks over two years without a collapse in its fighting capacity. Such resilience raises questions about whether the threat posed by ballistic missiles is overstated. Ballistic missiles have long been feared for their potential to strike without warning, following a high-arcing path before slamming into targets at high speed. This threat, dating back to World War II with Nazi Germany's V-2 rockets, has only grown as more countries—31 at present—develop their own missile capabilities. Yet, history shows that ballistic missiles, despite their lethality, rarely decide wars on their own. Whether in the 1980s Iran-Iraq conflict, the 2015 Houthi missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, or recent conflicts involving Israel and Ukraine, missile barrages have inflicted damage but failed to break the will of the targeted populations. Modern ballistic missiles are more accurate than their historical counterparts, aided by advanced guidance systems like GPS. Still, even high-tech missiles often miss precise targets, and the damage inflicted is often limited compared to the massive bombing raids of previous wars. In World War II, for example, Allied forces dropped millions of tons of bombs on Germany without compelling surrender, showing that even overwhelming firepower from the air has its limits. Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, reportedly numbering around 3,000, may seem formidable on paper, but in practice, even a simultaneous launch of all these weapons would face significant interception and accuracy issues. Furthermore, the damage caused by those that do get through would likely be less than a single large-scale bombing raid from the past. Ballistic missiles remain a potent symbol of military power, and their proliferation is a legitimate concern, especially if used to target infrastructure or as a means of political coercion. However, as Iran's attacks on Israel suggest, these weapons alone are unlikely to secure a decisive victory in war.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iran-missile-strikes-on-israel-reveal-limits-of-ballistic-missile-threat-in-modern-warfare	2024-10-14T03:10:16-07:00	
North Korea Attempts to Down South Korean Modern Drone with Old KS-19 Anti-Aircraft Guns	On October 13, 2024, according to Yonhap, North Korea ordered its artillery units, including eight brigades stationed near the South Korean border, to be on high alert and prepared to engage in response to alleged South Korean drone incursions over Pyongyang. North Korea’s General Staff directed these brigades, which reportedly include older KS-19 100mm anti-aircraft guns, to be fully armed and set in wartime configuration. Pyongyang accused South Korea of flying drones over its capital multiple times earlier in the month. In a statement, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry warned that any further incursions would be met with a military response, describing such actions as 'acts of war.'Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link South Korea RQ-101 Songgolmae fixed-wing UAV from Korea Aerospace Industries (Picture source: Wikimedia) Meanwhile, South Korea denied any airspace violations, condemning North Korea's recent use of propaganda balloons and waste-filled devices across the border, which South Korea views as provocations disrupting the security of its border regions. This exchange of accusations has intensified tensions along the Demilitarized Zone, with both countries expanding their military drone programs. While North Korea has made drone development a strategic priority, recently unveiling a suicide attack drone, South Korea is preparing to counter potential escalations with its own advancements in drone technology. The South Korean military employs a variety of High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE) drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, primarily to monitor North Korean military activities and potential security threats. These drones play a critical role in enhancing South Korea’s border surveillance, maritime monitoring, and intelligence capabilities. Among the HALE assets is the RQ-4 Global Hawk, capable of operating at high altitudes for extended periods, providing broad-area coverage with real-time intelligence over long distances. For medium-altitude operations, South Korea utilizes MALE drones such as the KUS-FT, developed by Korea Aerospace Industries. The RQ-101 Songgolmae is a fixed-wing UAV designed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) primarily for reconnaissance. With a wingspan of 6.4 meters and a maximum takeoff weight of 290 kg, it has a range of up to 200 km and an endurance of approximately 6 hours. This drone is equipped with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras and GPS/INS navigation systems, which allow it to gather high-resolution images and real-time intelligence over long distances. Operating at altitudes of up to 4,500 meters, the Songgolmae is especially useful for monitoring the heavily militarized border areas, giving South Korea crucial surveillance capabilities without risking personnel​. South Korea, in collaboration with Boeing, is working on a new High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) drone development project designed to enhance its surveillance capabilities, particularly for monitoring North Korea. This initiative stems from a Memorandum of Understanding signed between South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Boeing in April 2023, aiming to build a South Korean-manufactured HALE UAV that benefits from Boeing's design expertise and technological support. The joint project intends to position South Korea at the forefront of advanced UAV production, with a focus on developing a model suited for long-endurance reconnaissance missions. South Korea's Air Force operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, a high-altitude, long-endurance platform developed by Northrop Grumman. The RQ-4 operates at altitudes up to 60,000 feet with a range of over 12,000 miles, equipped with advanced radar and infrared sensors for long-range surveillance. It can remain airborne for over 30 hours, covering extensive areas and providing high-resolution imaging, making it a valuable tool for observing North Korea's military movements. South Korea also uses KUS-FT drones, developed domestically by Korea Aerospace Industries. The KUS-FT operates at medium altitudes, up to 30,000 feet, with an endurance of around 24 hours. Equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors, it is designed for tactical reconnaissance and can conduct close monitoring along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), complementing the broader surveillance provided by HALE drones like the Global Hawk. South Korea’s drones are tailored for intelligence-gathering missions that allow for extended coverage of North Korean activities, including potential missile launch sites, military movements, and cross-border provocations. By leveraging drones with high-definition imaging, infrared vision, and real-time data links, the South Korean military can maintain a continuous, low-profile surveillance presence. These capabilities reduce the need for manned flights, minimizing risk while maximizing reach and responsiveness. Furthermore, United States operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones in collaboration with South Korea to monitor North Korean activities across the Korean Peninsula. These high-altitude, long-endurance UAVs are stationed at Sacheon Air Base in South Gyeongsang Province, where they serve as a crucial part of South Korea's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Delivered through a strategic partnership, four Global Hawks were supplied to South Korea's Air Force between 2019 and 2020, as part of a defense initiative to enhance South Korea’s monitoring capabilities against regional threats​. The Global Hawk drones, designed by Northrop Grumman, are equipped with high-resolution synthetic aperture radar and electro-optical/infrared sensors, allowing them to capture detailed images of large areas, including North Korean military installations and missile sites. This UAV fleet is capable of covering up to 100,000 square kilometers in a single flight, which is approximately the size of South Korea, enabling comprehensive border surveillance and intelligence sharing between U.S. and South Korean forces​. This collaboration not only enhances South Korea’s situational awareness along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) but also strengthens interoperability with U.S. forces, who are stationed in the region as part of a defense alliance. These joint efforts aim to maintain a high level of readiness against North Korean provocations, ensuring a rapid response to emerging threats in the region. North Korea’s recent provocations include frequent missile tests and the development of drones, which serve both strategic deterrence and as direct responses to perceived threats from South Korea and the U.S. In 2023 alone, North Korea test-fired a variety of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. The Hwasong-17, one of its most advanced ICBMs, is estimated to have a range of up to 15,000 kilometers and can potentially carry multiple warheads or countermeasures designed to evade missile defenses. This long-range capability adds to North Korea’s growing arsenal of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles that can target South Korea and U.S. bases in Japan. Additionally, North Korea has enhanced its maneuverable, solid-fueled missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept, posing a significant challenge to South Korean and U.S. missile defenses. Beyond missiles, North Korea has also advanced its drone program, often utilizing these unmanned aerial systems as tools of psychological and military provocation. The North has deployed drones capable of surveillance and, potentially, small payloads. This was evident in recent incidents where North Korean drones allegedly crossed into South Korean airspace, heightening tensions on the peninsula. Combined with North Korea’s efforts to send balloons with propaganda and waste materials into the South, these drones add a new layer to Pyongyang’s tactics, aiming to provoke and destabilize without direct engagement, a strategy that allows it to maintain pressure on its adversaries while avoiding immediate military escalation. These provocations underscore North Korea’s commitment to demonstrating its military capabilities and maintaining a high-stakes environment in the region. As a reminder on July 27, 2023, North Korea unveiled two new drones, the 'Morning Star-4' and 'Morning Star-9,' which closely resemble the U.S.-designed MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These drones, categorized as High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE), are intended for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and ground-strike missions. Despite significant challenges posed by U.N. sanctions, North Korea appears to have made strides in replicating these advanced models, possibly influenced by prior incidents involving captured U.S. drones in Iran. However, questions remain about the drones’ actual capabilities and North Korea’s access to advanced SATCOM technology, sparking speculation of potential foreign assistance. The capabilities of North Korean artillery brigades to shoot down South Korean surveillance drones are limited due to the anti-aircraft equipment available. North Korea primarily uses anti-aircraft guns like the ZU-23 23 mm and the KS-19 100 mm, which are designed to target low-flying aircraft rather than high-altitude drones. These systems lack the precision and tracking abilities needed to effectively engage modern MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) or HALE (High Altitude, Long Endurance) drones used by South Korea. To intercept surveillance drones operating at higher altitudes, North Korea would require modern surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) with radar or infrared guidance, capable of tracking high-speed targets over long distances. Although North Korea possesses older SAMs, such as the Soviet-era SA-2 and SA-3, these systems are not sufficiently accurate to reliably target modern drones. Consequently, South Korean high-altitude drones remain less vulnerable to North Korea’s conventional artillery defenses.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-attempts-to-down-south-korean-modern-drone-with-old-ks-19-anti-aircraft-guns	2024-10-14T02:46:25-07:00	
Turkiye and Serbia Sign Defense Cooperation Agreement Focused on Drone Technology	According to information published by Middle East Monitor on October 12, 2024, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić announced a strategic collaboration between their countries in the defense industry during an official visit to Belgrade.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Bayraktar TB3 Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle. (Picture source: Navy Recognition) This agreement includes joint efforts in military technology, particularly focusing on drones, a sector where Turkey has become a global leader. Erdoğan emphasized that Turkish drone technology, including the renowned Bayraktar TB2 systems, would be an integral part of this cooperation. Turkish Defense Industry in Balkan countries Several Balkan countries have purchased Bayraktar TB2 drones from Türkiye, reflecting the growing military ties between the region and Ankara. Kosovo, which has been working to strengthen its defense capabilities, received its first batch of Bayraktar TB2 drones in July 2023. This acquisition is viewed as a strategic move amid ongoing tensions with Serbia, and it has been reported that Kosovo bought five drones, although the exact number remains unconfirmed​. Albania also joined the ranks of Bayraktar TB2 buyers in 2022, purchasing three drones to support both military and civilian operations, including surveillance and firefighting efforts. Bosnia and Herzegovina recently followed suit, placing an order for at least six Bayraktar TB2 drones in 2024. This move is designed to bolster its defense capabilities amid the complex security dynamics of the Balkans. Turkey’s role is not without challenges. Its involvement in the defense sectors of both Serbia and Kosovo positions it at the center of regional tensions. The sale of advanced weapons to countries in close proximity, often with competing interests, requires a careful diplomatic balance. Turkey has used its military strength and its defense industry to foster partnerships, positioning itself as a reliable supplier of advanced military technology, but it must also be wary of exacerbating existing conflicts. In the Balkans, Turkish arms sales serve not only as an economic driver but also as a tool for increasing Ankara’s regional influence. The Balkan states, many of which are NATO members or aspirants, see Turkish military technology as a valuable addition to their security frameworks. Turkey’s defense industry policy in the Balkans is a calculated mix of economic strategy, geopolitical ambition, and military influence. As Turkey continues to expand its defense exports, its ability to manage the complex political landscape of the Balkans will be crucial to its long-term success in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/turkey-and-serbia-sign-defense-cooperation-agreement-focused-on-drone-technology	2024-10-14T02:15:11-07:00	
Germany Launches Technical Talks with Türkiye for Eurofighter Fighter Jet Sale	With German Chancellor Olaf Scholz scheduled to visit Türkiye on October 19, 2024, Germany has greenlit technical discussions with Türkiye for a potential sale of Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. This decision, taken in a confidential meeting by the German Federal Security Council, marks a shift from Berlin, which had previously blocked the sale over concerns that these aircraft could be used against Kurdish armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase (Picture source: Eurofighter) The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, multi-role combat aircraft developed by a European consortium composed of Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom under Eurofighter GmbH. Used by several European nations and Saudi Arabia, the Typhoon is designed to perform air superiority missions, airspace defense, interdiction, close air support, and reconnaissance. Its delta-wing configuration, combined with advanced control systems and optimized aerodynamic instability, delivers exceptional agility and speed, reaching up to 2,495 km/h. Equipped with two EUROJET EJ200 engines, the Typhoon offers robust power and redundancy for secure operations both in peacetime and in conflict. Technologically, the Typhoon stands out with its CAPTOR radar, a mechanically scanned system that can evolve to AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, providing long-range detection, advanced air-to-ground capability, and enhanced electronic protection. This radar offers a broad field of view optimized for both aerial and ground engagements. The Typhoon’s weaponry includes 13 hardpoints for missiles and bombs, with configurations tailored to mission requirements: air-to-air AMRAAM and ASRAAM missiles, anti-radar and anti-ship missiles, and guided bombs. This weapon system, coupled with advanced piloting controls such as voice-commanded VTAS (Voice Throttle and Stick), maximizes in-flight effectiveness and reduces pilot workload, enabling swift responses in demanding combat scenarios. The Eurofighter consortium, consisting of Germany, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom, fully supports the potential sale of 40 Eurofighters to Türkiye, valued at approximately $5.6 billion. The agreement gained momentum following a meeting between Chancellor Scholz and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the UN General Assembly in New York last month. The technical talks, expected to last about three weeks, will cover aircraft specifications, acquisition stages, personnel training, and maintenance and spare parts management protocols. The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase. Additionally, sources close to the matter indicate that Chancellor Scholz might be seeking an agreement to expedite the repatriation of approximately 15,000 Turkish nationals whose asylum requests were denied in Germany, thereby strengthening ties between Berlin and Ankara. Airbus, one of Eurofighter's main partners, has actively supported efforts to navigate political challenges. Simon Ward, head of Airbus in Türkiye, even suggested that Eurofighters could arrive in Türkiye sooner than anticipated. While the start of technical talks does not guarantee a finalized sale, this move is seen as a significant indication of Germany’s openness amid rising regional tensions, particularly with the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the ongoing Gaza crisis. Turkish defense officials suggest that acquiring the Eurofighter would provide Türkiye’s air force with AESA radar technology for the first time, significantly enhancing its capabilities. Turkish experts view the Eurofighter as an optimal interim solution while Türkiye awaits the integration of its domestic KAAN fighter jet and American F-16 Block 70s into its fleet. The outcome of these talks could also pave the way for broader military-economic partnerships between Germany and Türkiye, a development closely observed by other Eurofighter consortium members. In conclusion, this initiative marks a turning point in bilateral relations and highlights the complexity of defense negotiations in Europe, shaped by geopolitical dynamics and regional security imperatives.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/germany-launches-technical-talks-with-tuerkiye-for-eurofighter-fighter-jet-sale	2024-10-14T02:06:03-07:00	
Australia’s new AS9 Huntsman 155mm howitzer makes first appearance in South Korea for testing phase	As reported by Mason on October 12, 2024, the Australian variant of the K9A1, the AS9 Huntsman, was reportedly observed in South Korea for the first time. It is likely that the 155mm self-propelled howitzer was transported by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development (ADD), which is responsible for developing the K9 Thunder and conducting various testing and evaluation services.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Australian variant of the K9 Thunder, later known as the AS9, is set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, quality assessment tests for mass-produced military products, performance tests for export items, and performance enhancement evaluations. The prospect of Australia acquiring the South Korean K9 Thunder was first publicly discussed in June 2005, when discussions began between Australian and South Korean defense officials about potential trade opportunities, including the K9 Thunder and Australian naval gun ammunition. By August 2009, Samsung Techwin and Raytheon Australia became leading contenders for Australia’s Land 17 artillery replacement program, as other bidders did not provide sufficient detail. Testing of the K9 platform commenced in April 2010, and the vehicle successfully fired the M982 Excalibur, meeting key requirements for the program. The proposed Australian variant, later known as the AS9, was set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, and performance tests for export items. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) In June 2010, the K9 was announced as the preferred option for the Land 17 program. However, funding for the project was redirected due to floods in Queensland in 2011, leading to the program’s cancellation in 2012. In 2019, then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia planned to acquire 30 K9 howitzers and ten K10 ammunition resupply vehicles, although no specific timeline was provided at that time. In September 2020, Australia issued a tender for Hanwha Defense Australia to locally produce 30 K9 variants as part of the Land 8116 Phase 1 project. The Australian variant, based on the Norwegian K9 VIDAR, was to include enhancements first proposed in 2010, alongside up-to-date modifications. In December 2021, the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) and Hanwha Defense Australia formalized a $788 million contract for the production of 30 AS9 howitzers and 15 AS10 armored ammunition resupply vehicles at a new facility in Geelong, Victoria. Hanwha’s Geelong facility, the Hanwha Armoured Vehicle Centre of Excellence (H-ACE), began construction in April 2022. This 150,000-square-meter site includes a 1.5-kilometer test track and various R&amp;D areas, with plans to create 300 jobs for local specialists. Through international partnerships, including a $67 million deal with Norway’s Kongsberg Gruppen for Integrated Combat Solutions (ICS) and a contract with Hanwha Systems worth 20.8 billion KRW, Hanwha Defense Australia has integrated various systems into the AS9. The AS9 Huntsman, a 155mm/52-caliber self-propelled howitzer, has a maximum firing range of 40 kilometers with standard ammunition and can reach up to 60 kilometers with specialized rounds. (Picture source: Australian MoD) Mass production of the AS9 and AS10 began at H-ACE in 2024, and the first deliveries to the Australian Army are expected by 2027. The AS9 includes an enhanced suspension system, additional armor for increased protection, and a fire control system from Kongsberg, which allows for integration with other Australian defense assets. These modifications align with the Australian Army’s specific requirements and distinguish the AS9 from the original K9 Thunder. Capable of firing three rounds in 15 seconds and sustaining a rate of six to eight rounds per minute, the AS9 is also equipped with a semi-automated loading system. The AS9 Huntsman, a 155mm/52-caliber self-propelled howitzer, has a maximum firing range of 40 kilometers with standard ammunition and can reach up to 60 kilometers with specialized rounds. Its mobility allows it to quickly relocate after firing, minimizing exposure to potential counterattacks. Therefore, the Australian Army plans to integrate the AS9 into its artillery units, replacing the existing M777 howitzers starting with the 4th Regiment. The AS9 will support operations with increased range and mobility, while the M777 will continue in roles requiring lightweight, air-mobile artillery. The AS9 can fire multiple rounds timed to arrive on target simultaneously, enhancing operational flexibility. These features, combined with armor improvements and digital control systems, support Australia’s defense modernization objectives.

South Korea Conducts Live Test of Taurus Missile Amid Rising Tensions with North Korea	Amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the South Korean Air Force (RoKAF) recently conducted live-fire drills featuring the German-designed Taurus missile. This exercise, held on October 8 and 10 over the Yellow Sea, has drawn international attention, especially from Ukraine, which has long expressed interest in acquiring such capabilities to counter Russian forces. These tests underscore Seoul's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid ongoing provocations from North Korea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Republic of Korea Air Force F-15K Slam Eagle, assigned to the 11th Fighter Wing, arrives for Korea Flying Training 2024 at Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, April 12, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) During the exercise, a Taurus missile was launched from an F-15K fighter jet, traveling over 400 kilometers to hit its designated target. A video released by RoKAF documented the entire process, from integrating the missile onto the aircraft to its launch. Beyond these live tests, RoKAF also implemented scenarios to intercept potentially hostile cruise missiles, involving both F-15K and F-35A Lightning II jets, though the exact number of aircraft used was not disclosed. The Taurus missiles demonstrated their ability to identify and track enemy cruise missiles moving at high speed and low altitude. The E-737 early warning and control aircraft played a crucial role, relaying real-time information to other aircraft and the central control center. This exercise, part of a broader training program to counter cruise missile threats, enhances South Korea’s defensive posture as tensions remain high. These missile drills follow a series of provocations from North Korea, including the deployment of propaganda balloons toward South Korea and threats to cut off ground and rail communications. North Korea also announced plans to fortify its border defenses, accusing South Korea and the United States of destabilizing actions. This South Korean military response recalls similar missile tests conducted in 2017 in reaction to North Korea's nuclear tests. The Taurus KEPD-350 missile, developed by Germany's MBDA in collaboration with Saab Bofors Dynamics, is designed for deep-strike missions. With a range exceeding 500 kilometers, it allows engagement of heavily fortified targets from a secure distance. Powered by the Williams P8300-15 turbofan engine, the missile combines precision with fuel efficiency. Its two-stage warhead, MEPHISTO, is engineered to penetrate bunkers and underground structures before detonation, targeting strategic facilities. Equipped with advanced guidance systems, including GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain reference navigation (TRN), the Taurus KEPD-350 maintains high accuracy even in GPS-denied environments. This missile, weighing 1,400 kg and measuring 5.1 meters in length, can be deployed on various platforms, including the F-15K and Eurofighter Typhoon, enhancing South Korea’s strike capabilities. Integrating the Taurus missile into South Korea’s F-15K Slam Eagle fleet aligns with its 'kill chain' strategy, aimed at quickly neutralizing North Korean command centers and fortified positions housing nuclear or conventional missiles in the event of conflict. In 2023, South Korean defense firm LIG Nex1 and Taurus Systems signed an MoU to adapt the KEPD-350K missile for the FA-50 light attack aircraft, further expanding Seoul’s long-range strike options. In parallel, South Korea conducted interception exercises involving KF-16 and F-35A fighter jets coordinated with E-737 'Peace Eye' surveillance aircraft. These early warning aircraft, capable of tracking thousands of targets simultaneously, play a central role in detecting and neutralizing low-altitude cruise missiles that are challenging to detect and intercept. The F-35A’s advanced sensors and avionics are designed for effective operations in contested airspace, providing a higher probability of intercepting enemy missiles before they reach their targets. The KF-16, an upgraded version of the American F-16, is equipped with sophisticated radar and AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, allowing precise interception of aerial threats. These exercises, part of a multi-layered defense strategy, highlight South Korea's readiness to respond swiftly to North Korean threats, which often involve low-altitude, fast-moving projectiles designed to evade detection. By showcasing advanced weaponry such as the Taurus missile, South Korea sends a clear message of deterrence to North Korea. South Korea appears well-prepared to respond to any escalation, with a highly capable air force equipped for precision strikes and defensive operations. The Taurus missile, with its ability to target strategic facilities, offers South Korea a critical technological advantage amid rising threats from Pyongyang. In summary, these missile tests and interception exercises underline South Korea’s commitment to reinforcing its defense and deterrence strategies against the persistent threats from North Korea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-conducts-live-test-of-taurus-missile-amid-rising-tensions-with-north-korea	2024-10-14T01:29:03-07:00

North Korea begins construction of large submarine possibly nuclear powered	According to information published by Yonhap News Agency on August 8, 2024, the South Korean military has confirmed that North Korea has initiated the construction of a large submarine near Sinpo, a key area for the regime's submarine operations in South Hamgyong Province.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kim Jong Un during an inspection visit to the Nampho shipyard. (Picture source: KCNA) On October 8th, officials revealed that analysis is underway to determine whether the vessel could potentially be nuclear-powered, a significant development given North Korea's past aspirations for such technology. According to reports, the new submarine is notably larger than the existing ones in North Korea's fleet. Although it is still in the early stages of construction, the exact displacement and capabilities will become clearer as the work progresses. One military source suggested that while crucial components like a nuclear reactor have not yet been installed, the increased size raises the possibility that this could be North Korea’s first nuclear-powered submarine. Earlier this year, in January, North Korea’s state newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported that Kim oversaw a test launch of submarine-launched cruise missiles and inspected ongoing work related to nuclear submarine development. Korean People's Navy The fleet includes a large number of conventionally powered submarines, with estimates suggesting around 70 to 90 vessels.

US Army accelerates M113 replacement with new $184 Million AMPV order	On October 9, 2024, BAE Systems received a $184 million contract modification from the U.S. Army for an additional 48 Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV), building on the existing full-rate production agreement. The AMPV Family of Vehicles (FoV) is being introduced to replace the older M113 series in the U.S. Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), offering modernized capabilities in survivability, mobility, and interoperability. The contract modification will support the Army’s plan to expand its fleet of AMPVs, thereby modernizing and improving the operational flexibility of the ABCTs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV) program was initiated with a $383 million EMD contract in 2014, producing 29 prototypes before entering low-rate production to deliver 289 vehicles by 2020. (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV lineup includes five specialized variants, each designed for specific roles: the M1283 General Purpose (GP), M1284 Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), M1285 Medical Treatment Vehicle (MTV), M1286 Mission Command (MC), and M1287 Mortar Carrier. The M1283 GP variant is utilized for resupply, maintenance, and casualty evacuation operations. The M1284 MEV is equipped for medical evacuation, accommodating up to six ambulatory personnel or four patients on litters. The M1285 MTV functions as a mobile medical treatment facility, supporting battlefield care with equipment typically found in civilian ambulances. The M1286 MC variant supports mission command functions, enhancing command, control, and communication within the ABCT. The M1287 Mortar Carrier provides indirect fire support using the M121 Mortar System and the M95 Mortar Fire Control System. The AMPV program has been pursued to address the limitations of the M113, a platform that has been in service since the 1960s. Although versatile, the M113 has shown vulnerabilities in modern combat scenarios, particularly during the Iraq War where urban warfare tactics exposed its weaknesses. The Army subsequently adopted Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for active service. However, the AMPV is intended to offer enhanced off-road mobility, similar to that of the M2 Bradley and M1 Abrams, making it more suitable for a variety of operational environments. The AMPV program has been pursued to address the limitations of the M113, a platform that has been in service since the 1960s, but has shown vulnerabilities in modern combat scenarios, particularly during the Iraq War where urban warfare tactics exposed its weaknesses. (Picture source: US DoD) This follow-on order represents the Army’s shift in acquisition priorities, following the cancellation of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. Initially, the GCV was intended to replace M2 Bradley vehicles within the ABCT, but cost constraints led to a preference for the AMPV program, estimated to cost over $5 billion, compared to the $37 billion projected for the GCV program. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office highlighted the AMPV as a more feasible option, and the Army’s FY 2015 budget proposal reflected a reallocation of resources to focus on AMPV production. BAE Systems, in response to the contract modification, has expanded its production capabilities, particularly at its York, Pennsylvania facility. Alongside facilities in South Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, and Michigan, this network is designed to meet current and projected demand for AMPVs. The expansion aligns with the Army’s objective to gradually increase production, reaching full-rate production after an initial low-rate production phase that began in 2018. Production plans include an incremental ramp-up, from 57 vehicles in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 to 122 units annually by FY 2026 and FY 2027, before reducing in later years. The AMPV program’s phased approach began with a $383 million Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract awarded to BAE Systems in 2014. This phase produced 29 prototypes, followed by a low-rate production phase to supply 289 vehicles by 2020. General Dynamics initially contested the AMPV requirements, claiming the design favored the BAE Bradley chassis. However, the Army Materiel Command dismissed the protest, stating that BAE’s manufacturing of the M113 and Bradley provided certain logistical advantages that did not constitute preferential treatment. The AMPV’s modular design aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. (Picture source: US DoD) Following this decision, General Dynamics did not pursue further action through the Government Accountability Office but continued to advocate a mixed fleet concept to Congress. This proposal suggested combining tracked Bradley and wheeled Stryker vehicles, which General Dynamics argued could enhance mission flexibility and reduce life-cycle costs. The AMPV’s modular design allows for future upgrades in communications and electronic systems, supporting the Army’s strategy of leveraging commercial off-the-shelf components. This approach aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. By allowing for incremental upgrades, the Army plans to incorporate new technologies over time, including satellite communications, further integrating the AMPV into the digital battlefield. Looking forward, the AMPV program includes potential future variants designed for counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) roles. One such variant may feature the Leonardo DRS Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) turret, equipped with a 30mm XM914 cannon, a 7.62mm M240 machine gun, and Stinger missile launchers. This development aligns with the Army’s intent to adapt the AMPV for a range of defense scenarios within the ABCT framework, while also considering international interest in the platform. The AMPV shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for the US Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs). (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV continues to replace the M113 in Army units, such as the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division, which recently replaced over 130 M113s with AMPVs after completing necessary training. This replacement supports the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Modernization Priority, with AMPVs designed to withstand threats from mines, improvised explosive devices, and direct fire. Their design shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for ABCTs. BAE Systems has also developed additional variants to fulfill specific mission requirements. Recently, a turreted mortar variant was introduced, equipped with the Patria NEMO 120mm remote-controlled mortar system. This variant provides responsive fire support within the ABCT. With the full-rate production now underway, BAE Systems will continue to supply AMPVs to the U.S. Army, fulfilling both current operational needs and potential future requirements as the Army transitions its fleet to more modernized combat vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-accelerates-m113-replacement-with-new-184-million-ampv-order	2024-10-14T00:26:14-07:00

Breaking News: US Authorizes Deployment of THAAD Air Defense Missile in Israel to Counter Missile Threats from Iran	On Sunday, October 13, 2024, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had authorized the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to Israel at the direction of President Joe Biden. This move comes in response to recent escalations, including Iran's ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October of this year. Ryder emphasized that the deployment would strengthen Israel’s air defense capabilities amid heightened regional tensions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A U.S. Air Force Airman unloads an American THAAD air defense missile system from a C-17 Globemaster III at Nevatim Air Base, Israel, on March 1, 2019. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) This is not the United States' first deployment of THAAD in the region. President Biden directed a similar deployment last year, following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, to protect American troops and interests. The U.S. also deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 as part of a joint training and integrated air defense exercise. The new deployment adds to Israel’s already robust air defense systems, which include the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow 3 systems, designed to intercept threats ranging from short-range rockets to long-range missiles. THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase—right before impact—providing a crucial layer of defense against missile threats. THAAD’s key strength lies in its ability to intercept threats at both high altitudes and long ranges, making it particularly effective against ballistic missiles. The system can engage targets at ranges of up to 200 kilometers and at altitudes exceeding 150 kilometers, far beyond the reach of most missile defense systems, allowing it to neutralize warheads before they reenter the atmosphere. Iran possesses one of the largest and most diverse missile arsenals in the Middle East, comprising a wide range of short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles. The country has developed several missile systems, such as the Shahab, Ghadr, and Sejjil series, capable of striking targets throughout the region, including Israel and U.S. military bases. Some of Iran’s missiles, like the Shahab-3, have a range of over 1,000 kilometers, while more advanced systems like the Sejjil-2 have ranges that extend beyond 2,000 kilometers, potentially reaching parts of Europe. These missiles can carry conventional or, in a worst-case scenario, nuclear warheads, though Iran insists its missile program is defensive. In addition to ballistic missiles, Iran has also developed cruise missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept due to their low-altitude flight paths. Iran’s missile capabilities, combined with its ability to produce and modify these systems domestically, pose a significant strategic threat in the region, especially to adversaries like Israel and the United States. These missiles have been central to Iran’s military strategy, allowing it to project power and retaliate against potential threats without relying solely on conventional forces. Against Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, which includes a variety of long-range and medium-range systems, THAAD offers a significant defensive advantage. Its ability to intercept missiles at such high altitudes ensures that the debris or any remaining missile fragments fall harmlessly outside of populated areas. Paired with Israel’s existing air defense systems, THAAD adds another crucial layer of protection to Israel’s multi-tiered defense strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-us-authorizes-deployment-of-thaad-battery-in-israel-to-counter-missile-threats-from-iran	2024-10-13T14:39:46-07:00

This victory, Ukraine's first in air-to-air combat using the F-16, was achieved with the advanced AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, known for its infrared homing and high maneuverability. The AIM-9X, widely regarded for its lethality, gives the F-16 a significant edge in dogfights, able to engage enemy aircraft at high angles and within close-range combat scenarios.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Historic Moment: Ukrainian F-16 Claims First Air-to-Air Victory by Downing Russian Su-34 Fighter-Bomber The F-16 Fighting Falcon is renowned for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and an array of precision-guided missiles. One of its standout features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing enhanced detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry a range of air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfighting. Thanks to its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X's ability to lock onto targets from extreme angles makes it particularly lethal in close-quarters combat. This mix of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate in both long-range and short-range engagements​. Compared to other contemporary fighter aircraft, such as Russia’s Su-35 and MiG-31, the F-16 has certain advantages regarding agility and electronic warfare capabilities. While the Su-35 boasts superior long-range radar and missile systems, the F-16 compensates with its superior maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures to evade radar-guided threats. This agility, coupled with advanced helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to engage targets by simply looking at them, gives the F-16 a distinct advantage in close combat​. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable for a range of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, however, its ability to engage multiple targets at various ranges and its integrated defensive measures provides a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While Russian aircraft like the Su-35 may have superior radar range, the F-16’s electronic warfare and countermeasures systems, combined with its superior dogfighting agility and modern missile systems like the AIM-9X, allow it to compete effectively against modern Russian fighters in both defensive and offensive air operations​. The AIM-9X Sidewinder missile is a state-of-the-art air-to-air weapon that has revolutionized modern dogfighting. Its infrared (heat-seeking) guidance system allows it to detect and lock onto the heat signature of an enemy aircraft, typically from the engines, making it highly effective against fast-moving targets. What sets the AIM-9X apart from previous iterations is its 'high off-boresight' capability. This means that the pilot doesn’t need to be directly facing the enemy to fire; the missile can target and hit aircraft even at extreme angles relative to the jet's flight path. This off-boresight capability is paired with a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system, enabling the pilot to simply look at a target to guide the missile. This feature drastically reduces the reaction time needed in close air engagements, a critical advantage when pilots maneuver at high speeds and in high-threat environments. Moreover, the AIM-9X is known for its agility and ability to perform sharp turns, allowing it to stay locked onto highly agile enemy fighters. In addition to the AIM-9X, the F-16 itself offers a combination of speed, radar systems, and maneuverability that make it a formidable platform for air-to-air combat. Equipped with beyond-visual-range missiles (such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM) alongside the AIM-9X, the F-16 can engage enemies both at close range and from distances where visual contact is not required. This first victory in air-to-air combat for Ukraine marks a significant milestone in the conflict, demonstrating the growing capability of the Ukrainian Air Force thanks to NATO's continued support in terms of advanced weaponry and pilot training. The F-16, paired with the AIM-9X, offers a significant edge in aerial warfare against Russian aircraft like the Su-34, which are typically less maneuverable in close engagements​.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-wins-first-air-to-air-fight-shoots-down-russian-su-34	2024-10-13T08:20:31-07:00

By aiming for a more stable future and opening new sales opportunities, NHI plans ambitious upgrades, increased reliability, and supply chain restructuring to ensure the NH90’s long-term usage. This new strategy leverages the helicopter’s untapped potential and targeted improvements, despite major challenges, including contract cancellations, delivery delays, and high operating costs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Royal New Zealand Air Force NH90 helicopter lands to deploy soldiers from Australia’s 7th Battalion for land clearing and fuel reduction on Brindabella Mountain, west of Canberra, on 20 January 2020 (Picture source: Australian MoD) The NH90 helicopter, developed to meet NATO’s stringent standards by a consortium comprising Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters, and Fokker Aerostructures, is available in two main versions: the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) and the NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH). It features a fully composite structure and integrated mission systems for complex land and sea operations, day and night. Equipped with advanced technologies such as fly-by-wire controls and a digital cockpit, it reduces pilot workload, enhancing efficiency for autonomous and mixed-team missions. In terms of armament, the NH90 can be configured for anti-submarine (ASW) and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) missions with anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, sonar systems, and lateral machine guns for maritime security operations. Its modular design and large transport capacity (up to 20 soldiers or NATO-standard pallets) also make it a strategic tool for tactical transport, logistical support, and special operations, including counter-terrorism and disaster relief missions. Currently used by multiple countries in various operational contexts, including combat missions in Afghanistan, Mali, and Iraq, as well as disaster relief in New Zealand, the Philippines, and Europe, the NH90 combines low radar and infrared signatures with advanced self-protection systems (chaff/flare dispensers, threat detectors). This agile and compact helicopter is built to withstand demanding environments, making it a valuable asset for modern military forces. Aloccio asserted that the NH90 could remain operational for 'at least another 50 to 60 years,' a claim he described as a 'fact,' based on the substantial investments already made by current customers. Speaking at an Airbus Helicopters press day in Marignane, France, Aloccio emphasized the company’s commitment to developing a 'Block 2' NH90, in discussions with clients for nearly a year. Although the main technologies for this upgrade are still being defined, discussions include increasing payload capacity and integrating drone cooperation capabilities to meet growing demand for joint operations. Simultaneously, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands approved the 'Software Release 3' upgrade for the NH90 last June. This upgrade will integrate the Link 22 datalink, Leonardo’s LEOSS-T electro-optical gimbal, new sonar equipment, and additional armament capabilities, allowing the NH90 to meet modern operational needs and enhance its versatility in the military helicopter market.

The Netherlands’ recent announcement of additional NH90 purchases last September highlights this momentum, as does expressed interest from several Middle Eastern countries. NHI aims to capture new markets by meeting potential customers’ expectations. Nonetheless, past challenges have not been overlooked. Aloccio acknowledged that supply chain difficulties had long hampered the NH90 program, with delays in part delivery and underestimation of certain client expectations. To address these, NHI implemented specific action plans for each supplier and simplified maintenance processes to improve fleet availability. By increasing critical parts deliveries by 15% last year and targeting an additional 15–20% improvement this year, NHI is working to resolve logistical issues that have impacted its reputation. Aloccio noted that essential parts, including main gearboxes, blades, and mission equipment, are partly manufactured by NHI-associated companies, underlining the consortium’s direct responsibility for some of the issues encountered. These industrial challenges have had significant financial impacts on NHI, leading Australia, Norway, and Sweden to cancel contracts despite aircraft deliveries. In June 2022, Norway ended its NH90 program, with Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram stating that efforts to make the helicopter operational were insufficient to meet the armed forces’ requirements. Consequently, Oslo is seeking compensation of nearly 5 billion kroner ($525 million), while NHI refuted Norway’s claims, describing the contract termination as 'legally unfounded.' The situation between NHI and Norway has escalated into legal proceedings after failed mediation attempts. 'They took us to court, and we are also pursuing legal action,' said Aloccio, explaining that the two parties had merged their claims into a single case. The matter will be heard in an Oslo court next year, but for now, Norway’s fleet of 14 NH90s remains in storage, unused since the program’s cancellation. In Australia, a €250 million buy-back program for MRH-90 Taipan spare parts is underway following Canberra’s decision to retire its MRH-90 fleet prematurely after a fatal accident during Exercise Talisman Sabre in July 2023. Around 300 parts have already been returned to NHI, marking the beginning of a complex process to wind down the program in Australia. In contrast, Sweden has seen a notable improvement in NH90 fleet availability, with flight hours increasing by 60% between January and August 2022 and the same period in 2023. Nevertheless, Stockholm has shown no indication of reversing its decision to abandon the program, instead moving forward with the acquisition of 12 additional UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/nhindustries-strives-to-stabilize-future-of-nh90-helicopter-despite-past-challenges	2024-10-10T06:25:39-07:00

In July 2024, this group released confidential documents exposing sensitive details of Russo-Indian defense contracts, including the S-400. Originating from hacked emails of senior Russian officials, these leaks reveal specific codes, component quantities, and munitions planned for India. Signed during a 2018 visit by Vladimir Putin to India, the S-400 Triumf contract marked a milestone in military cooperation between the two nations and facilitated enhanced training for Indian personnel. Despite the delays caused by Russia’s engagements in Ukraine, Moscow remains committed to completing the deliveries, underscoring its determination to maintain influence among strategic partners such as India. These disclosures raise questions about the security of Russia’s military information, exposing potential risks for its partners due to the sensitive nature of defense contracts amid geopolitical tensions. Correspondence from a high-ranking Russian defense official, Vladimir Chervakov, validates the complete S-400 inventory designated for India, highlighting the inherent risks of collaboration with Russia in defense matters under increasing external and internal pressures. Russia’s continued delivery of S-400 systems to India, despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, is notable, as Moscow might prioritize resources to strengthen its military presence in Ukraine and bolster domestic defense. Nonetheless, this situation emphasizes Russia’s strategic priorities to uphold its international commitments and preserve essential alliances, particularly with India. India, adopting a neutral stance and pursuing a policy of multi-alignment, carefully balances relationships with global powers, leveraging military cooperation with Russia while remaining uninvolved in the Ukrainian conflict. Completing the S-400 deliveries to India by 2025 is a crucial step in Russo-Indian cooperation, despite logistical and political challenges encountered.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/india-and-russia-set-for-final-s-400-delivery-in-2025-despite-ukraine-war	2024-10-10T00:39:38-07:00

India Showcases Rafale Jet Capability to Intercept High-Altitude Chinese Spy Balloons	The Indian Air Force (IAF) recently conducted an exercise to demonstrate its ability to intercept targets representative of Chinese spy balloons at very high altitudes. Deploying one of its thirty-six Rafale jets, the IAF successfully engaged a simulated target at over 55,000 feet or approximately 16.7 km altitude. According to a source cited by the Times of India, this operation marks a significant milestone for India, proving its air force’s capability to destroy such targets in previously unexplored flight zones for these types of missions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) India’s Rafale, first delivered in 2020 under a contract signed with France in 2016, is a versatile combat aircraft designed for high-altitude operations, extended range, and high payload capacity. With a maximum operational ceiling of 55,000 feet, the Rafale enables the IAF to maintain heightened vigilance against potential aerial incursions, including in upper airspace. Equipped for air-to-air and ground attack missions, the Rafale can carry a broad array of guided and unguided munitions, offering substantial flexibility. This operation comes as interest in very high-altitude security intensifies, particularly since the downing of a Chinese spy balloon by the US Air Force over American waters in 2023. This incident highlighted the strategic importance of this layer of airspace, which remains under-regulated due to a lack of consensus on the boundary between airspace and outer space. The Chinese balloon, measuring nearly 60 meters in diameter and equipped with a 900 kg payload, demonstrated high-altitude intelligence-gathering capabilities. However, US authorities stated that no significant data was collected during its passage. To prevent further intrusions, NORAD recalibrated its radars in March, enabling the interception of an aerostat at over 43,000 feet above Utah. Although this object posed no direct threat, vigilance remains essential, and other Chinese balloons have been observed near Taiwan. Given its own tensions with China, particularly concerning the Arunachal Pradesh region, India has been preparing for potential incursions of Chinese balloons into its airspace, though no official comment was made on a similar sighting over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2022. During this recent operation, the Indian Rafale was armed with Meteor and MICA missiles, capable of striking targets at ranges of 200 km and 80 km, respectively. No details were disclosed on the tactics employed to intercept the target at such a high altitude, which represents the Rafale’s operational ceiling. This demonstration echoes the capabilities affirmed by General Stéphane Mille, Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, in 2022, who stated that France also possesses the capability to intercept such devices. Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. This mix of Russian, French, and indigenous technology enables the IAF to maintain diverse and robust intervention capabilities. India is also considering expanding its Rafale fleet, with plans to acquire an additional 26 aircraft, primarily for its navy, which would strengthen India’s maritime defense capabilities. This potential expansion demonstrates India’s confidence in the Rafale, which has proven effective in high-altitude exercises and national security scenarios. The international context underscores the growing importance of very high-altitude protection, a domain that major powers are actively exploring to ensure enhanced surveillance and counter emerging threats. Beyond the technical dimension, the IAF’s exercise shows India’s determination to defend its airspace from any form of unwanted surveillance, affirming its sovereignty and increasing control over an area of airspace that has so far been sparsely utilized.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/india-showcases-rafale-jet-capability-to-intercept-high-altitude-chinese-spy-balloons-2	2024-10-09T02:18:49-07:00

L3Harris Explores Maritime Version of Vampire Counter-Drone Defense System	Defense technology manufacturer L3Harris is exploring a maritime version of its Vampire counter-drone defense system to enhance naval protection against airborne threats. Initially designed as a truck-mounted platform to provide low-cost precision defense for ground forces, the Vampire gained recognition in 2022 as one of the first weapon systems supplied to Ukraine by the Pentagon. Simple and durable in design, the Vampire combines widely available 2.75mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Systems (APKWS) rockets from BAE Systems with an L3Harris Wescam MX-10D digital sensor equipped with a laser designator. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield (Picture source: L3Harris) L3Harris has announced the adaptation of this system into a version intended to provide an anti-drone solution for ships at sea. According to Jason Lambert, president of the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance division at L3Harris, demonstrations for maritime use are currently underway, with a version of the Vampire deployed on ships. These tests are taking place amid repeated drone and cruise missile attacks targeting U.S. warships in the Red Sea over the past year, described by Pentagon officials as the most intense naval combat involving the U.S. since World War II. Although combat vessels are equipped with multi-layered air defense systems, these systems primarily rely on costly missiles, of which ships can carry only limited quantities. Each Raytheon SM-2 missile used by the U.S. Navy costs approximately $2 million, while the larger SM-6 model exceeds $4 million. In contrast, the smaller and less expensive APKWS rockets used in the Vampire system offer a cost-effective option between long-range missiles and close-range defensive guns, optimizing cost per shot. The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield. By deploying, for example, four such autonomous vessels equipped with numerous rockets around a single main ship, L3Harris envisions an additional layer of protection against attacks. These Vampire units would be remotely controlled from the primary vessel, with human operators managing targeting and rocket guidance. The company is also examining the possibility of incorporating autonomy into the system to facilitate target identification. The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks (Picture source: L3Harris) The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks. Over the past year, U.S. warships have faced dozens of armed drone strikes conducted in saturation waves, which have been intercepted by naval air defenses and carrier-based fighters. Despite these efforts, civilian ships have been impacted, with some even sinking. Since deploying the Vampire in Ukraine, L3Harris has implemented several enhancements, including the addition of proximity fuses on APKWS rockets, eliminating the need for direct hits to neutralize targets. According to Lambert, feedback from Ukraine regarding the Vampire’s performance in combat has been 'extremely positive.' The Ukraine conflict has underscored the critical role of drones in modern warfare, with both sides deploying small drones extensively for reconnaissance, artillery adjustment, and anti-personnel and anti-armor strikes. Russia has also used waves of armed drones and cruise missiles to target Ukrainian civilian areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/l3harris-explores-maritime-version-of-vampire-counter-drone-defense-system	2024-10-09T01:30:49-07:00

The objective of this new combat drone is to secure France’s strategic independence and air superiority in response to emerging geopolitical and military threats over the coming decades. The combination of the Rafale F5 and this autonomous drone is expected to enhance France’s collaborative combat capabilities—a network-centric approach that improves response times and operational effectiveness in combat missions. Similar to the historic partnership between the Mirage IV and the FAS in the 1960s, this new project represents a technological continuity that aligns the French military with current defense needs. Dassault Aviation’s selection to lead this development reflects the renewed confidence of French authorities in the company. Although budgets, additional industry partnerships, and export opportunities remain undefined, Éric Trappier views this mission as a commitment to meeting the French armed forces’ expectations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/france-launches-development-of-stealth-combat-drone-to-complement-rafale-f5-standard	2024-10-09T00:17:00-07:00	
Greece purchases 592 US-made Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions for Special Forces	According to Doureios on October 10, 2024, Greece plans to acquire 592 units of Switchblade 300 Block 20 and Switchblade 600 loitering munitions from the United States. The Hellenic Parliament’s Special Permanent Committee on Armaments and Contracts approved this procurement on September 17, 2024, as part of a broader defense enhancement initiative.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Most of these Switchblade loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. (Picture source: AeroVironment) Greece's decision follows a series of strategic evaluations that began in December 2023, when the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA) approved a related study for the acquisition, upgrade, and modernization of military equipment. Initial considerations involved two companies: the Israeli firm Aeronautics, which offered the Orbiter 1K, and the American company AeroVironment, which manufactures the Switchblade. However, in late 2023, Greece opted solely for the Switchblade, a choice influenced by a shift in funding priorities. The initial plan to procure used AAV7A1 amphibious armored vehicles from the United States was 'frozen,' with the allocated funds redirected to the loitering munitions program. Specifically, $25 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) credits, provided under the U.S. European Recapitalization Incentive Program (ERIP), were repurposed to cover part of the Switchblade procurement costs. This funding was initially available to support Greece's transition away from its BMP-1 armored vehicles of Soviet origin. Additionally, Greece received a further $30 million in FMF credits as part of U.S. assistance for Greece’s support of Ukraine. Combined, these credits amount to approximately two-thirds of the €75.2 million total cost of the loitering munitions procurement, reducing Greece’s direct financial outlay. The acquisition involves both the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 models, which together total 592 units. Most of these loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 300 is a small, expendable loitering munition designed to provide platoon-sized infantry units with precision strike capabilities. This UAV assists units under enemy fire by engaging long-range targets, following a pre-programmed path, and allowing operators to redirect its course en route. It has been deployed to destroy light-armored vehicles and personnel, and it can detonate mid-flight if necessary. Utilizing a Ground Control Station (GCS) compatible with other AeroVironment UAVs, such as the Wasp, RQ-11 Raven, and RQ-20 Puma, the Switchblade 300 can be coordinated with other drones to locate and attack targets. Its forward-firing warhead minimizes collateral damage, with an option to adjust detonation height mid-flight. The system is considered a loitering munition rather than a UAV, as it is not recoverable and is controlled by a fly-by-radio frequency signal. Additionally, it has been paired with SRC Inc.’s software and counter-drone technologies, enhancing its capability to intercept hostile UAVs. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. With a gross weight of around 8 pounds, it supports land, sea, and mobile platforms, allowing rapid deployment in under two minutes. The Block 20 also features an improved Digital Data Link (DDL) for secure, encrypted communication, reducing signal interception risks, enabling concurrent operations of multiple Switchblade systems, and supporting extended range operations through additional UAVs. The Block 20 includes a Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL), which can remotely launch several units in configurations from 2 to 20 rounds, with reloading times of under 30 seconds per round. This configuration supports base defense and facilitates 'sensor-to-shooter' operations by transmitting mission plans from other AeroVironment UAVs. The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. It can travel up to 40 kilometers in 20 minutes, then loiter for another 20 minutes, giving it a total range of 80 kilometers. Its warhead is based on the Javelin anti-tank missile, and it operates at a speed of 185 kilometers per hour during the terminal phase of its flight. The Switchblade 600 is controlled through a tablet-based system with autonomous and manual modes, secured by encrypted data links and anti-spoofing GPS. It is also compatible with a pocket DDL module for longer-range engagements. As part of the Army's Single Multi-Mission Attack Missile development program, AeroVironment has been able to scale production to manufacture up to 6,000 Switchblade 600 units annually. This model can also be configured for a six-pack vehicle-mounted launcher or air-launch options, broadening its potential deployment scenarios. The agreement, valued at 3.47 billion euros, includes the procurement of 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters. (Picture source: US DoD) Greece’s procurement of these munitions is part of its larger ten-year defense spending strategy, which includes plans to acquire 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters, from the United States and a fourth Belharra frigate from France. The Switchblades are also intended to complement other weapons systems in Greece’s inventory, such as the Spike anti-tank missiles recently purchased from Israel, which will be stationed on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. In addition, Greece is developing its own drone and anti-drone technologies as part of a broader focus on modernizing its defense capabilities. The choice to procure Switchblade munitions directly from the United States rather than through domestic production has raised questions regarding the Greek defense industry’s capacity for developing similar technologies. While some efforts have been made to advance indigenous loitering munition projects, these remain at the initial design or early development stages. The Greek Armed Forces' reliance on foreign partners reflects current operational requirements that domestic capabilities have not yet met. This loitering munitions acquisition aligns with ongoing U.S.-Greece defense cooperation and has received approval from Greece's top foreign and defense decision-making body, the Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defense (KYSEA). The decision situates Greece’s defense procurement within the context of its relations with NATO allies and broader strategic objectives, as well as ongoing regional tensions with Turkey over maritime boundaries, airspace, and resource rights in the Aegean Sea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-purchases-592-us-made-switchblade-300-and-600-loitering-munitions-for-special-forces	2024-10-09T00:01:53-07:00

Delivery of Wolf Armored Trucks to Belgian Army on Track for 2025	On October 1, 2024, the Belgian Defense Ministry announced that the production of Wolf-type armored trucks could soon resume, with the delivery of all 199 vehicles expected by 2025. This announcement marks a step forward in a project that recently faced challenges due to financial difficulties encountered by Jankel Armouring Limited, the British supplier of the Fox and Wolf wheeled vehicles used by the Belgian army. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The LTTV, known as 'Wolf,' is designed to carry eight fully equipped soldiers in its rear compartment, alongside a driver and vehicle commander (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) The LTTV, known as 'Wolf,' is designed to carry eight fully equipped soldiers in its rear compartment, alongside a driver and vehicle commander. With an empty weight of 9.2 tons, the vehicle can reach up to 10.8 tons in service configuration for paratrooper units. The transmission typically operates in automatic mode but can switch to manual for specialized off-road conditions or in case of an automatic mode failure, providing versatile operational capabilities. The LTTV also boasts a theoretical range of 1,200 km, making it suitable for long-duration missions. Earlier this year, Jankel, which also manufactures the Fox RRV (Rapid Reaction Vehicle) used by the Belgian Special Operations Group, faced critical financial issues, initiating a judicial restructuring process on March 8 to resolve its financial situation. This raised concerns about the company’s ability to fulfill its 2018 commitment to the Belgian army, involving a €67 million contract for 199 light troop transport vehicles (LTTV) under the 'Wolf' designation. These vehicles are intended to replace aging Unimog models, contributing to enhanced transport and logistical capabilities within the Belgian armed forces. After securing a 2015 contract to supply the Belgian Ministry of Defense with over 100 Fox Rapid Reaction Vehicles (RRVs), Jankel obtained a second major contract to deliver a new fleet of specialized tactical vehicles under the LTTV program. Jankel’s engineers developed the LTTV to offer modular, mission-adaptable functionality through interchangeable mission modules that allow configuration changes based on operational needs (Picture source: Army Recognition) Jankel’s engineers developed the LTTV to offer modular, mission-adaptable functionality through interchangeable mission modules that allow configuration changes based on operational needs. The platform is equipped with various military subsystems, including a removable ballistic protection kit, a roll-over protection system (ROPS), weapon mounts, and communications setups. This modular design ensures full interoperability with the Fox RRV fleet, enhancing compatibility across the Belgian army’s vehicle inventory. In terms of protection, the LTTV includes an armored floor, bullet-resistant front windshields with independent panels, and additional removable protection kits (RPK) available for cabin doors and the cargo area, offering enhanced security depending on mission requirements. A key turning point occurred on June 30, 2017, when the Belgian Defense Ministry approved the tender process for equipping special operations forces with 199 new armored LTTVs, intended not only for the Special Operations Group but also for paratrooper units. These vehicles will replace the Unimog 1350L models that have been in service since the mid-1990s, with the contract itself contributing to the continued commercial viability of the Unimog model. In June 2024, another significant step was taken when NP Aerospace (NPA), a Canadian-based company, partially acquired Jankel’s activities, ensuring the continuity of its contracts. This acquisition, effective since June 4 following several financial and security audits, allowed NP Aerospace to integrate the production and support operations for the Fox and Wolf vehicles. On September 19, the Belgian Defense Ministry confirmed that the contracts for the Fox and Wolf models had been officially transferred to NP Aerospace, ensuring that the vehicle delivery program would proceed for completion by 2025.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/delivery-of-wolf-armored-trucks-to-belgian-army-on-track-for-2025	2024-10-08T06:55:28-07:00	
Russian Baltic Fleet minesweeper disabled in Ukrainian sabotage in Kaliningrad	According to information published by the Ukrainian Military Intelligence on October 7, 2024, the Russian Navy's minesweeper Alexander Obukhov, stationed in the Baltic Fleet, was rendered inoperative following a sabotage operation attributed to Ukrainian military intelligence.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 12700 Alexandrit minesweeper Aleksandr Obukhov. (Picture source: Sdelanounas) According to reports, the vessel sustained significant damage after water entered its engine compartment through what has been described as a 'mysteriously appeared hole in a gas duct.' The breach led to a critical malfunction, putting the ship out of service. This incident follows an earlier Ukrainian operation in April targeting the Russian missile ship Serpukhov in the same region, which involved the assistance of a Russian sailor opposed to the war. Minesweeper Aleksandr Obukhov The vessel has a displacement of 800 tons in standard load, which increases to 890 tons at full load. It measures 61.6 meters in length and 10.3 meters in beam at its widest point. The draft ranges from 2.6 meters at its shallowest to 3.6 meters at its maximum, with 3.1 meters at midship. Its propulsion system consists of diesel engines, specifically 2 M503B-1 'Zvezda' engines, alongside diesel generators including 2 ADGR-315/1500 OM4 units and 2 DGF2A 200/1500 units. The engines deliver a power output of 2,500 horsepower (1838 kW) each, with additional generators providing 315 kW and 200 kW respectively. The vessel uses two shafts, two controllable-pitch propellers (CPP), two bow thrusters (PU-100F), and two stern retractable azimuth thrusters (VPK-90F/70). The ship achieves an economical speed of 10 knots and a maximum speed of 16.5 knots, with a range of 1,500 nautical miles at 10 knots. It can remain at sea for 10 days and carries a crew of 44. The hull is made of fiberglass. For radar systems, the ship is equipped with the PAL-N radar. Its electronic warfare systems include the KS 'Ruberoid' system, Anapa sonar, the Structure-35 towed sonar array, and the Altyn-M navigation and surveillance system. It features one 30-mm AK-306 anti-aircraft gun, with 1,500 rounds of ammunition. Its missile defense consists of eight Igla-1 or Verba MANPADS, armed with 9M39 or 9K333 missiles. The ship's mine and torpedo systems include UDM, UDM-2, UDM-500, MTPK-1, MTPK-2, MRPK-1, PMR-1, PMR-2, OUKT, OUKT-B, PKT, PKT-B, SHAT-U, and the 'Gelatin' mine-towing simulator. It is also fitted with one 'Livadia-M' mine-hunting sonar. Additionally, the vessel operates an aviation group that includes Orlan-10 UAVs. Comments The incident occurred in Baltiysk, Kaliningrad—a strategic Russian exclave situated between Poland and Lithuania that serves as a crucial naval base hosting the Baltic Fleet and advanced military assets. The successful sabotage operation deep within Russian territory underscores several critical implications. Strategically, it exposes vulnerabilities in Russia's defense of key assets far from the immediate conflict zones. The disruption of a minesweeper like the Alexander Obukhov hampers Russia's ability to secure maritime routes in the Baltic Sea, potentially affecting both military operations and commercial shipping in the region. Psychologically, the incident demonstrates the reach and capabilities of Ukrainian military intelligence and special forces. This could lower morale within the Russian military and boost confidence among Ukrainian forces and their supporters. It reflects a shift towards asymmetrical warfare tactics, where unconventional methods are employed to target high-value assets, thereby altering the traditional dynamics of the conflict.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-baltic-fleet-minesweeper-disabled-in-ukrainian-sabotage-in-kaliningrad	2024-10-08T06:47:03-07:00	
Bundeswehr’s New Reconnaissance Vehicle Korsak Would Be Based on Piranha 6×6	The Bundeswehr is preparing to renew its fleet of reconnaissance vehicles for its military intelligence forces, with the Spähfahrzeug Next Generation project, or 'Korsak,' reportedly progressing on the Piranha 6×6 platform from General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS), as revealed by Hartpunkt. Selected over competitors including Rheinmetall’s Fuchs Evolution and KNDS’s Patria CAVS, the Piranha 6×6 outperformed its rivals during a rigorous bidding process. However, final vehicle approval will require the resolution of appeal periods followed by a parliamentary review of the '€25 million proposal.' If on schedule, the contract may be finalized by late 2024 or early 2025, marking it as a second Bundeswehr project involving the Piranha platform. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications (Picture source: GDELS) The Korsak project aims to partially replace the light, four-wheeled Fennek vehicles currently used by reconnaissance units. According to the Bundeswehr, up to 252 vehicles may be ordered, with an initial order of 92 units confirmed. The first two prototypes are anticipated by 2026, pending a swift contract conclusion. Production delivery of the remaining 90 vehicles would follow in 2027 and 2028, with an option for an additional 162 units. Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications. Compliant with Korsak project requirements, this version is expected to include amphibious capabilities, though it may reduce armored protection to STANAG 4569 Level 2, thereby optimizing mobility with a favorable power-to-weight ratio. The Piranha 6×6 features a unique engine configuration for a reconnaissance vehicle, placing the engine to the driver’s right, unlike the traditional rear placement. This design maximizes roof space for turret and sensor systems, enhancing weapon reach. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets, as showcased at Eurosatory 2024. This cannon provides variable firing modes and a rate of up to 600 rounds per minute. The initial version of the Piranha I 6×6 dates back to 1972, having been adopted by the Swiss Army and produced under license in Chile and Canada. The Canadian version is known as the AVGP and LAV I. Some Chilean Piranha I units were fitted with a 60 mm IMI HVMS (Hyper Velocity Medium Support) gun acquired in 1980, while Swiss Army models included the NM142 turret, capable of launching TOW anti-tank guided missiles. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets (Picture source: Swiss MoD) The latest model, Piranha V, was introduced in the early 2010s. Designed to protect against medium-caliber ballistic threats, it includes a modern electronic architecture for integrating various weapon systems, from medium-caliber automatic cannons to large-caliber fire-support guns. The Piranha V meets current mobility demands on challenging terrain, equipped with a powerful motor and independent suspension, allowing a top speed of 100 km/h and a range of 1,000 km. The Piranha V can transport up to 12 soldiers and is suitable for peacekeeping operations, infantry support missions, and complex interventions. Customization options include modular armor kits, active protection against RPGs and other anti-tank weapons, as well as an amphibious version. It has been adopted by forces in Denmark, Romania, and Switzerland. Korsak does not include anti-tank capabilities, which will instead rely on the troops’ portable weapons. Consideration is also being given to the future use of loitering munitions as an alternative. The vehicle will also include advanced communication systems for voice and data transmission across various frequency bands, enabling teams to relay reconnaissance information or request long-range fire support. The Bundeswehr’s mobility specifications require a maximum road speed of 100 km/h and a range of 1,100 km at a steady 60 km/h. While amphibious capability is preferred but not mandatory, the silent mode requirement remains flexible in terms of technology. Finally, the core reconnaissance mission of the Korsak will rely on an advanced sensor suite. The vehicle will be equipped with a range of optical, optronic, and acoustic sensors, as well as electromagnetic spectrum reconnaissance and self-defense tools.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/bundeswehrs-new-reconnaissance-vehicle-korsak-would-be-based-on-piranha-6-6	2024-10-08T06:11:55-07:00	
Japan JS Ariake and India INS Shakti conduct joint naval exercise in Bay of Bengal	According to information published by the Japanese MoD on October 8, 2024, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) destroyer JS Ariake recently conducted a joint exercise with the Indian Navy replenishment ship INS Shakti in the Bay of Bengal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Murasame-class destroyer JS Ariake and Indian Deepark-class replenishment ship INS Shakti. (Picture source: Japanese MoD) India and Japan share growing concerns about the Chinese Navy's increasing presence in both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. These concerns are driven by China's aggressive territorial expansion, notably in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and its broader strategy to extend its influence across the Indo-Pacific region. For India, China's 'String of Pearls' strategy, which involves building partnerships and establishing naval facilities in countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Myanmar, is seen as an effort to encircle India and limit its influence in the Indian Ocean. China's increasing naval deployments, including submarines, in the Indian Ocean further fuel India's apprehensions. In response, India has been strengthening its maritime surveillance and increasing cooperation with allies, particularly Japan, to counter China's activities. Japan, similarly, faces direct threats from China, particularly concerning the disputed Senkaku Islands (known as Diaoyu in China). China’s assertive actions in the East China Sea and its growing military capabilities have led Japan to bolster its defense, particularly in its southwestern islands, and strengthen its security partnerships, notably through the Quad alliance, which includes India, Japan, the United States, and Australia. Both countries have responded to these threats by enhancing military cooperation. India and Japan recently signed a 10-year military pact that allows for greater coordination between their armed forces, particularly in naval operations. This pact is seen as a strategic move to counter Chinese assertiveness and is part of a broader effort to strengthen the Quad as a counterbalance to China in the region. The two nations regularly conduct joint naval exercises, such as the 'Malabar' exercises, to improve interoperability and readiness against potential Chinese threats. UNICORN India and Japan have recently strengthened their naval defense cooperation, focusing on key technology transfers and joint development projects. At the heart of these efforts is Japan’s decision to export the 'UNICORN' stealth antenna system to India, marking a significant step in their defense relationship. The UNICORN system, officially known as the Unified Complex Radio Antenna, integrates various communication and radar functions to enhance the stealth capabilities of naval vessels. This equipment, initially used on Japan’s Mogami-class frigates, will be installed on select Indian Navy ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-js-ariake-and-indias-ins-shakti-conduct-joint-naval-exercise-in-bay-of-bengal	2024-10-08T05:30:14-07:00

The agreement allows China to use Iranian air and naval facilities, especially in the Persian Gulf, which strengthens both nations’ positions in the region amid shifting geopolitical alliances. China’s defense collaborations have included technology transfers and training aimed at enhancing Iran’s anti-access and area-denial capabilities, especially against aerial and maritime threats. As part of this partnership, Iran may gain access to advanced Chinese weaponry, including anti-drone systems and missile technologies. This defense alliance positions both countries as strategic counterweights to U.S. influence in the Middle East. China’s 'Silent Hunter' laser defense system, recently spotted in Tehran, exemplifies the possible arms transfers that support Iran’s defensive infrastructure against low-altitude aerial threats, marking a significant step forward in bilateral military collaboration. Armed forces find laser systems highly effective against drone threats due to their precision, speed, and low operational costs. Lasers can disable or destroy drones almost instantly by targeting their sensors or structural components, making them ideal for countering swarms of small, low-flying UAVs. These systems also offer scalability in power output, allowing forces to adjust energy levels based on the target type, which is cost-efficient compared to traditional interceptive munitions. Additionally, laser systems generate minimal collateral damage and can operate continuously as long as there is sufficient power, making them reliable assets in defending sensitive locations. Several armed forces worldwide are advancing laser weapon systems to counter the growing threat of drones and other aerial targets. The U.S. military, for example, is developing the High Energy Laser Weapons System (HELWS) to neutralize UAVs and rockets, with tests showing promising results in both mobile and stationary defense settings. Similarly, Israel's 'Iron Beam' is a high-powered laser system designed to intercept drones, mortars, and missiles at close range, supplementing the Iron Dome missile defense system. In Europe, Germany has tested its own laser systems within the Bundeswehr for similar drone defense applications. These developments aim to provide a cost-effective, precise, and responsive defense solution as drone threats evolve in complexity and scale. The introduction of such a system into Iran's arsenal could have substantial implications for regional security dynamics. It indicates a potential deepening of military cooperation between Iran and China, aligning with both nations' strategic interests. Furthermore, it enhances Iran's ability to defend its airspace against increasingly sophisticated drone incursions, which have become a common feature in modern asymmetrical warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iran-deploys-now-chinese-laser-weapon-system-to-protect-high-value-targets-against-aerial-threats	2024-10-08T02:40:42-07:00

US Army aviators Jim Kreutz and Milo Burroughs initiated a study in 1981 to develop an aircraft with high maneuverability at low altitudes and stall resistance. Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites joined this effort, resulting in the development of the ARES under Model No. 151. The aircraft has a canard configuration, with a foreplane that provides pitch control. This foreplane is designed to stall before the main wings, enhancing safety during low-altitude operations. Although initially planned for a turboprop engine, the design was updated to use a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D-5 turbofan engine, producing 13.12 kN of thrust. This change addressed potential issues with debris ingestion during takeoffs and landings on unimproved surfaces. One notable feature of the ARES is its asymmetrical design. It mounts a GAU-12/U Equalizer 25 mm rotary cannon on the right side of the nose, with the engine intake located on the left. This layout minimizes the impact of the cannon's recoil on performance and prevents exhaust gases from entering the engine intake. The cannon is positioned in a concave recess beneath the cockpit to trap exhaust gases and balance recoil forces during firing.

(Picture source: Flickr/Corporate Flight Management) First flown on February 19, 1990, by Scaled Composites test pilot Doug Shane, the ARES has completed over 430 flight hours with the tail number/aircraft registration number N151SC. In November 1991, the ARES tested the GAU-12 Equalizer five-barrel 25 mm Gatling-type rotary cannon under a US Air Force contract, validating its Close Air Support (CAS) capabilities. This testing led to the cannon’s integration into various aircraft, such as the AC-130U Spooky gunship, the AV-8 Harrier II ground attack aircraft, and the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter. Despite its successful demonstrations, the ARES remained a private project as the military did not adopt it for operational use. However, it continues to function as a research test bed. After being stored in December 2000 at the Mojave Spaceport, the aircraft returned to flight on March 7, 2008, following Scaled Composites' acquisition by Northrop Grumman. The ARES remains active as a research test bed, providing services in conceptual design, aerodynamic analysis, structural design, systems integration, and experimental flight testing. In 2020, the ARES was observed flying alongside its successors, the Model 401 'Son of Ares' jets, over the Mojave Desert, showcasing a reflective metallic-like surface coating. This aligns with previous tests involving reflective coatings, possibly related to research on aircraft signatures against sensor systems such as infrared search and track technologies. The Proteus testbed platform by Scaled Composites has also conducted similar flights, equipped with large pods believed to house electro-optical systems.

(Picture source: The War Zone) Defense-related flight testing in the southwest U.S. desert has increased, with Scaled Composites' testbed jets actively participating. Observations of aircraft, such as F-15s equipped with infrared spectrum data-collection test pods, suggest research into infrared search and track systems or low-power laser technologies. Additionally, the ARES has also played the role of a fictional German jet, the ME-263, in the film 'Aces: Iron Eagle III' released in 1992. Specifications for the ARES include a length of 8.97 meters, a wingspan of 10.67 meters, and a height of 2.99 meters. Its wing area is 17.5 square meters, with an empty weight of 1,308 kilograms and a maximum takeoff weight of 2,767 kilograms. Equipped with a single Pratt &amp; Whitney JT15D turbofan engine, the ARES reaches a maximum speed of 750 kilometers per hour at 7,620 meters and has a service ceiling of 10,668 meters. Its combat range is 1,110 kilometers, with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.43 at maximum weight. The ARES is capable of carrying a 25 mm GAU-12/U Gatling cannon and has provisions for air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder or AIM-92 Stinger, as well as unguided rockets and other air-to-ground weapons. Its design emphasizes low-altitude performance and the ability to operate from unimproved airfields, meeting the goals of the original LCBAA program. The aircraft features twin boom-mounted vertical fins for directional stability and uses a canard for pitch control. The structure is composed primarily of fiberglass composite over a foam core, a fabrication technique developed by Scaled Composites. The flight controls are mechanical, and the engine includes a backup mechanical fuel control to maintain control in the event of electrical system failure.

Armenia Eyes South Korea's K2 Main Battle Tank Adapted for Mountainous Terrain	According to an article by the South Korean media outlet Chosun Biz, dated October 4, 2024, Armenian Defense Minister Suren Papikyan visited South Korea in September 2024 to explore the possibility of acquiring K2 Black Panther main battle tanks developed by Hyundai Rotem. This visit also allowed the Armenian minister to attend the 2024 High-Level Meeting on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence (REAIM), organized by South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 9 and 10.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: South Korea MoD) According to the Armenian Military Portal, Papikyan also used this visit to initiate discussions on the supply of South Korean weapons, with a particular interest in the K2 tank. Furthermore, the Armenian media outlet Caliban reports that Armenian Security Council Secretary Armen Grigoryan also traveled to South Korea on September 6 to hold several meetings focused on weapons procurement issues. The K2 main battle tank, currently used by the South Korean Army, features a semi-active pneumatic suspension system, an advanced technology that is especially well-suited to mountainous terrains. In Armenia, where nearly 86% of the territory is mountainous, this capability could provide a significant strategic advantage by enhancing the mobility and precision of troops in combat. Additionally, the tank is equipped with a sensor that automatically adjusts the suspension based on the terrain, further improving accuracy and crew comfort. Currently, according to Military Balance 2024, Armenia’s armored fleet comprises older models, including approximately 109 main battle tanks: 3 T-54s, 5 T-55s, around 100 T-72A/Bs, and 1 T-90A, all inherited from the Soviet era and modernized by Russia. However, it is important to note that these figures may be subject to caution due to losses sustained in the fighting since 2020 in Nagorno-Karabakh. Although these tanks remain in service, the acquisition of the K2 would enable Armenia to acquire state-of-the-art equipment to address persistent tensions with Azerbaijan, a neighboring country with which it has experienced repeated conflicts during the 2020s. In Europe, the K2 tank is already being deployed in Poland, where Hyundai Rotem has become a strategic defense partner. In August 2022, Poland reportedly signed a contract for the delivery of 180 K2 tanks, of which 46 have already been delivered this year, and a new agreement to supply an additional 180 units is under discussion. Romania is also reportedly considering the acquisition of this tank as part of a military modernization program. In competition with the German Leopard 2A8, the K2 has a price advantage, estimated at 26.2 billion won, compared to approximately 60 billion won for the Leopard 2A8, according to available estimates. South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: South Korea MoD) The K2 Black Panther tank was developed in South Korea to achieve self-sufficiency in defense production, replacing the aging M48 Patton tanks. Launched in 1995, this project aimed to create a tank suitable for fast, network-centric maneuver warfare. Hyundai Rotem spearheaded its development, and the tank officially entered service with the South Korean Army (ROKA) in 2014 after extensive testing and prototyping phases. To date, approximately 410 units have been produced across multiple production batches, securing the K2’s place in South Korea’s national defense framework. The K2 is armed with a 120mm 55-caliber smoothbore gun, capable of firing various munitions, including APFSDS rounds and HEAT shells. Thanks to its autoloading system, it can achieve a firing rate of 10 rounds per minute, with a total capacity of 40 rounds. It is also equipped with a Korean-developed munition, the KSTAM (Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition), designed for top-attack strikes against targets within a range of 2 to 8 kilometers. Secondary armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, enhancing its capabilities against both armored and soft targets. Powered by a water-cooled 12-cylinder diesel engine generating 1,500 horsepower, the K2 can reach a maximum speed of 70 km/h on roads and 50 km/h on rough terrain. It has an operational range of approximately 450 kilometers and can accelerate from 0 to 32 km/h in 7 to 9 seconds, depending on the engine model. Its advanced in-arm suspension unit (ISU) allows it to adjust its height and posture, improving its handling over various terrains and expanding its gun elevation range. The K2’s passive protection includes composite armor made of MIL-12560H steel and silicon carbide ceramic plates, supplemented by modular Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Non-Explosive Reactive Armor (NERA) packages. Additionally, the tank is equipped with an overpressure system to defend against chemical and biological threats, an automatic fire suppression system, and neutron shielding to protect the crew from radiation exposure. For active defense, the K2 is equipped with radar and laser warning receivers that detect threats such as anti-tank guided missiles. Upon detection, it can release multispectral smoke grenades, which obscure its position from enemy targeting systems. Under the K2 Product Improvement Program (PIP), future upgrades are planned, including a hard-kill active protection system capable of intercepting incoming projectiles before impact. Primarily operated by the South Korean Army, the K2 has also been acquired or adapted by countries such as Poland and Türkiye. Variants such as the K2GF, customized to Polish military specifications, and the Altay, developed for Türkiye with South Korean technological support, demonstrate this international expansion. Other proposed models, like the K2EX for global export, the K2ME for the Middle East, and the K2NO for Norway, offer specific modifications to meet regional conditions and operational requirements. South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: Army Recognition) According to Military Balance 2024, Armenia has significantly increased its defense budget, allocating USD 1.28 billion for 2023, marking a 46% rise from the previous year. This budget is expected to reach approximately USD 1.4 billion in 2024. Historically dependent on Russia for its military equipment, Armenia is now diversifying its suppliers, partly due to Moscow’s inability to fulfill deliveries agreed upon in 2021, as Russia has redirected resources to meet domestic needs driven by the conflict in Ukraine. To address this shortfall, Armenia has signed several major contracts with India, including the purchase of 90 ATAGS 155mm towed howitzers, an undisclosed number of Pinaka multiple-launch rocket systems, and Akash air defense systems. Armenia is also transitioning to Western defense standards, incorporating NATO-standard artillery, adopting Western military training methods, and embracing advanced command-and-control structures. As part of this shift, Defense Minister Suren Papikyan attended the Paris Air Show in June 2023, signaling Armenia’s growing interest in sourcing defense equipment from the West. France, in particular, has expressed openness to arms sales to Armenia. Before the escalation of hostilities with Azerbaijan in 2023, Armenia had already begun distancing itself from Russia as its primary security guarantor. This shift became evident in 2022 when Moscow declined to intervene during a significant border clash between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In response, Yerevan invited an EU monitoring mission while rejecting a similar proposal from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). The EU Mission in Armenia currently consists of 103 civilian personnel deployed until January 2025, with a possible extension. Furthermore, Armenia has effectively frozen its participation in CSTO activities, underscoring its move away from Russian-led security arrangements.

Turkish president sends off Oruç Reis seismic research ship on mission to Somalia	According to information published by the Turkish presidency on October 5, 2024, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attended a send-off ceremony for Turkey's domestically developed seismic research vessel, Oruç Reis, as it departed for a mission in Somalia. The vessel's deployment follows an agreement signed in March between Turkey's Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and Somalia's Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. This agreement covers onshore and offshore exploration blocks in Somalia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Turkish President Erdogan salutes the departure of the research ship Oruc Reis in Istanbul. (Picture source: Turkish presidency) Accompanying this vessel are two G-class frigates, TCG Gediz and TCG Gokova, which are providing vital naval protection throughout the mission. These frigates, modernized versions of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class, have been extensively upgraded with advanced systems, including the GENESIS combat management system, to enhance their operational capabilities in complex maritime environments. This deployment underscores Turkey's strategic interests in the Horn of Africa, where it has secured exploration rights in a 15,000-square-kilometer maritime zone off Somalia. The mission, expected to last around seven months, will see the Oruc Reis carrying out 3D seismic surveys in multiple license areas. The collected data will be critical in identifying potential drilling sites for future extraction operations. The presence of Turkish naval forces highlights Ankara’s commitment to safeguarding its energy interests, particularly in regions where security risks, such as piracy or regional conflicts, remain high. This operation not only supports Turkey's expanding influence in Africa but also demonstrates the country's broader ambitions to secure energy resources beyond the Mediterranean, where the Oruc Reis previously conducted controversial explorations. Background The Oruc Reis research vessel has been at the center of several contentious explorations, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey's energy ambitions have brought it into direct conflict with neighboring countries such as Greece and Cyprus. The disputes largely stem from overlapping claims to Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) in the resource-rich waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's controversial exploration missions began in 2020, when the Oruc Reis was deployed in areas around the Greek island of Kastellorizo, a region claimed by both Greece and Turkey under competing interpretations of maritime boundaries. Turkey argues that islands should not have full EEZs, a stance that diverges from the positions held by Greece and Cyprus, which rely on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Turkey is not a signatory to UNCLOS and insists on a more flexible interpretation of maritime boundaries to secure its interests in the region These operations escalated tensions between Turkey and Greece, prompting responses such as naval deployments, diplomatic protests, and calls for EU sanctions against Turkey. Several near-miss military encounters occurred during this period, including confrontations between Turkish and Greek naval vessels. The situation became so heated that NATO intervened to establish a deconfliction mechanism to prevent accidental clashes between the two NATO allies​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/turkish-president-sends-off-oruc-reis-seismic-research-ship-on-mission-to-somalia	2024-10-07T02:22:05-07:00

Leidos Successfully Tests Launch of Black Arrow Low-Cost Small Cruise Missile from AC-130J Ghostrider Gunship	On October 3, 2024, Leidos, an American company specializing in defense and advanced technology, unveiled the 'Black Arrow,' a small cruise missile designed to meet the growing needs for flexibility and versatility on the battlefield. Designed for both kinetic and non-kinetic missions, this new system stands out for its low cost and adaptability, offering a wide range of military applications. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Leidos Black Arrow Low-Cost Small Cruise Missile (Picture source: Leidos) Launched in 2021, this program builds on Leidos' experience with small munitions such as the GBU-69, used on AC-130 aircraft, as well as the X-61 Gremlins program developed in partnership with the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA). This project allowed Leidos to test an air vehicle capable of being launched from a C-130 and then recovered mid-flight, demonstrating its expertise in integrating innovative technologies on existing platforms. In 2022, Leidos signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) to advance the development of the Small Cruise Missile (SCM). The SCM is designed to be an economical, modular platform suited to the missions of various branches of the armed forces, with an architecture that facilitates future updates and responds to both kinetic and non-kinetic objectives. According to Leidos, this flexibility allows for a variety of launch options, including ramps, pallets, or conventional systems, depending on tactical needs. As part of its development, the Black Arrow recently completed a series of separation and captive-carry tests aboard an AC-130J Ghostrider, a support aircraft renowned for its firepower. These tests confirmed the weapon’s ability to safely detach from its launcher, as well as the reliability of its trajectory, flight software, navigation, and safety systems. These favorable results pave the way for guided flight tests scheduled for this fall, which will be critical for validating the Black Arrow's flight behavior under real conditions and finalizing necessary technical adjustments before its deployment. The competitive landscape also plays a role in the development of this missile, as other companies, such as Anduril Industries, are also working on low-cost, large-scale cruise missile solutions. This dynamic underscores the importance for Leidos to offer innovative, competitive solutions by integrating components from diverse sources to maintain its leading position in the defense industry. The growing popularity of munitions launched from transport aircraft, such as the AGM-158 JASSM and the Rapid Dragon system, also highlights the strategic interest in this launch type, an approach that could transform the projection capabilities of the U.S. Air Force. Indeed, projection capabilities are radically transformed by the introduction of small cruise missiles like the Black Arrow. Traditionally, missile strikes relied on specialized fighter aircraft, limited in number and range. However, with systems like the Black Arrow, transport aircraft can now serve as launch platforms using ramps or pallets. This innovation allows transport aircraft, such as the C-130 and C-17, to be converted into offensive platforms, significantly increasing the number of military vehicles capable of carrying out precision strikes. Adding this capability provides valuable tactical flexibility. Unlike fighter jets, often too visible in heavily monitored environments, transport aircraft can discreetly deploy missiles in high-tension areas. This gives military forces greater autonomy to strike remote targets quickly, even in the absence of forward bases. This flexibility is particularly strategic for close support missions or operations where surprise and speed are essential. Finally, this approach creates uncertainty for the adversary, who must now consider the possibility that transport aircraft may also be equipped for missile strikes. This new dynamic complicates enemy defense strategies, as it forces opposing forces to rethink their targeting priorities, knowing that an apparently harmless transport aircraft can also carry formidable strike capabilities. Consequently, small cruise missiles like the Black Arrow not only redefine military logistics but also the strategic projection of forces in contested environments, while optimizing engagement costs and flexibility. However, some analysts believe that, in the event of a major conflict, transport aircraft could be primarily mobilized for logistics missions, limiting their use for missile strikes. Mark Miller, Leidos’ Vice President of Missile and Aviation Solutions, highlighted that the rapid development of the Black Arrow benefited from the company’s experience with previous projects, such as the GBU-69 and the DARPA X-61 Gremlins program. These projects illustrate Leidos’ commitment to innovative initiatives, with a particular focus on agility and operational performance. With the Black Arrow, Leidos offers a small, versatile cruise missile designed to meet the modern requirements of the armed forces. By focusing on technological innovation and an open architecture, Leidos continues to enhance military capabilities by providing rapidly deployable solutions suited to various missions. If guided flight tests proceed as planned, the Black Arrow could become a strategic tool of choice, providing the military with enhanced operational flexibility and optimal efficiency in the coming years.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/leidos-successfully-tests-launch-of-black-arrow-low-cost-small-cruise-missile-from-ac-130j-ghostrider-gunship	2024-10-07T01:11:22-07:00

His Majesty’s Canadian Ships (HMCS) Shawinigan and Charlottetown tracked a Russian submarine and several surface vessels across different maritime zones.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Charlottetown and Russian Improved Kilo-class submarine. (Picture source: Canadian DoD) The HMCS Charlottetown (FFH 339) is one of twelve Halifax-class frigates designed for multi-role operations, particularly excelling in anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Technically, this frigate is equipped with advanced sonar systems and weapons that are critical for tracking submarines like the Russian Improved Kilo-class (Project 636.3). The Charlottetown utilizes the SQS-510 Hull-mounted sonar and SQR-501 CANTASS (Canadian Towed Array Sonar System), both of which allow for long-range passive detection of underwater threats. The ship also deploys the AN/SQR-19 towed array sonar, enhancing its capability to detect low-frequency noise emitted by submarines. Supporting these systems is the RUM-139 VL ASROC (Anti-Submarine Rocket) system, which delivers a lightweight torpedo via rocket to a target submarine's location, providing immediate engagement capabilities. The ship can also engage with Mk 46 torpedoes, fired from its twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo launchers. A critical advantage is the CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, which operates off the frigate's deck, extending its ASW range through the deployment of sonobuoys and its own dipping sonar. This combination makes the Charlottetown a formidable opponent in underwater tracking. On the other hand, the Improved Kilo-class submarine (Project 636.3) is among Russia’s most advanced non-nuclear submarines, known for its ultra-quiet operation, especially in shallow or coastal waters. This submarine’s stealth characteristics are enhanced by its MGK-400EM sonar suite and low-noise propellers. Equipped with six 533mm torpedo tubes, it can launch both standard torpedoes and Kalibr cruise missiles, giving it significant strike capabilities. The Kilo-class is designed for multiple mission profiles, including anti-shipping and intelligence-gathering, making it a considerable challenge for ASW forces. Despite the submarine's advanced quieting technologies, the Charlottetown’s towed array sonar and airborne ASW systems allow for a higher chance of detection, even when the Kilo-class is operating in stealth mode. The Charlottetown's ability to coordinate with other NATO assets, including satellite and maritime patrol aircraft, further enhances its operational effectiveness in tracking these submarines across vast distances. The frigate’s command and control systems integrate seamlessly with NATO’s maritime networks, allowing for real-time data sharing and enhancing situational awareness across the task force. This capability is crucial for tracking submarines like the Improved Kilo-class that can operate undetected for extended periods.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-canadian-navy-monitor-russian-submarine-amid-rising-tensions	2024-10-07T00:57:28-07:00

The same site is also responsible for producing Virginia Payload Module launch tubes, allowing Virginia-class submarines to deploy Tomahawk missiles and other future payloads. About the propulsors The propulsors used in the Virginia-class submarines are a key component of their advanced stealth capabilities. Unlike traditional submarines that utilize open-bladed propellers, Virginia-class submarines are equipped with pump-jet propulsors. This modern propulsion system minimizes noise by reducing cavitation, the phenomenon where vapor bubbles form and collapse due to rapid changes in pressure around the blades of traditional propellers. These pump-jet systems are quieter because they operate with a ducted fan inside a nozzle, which shields the blades from direct contact with the water, preventing the loud popping sounds caused by cavitation. This makes the Virginia-class more effective in covert operations and in environments requiring stealth, both in deep-ocean and littoral (coastal) areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/bae-systems-secures-us-navy-contract-for-virginia-class-submarine-propulsors	2024-10-04T02:43:20-07:00
