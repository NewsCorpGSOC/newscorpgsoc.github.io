According to a report by the French National Assembly published in 2013, the unit cost of the Rafale is between 90 and 100 million euros, excluding the weaponry. The aircraft has 14 external hardpoints (13 on the carrier-based Rafale M), five of which are designed for heavy ordnance or external fuel tanks. The Rafale has an empty weight of around 10 tonnes and is designed to carry up to 25 tonnes, including armaments and fuel, making it the only fighter in service capable of carrying 1.5 times its own weight. The Rafale has been used in military operations in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq, and Syria. Its first combat deployment occurred in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2011. In 2011, it carried out strike missions against armored columns in Libya. In 2013, during Operation Serval in Mali, a Rafale conducted a long-range airstrike lasting 9 hours and 35 minutes. The aircraft has also been deployed in counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Syria. The Rafale is designed for carrier and land-based operations and has a takeoff distance requirement of 400 meters. It has a top speed of Mach 1.8 (2,200 km/h) and an operational range of 1,850 km at high altitude. The aircraft is equipped with the RBE2 AA active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and carries various munitions, including Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, SCALP-EG cruise missiles, AASM Hammer guided bombs, and AM39 Exocet anti-ship missiles. The SPECTRA electronic warfare suite provides self-protection and threat detection. The F4 standard introduces upgrades in radar, electronic warfare, and networked communication capabilities. It includes improvements in data processing, artificial intelligence-assisted sensor fusion, and an upgraded helmet-mounted display. The aircraft’s communications systems have been enhanced for network-centric operations, and provisions have been made for the integration of future weapon systems. Flight testing for the F4 standard began in 2021, and the first deliveries occurred in 2023. All newly produced Rafales will be built to this standard, while existing aircraft will undergo retrofitting. In 2019, the French government allocated an additional €2 billion for further development, focusing on adapting the aircraft to evolving operational requirements. The Rafale is currently operated by France, Egypt, India, Qatar, Greece, Croatia, Indonesia, and the UAE. The UAE’s acquisition of 80 Rafales represents the largest single export order for the aircraft to date. Serbia has finalized a contract for 12 Rafales, while Iraq has expressed interest in acquiring 14 aircraft, with discussions reportedly involving payment through crude oil. Bangladesh has also been identified as a potential future operator. Since 2015, more Rafales have been sold internationally than acquired by the French military. Initial export orders were secured by Egypt, Qatar, and India between 2015 and 2016. After a period of limited sales, additional contracts were signed in 2021 and 2022, including deals with the UAE, Greece, Croatia, and Indonesia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/frances-first-rafale-f4-fighter-jet-for-uae-moves-to-initial-flight-testing-after-official-presentation	2025-01-31T00:39:56-08:00

(Picture source: Facebook/Rafał Bieńkowski) Compared to its predecessor, the BTR-60PB, the BTR-70 saw relatively limited production, as it retained some of the earlier vehicle’s shortcomings, such as the dual gasoline engines and restricted troop entry and exit points. These issues became evident during combat, particularly in the Soviet–Afghan War, leading to the introduction of the BTR-80 in 1984. The BTR-80 featured a single 260-horsepower diesel engine and an improved drivetrain, prompting the cessation of BTR-70 production the same year. The Soviet Union exported the BTR-70 to Afghanistan, East Germany, Hungary, and Romania, with Romania producing a local variant, the TAB-77. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many BTR-70s were inherited by post-Soviet states or re-exported. Some countries have retired their fleets, such as Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania, while others have extended their service life through modernization programs, including Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. Currently, Turkmenistan operates the largest fleet of BTR-70s, with approximately 300 units, followed by Russia with around 200. Azerbaijan has 132 units, while Pakistan retains up to 120. Belarus maintains approximately 64 units, North Macedonia 56, and Kyrgyzstan 45, including standard BTR-70s and upgraded BTR-70M models. Mongolia operates 40, Armenia 36, while Georgia and Uzbekistan each have 25. Other operators include Mexico with 26, Ghana and Zambia with 20 each, Tajikistan with up to 20, and Nicaragua and Sudan with smaller numbers. Ukraine, having inherited a substantial number from the Soviet Union, has pursued multiple modernization initiatives, including the BTR-70DI, BTR-70M, BTR-70 KBA-2, BTR-70T, and BTR-70 Varan armored personnel carriers, as well as the BTR-70Di-02 Svityaz command vehicle, the BMM Ark armored ambulance and the BREM-2000 (or BREM-7K), an armored recovery vehicle. The source of the 150 BTR-70DI modernized by Mista is most likely Ukraine, as this specific variant seems to have not been exported to any country, though differences exist in the choice of armament. There has been no official confirmation regarding the recipient of these modernized vehicles, but Ukraine remains the most probable operator, as Mista is also involved in producing the Oncilla, a Polish variant of the Ukrainian Dozor-B 4x4 armored personnel carrier. The upgrades, including Western diesel engines, reinforced protection, and electronic warfare enhancements, align with Ukraine’s operational needs. Additionally, reports confirm that vehicles matching this configuration have been observed in service with Ukraine’s 151st Separate Mechanized Brigade, suggesting that these modernized BTR-70s have been delivered to the Ukrainian military.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-modernizes-150-ukrainian-btr-70di-8x8-armored-personnel-carriers-to-improve-their-effectiveness	2025-01-30T08:01:11-08:00

The integration of S9G pressurized water reactors, derived from U.S. Virginia-class and Ohio-class submarines, ensures that Australia’s SSNs will maintain parity with American and British counterparts in terms of power output, submerged endurance, and operational tempo. These submarines will be optimized for low-acoustic signature propulsion, advanced sonar processing, and high-bandwidth secure communication systems, making them a core component of Indo-Pacific undersea deterrence. The Trump administration’s continued backing suggests that Australia’s nuclear propulsion capability development—including the establishment of domestic reactor sustainment facilities—will remain a priority, with an emphasis on workforce training, regulatory harmonization, and classified material handling protocols. Beyond submarines, AUKUS Pillar II expands the scope of allied defense cooperation into multi-domain warfare capabilities, emphasizing the co-development of advanced weapon systems, electronic warfare integration, and AI-enhanced battle networks. One of the primary areas of collaboration involves hypersonic and counter-hypersonic missile systems, where the U.S. is leveraging its experience with the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system and the U.K.’s high-speed glide vehicle research to accelerate Australia’s indigenous long-range strike capability. The Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise, central to AUKUS Pillar II, is focusing on establishing an Australian production line for next-generation munitions, ensuring logistical resilience for long-range precision fires. This includes the joint manufacturing of AGM-158B JASSM-ER, the integration of PrSM (Precision Strike Missile) variants, and potential Australian involvement in DARPA’s Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) successor program. The technological convergence under AUKUS also extends to networked warfare, with a key emphasis on the integration of Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2)-compliant battle management systems. The U.S. and Australia are working to align their C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) architectures, enabling real-time sensor fusion and multi-domain strike coordination. As part of this effort, AUKUS partners are pursuing a common MQ-28 Ghost Bat autonomy framework, allowing AI-driven sensor-sharing across unmanned platforms, further enhancing distributed lethality concepts within the Indo-Pacific battlespace. Another critical component of AUKUS is force posture realignment, particularly the expansion of U.S. rotational deployments in northern Australia. The U.S. Marine Rotational Force-Darwin (MRF-D) is evolving beyond a training contingent into an expeditionary force with prepositioned stocks of Naval Strike Missiles (NSM), HIMARS rocket artillery systems, and integrated air defense assets. Simultaneously, the enhancement of RAAF Base Tindal and HMAS Stirling as key operational nodes for U.S. and allied SSNs ensures that Australia becomes a strategic hub for undersea warfare operations, supporting not only its own fleet but also forward-deployed U.S. and U.K. assets. The Trump administration’s reaffirmation of AUKUS signals that these basing arrangements will continue, likely accompanied by increased investment in rapid deployment infrastructure, secure data exchange networks, and cross-domain ISR capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/trump-administrations-defense-chief-reaffirms-us-commitment-to-aukus-in-talks-with-australia	2025-01-30T07:19:41-08:00

Flash News: UK Deploys Navy ships and submarine to Shadow Russian Spy Ship Yantar in British Waters	On January 28, 2025, a statement published by the British Parliament confirmed that the UK had deployed Royal Navy and Royal Air Force (RAF) assets to track and monitor the Russian intelligence-gathering vessel Yantar as it moved through British waters. The operation involved a coordinated effort by maritime patrol aircraft, the Minehunter HMS Cattistock, the River-class offshore patrol vessel HMS Tyne, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Proteus, a survey and surveillance ship. In addition, the British Parliament authorized a Royal Navy submarine to surface close to Yantar—strictly as a deterrent measure—to signal that UK forces had been covertly monitoring the Russian vessel’s every move. Following this decisive action, Yantar left UK waters without further loitering and continued its journey towards the Mediterranean.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British Navy RFA Royal Fleet Auxiliary Proteus (background) gets up close with the Russian ship Yantar (foreground), in the Irish Sea in November 2024. (Picture source: UK MoD) According to British defense officials, Yantar is a specialized spy Russian vessel equipped with advanced submersibles capable of deep-sea operations. Western military analysts believe it is used for intelligence collection and for mapping critical underwater infrastructure, including undersea communication cables. Its presence in UK waters has raised significant security concerns, as its activities are viewed as part of a broader strategy by Russia to disrupt Western critical infrastructure. This marks the second time in recent months that Yantar has drawn the attention of British defense forces. In November 2024, the vessel was detected loitering near sensitive undersea infrastructure in UK waters, prompting a similar deployment of British naval and aerial assets. At that time, military officials took measured steps to deter any potential threat, reaffirming the UK’s commitment to safeguarding its territorial waters. The swift and coordinated response on both occasions reflects a broader strategy to counter growing Russian naval activities in the region. The UK government has labeled this latest incident as another example of increasing Russian aggression, which threatens not only its allies abroad but also domestic security. The heads of MI6 and the CIA recently issued a joint statement warning that Russia is waging a 'reckless campaign' of sabotage across Europe. This includes periodic incursions of Russian military aircraft into airspace monitored by the UK. On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 undersea cable between Finland and Estonia was damaged—an act that many analysts believe was caused by a vessel in Russia’s shadow fleet. Such incidents have heightened concerns about Moscow’s intentions and its growing focus on targeting Western infrastructure. British officials have reiterated that Russia remains the most pressing and immediate threat to national security. Addressing Parliament, a senior government representative assured both lawmakers and the British people that any threat would be met with strength and resolve. 'We are delivering on the foundation of security in our plan for change by making Britain secure at home,' they stated. After leaving UK waters, Yantar passed through the Dover Strait and entered Dutch waters. British defense forces continue to monitor the situation closely in coordination with NATO allies. This latest encounter comes as part of an ongoing pattern of Russian military activity near British territory. In September 2024, RAF Typhoons scrambled to intercept two Russian Bear F strategic bombers operating near UK airspace, demonstrating the ongoing vigilance required to counter potential threats. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) service is also playing a crucial role in safeguarding offshore infrastructure. The multi-role ocean surveillance ship RFA Proteus has been instrumental in tracking foreign vessels of interest, reinforcing the UK’s ability to detect and deter potential threats. With tensions between NATO and Russia escalating, the UK is expected to continue strengthening its maritime and aerial surveillance efforts, ensuring that any future incursions by vessels like Yantar are met with a swift and decisive response. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the evolving nature of modern security threats and the importance of maintaining robust defenses against potential adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-uk-deploys-navy-ships-and-submarine-to-shadow-russian-spy-ship-yantar-in-british-waters	2025-01-30T02:50:36-08:00	
Japan’s First F-35B Carrier Landings Backed by UK and US Naval Aviation Experts	According to information published by Forces News on January 21, 2025, a Royal Navy pilot has been actively assisting Japan in its transition to operating the F-35B Lightning II, providing expertise in flight testing and operational procedures to ensure the aircraft’s seamless integration into Japan’s maritime forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Royal Navy pilot supports Japan’s transition to F-35B Lightning II operations, conducting advanced flight trials to optimize carrier integration aboard the newly converted JS Kaga. (Picture source: UK MoD) Japan has been operating the F-35A, the conventional takeoff and landing variant, for several years. However, the introduction of the F-35B represents a shift towards carrier-based air power, as the aircraft’s short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability enables operations from smaller decks and forward-deployed bases. Unlike the F-35A, the B variant incorporates a shaft-driven lift fan behind the cockpit and a rotating rear nozzle for vertical thrust, allowing it to land and take off in confined spaces. These design modifications necessitate specialized pilot training and ship integration trials to determine the aircraft’s full operational effectiveness. The ongoing trials include advanced deck landing procedures that are not typically associated with fixed-wing naval aviation, such as rearward landings and lateral deck approaches, which test the aircraft’s ability to operate in constrained environments. These maneuvers simulate potential real-world operational requirements, where pilots may need to adjust their landing profiles due to deck obstructions or limited available space. The trials also gather extensive flight data, including information on deck heating, jet blast effects, and aircraft handling characteristics under different sea conditions, which will inform Japan’s operational doctrine. The transition to F-35B operations is directly linked to Japan’s decision to convert its Izumo-class multi-purpose destroyers into aircraft carriers, starting with JS Kaga. Originally designed for helicopter operations, Kaga is undergoing significant structural modifications, including flight deck reinforcement to withstand the thermal stress from the F-35B’s vertical landing exhaust, adjustments to the hull shape for improved airflow and stability, and reconfiguration of the deck layout to accommodate jet operations. Unlike traditional aircraft carriers, Kaga will lack a catapult launch system, relying instead on the STOVL capabilities of the F-35B to launch and recover aircraft. The integration of the F-35B into Japan’s Self-Defense Forces represents a substantial investment in next-generation air power, with Japan committing to the acquisition of 42 F-35B aircraft to complement its existing fleet of F-35As. The introduction of this capability aligns with Japan’s broader defense strategy, which focuses on enhancing naval aviation capabilities amid growing regional security challenges. The F-35B’s ability to operate from smaller carriers provides Japan with a highly flexible force projection platform, bridging the gap between traditional land-based fighter operations and full-scale carrier aviation. As part of the UK-Japan defense partnership, British F-35B pilots will conduct operations from JS Kaga later this year during the UK Carrier Strike Group’s Pacific deployment in 2025.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japans-first-f-35b-carrier-landings-backed-by-uk-and-us-naval-aviation-experts	2025-01-30T01:56:36-08:00

As the Type 26 and Type 31 frigates enter service, these new platforms will be equipped with advanced digital infrastructure, allowing seamless coordination with existing warships. Ensuring that legacy vessels remain technologically competitive is equally important, as the transition to a fully modernized fleet takes time. Investments in CMS modernization also align with the UK’s strategic vision for maritime security, which emphasizes deterrence, power projection, and rapid response capabilities. Future conflicts are expected to be characterized by high-speed engagements, cyber warfare, and multi-domain operations, making the ability to rapidly process and act on intelligence a key factor in mission success. Beyond direct combat applications, an upgraded CMS also enhances a warship’s role in intelligence gathering, reconnaissance, and network-centric warfare. The ability to integrate with allied naval forces and share real-time data across joint task forces ensures that Royal Navy assets remain a crucial part of multinational security operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/british-navy-overhauls-combat-systems-to-improve-threat-detection-after-monitoring-russian-vessel	2025-01-29T06:02:12-08:00	
Iran tests new Badr anti-tank guided missile to modernize its infantry strike capabilities	As reported by Patarames on January 28, 2025, Iran has conducted the first publicly documented test of its new Badr anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). The system, which appears to be a modified version of the Almas missile, features a reduced caliber from 130 mm to 110 mm. The Badr ATGM is a single-operator, fire-and-forget weapon with an operational range of up to two kilometers, designed to counter armored vehicles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Compared to the earlier Almas missile, the Badr’s lighter design enables a single soldier to carry and deploy this fire-and-forget weapon without additional personnel or setup while maintaining the ability to penetrate up to 60 centimeters of armor at a range of up to two kilometers. (Picture source: Twitter/Fatherland9_) The caliber reduction has led to discussions about weight reduction and improved portability for individual operators. The lighter design allows a single soldier to carry and deploy the system without additional personnel or setup. Available specifications indicate that the Badr missile can penetrate up to 60 centimeters of armor. The missile has a flight duration of 13 seconds and a total weight of approximately 15 kilograms, contributing to its ease of use. During a recent Iranian military exercise in the western region of the country, the Badr ATGM was tested alongside other weapon systems. The exercise, conducted in the Qasr Shirin to Naft Shahr axis, included joint operations using platforms such as Ababil and Arash Nezaja attack drones. These unmanned systems were used in coordinated attacks and target destruction missions, demonstrating efforts to integrate precision-guided munitions into military operations. Brigadier General Karim Cheshak, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations of the Iranian Army Ground Forces, stated that the Badr missile was one of the new weapons evaluated during the exercise. The new Badr anti-tank guided missile system is expected to replace older models, such as the Saeghe ATGMs, which have been used by Iranian forces and allied groups in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon. This suggests that the Badr ATGM may follow a similar deployment pattern. Footage of the missile launch has been analyzed, with some suggesting that the Badr ATGM employs a high-angle attack trajectory, possibly indicating a top-attack capability. While not officially confirmed, this feature would improve effectiveness against armored vehicles by targeting less protected areas. Additionally, the reduction in caliber compared to the Almas (a copy of the Israeli ATGM) is not easily visible but contributes to reduced weight and increased portability. Some commentators have noted that stability during launch is crucial for operators, but the fire-and-forget capability simplifies its use by eliminating the need for manual guidance after launch. Iran's development of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) dates back to the 1970s with the acquisition of American BGM-71 TOW missiles in 1971. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Iran sought to develop indigenous ATGM capabilities, leading to the production of the Toophan missile, a reverse-engineered variant of the TOW. The Toophan became the foundation of Iran’s ATGM industry, with serial production beginning in the late 1980s. Additionally, Iran developed the Raad missile, modeled after the Soviet 9M14M Malyutka (AT-3b Sagger), which entered mass production in 1988 and was publicly unveiled in 1997. Over time, Iran expanded its ATGM arsenal, introducing more advanced variants of the Toophan and other systems with improved guidance and penetration capabilities. In recent years, Iran has expanded its anti-tank capabilities through the development and deployment of multiple missile systems. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) introduced a ground-launched version of the Almas anti-tank missile in July 2021, a top-attack system with an 8-kilometer range. In April 2023, the IRGC test-fired the Sadid-365, a guided anti-tank missile with a similar 8-kilometer range. In February 2024, Iran unveiled the Shafaq missile system, designed to engage armored targets at distances of up to 20 kilometers. These developments indicate Iran's efforts to improve its precision-guided anti-armor systems and increase the operational range of its anti-tank weapons. Additionally, Iran has renewed its focus on developing indigenous missile systems, including the hypersonic Fatah, the Paveh, and the ballistic Khorramshahr-4 missile, to support its defense strategy and enhance the capabilities of its armed forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/iran-tests-new-badr-anti-tank-guided-missile-to-modernize-its-infantry-strike-capabilities	2025-01-29T05:01:13-08:00

Since 2015, Spanish armed forces have maintained a continuous presence in Adana with a PATRIOT surface-to-air missile battery, operating under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the operational control of Allied Air Command. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The PATRIOT system, designed to intercept and neutralize various airborne threats, plays a crucial role in this mission (Picture source: NATO) This ongoing commitment reflects Spain’s active role within NATO and its contribution to the collective security of its allies. Over the past ten years, the mission has required 21 rotations and involved nearly 3,000 Spanish military personnel, deployed successively to support the protection of Turkish airspace. NATO Support to Türkiye was established to enhance Türkiye’s air defense capabilities with the PATRIOT missile system, an integral component of NATO’s air defense network, designed to counter aerial and ballistic threats. The mission traces its origins to 2013 when the Turkish government requested assistance from NATO due to security risks stemming from the conflict in Syria. Following a decision by NATO foreign ministers, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands deployed PATRIOT batteries to counter ballistic threats. In 2015, Spain took over the deployment, stationing a unit in Adana, where it continues its mission today. Spain currently operates three PATRIOT missile batteries. The first was acquired second-hand from Germany in 2004, followed by two more in 2014, enhancing Spain’s capability to meet NATO air defense requirements. One of these batteries has been permanently stationed in Türkiye since 2015, ensuring continuous surveillance and protection of Turkish airspace. To further strengthen these capabilities, Spain received authorization in October 2023 to acquire four additional PATRIOT PAC-3+ systems for €2.67 billion. This acquisition aligns with efforts to modernize air defense systems and address evolving threats. The PATRIOT system, designed to intercept and neutralize various airborne threats, plays a crucial role in this mission. It includes a passive electronically scanned array radar (AN/MPQ-53 or AN/MPQ-65), an AN/MSQ-104 control station, launchers mounted on M860 semi-trailers towed by M983 HEMTT trucks, and missiles housed in launch containers. Its ability to detect, track, and engage enemy targets makes it a key asset in safeguarding Turkish airspace. With a range of 70 km and an interception altitude exceeding 24 km, the PATRIOT system is capable of countering tactical ballistic missiles, aircraft, and unmanned aerial threats. The PAC-3 variant, featuring direct-impact technology, provides increased precision against ballistic missiles, while each launcher can carry up to four PAC-2 missiles or sixteen PAC-3 missiles, significantly enhancing the system’s firepower. Its rapid deployment capability—less than an hour—and resistance to electronic countermeasures ensure an effective and responsive defense. The continued Spanish deployment in Türkiye relies on close cooperation between NATO allies. As the host nation, Türkiye provides the operational framework for Spanish forces to carry out their mission effectively. Additionally, logistical support from the U.S. Air Force’s 39th Air Base Wing, based in Incirlik, plays a vital role in maintaining the system’s operational readiness. This collaboration underscores the broader alliance commitments to regional and international security. During the ceremony marking this milestone, officials highlighted Spain’s contribution to the mission. Spanish Ambassador to Türkiye, Cristina Latorre Sancho, emphasized that 'Türkiye’s defense is also Spain’s defense,' underlining the principle of allied solidarity within NATO. Brigadier General Kemal Güleç, commander of Incirlik Air Base, expressed Türkiye’s appreciation for Spain’s continued support, stressing the importance of sustained cooperation among allies. After a decade of operations, the Spanish PATRIOT battery continues to provide air defense for Adana and its surroundings, reinforcing NATO’s defensive posture along its southeastern flank. The ongoing deployment reflects NATO’s commitment to ensuring the security of its member states against contemporary threats. More broadly, this mission highlights the strategic importance of allied cooperation in an evolving global security landscape, where technological advancements and operational adaptability remain key priorities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/spain-marks-a-decade-of-patriot-system-deployment-in-tuerkiye-under-nato-command	2025-01-29T04:22:43-08:00	
Analysis: President Trump Orders Next-Gen Missile Shield: How US Plans to Defend Against New Missile Threats?	U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to develop a 'next-generation missile defense shield' to protect the U.S. from aerial threats, including hypersonic weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and cruise missiles. The executive order, signed on January 28, 2025, directs the U.S. Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed plan within 60 days, outlining the technology, deployment strategy, and budget for this ambitious project.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Integrated Battle Command System continues to demonstrate its transformative Air and Missile Defense integration capability through participating in the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor live fire flight tests. LTAMDS is a new, advanced sensor developed to integrate into the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture and will replace the current Patriot radar. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The initiative, being informally called 'America’s Iron Dome,' seeks to reinforce U.S. homeland defense by integrating advanced interception technologies and potentially even space-based defenses. However, the plan raises several key questions: How will it differ from existing U.S. missile defense systems? What additional protection does America actually need? And is such an initiative even feasible given current military capabilities and budget constraints? The United States already has one of the most advanced and layered air and missile defense architectures in the world, protecting against various threats ranging from enemy aircraft to ballistic missiles. This system comprises land, sea, and space-based assets that work together to detect, track, and neutralize potential threats. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is the U.S.'s primary defense against long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched by adversaries like North Korea, China, and Russia. It is based in Alaska and California, with 44 interceptor missiles designed to engage incoming threats outside the Earth's atmosphere in mid-flight. However, the GMD system has been criticized for inconsistent test results and limited capacity against multiple incoming missiles or decoys. Deployed on U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system can intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system uses the SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 interceptors and is crucial for defending the U.S. fleet and key allies such as Japan and South Korea. Aegis Ashore installations in Romania and Poland also serve as land-based missile defense sites against regional threats. Meanwhile, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their final phase before impact. It is deployed in locations such as Guam, South Korea, and the U.S. mainland, providing additional protection for key military installations. Unlike Israel’s Iron Dome, THAAD does not counter short-range threats like drones and artillery. The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system is widely used for defending against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and enemy aircraft. Patriots have been deployed in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific to counter threats from adversaries such as Iran and North Korea. However, their effectiveness against hypersonic missiles remains a concern. For short-range air defense, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) is used to defend Washington, D.C., and key locations against cruise missiles, drones, and aircraft. The Avenger system, mounted on Humvees, provides mobile low-altitude protection against drones and helicopters. Beyond ground-based defenses, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) provides early missile warning by detecting heat signatures from launches around the globe. Future Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensors (HBTSS) will enhance tracking and targeting of hypersonic weapons. Trump’s new directive aims to create a more comprehensive defense system that goes beyond the existing regional and strategic defenses currently in place. Unlike Israel’s Iron Dome, which specializes in intercepting short-range rockets and artillery, Trump’s version is expected to address ICBMs, hypersonic missiles, and long-range cruise missiles. The system may incorporate directed energy weapons (lasers) and space-based interceptors to neutralize threats earlier in flight. Current defenses are focused on military installations and strategic sites. Trump’s proposal might include localized air defense systems for major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. The plan could involve integrating AI and advanced radar networks to detect and neutralize incoming threats faster. However, several challenges and concerns exist. Missile defense is expensive. The existing GMD program alone has cost over $67 billion, and THAAD and Aegis programs also require billions in maintenance and upgrades. A nationwide missile shield could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, raising concerns about affordability and congressional approval. Technical feasibility is also a major concern. Intercepting hypersonic missiles is extremely difficult. China and Russia are rapidly advancing their hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) programs, and current U.S. defenses struggle to track and intercept them. Space-based interceptors, while promising, have not yet been proven effective in real-world scenarios. Geopolitically, Russia and China have strongly opposed U.S. missile defense expansions, arguing that such systems could destabilize global strategic balance. A more advanced U.S. missile shield might provoke adversaries to develop more offensive missile capabilities, triggering a new arms race. Trump’s new missile defense initiative marks a major shift in U.S. national security strategy, aiming for comprehensive homeland protection beyond current regional defenses. While enhancing air defense is crucial given the rise of hypersonic and advanced missile threats, the plan faces significant technical, financial, and geopolitical hurdles. As the Pentagon prepares its report within 60 days, the world will be watching closely to see whether Trump’s vision for a next-generation missile shield will become a revolutionary step in U.S. defense—or an unattainable dream.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-president-trump-orders-next-gen-missile-shield-how-us-plans-to-defend-against-new-missile-threats	2025-01-29T03:58:16-08:00	
Spanish Navy’s Flagship to Operate SIRTAP Drone for Next-Gen Carrier-Based Drone Missions	According to information published by Airbus on January 28, 2025, Airbus and Navantia have launched an initiative to integrate the SIRTAP tactical unmanned aerial system (UAS) into the Juan Carlos I (L61) amphibious assault ship. This effort focuses on seamless integration with the ship’s combat systems, secure real-time data transmission, and safe launch and recovery procedures in maritime conditions. The initiative reflects a broader trend in modern naval warfare, where unmanned systems play an increasingly critical role in surveillance, reconnaissance, force projection, and operational flexibility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Spanish drone SIRTAP on the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I. (Picture source: Airbus Defence) The core of the integration lies in linking SIRTAP with the SCOMBA combat management system, which acts as the command and control backbone of the ship. This requires adapting the UAV’s data transmission capabilities to work within the ship’s sensor fusion and fire control network, ensuring real-time situational awareness across all operational units. The challenge involves optimizing latency-free communication between the UAV and onboard operators, allowing for effective reconnaissance and target acquisition. This will demand a robust, encrypted data link capable of resisting electronic warfare threats, ensuring that adversaries cannot disrupt ISR operations through jamming, cyber intrusions, or signal spoofing. Operating a fixed-wing UAV from a ship like the Juan Carlos I requires precise launch and recovery adaptations. The ship’s flight deck, originally designed for Harrier fighter jets and helicopters, lacks the catapult systems typically used for fixed-wing UAVs. Airbus and Navantia must either develop a dedicated net or arrestor-based recovery system or modify SIRTAP’s software for precision-assisted landings using optical, radar, and inertial navigation cues. Stability during takeoff and landing is further complicated by the ship’s movement, deck pitching, and unpredictable wind patterns, requiring advanced stabilization algorithms and real-time course corrections to ensure successful drone operations in varying sea states. The flight control software and autonomous guidance system must be modified to integrate with the ship’s aviation coordination framework. This includes adapting the UAV’s autopilot to work with ship-based navigation radars and inertial stabilization systems, ensuring precise positioning even in rough seas. The ability to execute automated landings with AI-assisted adjustments for wind conditions, deck movement, and aircraft deconfliction is critical, especially when operating in a mixed-aircraft environment. With existing air operations including AV-8B Harrier II jets, NH90 helicopters, and SH-60 Seahawk helicopters, the introduction of a UAV requires new air traffic control protocols, ensuring that drone launch and recovery do not interfere with manned aircraft operations. Expanding the ISR capabilities of Juan Carlos I, SIRTAP will provide beyond-line-of-sight reconnaissance, essential for anti-submarine warfare, maritime interdiction, amphibious assault coordination, and early warning threat detection. The UAV’s ability to track surface contacts, monitor littoral zones, and relay real-time intelligence to deployed forces significantly extends the ship’s operational reach, reducing reliance on traditional airborne surveillance assets. With its multi-sensor payload, including electro-optical, infrared, and maritime radar systems, SIRTAP can detect and track naval threats, identify irregular maritime activity, and provide force protection against asymmetric threats such as swarm drone attacks or small fast-attack craft. The integration of an automated launch and recovery system (ALRS) will be essential for enabling repeatable, reliable UAV operations at sea. The lack of a dedicated runway means SIRTAP will require either a shipborne recovery system using arresting cables, nets, or a robotic arm-assisted capture mechanism, or modifications that allow short-roll landings on the deck with rapid retrieval. Launch operations must also account for deck stability, wave motion, and wind interference, requiring adaptive flight control settings based on real-time meteorological and ship movement data. With increasing reliance on network-centric warfare, ensuring secure UAV communication and data sharing within the Spanish Navy’s fleet-wide tactical network is crucial. SIRTAP’s integration must support multi-platform interoperability, allowing data to be distributed not just to the Juan Carlos I but also to supporting assets such as frigates, offshore patrol vessels, and allied maritime task forces. To achieve this, Airbus and Navantia will likely implement tactical datalink protocols similar to NATO’s Link 16 or Link 22 standards, ensuring that ISR feeds can be shared with joint and coalition forces for enhanced situational awareness and coordinated mission execution. The introduction of SIRTAP aboard Juan Carlos I represents a technological leap in Spanish naval doctrine, marking the first true integration of a tactical UAV into a Spanish Navy amphibious and power projection platform. Beyond its immediate ISR benefits, the program paves the way for future UAV deployments across Spain’s surface fleet, including potential applications aboard the F-110 frigates and BAM offshore patrol vessels. The knowledge gained from integrating a fixed-wing UAV into a naval aviation environment will inform future unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) programs, shaping the next generation of manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) concepts in Spanish maritime operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/spanish-navys-flagship-to-operate-sirtap-drone-for-next-gen-carrier-based-drone-missions	2025-01-29T03:55:11-08:00

He reassured that a thorough investigation would be conducted to identify the factors behind the crash and to implement measures that would help prevent future incidents. Authorities have also urged local residents and travelers not to stop along the Richardson Highway near Eielson AFB, as this could pose safety risks and hinder recovery efforts. Federal law prohibits photography in the area. This latest crash adds to a series of 15 recorded incidents involving the F-35 since its introduction. The F-35 program, one of the most advanced fighter aircraft programs in the world, has now delivered nearly 1,000 aircraft to multiple operators, including the United States, NATO allies, and partner nations. Despite these incidents, the F-35 remains one of the safest fighter aircraft in modern air combat, thanks to its advanced pilot protection systems. A key factor in ensuring pilot survivability is the Martin-Baker US16E ejection seat, designed to provide safe ejection at various altitudes and speeds. The aircraft also features an advanced Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS), which enhances situational awareness and reduces the risk of pilot disorientation, a factor in previous crashes. Additionally, the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) has been credited with preventing multiple accidents by automatically correcting flight paths to avoid terrain collisions. The F-35’s structural integrity, fire suppression systems, and redundant flight controls further enhance pilot safety, ensuring that even in the event of a crash, pilots have the highest chance of survival. The Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where the crash occurred, plays a strategic role in U.S. and allied military operations, particularly in Indo-Pacific air defense and Arctic security. The base was selected in 2016 to host 54 F-35A aircraft, making it a key hub for fifth-generation fighter operations in the region. The F-35A Lightning II, the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant, is known for its stealth capabilities, advanced sensor fusion, and networked combat systems, making it a critical asset in modern air warfare. While the F-35 program has faced technical challenges and occasional accidents, it continues to evolve with software upgrades, avionics improvements, and enhanced pilot training. Each crash is followed by a detailed investigation to improve safety protocols and address any mechanical or pilot-related issues. The findings from the Eielson AFB crash will contribute to further improvements in operational readiness and flight safety. The most recent F-35 crash before this one occurred on September 17, 2023, when a U.S. Marine Corps F-35B crashed in South Carolina after the pilot ejected due to a flight control malfunction. That incident gained widespread attention because the aircraft continued flying on autopilot for nearly 60 miles before crashing in a remote area. Other notable crashes include the December 1, 2022, crash in Texas, where an F-35B suffered an issue during a vertical landing test, and the October 19, 2022, crash in Utah, where an F-35A crashed after pilot disorientation led to a loss of control. Despite these incidents, the F-35 program remains the most widely adopted fifth-generation fighter aircraft worldwide. The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, along with international operators like the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Italy, and Israel, continue to expand their fleets, reaffirming confidence in the aircraft’s combat effectiveness and safety record.

French Army Responds to Growing Drone Threat with New Anti-Air Capabilities	As aerial threats evolve rapidly and high-intensity conflicts resurface in Europe, France is accelerating the modernization of its air defense and counter-drone capabilities. The 2024-2030 Military Programming Law prioritizes surface-to-air defense, allocating a total investment of €5 billion over the period. This program aims to upgrade anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, renew low-altitude defense capabilities, and enhance counter-drone measures. Within this framework, the French Directorate General of Armament (DGA) has awarded contracts worth €600 million to KNDS, MBDA, and Thales, benefiting all three branches of the French armed forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Army will receive two newly developed versions of the Serval Light Multi-Role Armored Vehicle (VBMR-L), tailored for surface-to-air defense and counter-drone operations (Picture source: Army Recognition) The French Air and Space Force, which transferred part of its twelve Crotale NG short-range air defense systems to Ukraine as part of military assistance, will receive eight VL MICA launchers along with associated munitions. This order supplements the first units delivered in 2024, which were deployed to secure the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games. The VL MICA NG missile is designed to improve interception of hard-to-detect targets, such as drones and small aircraft, while remaining effective against evolving threats with increasingly reduced infrared and electromagnetic signatures. These launchers will provide enhanced engagement capabilities against modern threats, with improved reactivity and interoperability with other defense systems. According to the Military Programming Law, the Air and Space Force is expected to operate twelve VL MICA launchers by 2035, with nine planned by 2030. This procurement seeks to offset the temporary reduction in capabilities caused by the transfer of Crotale NG systems, ensuring a gradual transition to more advanced and efficient solutions. The integration of these new launchers will not only strengthen the defense of critical sites but also improve responsiveness to aerial incursions at a time when the widespread use of drones and cruise missiles is making airspace security increasingly complex. The French Army will receive two newly developed versions of the Serval Light Multi-Role Armored Vehicle (VBMR-L), tailored for surface-to-air defense and counter-drone operations. The Serval DSA, ordered in 30 units, will be equipped with MBDA’s ATLAS RC remote-controlled turret, which can fire two MISTRAL missiles while operating under armored protection with an advanced fire control system. This vehicle is designed to provide mobile air defense for ground units, creating a protective bubble adapted to high-intensity operations. The Serval LAD, with an initial order of 24 units, will be specifically configured for counter-drone missions. It will feature a remotely operated turret armed with a 30mm cannon and an autonomous detection system combining radar and radio frequency sensors. These detection capabilities will enable continuous airspace monitoring, identifying and tracking drones before they pose a threat to deployed forces. Given the increasing use of attack, reconnaissance, and loitering drones in modern conflicts, this mobile and responsive system is intended to enhance the protection of ground units. These vehicles will provide additional protection against aerial threats, including manned aircraft, drones, and loitering munitions capable of targeting vehicles and strategic infrastructure. By offering a rapid and effective response to low-altitude aerial attacks, the Serval DSA and Serval LAD will complement existing ground-based air defense systems, which have traditionally been limited to fixed or semi-mobile platforms. This integrated approach will allow ground forces to operate with greater mobility while reducing their vulnerability to aerial strikes. These acquisitions represent a progressive expansion of the French armed forces’ air defense and counter-drone capabilities. They will complement the next-generation SAMP/T NG missile systems developed by EUROSAM, which provide medium-range surface-to-air coverage against advanced aerial threats. With this modernization effort, France aims to develop a coordinated and adaptive air defense system to protect deployed forces, critical infrastructure, and national airspace from increasingly sophisticated threats. The integration of these new systems will support a more resilient and dynamic air defense posture, enabling the French armed forces to better address evolving battlefield challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/french-army-responds-to-growing-drone-threat-with-new-anti-air-capabilities	2025-01-29T01:18:17-08:00

F-35s from Three Nations Conduct Joint Drills in Guam to Strengthen Indo-Pacific Air Operations	Amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, the air forces of Japan, the United States, and Australia are set to conduct a large-scale military exercise in Guam, marking a significant step in their trilateral cooperation. For the first time, F-35 stealth fighters from all three nations will operate together in the Cope North exercise, scheduled from February 3 to 21 at Andersen Air Force Base. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan will deploy six F-35As, two E-2D Hawkeye early warning aircraft, a KC-46A Pegasus tanker, and 250 personnel from the 3rd Air Wing, Airborne Warning and Control Wing, and 3rd Tactical Airlift Group (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) Organized under the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) command, this exercise aims to enhance interoperability between the participating forces and strengthen their ability to conduct complex operations in a modern combat environment. The focus will be on aerial combat and large-force employment, providing an opportunity for pilots and command structures to refine their coordination against opponents with similar capabilities. General Hiroaki Uchikura, Chief of Staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), emphasized the importance of this training in evaluating strategies and tactics against comparable threats. The F-35A Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole stealth fighter developed by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. Air Force under the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. As the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant of the F-35 family, it is designed for air superiority, precision strikes, and close air support. Equipped with advanced stealth, cutting-edge avionics, and real-time sensor fusion, the F-35A is capable of operating in contested environments, detecting and engaging targets beyond visual range (BVR). Its AN/APG-81 AESA radar, Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provide enhanced situational awareness, complemented by the Helmet-Mounted Display System (HMDS), which projects tactical data directly onto the pilot’s visor. The F-35A carries a diverse array of armaments, including an internal M61A2 Vulcan 20mm cannon, AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, as well as GBU-31 JDAM and GBU-39 SDB guided bombs for precision strikes. The integration of the AGM-88 HARM missile allows it to conduct suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions. Designed for interoperability with allied forces, the aircraft has been adopted by multiple nations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Norway, and other NATO and strategic partners. Powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135-PW-100 engine, it reaches speeds of Mach 1.6 with a combat range of over 2,200 km, making it a key asset in modern air operations. Japan will deploy six F-35As, accompanied by two E-2D Advanced Hawkeye early warning aircraft and a KC-46A Pegasus tanker, with approximately 250 personnel from the 3rd Air Wing, the Airborne Warning and Control Wing at Misawa Air Base, and the 3rd Tactical Airlift Group at Miho Air Base. Cope North, first launched in 1978 as a bilateral U.S.-Japan training exercise, has evolved into a large-scale multinational operation, incorporating Australia in 2012. In 1999, the exercise moved from Misawa to Guam in response to expanding operational requirements, allowing for larger deployments and more comprehensive combat simulations. The increasing role of the F-35 in joint operations reflects the three nations’ commitment to strengthening deterrence capabilities in the region. In 2023, the JASDF deployed two F-35s to Australia for the first time, seen as a preparatory step for potential future deployments. This rapid relocation capability holds strategic importance amid growing regional security concerns. The vulnerability of Japanese air bases to ballistic and cruise missile threats has led Japan to explore alternative operational strategies to ensure continuity in a conflict scenario. The potential use of allied bases, particularly in Australia and Guam, would enable more effective force dispersion in case of hostilities. Andersen Air Force Base, located at a greater distance from China, serves as a key hub for trilateral air operations. However, the expansion of China’s long-range strike capabilities has prompted the United States to consider additional options, such as Wake Island, to bolster its defense posture. This exercise highlights a significant shift in military cooperation within the Indo-Pacific. The joint deployment of F-35s by these three nations underscores their shared objective of maintaining regional security and stability amid evolving threats. Through Cope North, the air forces of the United States, Japan, and Australia continue efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, reinforcing operational readiness and enhancing mutual capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/f-35s-from-three-nations-conduct-joint-drills-in-guam-to-strengthen-indo-pacific-air-operations	2025-01-29T00:34:47-08:00	
Breaking News: Philippine Army to Begin Training with US MRC Typhon Missile System in February 2025	According to information published on Military Cognizance Facebook account on 28 January 2025, approximately 20 soldiers from the Philippine Army's artillery regiment are set to begin specialized training with the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Typhon missile system in February 2025. The training, which will focus on the advanced capabilities of the Typhon system, particularly its cruise missile capabilities, will not involve live-fire exercises. This initiative marks a significant step in the Philippines' ongoing defense modernization efforts and strengthens the military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On June 27, 2023, the U.S. Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, in collaboration with Soldiers from the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force and the U.S. Navy's Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons, successfully demonstrated the launch of a Tomahawk missile from the Army's prototype Mid-Range Capability system. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Typhon missile system is the nickname for the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) system, which is designed to address a critical gap in the U.S. and allied defense capabilities. This system is capable of launching long-range missiles, providing the flexibility to strike a wide range of targets with precision. The Typhon is especially significant due to its versatility and operational mobility, as it can deploy rapidly and engage a variety of targets across large distances. The Typhon is specifically designed for mid-range missile defense, enabling high-precision strikes in regions where traditional long-range or short-range systems would be less effective. Key missile systems compatible with the Typhon MRC include the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) and the Tomahawk Block V cruise missile. The SM-6 is a multi-role missile capable of targeting air, surface, and ballistic missile threats. Its inclusion in the Typhon system allows for effective anti-air and anti-surface warfare, giving it an edge in countering advanced threats such as enemy aircraft, drones, and maritime assets. The Tomahawk Block V, one of the most advanced versions of the Tomahawk cruise missile, is a long-range, precision strike weapon that can target land-based facilities, including command centers, missile sites, and other strategic infrastructure. The Philippines' interest in acquiring the Typhon system stems from its strategic location in the South China Sea, an area that has become a focal point of heightened military tensions, particularly with China. China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea directly challenge Philippine sovereignty, making the acquisition of advanced missile systems like Typhon crucial for enhancing the country's defense capabilities. The Typhon’s long-range strike capabilities would significantly strengthen the Philippine military's ability to protect its maritime and airspace borders. The system’s combination of SM-6 and Tomahawk Block V missiles offers the Philippines a potent deterrence against potential regional threats, particularly from adversaries with sophisticated air and naval assets. As China continues to expand its military presence in the South China Sea, the Philippine government sees the Typhon system as a vital component of its defense modernization efforts, which are aimed at enhancing the country's ability to defend its territorial integrity and safeguard its strategic interests. This training initiative is part of broader defense cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines, built on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The Typhon system was deployed during the Balikatan joint exercises in 2024, a clear demonstration of the growing military interoperability between the two nations. Despite strong objections from China, the Typhon missile system remains stationed in the Philippines, symbolizing the deepening defense ties between Washington and Manila. The Philippines has expressed its desire to acquire its own Typhon launchers, with discussions about this potential acquisition ongoing. Philippine officials recognize the strategic importance of having such advanced missile capabilities as part of the country’s defense infrastructure. The upcoming training is expected to prepare Philippine forces for the potential operational integration of the Typhon system, ensuring that the military is fully equipped to manage and deploy the system should the country move forward with acquiring its own launchers in the future. The integration of the Typhon missile system into the Philippine military would not only strengthen its defense capabilities but also have significant implications for the regional security environment. By acquiring the Typhon, the Philippines would enhance its position within the broader security architecture of the Indo-Pacific region, which continues to experience rising tensions, particularly in relation to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The training of Philippine Army personnel on the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Typhon missile system marks a pivotal moment in the country's defense modernization. As the Philippines looks to enhance its deterrence capabilities and build stronger defense relationships with the U.S. and other allies, the Typhon missile system, with its advanced SM-6 and Tomahawk Block V missiles, will play a crucial role in securing the nation’s strategic interests and strengthening its defense posture against potential regional threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-philippine-army-to-begin-training-with-us-mrc-typhon-missile-system-in-february-2025	2025-01-28T07:46:07-08:00	
US Navy's Medium Landing Ship (LSM) Program: Transforming Amphibious Warfare for Indo-Pacific	The Navy Medium Landing Ship (LSM) Program: Background and Issues for Congress, published on January 23, 2025, examines the Navy’s initiative to develop a fleet of 18 to 35 cost-effective amphibious vessels, a key component of the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy, aimed at enhancing U.S. operational agility in Indo-Pacific maritime environments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The US Navy's new Medium Landing Ship (LSM) will play a pivotal role in supporting the Marine Corps' island-hopping operations under the Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy in the Indo-Pacific. (Picture source: US Congress) The U.S. Navy’s Medium Landing Ship (LSM) program, formerly known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW) initiative, is a crucial component of the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy. Designed to operate in contested maritime environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, the program aims to procure between 18 and 35 amphibious ships. These vessels will enhance the Marine Corps’ ability to rapidly deploy, maneuver, and sustain small, mobile units as part of the broader U.S. military concept of Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO). The Navy’s proposed FY2025 budget includes $268.1 million to procure the lead ship in the program. Subsequent vessels are expected to be less costly due to the distribution of nonrecurring engineering and design costs, with per-ship costs stabilizing around $152.5 to $155.7 million by FY2029. The first ship in the class, named LSM-1 'McClung' in honor of Major Megan M. L. McClung, a Marine Corps officer killed in action during the Iraq War, is expected to be delivered in February 2029, following a contract award in March 2025. The LSM program emphasizes affordability, simplicity, and operational efficiency. The ships are smaller and less expensive to operate than traditional amphibious vessels like the LHA, LHD, and LPD classes. They are designed with a shallow draft, enabling them to operate in littoral waters and beach directly onshore. Each ship will have the capacity to transport 50 Marines, 648 short tons of equipment, and provide approximately 8,000 square feet of deck cargo space. Equipped with a helicopter landing pad, roll-on/roll-off beaching capability, and light defensive armament, the LSM is tailored for the Marine Corps’ vision of swift, distributed, shore-to-shore operations. The LSM is essential to the Marine Corps’ EABO strategy, which focuses on small, platoon-sized units maneuvering across island chains to deny adversaries sea control. These units are envisioned to operate from remote bases, conducting missions such as firing anti-ship cruise missiles, providing forward arming and refueling for aircraft, and delivering intelligence and early warning capabilities. The LSM’s ability to transport, sustain, and support these forces will play a pivotal role in countering potential adversaries, particularly China, in the Western Pacific. Congressional oversight of the program has intensified, with concerns about cost estimates, schedule risks, and design stability. Historical challenges with lead-ship construction in Navy programs, such as significant cost overruns and delays, remain a point of contention. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected higher per-ship costs than the Navy’s estimates, with a potential average cost of $340-430 million compared to the Navy’s projection of approximately $150 million per ship for the first eight vessels. In December 2024, the Navy canceled its original Request for Proposals (RFP) for the LSM program due to higher-than-expected bids and is now exploring the acquisition of non-developmental vessels as an interim solution. Efforts to refine the program include examining the possibility of adapting existing Army Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) or using commercially available designs to meet operational needs. Army watercraft, such as the General Frank S. Besson-class and Runnymede-class vessels, have been identified as potential options for bridging the capability gap. These vessels, already equipped with beaching capabilities and significant cargo capacity, could provide a cost-effective alternative while the Navy works to refine the LSM’s final design. The industrial base implications of the program are another critical aspect under congressional review. The Navy has indicated a preference for having a single shipyard build all LSMs but remains open to multi-yard construction if it expedites delivery or reduces costs. The program has the potential to distribute shipbuilding work across multiple U.S. yards, fostering competition and strengthening the industrial base. However, lawmakers have expressed concerns that delays or design immaturity could lead to costly rework and jeopardize the program’s long-term affordability. The Marine Corps has also explored interim solutions to address the operational gap before the LSM becomes operational. These include chartering civilian vessels, using existing Navy platforms like the Expeditionary Fast Transport (T-EPF), and experimenting with commercially available stern landing vessels. These bridging efforts aim to support Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs), which have already begun forming in regions like Hawaii, where they are tasked with testing the EABO concept in realistic scenarios.

Trump Launches Iron Dome Project to Protect US From Ballistic Missiles	On January 27, 2025, in a speech delivered in Miami, President Donald Trump announced the launch of an ambitious missile defense project aimed at protecting the United States from a wide range of threats, including ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missiles. Dubbed the 'Iron Dome for America,' the initiative draws inspiration from Israel's well-known system designed to intercept rockets and short-range missiles while incorporating advanced technologies tailored to the specific needs of the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The partnership between Raytheon Technologies and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has led to the development of the SkyHunter, a U.S.-adapted version of Israel’s Iron Dome (Picture source: Army Recognition) In an executive order signed the same day, Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to submit a detailed plan within 60 days for this defense shield. Among the proposed solutions are space-based interceptors, underscoring the administration's interest in leveraging space technologies for national defense. 'The United States will not remain passive in the face of countries like China and Russia advancing militarization in space,' Trump stated, linking this initiative to earlier efforts during his first presidency, such as the creation of the Space Force in 2019. Trump emphasized that the system would provide unparalleled protection, similar to the Israeli Iron Dome, which has demonstrated its effectiveness by intercepting thousands of rockets launched from Gaza and Lebanon. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in collaboration with Israel Aerospace Industries, the Iron Dome relies on the EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptor missiles to counter short-range threats with an interception rate close to 90%. However, many experts argue that simply replicating the Iron Dome technology would not be sufficient to defend a nation as vast as the United States, which primarily faces threats from intercontinental and hypersonic missiles. These advanced threats demand more sophisticated solutions, potentially including orbital platforms and laser defense systems. The current geopolitical environment, marked by the growing missile capabilities of China and Russia and the proliferation of advanced missile technologies, highlights the need for an adaptable and robust defense system. Space-related threats, such as anti-satellite weapons and hypersonic missiles capable of evading conventional systems, have further driven the Trump administration to explore innovative defensive measures. In 2024, Israel demonstrated the effectiveness of a multi-layered defense system during an attack involving over 300 Iranian drones and ballistic missiles. This approach, combining the Iron Dome with the David’s Sling and Arrow systems, may serve as a model for the U.S. However, adapting this concept to the scale and complexity of U.S. defense requirements poses significant challenges. Since 2019, the U.S. Army has acquired two Iron Dome batteries to protect specific strategic bases from localized attacks. The partnership between Raytheon Technologies and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has led to the development of the SkyHunter, a U.S.-adapted version of Israel’s Iron Dome. Designed to intercept and neutralize rockets, artillery shells, drones, and short-range missiles, the SkyHunter retains the key features of the Iron Dome, including the EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptors. However, it has been tailored to meet specific U.S. requirements. As part of this collaboration, Raytheon localized part of the production process, establishing a manufacturing facility in Arizona to produce critical components such as the Tamir interceptors. This move not only strengthens the U.S. defense industrial base but also ensures compliance with congressional mandates for domestic production, making the SkyHunter a vital asset in America’s layered defense strategy. Trump has insisted that this new system will be fully designed and manufactured domestically, highlighting the importance of national technological capabilities. However, the financial, technological, and strategic hurdles remain considerable. Developing a defense shield incorporating space-based interceptors will require extensive research and significant funding, raising concerns about the feasibility of achieving such a goal within a reasonable timeframe. While the concept of an 'Iron Dome for America' represents a recognition of modern threats, its realization faces numerous challenges. This project has the potential to become a pivotal development in U.S. national defense, but its success will depend on overcoming technical, financial, and political obstacles in the coming months.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/trump-launches-iron-dome-project-to-protect-us-from-ballistic-missiles	2025-01-28T01:14:43-08:00

The first two jets were delivered in late 2024, signaling the beginning of their integration into Iran’s air force as replacements for older American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, acquired in the 1970s. These new jets will complement Iran's existing fleet, which includes Russian MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft, as well as domestically produced models like the Saeqeh and Kowsar. Iran has made significant upgrades to its airbases to accommodate the Su-35SE. Notably, the first two Su-35SE jets were delivered disassembled by cargo plane to Tehran, where they were subsequently assembled at Hamadan Air Base. This base, also referred to as the 3rd Tactical Air Base, now features new, larger hangars specifically designed for these larger aircraft. Additionally, Iran has constructed fortified facilities, including the underground Eagle 44 airbase unveiled in early 2023, to enhance the security and operational readiness of its air assets, including its Su-35s. These facilities are strategically located near Tehran, key nuclear sites, and regions requiring rapid air defense response, ensuring that the new fighters can operate securely and effectively while reducing vulnerability to airstrikes in centralized locations. Alongside the Su-35SE, Iran has acquired Yak-130 trainer aircraft, with deliveries starting in 2023, and Mi-28 attack helicopters, reportedly for use by the Revolutionary Guard Corps. In October 2024, reports also indicated that Iran has expressed interest in Su-30 fighter jets and may seek a license production agreement for both Su-35 and Su-30 aircraft, with plans for producing between 48 and 72 units. However, economic constraints and technical challenges make the feasibility of domestic production uncertain. While the F-35I Adir's stealth features reduce its radar cross-section, the Su-35SE's infrared search and track (IRST) system can detect aircraft based on heat signatures, potentially mitigating this advantage. (Picture source: Twitter/J.J.) Iran and Russia have been increasingly strengthening their military and economic ties in recent years, particularly in the face of Western sanctions. In early 2024, Iran joined the BRICS geopolitical bloc, aligning itself more closely with nations seeking alternatives to the Western-led global order. The comprehensive strategic partnership agreement signed between Tehran and Moscow emphasizes joint military efforts against common threats, intelligence exchanges, and collaboration to counter sanctions. For instance, Iran has supported Russia with drones and ballistic missiles during the conflict in Ukraine, while Russia has reciprocated with the delivery of modern assets, including the Murmansk-BN electronic warfare system to counter Israeli F-35s. The Su-35SE is an export version of the Sukhoi Su-35, a 4+ generation multirole fighter jet developed as a modernization of the Su-27 Flanker. It incorporates modern avionics, twin Saturn AL-41F1S afterburning turbofan engines, and thrust-vectoring nozzles, which contribute to its maneuverability. The Irbis-E radar, a passive electronically scanned array, can detect and track up to 30 targets simultaneously and engage up to eight, with a maximum detection range of 400 kilometers for larger targets. The Su-35 is equipped with 12 hardpoints, supporting a payload of up to 8,000 kilograms, including air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, and a 30mm GSh-30-1 internal cannon. While not designed as a stealth aircraft, it features electronic countermeasure systems aimed at disrupting enemy radar and missile systems, improving its operational survivability. With a combat radius exceeding 2,000 kilometers and the ability to launch the R-37M missile, capable of tracking targets at ranges up to 400 kilometers, the Su-35 allows Iran to project power across the region, including the Straits of Hormuz and beyond, as well as conduct extended air patrols over the Persian Gulf. These capabilities could improve Iran's ability to monitor and potentially challenge Turkish, Israeli, and US naval operations in the region, secure key air corridors, and provide air support to allied forces in conflict zones such as Syria. The Su-35’s combination of advanced radar and missile systems also strengthen Iran’s ability to counter air incursions and defend strategic sites. Additionally, its deployment at fortified bases such as Hamadan Air Base and Eagle 44 ensures the security and operational readiness of the aircraft, which could influence the defense strategies of regional adversaries, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, while reshaping the balance of air power in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Su-35SE offers specific capabilities that could be considered advantageous against the Israeli variants of the American F-35 Lightning II, F-15 Eagle, and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Its Irbis-E radar can detect targets at ranges up to 400 kilometers, which may allow it to identify non-stealth aircraft such as the F-15I Ra'am and F-16I Sufa before being detected. In beyond-visual-range (BVR) scenarios, the Su-35SE's R-37 missiles have a longer range compared to the AIM-120D missiles used by these fighters. In within-visual-range (WVR) engagements, its thrust-vectoring engines enable high maneuverability, which could provide an advantage over the F-15I and F-16I. While the F-35I Adir's stealth features reduce its radar cross-section, the Su-35SE's infrared search and track (IRST) system can detect aircraft based on heat signatures, potentially mitigating this advantage. Actual combat performance would depend on factors such as pilot expertise, mission objectives, and supporting systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/analysis-irans-confirmation-of-su-35-fighter-jet-purchase-could-threaten-us-air-superiority-in-the-middle-east	2025-01-28T01:01:49-08:00

US Army Revises Future XM-30 Combat Vehicle Requirements to Counter Lessons from Ukraine Conflict	The U.S. Army has requested to update its technical requirements for the future XM-30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle (MICV), taking into account the valuable lessons learned from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War. These updates are aimed at addressing the evolving threats posed by anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which have had a devastating impact on modern armored vehicles. Among the key updates is the integration of advanced active protection systems (APS) designed to shield the vehicle from these emerging threats. However, the question remains: will these APS be sufficient to address the full spectrum of dangers that have emerged in the Ukraine conflict? The XM-30’s design reflects a broader trend of adapting military hardware to counter the vulnerabilities exposed by recent combat operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment participate in a virtual simulation at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, offering feedback on potential crew configurations for the XM30 Combat Vehicle. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The XM-30 is a rebranding of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program, which was initiated to replace the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV). The Bradley, in service since 1981, has long been an essential platform for U.S. mechanized infantry units, providing mobility, fire support, and the ability to engage enemy combat vehicles. Over the years, it has undergone several upgrades, but it has now reached the technological limits of its capacity to integrate new electronics, armor, and defensive systems. Past efforts to replace the Bradley, including the Future Combat System (FCS) and Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) programs, were canceled due to cost overruns and programmatic challenges. The OMFV program, which began with the goal of creating a next-generation fighting vehicle, was designed with optionally manned capabilities. This means that the vehicle could operate with or without a crew, depending on the operational situation. This flexibility is essential in modern warfare, where unmanned systems and semi-autonomous technologies are becoming increasingly significant. The optional manning concept would allow the vehicle to operate remotely, minimizing risks to the crew in high-threat environments. The OMFV aimed to provide a versatile platform that could maneuver soldiers, engage in close combat, and deliver lethality while operating alongside unmanned systems. On June 26, 2023, after completing the initial digital design phase, the Army officially redesignated the OMFV as the XM-30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle. The XM-30 will be an integral part of the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) and is slated to replace the M-2 Bradley to provide the capabilities needed to engage and defeat near-peer adversaries. The XM-30 will not only transport soldiers but will also enhance their effectiveness in combat through its advanced technology, including the ability to control robotics and semi-autonomous systems. The vehicle’s optionally manned design ensures that it can operate with or without a crew, depending on the mission requirements. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has revealed a series of lessons about the vulnerability of armored vehicles to modern weapon systems. ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided Missiles) and UASs (Unmanned Aerial Systems) have emerged as primary threats to traditional armored platforms, with Ukrainian forces making extensive use of systems like the Javelin and NLAW to destroy Russian tanks and IFVs. At the same time, drones have proven to be an especially lethal threat, often used for precision strikes against armored vehicles. These platforms, which can fly at low altitudes and strike vulnerable targets with guided munitions, have highlighted the need for armored vehicles to evolve in response to these emerging threats. The vulnerability of armored vehicles to ATGMs is particularly concerning. These missiles, which can be launched from a distance by enemy forces in hidden or mobile positions, have been highly effective against tanks and IFVs. Similarly, UAS have demonstrated their ability to conduct precision strikes against armor, often targeting vulnerable points like turret rings or the tops of vehicles, where the armor is thinner. These new threats emphasize the importance of developing Active Protection Systems (APSs) that can detect and neutralize incoming projectiles before they reach their targets. In response to these threats, the XM-30 will be equipped with advanced APS designed to defend against ATGMs, rockets, and projectiles. APS are systems that use a combination of sensors and countermeasures to intercept and destroy incoming threats. These systems can include radar-guided interceptors, jammers, and even high-energy projectiles designed to neutralize missiles and rockets. The Army has identified APS as essential to the XM-30’s design to protect the vehicle from the types of threats that have become increasingly common in modern conflict. The integration of APS into the XM-30 is a direct response to the lessons learned from the Ukraine conflict, where drones and ATGMs have significantly impacted the effectiveness of armored vehicles. While APS like the Iron Fist or AMAP-ADS have shown promise in countering ATGMs, the challenge remains in adapting these systems to deal with the variety of threats now present on the battlefield, especially the diverse and fast-moving drones. UAS, with their low cost and high versatility, can be used to harass armored vehicles from a variety of angles, making them difficult targets for traditional defense systems. To address these challenges, the APS on the XM-30 will likely combine both kinetic and electronic countermeasures to address a broad range of threats. In addition to APS, the XM-30 will likely incorporate advanced electronic warfare capabilities to counter the growing threat of drones. These systems could include jammers that disrupt drone communications and guidance systems, or even directed-energy weapons (DEWs) designed to disable or destroy small drones mid-flight. With drones being used increasingly in swarms, APS will need to be adaptive and responsive, capable of distinguishing between threats and neutralizing them in real-time. The development of the XM-30 also highlights broader trends in armored vehicle design, particularly the shift toward multi-functional platforms that can operate alongside autonomous systems and integrate robotics. The vehicle is designed not only to transport soldiers and engage in combat but also to control and coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles and robotic systems on the battlefield. This approach allows for more flexible and dynamic operations, especially in complex, fast-moving combat environments. In the face of emerging threats and changing warfare dynamics, the XM-30 represents a significant evolution in infantry fighting vehicles. By incorporating advanced active protection systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and semi-autonomous features, it promises to enhance the survivability and lethality of U.S. forces in future conflicts. The lessons learned from the Russia-Ukraine War have played a pivotal role in shaping the XM-30’s design, ensuring that it will be better equipped to face the challenges posed by modern anti-tank systems and drones. As these technologies continue to evolve, the XM-30 will serve as a cornerstone of future U.S. Army operations, providing a new level of capability for mechanized infantry and setting the standard for next-generation combat vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-revises-future-xm-30-combat-vehicle-requirements-to-counter-lessons-from-ukraine-conflict	2025-01-27T09:34:12-08:00

Despite this, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu has reaffirmed the strategic importance of the A400M for French forces, while emphasizing the need to secure new export contracts to ensure the program’s economic viability and maintain the production chain. The Airbus A400M is a versatile military transport aircraft designed by Airbus Military to meet the tactical and strategic needs of modern armed forces. Equipped with four Europrop TP400-D6 turboprop engines, it can carry up to 32 tons of equipment, heavy machinery, or armored vehicles over distances of 2,300 nautical miles at a maximum speed of 780 km/h. Its adaptable cargo bay can accommodate up to 108 paratroopers, helicopters, or a mix of troops and cargo, while its onboard systems enable autonomous operations, even on short or rough airstrips. The aircraft can also undertake missions such as medical evacuation, aerial refueling, and transport in crisis zones. The A400M incorporates advanced technologies, including a night-vision-compatible glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and modern defensive aids such as radar and infrared detectors, electronic countermeasures, and flare dispensers. Its robust and innovative design, including composite wings and woven-fiber propellers, makes it more efficient and reliable than its predecessors. Capable of operating at low altitudes or up to 11,300 meters, it offers flexibility, performance, and reduced operating costs, meeting the demands of both military and humanitarian missions. Despite these recognized capabilities, the A400M has struggled to attract new clients in Europe, where countries like the Netherlands and Sweden have opted for Embraer's C-390 Millennium to modernize their aging C-130 Hercules fleets. In this context, Poland presents a significant opportunity for Airbus. The country, seeking to replace its second-hand C-130E/H aircraft acquired from the United States, has been identified by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius as a potential client. During a visit to Airbus's Bremen facility, which produces the A400M’s fuselage, Pistorius confirmed a 'very specific interest' from Poland and noted that discussions are ongoing. Reports suggest that the Polish Air Force could consider acquiring ten aircraft. However, the A400M program faces substantial challenges. German labor unions warn that production could cease as early as 2027 or 2028 if no strategic decisions are made. This outlook raises concerns, particularly for workers at the Bremen facility, a key site in the aircraft's manufacturing process. Following Pistorius's visit, A400M program director Gerd Weber emphasized the critical situation. While Germany, as the largest operator with 53 aircraft, has met its contractual obligations, export orders remain insufficient to offset reduced purchases from historical clients such as Spain and France. This situation has also highlighted tensions over the distribution of production value. According to observers cited by Hartpunkt, it is problematic that France and Spain retain equivalent shares in production despite their reduced orders, as this contradicts the usual European practice of proportional value distribution in defense projects. In response, German unions have proposed relocating the A400M’s final assembly line from Seville to Bremen, adding to the existing challenges among European partners. Amid this uncertain environment, Airbus and its partner nations are intensifying efforts to promote the A400M internationally. German Defense Minister Pistorius has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to supporting the export of this strategic aircraft, while negotiations with Poland offer a potential lifeline for the program. Nonetheless, the A400M’s future depends on swift decisions and strengthened cooperation among stakeholders to overcome the economic and industrial challenges threatening its continuity. Poland’s interest in the A400M represents a significant opportunity for Airbus in the context of declining orders and uncertainties about production sustainability. However, the situation remains critical, requiring urgent action to safeguard this emblem of European aeronautical industry—one that embodies shared technological ambitions yet faces the realities of global markets and shifting national priorities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/polands-interest-in-airbus-a400m-revives-export-prospects-for-european-transport-aircraft	2025-01-27T00:32:08-08:00

Breaking News: US Greenlights MK-84 Bombs for Israel Despite US President Donald Trump's Foreign Military Sales Pause	On January 25, 2025, The New York Times reported that despite a temporary three-month halt on foreign military sales imposed by President Donald Trump, the U.S. government is preparing to proceed with a significant shipment of bombs to Israel. This shipment will include 1,800 MK-84 bombs, a variant of the general-purpose bomb that has been used extensively by the U.S. and allied forces for decades. According to an anonymous White House official, the 900 kg (2,000-pound) bombs are set to be delivered to Israel as part of continued U.S. military support following the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An Israeli F-35I fighter jet from the 5601 Testing Squadron, equipped with Mk-84 bombs fitted with GBU-31 JDAM kits, prior to a bomb release test. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The MK-84 is an American-made high-explosive, general-purpose bomb with a weight of around 900 kg (2,000 pounds), making it one of the largest bombs in the U.S. arsenal. This bomb is designed to deliver a massive payload of explosives, capable of devastating both hardened and soft targets. The bomb is filled with a large charge of trinitrotoluene (TNT) or an explosive equivalent and is known for its extensive blast radius and ability to penetrate deep into structures before detonating. Due to its sheer destructive power, the MK-84 is often employed against large infrastructure targets such as military installations, enemy supply lines, and heavily fortified structures. However, despite its combat effectiveness, the MK-84 is generally considered too lethal for urban combat, particularly in densely populated areas. Its blast radius and potential for collateral damage are significant concerns, especially when dealing with targets near civilian zones. U.S. military officers have expressed reservations about deploying such powerful ordnance in environments where minimizing civilian casualties is a priority. For this reason, its use in Gaza, where Hamas operates in urban settings, has sparked ongoing debates within defense circles about its appropriateness. The U.S. decision to supply Israel with the MK-84 bombs is part of a broader military support strategy that has included various munitions throughout the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. This support is crucial as Israel continues to confront a complex battlefield, where Hamas has built a vast network of tunnels and underground facilities in densely populated areas. While critics argue that the MK-84’s destructive power can lead to heavy civilian casualties, proponents stress its utility against Hamas’s fortified positions. The bombs’ ability to target hardened structures such as tunnels, weapon caches, and command centers provides the Israeli military with a critical advantage in neutralizing Hamas’s infrastructure. The MK-84 bomb is a versatile weapon that can be deployed by several different aircraft platforms, making it an asset in joint operations across various theaters of war. It is typically dropped by aircraft equipped with specialized bomb racks, and it is compatible with a wide range of combat aircraft, including the U.S. and Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighters, which are key components of the Israeli Air Force’s tactical capabilities. These aircraft are capable of delivering a wide range of ordinance, including the MK-84, with precision targeting systems, ensuring that the bombs are released with maximum effectiveness. Israel’s advanced F-35 stealth fighters are also capable of carrying and deploying the MK-84. With its advanced avionics and stealth capabilities, the F-35 can deliver this heavy ordinance with minimal risk of detection, making it particularly useful in high-stakes operations where stealth and surprise are paramount. Additionally, while the U.S. B-52 bomber, though not currently in active service with Israel, can also carry the MK-84, its use would likely be limited to larger, strategic bombing missions, as would be the case with the B-1B Lancer and B-2 Spirit bombers, which are also capable of deploying the MK-84. The MK-84 bomb shipment comes at a critical time as Israel continues its military operations in Gaza. Following the U.S. government's pause on foreign military sales, the shipment of these bombs signals a return to normalcy in defense aid. Throughout the Biden administration's tenure, the U.S. has sent a variety of munitions to Israel, including precision-guided munitions, bombs, and ammunition, to help bolster its defense against Hamas and other militant groups operating in the region. Notably, the Biden administration has faced internal and external pressures regarding the continued supply of weapons to Israel, particularly due to concerns over civilian casualties. However, U.S. officials have justified their support by emphasizing the need to ensure Israel’s right to self-defense and its ability to combat threats posed by Hamas. While the MK-84 bomb remains one of the most powerful and destructive bombs in the U.S. arsenal, its role in modern warfare is balanced by its potential for collateral damage. As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, the use of such heavy ordnance in urban environments will likely remain a contentious issue, but its effectiveness in striking heavily fortified targets in Gaza ensures its continued presence in Israel’s military inventory. With the resumption of bomb shipments, the U.S. is reinforcing its strategic partnership with Israel as both nations work to address the ongoing security threats in the Middle East.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-us-greenlights-mk-84-bombs-for-israel-despite-us-president-donald-trumps-military-sales-pause	2025-01-26T07:34:47-08:00

Using MLRS to lay mines allows for a highly mobile and effective means of creating minefields, without relying on more detectable or vulnerable platforms like dedicated mine-laying ships. The ability to rapidly deploy mines over a large area with the Fajr-5 makes this method a powerful tool for disrupting naval traffic, particularly in regions like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a vital passage for global oil shipments. Sea mines, in general, have long been a weapon of choice in asymmetric warfare. They are particularly effective in chokepoints or high-traffic maritime areas where they can significantly hinder the movement of enemy naval forces or commercial shipping. By using a rocket artillery system to deploy these mines, Iran has found a way to enhance its capacity for maritime denial, particularly in critical corridors like the Strait of Hormuz or the Bab-el-Mandeb. Given the importance of these waterways in global energy transit, the ability to use rockets to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines could have disastrous economic and geopolitical consequences. Iran’s development of this capability is not entirely unprecedented, though it is relatively unique. Countries like Russia have also employed artillery-based systems for laying mines. Russia’s Zemledeliye system, for instance, uses rocket artillery to deploy mines in both land and sea environments. This method allows for the rapid establishment of minefields and can be employed to target both land forces and maritime vessels. Such systems have become increasingly important in modern warfare, particularly for nations and militias that lack the resources to compete with superior naval powers directly. The concept of using missile-launched sea mines is gaining traction in many parts of the world, with countries like North Korea and Ukraine also having explored similar methods to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries. Despite this, Iran's application of the Fajr-5 to lay sea mines is particularly significant due to the strategic context in which it is deployed. The ability to lay mines using MLRS systems can significantly alter the balance of power in maritime regions, particularly in the Middle East. For instance, if Iran’s MLRS capabilities were to be shared with proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthi rebels in Yemen, these groups could gain access to a highly effective method of disrupting the flow of global energy. In fact, it is precisely in these contested regions that the tactical advantage of laying mines without the need for traditional naval assets becomes most apparent. Groups that might otherwise be unable to challenge the naval might of Western powers could employ such systems to effectively cut off vital maritime routes, creating uncertainty and economic disruption on a global scale. The use of the Fajr-5 MLRS for laying sea mines underscores the broader strategic shift towards asymmetric warfare in which countries and non-state actors are increasingly relying on low-cost, high-impact tactics to undermine superior military forces. This tactic, while not entirely unique, adds to the growing trend of countries and factions leveraging missile systems in unconventional ways to achieve tactical goals. For Iran, which is already well-versed in asymmetric naval tactics, the ability to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines enhances its power projection in strategic maritime regions. The global ramifications of this new development could be far-reaching. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil supply passes, could become a highly contested zone. The ability to rapidly lay sea mines in such areas could give Iran—or any actor equipped with similar technology—substantial leverage over global shipping and energy flows. In times of conflict, such minefields could cripple naval operations, halt commercial shipping, and disrupt the global economy. As tensions in the region continue to simmer, this new capability becomes a tool of naval denial, forcing adversaries to reconsider their strategies in regions where free passage has traditionally been guaranteed. Iran’s recent demonstration of using the Fajr-5 MLRS to lay sea mines represents a game-changing development in modern naval tactics. While missile-based mine-laying is not entirely new, the use of the Fajr-5 system for this purpose adds a new layer of asymmetric warfare to Iran’s already extensive military playbook. The potential for other nations or proxy groups to adopt similar strategies raises serious questions about the future of maritime security, particularly in regions vital to global trade and energy. As more nations and militant groups gain access to such technologies, the world may see an increasing number of missile-laid minefields, which could reshape the landscape of modern naval warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-demonstrates-fajr-5-rocket-launcher-for-sea-mine-laying-threatening-global-maritime-security	2025-01-26T02:05:03-08:00	
Exclusive: US Navy USS Lyndon B. Johnson Destroyer to Integrate Hypersonic Missiles Enhancing Modern Naval Warfare	The U.S. Navy's USS Zumwalt class destroyer is poised for a major leap in combat capabilities with the integration of hypersonic missile systems. According to a recent report from Interesting Engineer, the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, a ship within the Zumwalt-class, is set to undergo rigorous testing as the first at-sea platform equipped with the next-generation hypersonic missile system. This significant milestone underscores the Navy’s ongoing modernization efforts and its commitment to fielding cutting-edge technology. The integration of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system, a key component of the U.S. military’s hypersonic capabilities, will position the Zumwalt-class as a formidable force in future naval combat.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USS Lyndon B. Johnson Zumwalt-class destroyer undergoes significant modernization, with the two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems replaced by hypersonic missile launchers, enhancing its offensive capabilities for long-range precision strikes. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Zumwalt class is a series of advanced guided-missile destroyers designed with versatility in mind. These ships are built to handle various missions, from precision strikes to air and missile defense. Recognized for their stealthy appearance, Zumwalt-class ships feature a reduced radar cross-section, which allows them to operate covertly and evade detection in hostile environments. The class is equipped with advanced technologies, such as an integrated power system, a highly efficient hull shape, and the capacity to deploy both conventional and sophisticated weaponry. Initially intended to be equipped with a 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS) for shore bombardment, the Zumwalt-class ships have undergone significant modifications to suit modern naval warfare needs better. These changes have transformed the ships into highly adaptable platforms capable of housing more advanced weapon systems. Hypersonic missiles represent a transformative shift in naval warfare, and their inclusion in Zumwalt-class destroyers will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the fleet. Hypersonic weapons are defined as projectiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5—five times the speed of sound. This extreme velocity, combined with their maneuverability, makes hypersonic missiles incredibly difficult for traditional missile defense systems to intercept. As such, they offer a significant advantage over conventional missiles. In the context of naval warfare, hypersonic missiles bring several strategic benefits. First, their high speed drastically reduces the reaction time available to enemy defense systems, making it more difficult for adversaries to mount an effective countermeasure. Hypersonic missiles are also highly maneuverable during flight, enabling them to adjust their trajectories unpredictably, further complicating interception efforts. Additionally, these missiles are capable of long-range precision strikes, allowing naval forces to target critical assets from distances well beyond the reach of conventional weapons. The CPS system, for example, is designed to strike targets over 1,000 nautical miles away, which is ideal for engaging adversary targets in highly contested regions without the need for close proximity. The speed and unpredictability of hypersonic missiles also allow for surprise attacks, overwhelming enemy defenses before they can react. The transformation of the Zumwalt class destroyer to accommodate hypersonic missile systems began in 2023, marking a pivotal step in the Navy’s strategic shift. The first phase of this modernization involved removing the ship's original 155mm AGS, which had proven to be ineffective for modern operational needs. In its place, four vertical launch system (VLS) missile tubes were installed. Each VLS tube is capable of launching three hypersonic missiles, providing the Zumwalt class with the ability to carry up to 12 of these advanced munitions. This redesign required substantial modifications, including reconfiguring the ship’s bow to house the new missile tubes and integrating systems that can support hypersonic launches. Despite these changes, the ship’s rear gun mount, equipped with an auto-loading system, remains intact, preserving its multi-role combat flexibility. The inclusion of hypersonic missiles positions the Zumwalt class as a dominant offensive platform. According to Captain Lawler, the integration of the CPS weapon system makes the Zumwalt-class destroyer the 'foremost offensive surface combatant,' capable of delivering long-range precision strikes against high-value targets in future naval operations. With these enhancements, the Zumwalt class will play a crucial role in the Navy's ability to project power in maritime theaters, capable of striking strategic targets with unmatched speed and accuracy. The comparison between hypersonic and conventional missiles reveals significant advantages for the former. Conventional missiles, such as cruise or ballistic missiles, typically travel at subsonic or supersonic speeds, giving adversaries ample time to detect and intercept them. In contrast, hypersonic missiles' extreme speed makes them far more challenging to counter. Furthermore, conventional missiles tend to follow more predictable ballistic paths, making them easier to track. Hypersonic missiles, however, can alter their trajectory mid-flight, allowing them to avoid interception and penetrate even the most sophisticated missile defense systems, such as Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense or THAAD. The operational profile of the Zumwalt-class destroyer will be radically altered with the addition of hypersonic missiles. While traditional missile-equipped destroyers focus on anti-air warfare or strike missions, Zumwalt-class destroyers equipped with hypersonic weapons will be able to conduct precision strikes at far greater ranges, providing a near-guaranteed success rate against high-priority, time-sensitive targets. The ability to deliver powerful blows from such a distance offers a level of flexibility and survivability that was previously unattainable with conventional systems. With the integration of hypersonic missile systems, Zumwalt-class destroyers, especially the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, are set to become an essential part of the U.S. Navy's future combat strategy. These advanced missiles provide unprecedented speed, range, and flexibility, ensuring that Zumwalt class ships will be capable of executing rapid, precise strikes while maintaining resilience against enemy defenses. As the U.S. Navy continues to push the boundaries of technological innovation, the deployment of hypersonic missiles represents a pivotal moment in enhancing naval power projection. This transformation guarantees that the U.S. Navy will maintain its status as a dominant force in global naval warfare, ensuring operational superiority for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/exclusive-us-navy-uss-lyndon-b-johnson-destroyer-to-integrate-hypersonic-missiles-enhancing-modern-naval-warfare	2025-01-25T08:09:54-08:00

India’s Submarine Revolution: German-Indian Collaboration Brings AIP to Navy	According to information published by Reuters on January 23, 2025, the German-Indian joint venture led by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender for India's ambitious $5 billion Project-75(I) submarine program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link German built Type 214 submarine. (Picture source: TKMS) India’s Project-75(I) is one of the most ambitious and long-awaited defense acquisition programs, aimed at revitalizing the country’s submarine fleet to counter growing threats in the Indian Ocean region. With a budget of $5 billion, the program seeks to procure six next-generation diesel-electric attack submarines equipped with cutting-edge technologies, including air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. Following a rigorous evaluation process, the joint venture between German shipbuilder ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender, after the Spanish consortium of Navantia and Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) failed to meet critical requirements. The program was envisioned as an extension of the original Project-75, under which MDL collaborated with French company Naval Group to produce six Scorpène-class submarines. These submarines, while a significant leap forward at the time, lack AIP technology, which is now critical for modern naval operations. The objective of Project-75(I) is to develop a new class of conventional submarines that can stay submerged for extended periods, enhance stealth capabilities, and feature cutting-edge weapons and sensor systems.

This system operates silently, significantly reducing the submarine’s acoustic signature, a critical factor in modern anti-submarine warfare. Navantia proposed a design based on its S-80 Plus submarine, which is still under development and has yet to achieve operational deployment. The S-80 Plus relies on a bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, which converts bio-ethanol into hydrogen for powering fuel cells. While innovative, this system has not been field-proven to the extent of TKMS's AIP technology. Moreover, Navantia’s design faced setbacks in the past, including issues with buoyancy calculations that delayed Spain’s own submarine program. These technical challenges may have undermined confidence in their ability to meet the Indian Navy’s rigorous specifications. In terms of industrial partnership, Larsen &amp; Toubro is a leading Indian defense company with significant expertise in shipbuilding and engineering. However, its collaboration with Navantia was relatively nascent compared to the established relationship between TKMS and MDL, which had successfully navigated previous submarine-building challenges under Project-75. The centerpiece of the competition was the AIP system, a transformative technology for diesel-electric submarines. Conventional submarines without AIP must surface or use a snorkel to recharge their batteries, making them vulnerable to detection. AIP systems, by contrast, allow prolonged underwater endurance and enhanced stealth. The hydrogen fuel cell system used by TKMS is regarded as one of the most mature and efficient AIP technologies available. It operates silently, generates no vibrations, and produces minimal heat, making detection by thermal and acoustic sensors difficult. Navantia’s bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, while innovative, introduces potential complexities in fuel management and system integration. Its unproven track record compared unfavorably to TKMS’s operationally validated system, which has seen years of deployment and performance refinement. Both contenders proposed submarines capable of carrying heavyweight torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, and land-attack cruise missiles. TKMS’s Type 214 is already compatible with a range of munitions, including the DM2A4 SeaHake torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The S-80 Plus, while theoretically offering similar versatility, is still undergoing integration testing for many of these systems. On the sensor front, both designs emphasized advanced sonar suites, electronic warfare capabilities, and integrated combat management systems. However, TKMS’s submarines benefit from operational feedback from multiple navies, whereas the S-80 Plus remains in developmental stages. With a rapidly aging fleet and increasing threats from China's expanding submarine force and Pakistan’s AIP-equipped Agosta-class submarines, the Indian Navy urgently requires these advanced platforms. Selecting a proven design like the Type 214 minimizes developmental risks and ensures timely delivery. If negotiations proceed as planned, the first submarine from Project-75(I) could enter service within three to five years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indias-submarine-revolution-german-indian-collaboration-brings-aip-to-navy	2025-01-24T07:02:18-08:00

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) The MRC Mid-Range Capability, also called Typhon missile system, is a highly versatile and powerful missile system designed for surface-to-surface operations. The system is primarily equipped with two types of advanced missiles: the SM-6 and the Tomahawk cruise missile. These missiles are key to the U.S. military’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific, providing both offensive and defensive capabilities over extended ranges. The SM-6 missile, with a range of up to 500 km, is a multi-role missile that is used to engage a variety of targets, including enemy aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. It is primarily deployed aboard U.S. Navy surface ships as part of the Aegis Combat System, but with the Typhon system, it is being adapted for land-based operations. The SM-6 is integral to U.S. missile defense, providing long-range interception against air threats and contributing to regional stability by offering an advanced defense layer. Its versatility makes it suitable for anti-air and missile defense, crucial for the protection of U.S. assets in high-threat environments. In contrast, the Tomahawk cruise missile, with a range of up to 2,500 km, is a long-range precision strike weapon designed for deep penetration into hostile territory. It is used to target high-value land targets, such as enemy command centers, missile sites, and critical infrastructure. The Tomahawk’s accuracy and ability to strike from long distances make it an ideal tool for projecting U.S. military power and engaging adversaries without the need for manned aircraft or carrier strike groups. Its long range also positions it as a critical asset in regions like the South China Sea, where the U.S. must maintain a credible deterrence against China’s growing military presence. The redeployment of the MRC Typhon missile launcher system to Luzon is part of a broader effort by the U.S. military to refine its approach to force projection in the Indo-Pacific. According to the Philippine government source, the redeployment's primary goal is to assess how quickly and efficiently the missile batteries can be moved to new positions. Such flexibility is critical in an environment where rapid repositioning can increase the survivability of military assets during a potential conflict. The move also reflects the U.S. military's commitment to ensuring that its missile systems can be quickly repositioned across the region, making them harder to target and increasing their overall effectiveness in the face of emerging threats. The Typhon missile system was first deployed in the Philippines in April 2024 during a training exercise, a move that drew strong criticism from China. The Chinese government condemned the deployment, viewing it as an escalation of U.S. military presence in the region and a direct challenge to China's growing influence, particularly in the South China Sea. In response, Beijing reiterated its concerns about the militarization of the region, accusing the U.S. of exacerbating tensions and undermining regional stability. However, the U.S. maintains that the deployment of these advanced missile systems is a necessary countermeasure to China's increasing military assertiveness, particularly its ongoing efforts to establish control over disputed territories in the South China Sea and its growing missile capabilities. The MRC Typhon missile launcher system's combination of the SM-6 and Tomahawk provides the U.S. with a potent mix of defense and offense. The SM-6 enhances the U.S. Navy’s capability to defend against aerial threats at extended ranges, while the Tomahawk provides a means to strike enemy targets far beyond the reach of most conventional systems. This combination gives the U.S. military a powerful deterrent in the region, especially in scenarios involving anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) systems, which are central to China's defense strategy. The ability to engage air and ground targets from a land-based position extends the reach of U.S. forces and complements existing naval and air assets, enabling a more flexible and layered defense posture. The U.S. military's ongoing presence in the Philippines, with the deployment of advanced systems like Typhon, is also indicative of the deepening U.S.-Philippine security cooperation. The Philippines, which has territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, benefits from the presence of U.S. missile systems that can protect its sovereignty and ensure regional stability. The Typhon’s ability to operate from Philippine territory allows the U.S. to project power while also strengthening the defensive capabilities of its ally in the region. Furthermore, the mobility of the Typhon system ensures that U.S. forces can respond swiftly to any escalation in the region, maintaining a strong deterrent presence against potential adversaries. The redeployment of Typhon to Luzon is also a strategic measure to refine the U.S. military’s overall posture in the Indo-Pacific. The ability to quickly reposition key missile assets in the region provides the U.S. with greater flexibility and operational readiness. In the event of a crisis, this capacity for rapid relocation makes U.S. missile systems less vulnerable to preemptive strikes and ensures that they can continue to operate effectively across a vast and contested region. This increased mobility also enhances the system’s survivability, which is essential in the event of a conflict with a peer competitor like China. The redeployment of the MRC Typhon missile launcher system to Luzon enhances the U.S. military’s ability to project power, defend allies, and deter potential adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region. By combining the defensive capabilities of the SM-6 with the long-range precision strike power of the Tomahawk, the Typhon system provides a highly flexible and capable tool for responding to threats in a region marked by growing geopolitical tension. The U.S. military's focus on mobility, survivability, and strategic flexibility in its missile systems ensures that it can maintain a credible deterrent against China and other regional challengers, while strengthening its defense commitments to allies like the Philippines. As tensions in the South China Sea and surrounding areas continue to rise, the Typhon missile system is poised to play a pivotal role in the U.S. military's efforts to maintain regional stability and safeguard its interests in the Indo-Pacific.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-us-redeploys-mrc-typhon-surface-to-surface-missile-launchers-in-philippines-to-test-rapid-mobility	2025-01-23T07:47:26-08:00

Flash News: US Navy Arleigh Burke destroyer USS Spruance scores impressive missiles & UAVs downs in Red Sea Battle	According to information published by the US DoD on January 18, 2025, the USS Spruance (DDG-111), an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, emerged from a recent engagement in the Red Sea bearing thirteen new mission marks. These marks signify a successful defense against a diverse and complex array of threats, underscoring the ship's readiness and its crew's proficiency in operating naval systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS Spruance (DDG-111) returns to port bearing 13 mission marks after successfully intercepting ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs in a high-stakes engagement against Houthi forces in the Red Sea. (Picture source: US DoD) At the core of the USS Spruance’s defense is the Aegis Combat System, a fully integrated combat management system designed to process vast amounts of sensor data and coordinate the ship’s weapons to neutralize diverse threats. The Aegis system is centered around the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar and the ship’s command and control suite, which collectively provide rapid detection, tracking, and engagement across multiple domains. The AN/SPY-1D(V) radar is a high-power, multi-function phased-array radar that operates in the S-band frequency range. It is capable of detecting and tracking hundreds of targets simultaneously, including low-observable threats such as sea-skimming cruise missiles and high-altitude ballistic missiles. The radar’s phased-array technology eliminates the need for moving parts, allowing it to maintain constant surveillance over its area of coverage. During the engagement, this radar was responsible for detecting inbound threats at their maximum range, providing critical early-warning data. Once threats were detected, the Aegis Command and Decision Suite processed the data and classified the targets based on their threat level. The system’s real-time processing capability enables rapid assignment of weapons to targets, prioritizing engagements based on speed, proximity, and lethality. This ensures that the ship’s defenses are neither overwhelmed nor misallocated during a multi-vector attack. The interception of three anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) by the USS Spruance represents a significant technological achievement. Ballistic missiles follow a high-arcing trajectory and typically re-enter the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often exceeding Mach 5. These characteristics make them extremely challenging targets, requiring precise timing and advanced intercept technology. The Aegis BMD system, an upgraded component of the ship’s combat suite, provides the capability to track and intercept ballistic missiles during their midcourse or terminal phase. When the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar detected the inbound ASBMs, the Aegis system calculated their trajectory, speed, and re-entry path. This data was shared with regional and space-based sensors through the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), creating a unified threat picture. To neutralize the ASBMs, the Spruance likely launched Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors from its Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). The SM-3 is a hit-to-kill interceptor designed specifically for ballistic missile engagements. It uses a multi-stage booster to achieve high velocity and deploys a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) in the missile’s terminal phase. The KKV does not carry an explosive warhead; instead, it relies on sheer kinetic energy to destroy the target by colliding with it at high speed. For terminal-phase threats closer to the ship, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) could have been employed. The SM-6 is a dual-role missile capable of intercepting both ballistic and air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles, at extended ranges. Its active radar seeker and advanced guidance system make it particularly effective in dealing with maneuvering re-entry vehicles (RVs). The interception of three anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) further illustrates the Spruance’s layered defensive architecture. Cruise missiles, which fly at low altitudes and often use terrain-following radar to evade detection, are designed to overwhelm shipboard defenses with speed and maneuverability. The SPY-1D(V) radar played a pivotal role in detecting these missiles despite their low-altitude flight paths and potentially stealthy designs. Upon detection, the Aegis system assigned Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) interceptors for mid-range engagements. The SM-2 employs semi-active radar homing, guided by the ship’s radar, to track and intercept the target. Its dual-thrust rocket motor provides the necessary speed and range to engage cruise missiles before they reach their terminal phase. For threats that penetrated closer to the ship, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) likely came into play. The ESSM is designed for point defense and is capable of engaging highly maneuverable targets at short ranges. Its active radar seeker provides high accuracy, while its advanced control surfaces enable rapid course adjustments to counter evasive maneuvers. Additionally, the ship’s Mk 99 Fire Control System directed the engagement, ensuring precise guidance of each interceptor. This system uses radar illuminators to 'paint' the target, providing the SM-2 and ESSM with continuous updates on the target’s location and trajectory during flight. The successful interception of seven UAVs showcased the Spruance’s ability to counter the growing use of drones in asymmetric warfare. UAVs are often deployed in swarms to saturate defenses and are particularly challenging to detect due to their small radar cross-sections and erratic flight patterns. The ship’s Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) likely played a central role in UAV defense. The CIWS, commonly referred to as 'Phalanx,' is a 20mm Gatling gun mounted on a swiveling turret. It is radar-guided and designed for last-ditch defense against incoming threats. Operating at a rate of up to 4,500 rounds per minute, the CIWS can effectively destroy small, fast-moving targets like UAVs at ranges of 1-2 kilometers. Electronic warfare measures, such as the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), complemented kinetic defenses. SEWIP provides advanced electronic attack capabilities, allowing the ship to disrupt the command, control, and navigation systems of UAVs. By jamming communication links, SEWIP can render drones ineffective without expending munitions. The Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) on the USS Spruance provides the foundation for its multi-mission flexibility. With 96 launch cells, the ship can carry a mix of interceptors, land-attack missiles, and anti-submarine weapons, tailored to mission requirements. The VLS uses a 'hot launch' system, where missiles are ignited within the cell and expelled upward through a hatch.

Israel's Rafael upgrades its Trophy active protection system to counter kamikaze drones	During the Defence IQ International Armoured Vehicles (IAV) conference, held in Farnborough, UK, from January 21 to 23, 2025, the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defence Systems announced an upgrade to its Trophy Active Protection System (APS) to intercept drones. According to a company representative, the enhancement addresses challenges posed by low-altitude aerial threats, including commercially available drones, kamikaze drones, and larger fixed-wing UAVs. The upgrade, requiring software adjustments and minor hardware changes, is compatible with existing systems used by operators in the United States and Europe.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2017, the Trophy APS had accumulated 50,000 operational hours since its introduction in 2011, showcasing its effectiveness in both low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) During testing, the upgraded Trophy system, mounted on a 30 mm turret, successfully intercepted a jet-powered fixed-wing drone classified between classes 2 and 3. The drone approached in a near-vertical dive. Rafael emphasized that these enhancements were achieved without altering the system’s core hardware. In addition to drone interception, Trophy has been updated based on operational experience, including lessons learned from conflicts in Gaza and northern Israel. These improvements address the system’s performance against short-range threats in urban environments and long-range threats such as ATGMs in open terrain. A representative of EuroTrophy—a joint venture between Rafael, GDELS, and KNDS to market Trophy in Europe—stated that the system has achieved high interception rates during conflicts. The venture is working to integrate Trophy onto platforms like the MGCS and ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles, as well as three European 8x8 armored vehicles. The representative noted that Trophy contributes to operational effectiveness by providing consistent vehicle protection, which is critical for mission continuity. They also highlighted the operational challenges commanders face when vehicle losses threaten the success of an operation. The Trophy APS, also known as 'Windbreaker,' was developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems in collaboration with Elta Systems to counter modern anti-armor threats such as ATGMs, RPGs, and other anti-tank weapons. Development began in the 1980s to enhance the survivability of armored vehicles in urban and open battlefields, with the system becoming operational in 2009 and achieving its first recorded interception in 2011. Variants have been developed for different vehicle weight classes, including Trophy HV for heavy vehicles, Trophy MV for medium vehicles, and Trophy LV for light vehicles. Trophy's functionality is based on the Elta EL/M-2133 fire-control radar, which uses four flat-panel antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. When detecting an incoming projectile, it calculates the approach vector, threat type, time to impact, and angle. Rotating launchers deploy Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) in a precise pattern to neutralize threats at a safe distance. The system counters ATGMs, high-explosive anti-tank rounds, RPGs, and similar threats. It can engage multiple threats simultaneously on stationary and moving vehicles and integrates with C4I systems and remote-controlled weapons stations. Newer models feature automated reloading for consecutive engagements. By 2023, the production of the Trophy APS increased to 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month, as it has been deployed on tanks like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4, the American Abrams, the German Leopard 2A7A1 and 2A8, as well as the British Challenger 3. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) The Trophy APS has been operational since 2011, demonstrating success in low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. It has intercepted threats like Kornet ATGMs and RPG-29s. By 2017, Trophy accumulated 50,000 operational hours, and by 2023, production reached 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month. The radar system can share data with other vehicles, enabling improved threat coordination and targeting. It can identify whether a projectile will miss its target, withholding countermeasures and sharing data for tactical use. Reports suggest it offers protection against certain top-attack missiles and is used in Israel and the U.S. However, the Trophy APS has limitations. It cannot counter kinetic energy penetrators and is vulnerable to direct top-down attacks, as demonstrated in 2023 when drones dropped grenades on protected vehicles. Its weight, approximately 500 kilograms, may impact the performance of lighter vehicles. The use of EFPs poses risks to nearby infantry, complicating operations involving dismounted soldiers. Techniques such as rapid successive missile firings, ultra-close-range RPG attacks, and supersonic projectiles have exploited system weaknesses. Conflicts in 2023 and 2024 highlighted instances where the system was overwhelmed, with video evidence showing some failures. Rafael representatives emphasized that despite its new anti-drone capability, Trophy alone cannot provide comprehensive air defense against drones. They advocate a layered defense strategy incorporating mobility, lethality, and survivability, supported by technologies like lasers, electromagnetic spectrum control, and hard- and soft-kill systems. This approach aims to address the growing challenges posed by drones, including swarms and top-attack threats, which complicate operations for maneuver forces. Production of Trophy APS began in Israel in 2007 and in the U.S. in 2012, with a combined output of 40 systems and 500 countermeasures per month by 2023. Since 2010, it has been deployed on platforms like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4 tanks, Namer APCs, and U.S. M1A2 Abrams tanks. It has been tested on Stryker APCs and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The lighter Trophy MV/VPS version was developed for medium and light vehicles, while the Trophy LV is designed for vehicles under 8 tons. It has been integrated into Germany's Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and is included in orders for the Leopard 2A8. The UK has signed contracts to evaluate it for Challenger 3 tanks. Other potential operators include Croatia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/israels-rafael-upgrades-its-trophy-active-protection-system-to-counter-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-23T01:47:31-08:00

Royal Navy Confronts Russian Ship in Channel as UK Strengthens Undersea Security	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 22, 2025, the Royal Navy recently intercepted and tracked the Russian spy ship Yantar as it moved through the English Channel. This latest development reflects the UK’s intensified efforts to counter potential threats to undersea infrastructure, which is increasingly seen as a target of strategic importance. Yantar, known for its specialized surveillance capabilities, has been under scrutiny for its potential to interfere with critical assets such as undersea cables and pipelines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 22010-class intelligence ship and a Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset. (Picture source: UK MoD) This is not the first encounter between Yantar and British forces. Late last year, the vessel was observed lingering near key infrastructure in UK waters, prompting the Royal Navy to send a submarine to surface near Yantar and issue a pointed warning. Following that incident, the vessel left UK territory for the Mediterranean. Its return this week has reignited concerns over its intentions, leading to its close monitoring by the frigate HMS Somerset as it transited the Channel. The broader context for these developments is the rising tension over the security of offshore infrastructure across Europe. Undersea cables, which carry the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic, and pipelines, essential for energy supplies, have become focal points of geopolitical vulnerability. Recent damage to the Estlink2 undersea cable between Estonia and Finland has heightened these concerns, prompting NATO to launch new measures to protect these critical assets. The UK is playing a leading role in these efforts, deploying advanced capabilities to deter and monitor threats. As part of the NATO Baltic Sentry initiative, the UK is contributing advanced P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and Rivet Joint surveillance platforms. These assets are designed to bolster reconnaissance and response capabilities in regions where the risk to undersea infrastructure is particularly acute. At the heart of Britain’s response is a new AI-driven system known as Nordic Warden. This technology, recently activated, leverages real-time data from a variety of sources to track and analyze ship movements, assessing the potential risks posed by suspicious vessels. Nordic Warden has been specifically configured to monitor Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet,' a network of tankers used to evade sanctions by transporting oil and gas to international buyers. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy’s RFA Proteus, equipped with submersible drones, has been a critical component in safeguarding undersea assets. Proteus, which previously shadowed Yantar during its activities in UK waters, remains on the front lines of undersea surveillance and inspection, ensuring that cables and pipelines remain secure. These efforts also dovetail with international sanctions targeting Russia’s economic lifelines. The UK has taken a prominent role in sanctioning vessels involved in evading restrictions, including tankers used to fund Russia’s ongoing military operations in Ukraine.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/royal-navy-confronts-russian-ship-in-channel-as-uk-strengthens-undersea-security	2025-01-23T01:01:34-08:00

This was Turkey's seventh tenure leading the task force, reflecting its continued commitment to maritime security. Taking over the command, the Pakistan Navy brings proven resources and capabilities to the mission. Among these, Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates like PNS Alamgir (F-260), often deployed for international operations, and Zulfiquar-class frigates such as PNS Aslat (F-254), are expected to play a key role. These vessels, equipped with advanced surveillance systems and versatile combat capabilities, are instrumental in supporting CTF 151’s efforts. Additionally, the Pakistan Navy deploys P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, which provide extensive reconnaissance and early threat detection, further enhancing the effectiveness of operations. Pakistan has also demonstrated its capacity for coordinated operations with other nations to secure international shipping routes. For instance, during Focused Operation TAHAFFUZ, the Pakistan Navy led joint efforts involving nine countries to protect global maritime trade. Furthermore, regular exercises with partners like the South Korean Navy highlight Pakistan's ongoing commitment to improving interoperability and strengthening professional ties within the framework of maritime security initiatives. Since its establishment in 2009, CTF 151 has been a cornerstone of the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), a coalition of 46 nations committed to safeguarding international maritime routes. In coordination with EUNAVFOR and independently deployed naval assets, CTF 151 patrols strategic zones such as the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor, contributing directly to reducing piracy threats. Headquartered in Bahrain, the CMF represents the largest multinational naval partnership in the world, covering more than 8.3 million square kilometers of maritime space. Despite progress in recent years, piracy remains a persistent threat in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding areas. Historically, this region has been a focal point for piracy activities, particularly off the Somali coast. While international measures such as the European Union's Operation Atalanta significantly reduced incidents in the early 2010s, a resurgence has been observed since 2023. In January 2024, the Indian Navy rescued an Iranian fishing vessel with 19 Pakistani crew members that had been hijacked by Somali pirates. This resurgence is attributed to factors such as regional instability aggravated by conflicts in Yemen, reduced international naval patrols, and socio-economic challenges in Somalia that drive individuals towards piracy. To address these growing threats, international initiatives have been strengthened. Operation Atalanta, for example, had its mandate extended in December 2024 for an additional two years to secure the Gulf of Aden and parts of the Red Sea. These efforts, combined with contributions from partner nations like Pakistan, aim to maintain a secure maritime environment and prevent disruptions to vital trade routes. This change of command underscores the ongoing importance of multinational cooperation in addressing global maritime security challenges. Under the leadership of Commodore Sohail Azmie, CTF 151 will continue its efforts to suppress piracy, enhance international coordination, and protect strategic maritime routes. With its experience and capabilities, Pakistan reaffirms its role as a key contributor to combating maritime threats in this critical region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/pakistan-navy-takes-command-of-task-force-151-leading-global-counter-piracy-efforts-in-gulf-of-aden	2025-01-22T06:58:45-08:00

According to Unite, this decision is crucial for safeguarding the UK’s industrial expertise and preparing the country for the production of the future sixth-generation combat air program, known as Tempest or the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Typhoon would support industrial autonomy and preserve national expertise while remaining a proven, versatile tool for diverse missions. (Picture source: British MoD) As the British government prepares to announce its decision on the purchase of new combat aircraft for the Royal Air Force, the Unite union is urging the Ministry of Defence to prioritize Eurofighter Typhoon jets over the F-35A. This decision is deemed crucial for safeguarding national industrial expertise and preparing the UK for the production of the future sixth-generation fighter program, the Tempest, or the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). With large-scale production of Tempest expected in the 2030s, the gradual reduction of the UK Typhoon production line threatens the industrial base, including the 6,500 BAE Systems employees currently involved in the program. A recent report by the Defence Select Committee further underscores the strategic importance of preserving jobs and expertise in the aerospace sector. The Eurofighter Typhoon, developed by a European consortium comprising EADS, Alenia Aeronautica, and BAE Systems, is a highly versatile multirole aircraft. It excels in air superiority, ground strikes, reconnaissance, and maritime attack. With a maximum speed of 2,495 km/h, exceptional agility, and 13 hardpoints for various armaments such as AMRAAM missiles, Paveway guided bombs, and Storm Shadow anti-radar missiles, it is well-suited for a broad range of missions. Its CAPTOR-M radar, combined with a planned upgrade to AESA technology, enhances detection and targeting capabilities, while its lightweight composite structure ensures operational flexibility. In contrast, the F-35A Lightning II, developed by Lockheed Martin under the Joint Strike Fighter program, emphasizes stealth and advanced technology. Its AESA AN/APG-81 radar and Distributed Aperture System (DAS) provide unmatched situational awareness, supported by advanced electronic warfare capabilities. Designed to operate in heavily defended airspaces, the F-35A can carry a range of weapons, including AMRAAM missiles, JDAM bombs, and HARM missiles, all while maintaining a low radar signature through its internal weapons bay. While it has a lower top speed (1,930 km/h compared to 2,495 km/h) and slightly less agility, the F-35A’s ability to neutralize advanced air defense systems and its integration into coalition operations make it a strategically valuable asset. In terms of costs, the Typhoon presents significant advantages for the British economy. A purchase of 24 aircraft could sustain 26,000 jobs over two years across BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo, and the broader national supply chain. By comparison, a similar order for the F-35A would create only two to three months of work for approximately 2,000 workers in the UK. While the Typhoon directly supports local industry, the F-35A benefits from economies of scale due to its large-scale production, potentially offsetting its higher initial costs. However, the infrastructure required to maintain its stealth technology adds significant long-term expenses. The choice between the two aircraft depends on the UK’s strategic priorities. The Typhoon would support industrial autonomy and preserve national expertise while remaining a proven, versatile tool for diverse missions. Meanwhile, the F-35A, with its stealth and advanced capabilities, is better suited to modern conflicts involving contested environments. A hybrid solution combining both aircraft could offer a strategic balance, addressing immediate military needs while supporting the long-term viability of the national aerospace sector. Unite emphasizes the urgency of this decision. General Secretary Sharon Graham highlighted the importance of retaining the highly skilled engineers and technicians in the aerospace sector. She called on the government to invest in Typhoons to meet military and economic needs while ensuring continuity of expertise for future programs. Rhys McCarthy, Unite’s national defense officer, warned that neglecting the domestic defense industry in an increasingly unstable world would be irresponsible. He also stressed that the UK government cannot expect to sell Typhoons abroad if it does not demonstrate confidence in the product itself. The decision between the Typhoon and the F-35A represents a critical strategic choice for the UK. Beyond military considerations, it could redefine the future of the national aerospace industry while addressing global security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/british-aerospace-industry-at-stake-with-choice-between-typhoon-and-f-35a-fighter-jets	2025-01-22T06:11:32-08:00

South Korea develops a land-based CIWS-II 30mm system to counter future North Korean kamikaze drones	As reported by the Korea Bizwire on January 20, 2025, South Korea has begun developing a land-based adaptation of its Close-In Weapon System (CIWS-II) to address North Korean threats, including artillery, drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) manages the project, building on the naval CIWS-II equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun and Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. For the land-based version, design changes include replacing the four-sided fixed AESA radar with a single-faced rotating radar to prioritize monitoring northern threats and reducing costs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after several North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 incident when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. (Picture source: DAPA) A close-in weapon system (CIWS) is a point-defense weapon designed to detect and intercept short-range threats, such as incoming missiles and aircraft, that have penetrated outer defenses. Typically installed on naval ships, CIWS is standard on most large modern warships and has also been adapted for land-based applications. There are two main types: gun-based and missile-based. Gun-based CIWS, such as the American Phalanx, Dutch Goalkeeper, and Russian Kashtan systems, employ rotary or revolver cannons with radar and computer systems mounted on rotating turrets for automatic targeting. Missile-based CIWS, like the American RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile and Russian Pantsir system, use radar or infrared guidance to direct short-range missiles at close-range threats. The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 event when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. Existing ground-based systems, such as the K30 Biho, have struggled to detect and track small or low-flying threats. The new system aims to counter a range of threats, including long-range artillery, close-range ballistic missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, multiple rocket launchers, low-flying cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. It will use AESA radar and electro-optical tracking systems for improved detection and interception. Advanced Hit Efficiency And Destruction (AHEAD) ammunition, designed to release fragments upon detonation, will increase its effectiveness against drones and artillery shells. Cost-saving measures for the land-based adaptation include using a rotating AESA radar instead of the fixed version used on naval systems. The system is designed to counter specific threats such as kamikaze drones and missile swarms. Rep. Yoo Yong-won of the People Power Party emphasized the importance of deploying the system, citing North Korea’s advancements and their risks to Seoul and nearby areas. The US-made Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, serves as a notable example of a naval close-in weapon system modified for ground-based applications. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, offers a comparable example. Based on the Phalanx CIWS, the C-RAM uses a 20mm M61A1 Gatling gun and Ku-band radar to protect forward operating bases from rockets and mortars. It employs high-explosive incendiary tracer self-destructing (HEIT-SD) ammunition to minimize collateral damage and successfully intercepted 105 attacks during its initial deployment. The C-RAM influenced South Korea’s approach to the CIWS-II program. Expected to reach initial capability by 2027, the CIWS-II project addresses limitations in foreign systems, such as the Dutch SGE-30 Goalkeeper and U.S. Phalanx, which have faced issues related to cost, maintenance, and operational capability. Dissatisfaction with reliance on external suppliers led to the decision to develop a domestic solution. In 2021, LIG Nex1 and Hanwha Systems competed for the CIWS-II contract, presenting models with AESA radar and electro-optical systems at MADEX 2021. LIG Nex1 was chosen for its expertise in radar, fire control, and maintenance, including its work with the Goalkeeper system. The project has a budget of 895.7 billion KRW (approximately $626,990,000) and will continue through 2036. The naval CIWS-II, equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun capable of high rates of fire, integrates AESA radars for detection and tracking. Its configuration includes four detection radars and one tracking radar, whereas the land-based variant may use a simplified setup to reduce costs. Electro-optical targeting enhances interception of drones, supersonic missiles, and other aerial threats. Future upgrades aim to enhance the system’s effectiveness against swarming drone attacks using AHEAD ammunition. Initial deployment will occur on Chungnam-class frigates, potentially serving as test platforms. The land-based version is expected to defend urban and strategic areas, including Seoul, addressing South Korea’s security challenges. However, gun-based CIWS systems have limitations, particularly in range and effectiveness. These systems typically have a maximum range of 5,000 meters, with real-world interception often occurring closer to 500 meters, increasing the risk of fragments or damaged threats causing harm. Additionally, their kill probability is limited, as direct hits may not neutralize threats entirely, especially with kinetic-energy-only projectiles. Missile-based CIWS mitigates some of these challenges by offering extended range and improved interception capabilities. Systems like the dual-role Kashtan and Pantsir combine guns and missiles for greater tactical flexibility.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/south-korea-develops-a-land-based-ciws-ii-30mm-system-to-counter-future-north-korean-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-22T04:57:40-08:00

Soldiers from both units requested drones that would be more versatile, durable, and, importantly, expendable—capabilities that existing systems often lacked. The new drones will be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, where the Division will field 100 custom-made sUAS units. 'We are able to print these systems at a fraction of the cost of traditional models, without sacrificing operational functionality,' said Capt. Andrew Blomquist, the 2nd Mobile Brigade Combat Team’s innovation officer. He emphasized the excitement within the Division to see these new, 3D-printed drones put to the test in the hands of soldiers during the exercise. Operation Lethal Eagle is a 21-day training exercise designed to push the limits of the Division's capabilities, particularly in large-scale, long-range air assault (L2A2) operations. The event aims to prototype and test emerging Army technologies, enhance the lethality of soldiers, and build proficiency in complex, multi-domain operations. During the exercise, soldiers will conduct a range of missions that integrate these new sUAS into tactical operations. This will provide invaluable data for refining drone usage and manufacturing at the tactical level. The training is expected to showcase the practical benefits of 3D-printed drones, such as their ease of replacement in the field and lower costs for procurement, maintenance, and training. The 3D manufacturing initiative is a reflection of the Army's broader strategy to modernize and improve its technological edge. As Col. McIntosh notes, the effort is part of an ongoing transformation that will make the Division’s drone systems more adaptable to ever-evolving mission requirements, from surveillance to electronic warfare. While the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division’s 3D-printed drones will first be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, they are expected to be a permanent fixture within the Division’s technological arsenal. The success of the program could serve as a blueprint for other units in the U.S. Army, offering a new model for rapid, cost-effective drone manufacturing that can be easily scaled across other operational theaters. As U.S. soldiers continue to experiment with and refine these new systems, the 101st’s venture into 3D printing is setting the stage for broader innovations in military drone development, offering a glimpse into the future of Army warfare—one where agility, speed, and innovation take center stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-army-101st-airborne-division-develops-3d-printed-small-drones-for-air-assault-operations	2025-01-22T03:24:22-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) Marine One, the call sign for any U.S. Marine Corps aircraft carrying the President, has been in use since 1957. President Dwight D. Eisenhower first used a Bell UH-13J Sioux helicopter for short-range travel to his summer home in Pennsylvania, followed by the Sikorsky UH-34 Seahorse. The Marine Corps assumed exclusive control of Marine One operations in 1976, designating the White House South Lawn as the primary landing zone. Over the decades, the fleet, managed by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), has included the VH-3A, VH-3D, and VH-60N models. Operating from MCAF Quantico, Virginia, and Naval Support Facility Anacostia, the fleet supports both domestic and international missions. Procedures include flying in decoy formations and employing countermeasures like AN/ALQ-144A infrared jammers and radar-guided missile defenses. The prefix 'VH' in U.S. military aircraft designations stands for 'VIP Helicopter,' identifying rotary-wing aircraft configured specifically for transporting very important persons, such as the President. The 'V' denotes its VIP transport role, and the 'H' indicates it is a helicopter. This designation is used for helicopters like the VH-3D Sea King, VH-60N White Hawk, and VH-92A Patriot, which have been assigned to serve as Marine One, the call sign for any U.S. Marine Corps aircraft carrying the President. The VH-3D Sea King, introduced in 1974, was a twin-engine helicopter derived from the Sikorsky S-61 platform, replacing the VH-3A in the Marine One fleet. It featured a fuselage length of 16.5 meters, an overall length of 21.9 meters, and a height of 5.1 meters, with a maximum takeoff weight of 9,752 kilograms. Powered by two General Electric T58-GE-400B turboshaft engines, the VH-3D could reach a maximum speed of 259 km/h (140 knots). The VH-3D was equipped with navigation systems, GPS, TCAS, crash-survivable flight data recorders, and EMP-hardened communication systems for secure and non-secure operations. The helicopter supported day/night and all-weather missions, with systems periodically upgraded to meet evolving operational needs. However, increased weight from added capabilities limited further modifications due to its aging airframe, reducing operational effectiveness. The VH-60N White Hawk, entering service in 1989, was developed as a variant of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, incorporating features from the SH-60 Seahawk, allowing it to achieve a cruising speed of 278 km/h. (Picture source: US DoD) The VH-60N White Hawk, entering service in 1989, was developed as a variant of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, incorporating features from the SH-60 Seahawk.

The agreement was finalized in New Delhi on January 21, 2025, in the presence of Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh and senior officials from the MoD and HVF/AVNL.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The bridge system of the BLT T-72 consists of a launching mechanism, hydraulic systems, auxiliary systems, an electronic control system, and the bridge structure itself. (Picture source: Army Recognition) India's procurement of 47 T-72 BLTs aims to improve the operational capacity of its mechanized forces by enabling the rapid deployment of bridges during both offensive and defensive operations. The T-72 BLTs are designed to support the movement of armored units across obstacles such as rivers and trenches, addressing mobility challenges and ensuring tactical flexibility. This acquisition is part of a broader initiative to modernize India's military infrastructure and maintain the operational relevance of the T-72 fleet. The T-72 BLT, also known as BLT T-72, is an armored engineering vehicle (AEV) used to deploy prefabricated steel bridges during military operations. It assists in crossing natural and artificial obstacles, enabling tanks and armored vehicles to maintain mobility during combat. The system includes a scissors-type bridge that can be deployed in two configurations: a 20-meter span with a Military Load Classification (MLC) of 60, supporting vehicles up to 60 tons, and a 22-meter span with an MLC of 70, supporting vehicles up to 70 tons. The Military Load Classification (MLC) is a standardized system used by NATO to indicate the load-bearing capacity of infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and routes, as well as the load impact of military vehicles. It is represented in whole numbers, with higher numbers corresponding to the capacity to support heavier loads. Vehicles are assigned MLC numbers based on their weight, type (wheeled or tracked), and their impact on infrastructure, while infrastructure elements are categorized according to their structural characteristics and ability to handle specific traffic conditions. This system ensures compatibility between military vehicles and the infrastructure they use, supporting the safe and efficient movement of forces. The bridge system of the BLT T-72 consists of a launching mechanism, hydraulic systems, auxiliary systems, an electronic control system, and the bridge structure itself. During transit, the bridge remains folded atop the tank and can be deployed in approximately three to five minutes using manual or automatic controls. The vehicle’s ability to deploy and recover the bridge ensures tank columns can cross obstacles and maintain efficient movement. The T-72 BLT, also known as BLT T-72, features a scissors-type bridge that can be deployed in two configurations: a 20-meter span supporting vehicles up to 60 tons, and a 22-meter span supporting vehicles up to 70 tons. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The BLTs are built on the T-72M1 tank chassis and powered by a 780-horsepower engine. Weighing 49 tons, they measure 11.36 meters in length, 4.0 meters in width, and 3.8 meters in height. The maximum road speed is 60 kilometers per hour, and the vehicle can traverse gradients of up to 25 degrees, cross trenches up to 2.4 meters wide, and ford shallow waters up to 1.8 meters deep. Armament includes a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun, with provisions for attaching a KMT-6 mine plow for landmine clearance. India’s association with the T-72M1 began in 1978 with the purchase of 500 tanks from the Soviet Union, including T-72, T-72M, and T-72M1 variants. Licensed production was subsequently initiated at the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) in Avadi, Tamil Nadu, where the tank was designated as the Ajeya. Over a 15-year production period, more than 1,100 units were manufactured domestically before production ceased in 1998. In the 1990s, the Indian Army launched the Combat Improved Ajeya program, also known as Project Rhino, upgrading approximately 1,500 T-72M1 tanks. This program introduced enhancements such as upgraded engines, advanced fire control systems, Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA), fire detection and suppression systems, and modern communication and navigation systems. As of 2023, the Indian Army operates a fleet of 2,418 T-72M1 tanks, with plans to replace them under the Future Ready Combat Vehicle (FRCV) program. The BLTs fall under the 'Buy (Indian-Indigenously Designed, Developed, and Manufactured)' (IDDM) procurement category, introduced in India's Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016. This category prioritizes defense products that are indigenously designed, developed, and manufactured, requiring at least 50% indigenous content. The policy aligns with the 'Make in India' program, launched in 2014 to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports across various sectors, including defense. Additionally, the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) campaign, initiated in 2020, emphasizes fostering self-sufficiency by encouraging indigenous production capabilities. In the defense sector, these initiatives aim to develop a domestic defense industry, reduce dependency on foreign suppliers, stimulate economic growth through local manufacturing, and advance technological innovation within India.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/indian-army-purchases-47-new-t-72-blt-bridge-laying-tanks-to-strengthen-obstacle-crossing-capabilities	2025-01-22T01:48:29-08:00

B-1B Lancers Deployed to Guam a Strategic Reinforcement for Indo-Pacific	Four U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer strategic bombers landed at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam on January 15, 2025, marking the start of the year's first Bomber Task Force mission. These aircraft, from the 34th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron based at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, play a pivotal role in U.S. efforts to strengthen alliances and deter threats in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link the B-1 Lancer is a long-range, versatile strategic bomber that holds a central position in the U.S. Air Force's arsenal (Picture source: US Air Force) A key feature of this mission was an unprecedented trilateral flight conducted over airspace between Japan and South Korea. Two B-1Bs were escorted by two Mitsubishi F-2 fighters from Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force and two F-15K Slam Eagles from the South Korean Air Force. This operation underscores growing trilateral military cooperation, reflecting closer ties between these nations as they address security challenges in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and the Korean Peninsula. Originally developed by Rockwell (now part of Boeing), the B-1 Lancer is a long-range, versatile strategic bomber that holds a central position in the U.S. Air Force's arsenal. Its unique variable-geometry wing configuration enables the aircraft to adjust wing angles for optimal performance during various phases of flight. Powered by four General Electric F101-GE-102 turbofan engines, the B-1B can reach a top speed of 1,340 km/h and a range of 11,998 km with aerial refueling. Operated by a crew of four — a pilot, a co-pilot, and two systems operators — it is designed to execute complex, long-range missions. The B-1B is distinguished by its significant payload capacity. Its three internal weapon bays and eight external hardpoints allow it to carry up to 75,000 pounds of ordnance, including conventional bombs such as Mk 82 and Mk 84, AGM-86B, and AGM-69 cruise missiles, as well as nuclear payloads like the B-61 or B-83 bombs. This adaptability makes it a valuable asset for a wide range of high-intensity missions. To enhance survivability, the B-1B features advanced avionics and countermeasure systems. The AN/ALQ-161 electronic warfare suite enables radar jamming, while the APQ-164 multi-mode radar provides high-resolution terrain mapping, terrain-following capability, and weather detection. These systems, along with chaff and infrared decoy dispensers, ensure the bomber can penetrate contested airspace and avoid threats effectively. The B-1 B entered service in 1986 as a nuclear-capable platform and was later adapted in the 1990s for conventional bombing missions. Since then, it has played a critical role in major operations, including Desert Fox in 1998 and campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Its ability to adapt to evolving operational requirements has solidified its importance within U.S. strategic planning. The current deployment to Guam also highlights the evolution of U.S. military presence strategies in the region. Since 2020, the Air Force has shifted from a continuous bomber presence on the island to a rotational model through Bomber Task Forces. This approach provides operational flexibility while maintaining a credible deterrent. With its strategic location just 1,600 miles from Taiwan and 1,800 miles from South Korea, Guam serves as a vital hub for projecting power in a region marked by increasing tensions. These Bomber Task Force missions extend beyond deterrence. They also serve as a proving ground for crew endurance and readiness. With flight durations often exceeding 24 hours and sometimes approaching 30, such missions test operational capabilities and demonstrate the Air Force's ability to sustain operations across diverse and distant environments. In summary, the deployment of B-1B bombers to Guam is part of a broader strategy aimed at reinforcing alliances and addressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. More than a demonstration of military strength, this mission reflects a measured approach to projecting power, reassuring regional partners, and deterring potential adversaries. As the Task Force mission continues, it underscores the United States' commitment to upholding stability and the international rules-based order in this strategically significant region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/b-1b-lancers-deployed-to-guam-a-strategic-reinforcement-for-indo-pacific	2025-01-22T00:10:37-08:00	
Kalashnikov and Russia to Soon Present New KUB-2-E Loitering Munition	At the upcoming IDEX 2025 defense exhibition, scheduled from February 17 to 21 in Abu Dhabi, the Kalashnikov Group will unveil its latest innovation in loitering munition technology, the KUB-2-E, a joint development by the Kalashnikov Group and the Izhevsk Unmanned Systems Research and Production Association (NPO 'IzBS'). As always, Army Recognition will be on-site to cover the event, and more details will be available in the coming weeks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The small-class KUB-2-E system is designed to target enemy infantry, including individual soldiers, as well as unarmored military vehicles. (Picture source: Kalashnikov) This new generation of small and medium-sized loitering munitions is designed to enhance modern military capabilities, marking a significant milestone in Russian unmanned defense technology. The emergence of drones in the conflict in Ukraine has marked a major turning point in the conduct of modern military operations. From the outset of the Russian invasion in 2022, Ukraine quickly integrated reconnaissance and attack drones, such as the Turkish Bayraktar TB2, to carry out precision strikes against strategic Russian targets, including bridges, armored vehicles, and command facilities. The use of drones, including loitering munition systems, has helped overcome certain limitations related to manpower shortages or equipment while providing greater flexibility to conduct asymmetric attacks. On the other hand, Russia has also intensified the use of drones, particularly for kamikaze strikes or intelligence-gathering missions. These technologies have changed the nature of combat by making operations more fluid and responsive, but they have also redefined warfare strategies, where speed, precision, and the ability to strike from a distance have become key elements. The small-class KUB-2-E system is designed to target enemy infantry, including individual soldiers, as well as unarmored military vehicles. It is therefore ideal for precise strikes against lighter, more vulnerable targets on the battlefield. Meanwhile, the medium-class KUB-2-E broadens the scope by allowing strikes against a wider range of targets, such as enemy personnel, launch positions for unmanned aerial systems, helicopter landing zones, and both unarmored and lightly armored military vehicles. Both versions of the KUB-2-E loitering munitions are equipped with advanced electro-optical systems, allowing operators to guide the munitions with precision toward their targets, even if those targets change positions during the operation. Weighing over 10 kg, these munitions can operate in various challenging conditions, such as day and night operations, complex weather scenarios, smoke, and dust. They can also operate in wind speeds of up to 15 m/s and in temperature ranges from -40°C to +50°C. Moreover, these systems resist passive and active jamming tactics that may occur in a battlefield environment. Developed as an initiative by the Kalashnikov Group, the KUB-2-E complexes offer significant advancements in loitering munition technology, providing armed forces with the ability to conduct more flexible and effective strikes under diverse battlefield conditions. With IDEX 2025 fast approaching, the presentation of the KUB-2-E system at the event will highlight the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern warfare and their potential to redefine the dynamics of combat engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/kalashnikov-and-russia-to-soon-present-new-kub-2-e-loitering-munition	2025-01-21T23:59:01-08:00	
Flash News: China Develops Secret Hypersonic Air-to-Air Missile Posing New Threat to US B-21 Stealth Bomber	China has officially confirmed the development of a highly advanced hypersonic air-to-air missile, marking a significant milestone in aerospace and defense technologies. This announcement was made public on January 19, 2025, via the 'South China Morning Post', a newspaper based in Hong Kong, after extensive testing, including extreme heat resistance trials designed to meet the stringent requirements of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). The development of this missile poses a serious challenge to existing air defense systems. It could alter the dynamics of air superiority, particularly against high-tech aircraft like the U.S. B-21 Raider stealth bomber, which is currently undergoing flight testing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Conceptual image of a cutting-edge hypersonic air-to-air missile, revolutionizing long-range aerial combat. (Picture source: China CCTV) The confirmation of the missile's existence was made through a paper published by Chinese scientists, revealing the sophisticated testing procedures employed, including the use of arc-heated wind tunnels. These special tunnels are designed to simulate the extreme conditions encountered by hypersonic vehicles, with temperatures reaching thousands of degrees Celsius—well beyond what conventional missiles experience. The heat-resistant tests are part of China’s effort to overcome one of the primary challenges of hypersonic flight: aerodynamic heating. At speeds greater than Mach 5, hypersonic missiles encounter intense friction with the atmosphere, which can cause temperatures to soar and potentially damage the missile’s structural integrity or disrupt its internal electronics. To ensure the missile’s reliability, China has conducted extensive trials, including those in high-cost wind tunnels typically used for space missions like simulating Mars landings. Hypersonic air-to-air missiles are capable of traveling at speeds that exceed Mach 5, and as such, they present entirely new challenges and opportunities in air combat. Unlike traditional air-to-air missiles, which generally operate within a range of several hundred kilometers, hypersonic variants could strike targets as far as 1,000 km away or more, significantly extending the operational reach of platforms like China’s J-16 fighter. This increased range is not just a matter of distance, but also a matter of speed—hypersonic missiles can cover that ground much more quickly than their subsonic counterparts. With less time for an adversary to react, and an incredibly fast trajectory that evades interception, these missiles present a new type of threat for modern air forces. Conventional air-to-air missiles require complex guidance systems and long engagement times, while hypersonic missiles, due to their speed, can drastically shorten the time from launch to target impact, leaving little opportunity for escape. The introduction of this weapon has serious implications for global air combat strategies, especially for the U.S. military and its allies. The U.S. B-21 Raider new stealth bomber, with its stealth capabilities and long-range strike capabilities, represents the cutting edge of American air power, but the threat of hypersonic weapons could force a reconsideration of how such aircraft are deployed in contested airspace. The B-21 was designed with the assumption that adversaries would rely on traditional anti-air threats, such as surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets. The hypersonic missile, however, could engage even the most advanced stealth bombers at ranges far beyond the capabilities of conventional interception systems, making them vulnerable in ways previously unimagined. While China's hypersonic air-to-air missile represents a new phase in military aerospace development, it is not alone in this endeavor. Other nations have also made significant strides in hypersonic and supersonic missile technology, some of which include air-to-air capabilities. The United States, for example, is actively working on a range of hypersonic missile systems through its various programs such as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) and the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). These systems, while primarily intended for surface-to-air and air-to-ground applications, are indicative of the U.S.'s interest in keeping pace with China and Russia in the hypersonic race. In fact, the U.S. has been focusing efforts on deploying hypersonic missiles in various configurations, including for air-to-air engagements, albeit with a somewhat longer timeline for deployment than China. Russia, too, has demonstrated significant progress in hypersonic technology with its Kinzhal missile, which, while primarily designed for air-to-ground strikes, is expected to serve as the basis for further developments in air-to-air variants. The Kinzhal is launched from a MiG-31 fighter jet and has already been used in combat, highlighting its potential in real-world scenarios. However, the focus for both the U.S. and Russia has largely been on using hypersonic systems for long-range strike missions rather than air-to-air combat, which is a niche that China appears to be pioneering. The development of air-to-air supersonic and hypersonic missiles represents a new frontier in aerial warfare. These weapons offer far greater ranges and speeds than traditional air-to-air missiles, which are typically limited by their reliance on radar guidance and the necessity of in-flight updates from the launching platform. A hypersonic air-to-air missile, due to its sheer speed, could engage targets with little to no warning and without relying on extensive data links to ensure its accuracy. This dramatically changes the nature of air combat, as enemy aircraft—especially slower-moving tankers, bombers, and early warning platforms—will have limited options for evasion. The strategic implications of this technology are profound. Air forces must now rethink their defense strategies in the face of such advanced missile technology. Countries with significant air forces, particularly the United States, will have to develop countermeasures capable of defeating or mitigating the effects of hypersonic missiles. This could involve developing better detection systems, faster interception capabilities, and more advanced electronic warfare tactics to thwart these high-speed threats. The challenge is not only technological but also economic. Hypersonic systems, due to their complex engineering and high operating costs (such as the expense of running advanced wind tunnels), represent a significant investment. For now, only a handful of nations, including China, the U.S., and Russia, are investing heavily in this cutting-edge technology. However, as the missile race intensifies, other nations may also seek to develop their own variants, potentially changing the future balance of air superiority. In conclusion, the Chinese hypersonic air-to-air missile marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of modern warfare, setting a new standard for the speed, range, and lethality of air-launched weapons. While other nations, including the U.S. and Russia, are working on their own hypersonic and supersonic missile technologies, China’s advancements in this area could lead to a shift in the tactical and strategic dimensions of aerial combat. The development of such weapons challenges not only current defense systems but also long-held assumptions about the effectiveness of traditional air-to-air missile engagements. As the world watches this technological race unfold, the implications for future air combat are both revolutionary and uncertain.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-china-develops-secret-hypersonic-air-to-air-missile-posing-new-threat-to-us-b-21-stealth-bomber	2025-01-21T09:13:15-08:00

What Happened to Russia’s Destroyer Lider and Its S-500 Missile Defense Plan?	Russia’s ambitious Project 23560 destroyer Lider was envisioned as a next-generation warship that could replace multiple classes of vessels in the Russian Navy. This advanced platform was designed to carry a naval version of the S-500 Prometey air defense system, positioning it as a formidable counter to the U.S. Navy’s Aegis missile defense system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A model of the Russian Navy's Project 23560 destroyer. (Picture source: Navy Recognition) Military expert Sergey Marzhetsky highlighted that the destroyer Lider, with its full displacement of 19,000 tons, was uniquely suited to accommodate the massive S-500 interceptors, something smaller ships like the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates could not achieve without compromising their mission capabilities. The S-500 system offered unprecedented capabilities in air and missile defense, including the ability to engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 600 kilometers and detect threats at a distance of 800 kilometers. With a maximum engagement altitude of 200 kilometers and the capacity to neutralize targets traveling at speeds up to 7 kilometers per second, the S-500 promised to counter advanced threats such as the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, an early-warning aircraft capable of detecting cruise missiles from a distance of 258 kilometers. This system could have given the destroyer Lider a critical edge in naval warfare by extending its defensive reach far beyond that of the U.S. Navy’s Aegis system, which relies on SM-3 Block IB missiles with a range of 700 kilometers and a speed of 3 kilometers per second. The Aegis system, a cornerstone of U.S. naval defense, is an advanced, multi-layered combat system designed to detect, track, and intercept a wide array of threats, including ballistic missiles, aircraft, and surface targets. Central to its effectiveness is the AN/SPY-1 radar, a powerful, phased-array system that provides continuous 360-degree surveillance and fire control. This radar works in tandem with the Standard Missile family, particularly the SM-3 and SM-6 variants, to deliver precise and effective missile interceptions. Deployed across a fleet of over 70 ships worldwide, including U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, as well as allied vessels, the Aegis system is renowned for its integration capabilities, allowing ships to work as part of a larger missile defense network. Despite its promise, the Project Lider was halted due to a combination of financial, technical, and strategic challenges. Russia’s economic constraints made it difficult to allocate the significant funding required for such an advanced and massive destroyer. Technological hurdles in adapting the land-based S-500 system for naval use, particularly integrating the complex radar and launcher systems, further complicated the project. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy’s focus shifted toward smaller, more versatile ships like the Project 22350 frigates and Karakurt-class corvettes, which were more practical given budgetary limitations and immediate operational needs.

Its extended range allows deployment platforms to remain beyond the reach of many air defense systems, improving survivability during missions. China’s glide bomb development originated with the LS-6 series, introduced in 2006 by the Luoyang Optoelectro Technology Development Center. The LS-6 family includes precision-guided glide bomb kits compatible with multiple weights: 50kg, 100kg, 250kg, and 500kg. The 500kg LS-6 achieves a range of up to 60 kilometers when released from an altitude of 10,000 meters. The Tiangang bomb builds on this foundation, offering improved range capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing systems. The Tiangang's performance invites comparisons with the AGM-154 JSOW, as its design and purpose are closely aligned with this U.S. counterpart. The Tiangang, developed by Norinco Group, offers a range exceeding 80 kilometers and a CEP of less than 15 meters, targeting fixed installations such as communication hubs and military bases. By contrast, the AGM-154 JSOW, manufactured by Raytheon, achieves ranges of approximately 22 kilometers from low-altitude releases and up to 130 kilometers from high-altitude releases, utilizing a GPS/INS system with optional imaging infrared guidance. Compared to the JDAM, the Tiangang demonstrates a superior range; the standard JDAM achieves up to 28 kilometers with a CEP of 5 meters under optimal conditions. However, the JDAM-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) narrows the gap by incorporating a wing kit to extend its range to approximately 80 kilometers. The design and purpose of the Tiangang guided bomb closely resemble those of its U.S. counterpart, particularly the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon, also known as the JSOW. (Picture source: US DoD) Globally, glide bombs and modular guidance kits are increasingly valued for their ability to enhance the effectiveness of unguided munitions. Systems like the U.S. AGM-154 JSOW, Russia’s UMPK, and Pakistan’s Takbir glide bomb improve accuracy and operational range, enabling launch platforms to remain outside defended airspace. These upgrades are cost-efficient, repurposing existing bombs with advanced guidance modules and aerodynamic surfaces, making them highly effective in modern combat scenarios. The concept of glide bombs dates back to World War II, with Germany’s Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 introducing remote-controlled munitions for precision strikes, primarily against naval targets. Early systems faced accuracy challenges and required clear visibility from the launch aircraft but marked the advent of precision-guided munitions. Advancements in guidance systems, such as GPS and inertial navigation, have since significantly improved accuracy and standoff ranges, broadening their operational applications. The primary advantage of glide bombs lies in their ability to deliver precise strikes from extended distances, keeping aircraft outside the range of air defense systems. Their modular nature allows unguided bombs to be converted into precision-guided munitions, offering a cost-effective solution for many militaries. Additionally, their small radar signatures and short flight times reduce vulnerability to interception, making them versatile for various missions. For China, the Tiangang bomb provides a practical solution to enhance precision-strike capabilities by leveraging its extensive inventory of FAB-series bombs, reducing the need for entirely new munitions. This approach increases operational flexibility and cost-efficiency. By incorporating advanced guidance systems, the Tiangang bomb significantly enhances the effectiveness of China’s aerial munitions, bolstering its ability to conduct strategic operations with precision at extended ranges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/china-continues-to-challenge-us-aerial-superiority-with-its-tiangang-guided-bomb	2025-01-21T03:53:04-08:00

The MD 530F is a light, agile helicopter designed for reconnaissance and light attack roles. Its speed and maneuverability are particularly useful in urban or mountainous combat scenarios. The Taliban’s use of these helicopters could enhance their surveillance and ground support capabilities. The ScanEagle is a small, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Its capture gives the Taliban the potential to monitor enemy activity and plan operations with advanced situational awareness. There is also concern about the possibility of reverse-engineering this technology for use or sale to other groups. The M1151 and M1152 are variants of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), or Humvee, known for their adaptability and durability. The M1151 is armored for troop transport, while the M1152 is designed for cargo. Thousands of these vehicles were left behind, providing the Taliban with substantial mobility and logistical support for operations. The MaxxPro MRAP is a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle designed to protect occupants from IED blasts and small-arms fire. Its advanced V-shaped hull deflects explosions, making it an invaluable asset for safe travel in hostile environments. The Taliban’s acquisition of these vehicles enhances their survivability in asymmetric warfare. Light and medium tactical vehicles such as the Ford Ranger and Navistar 7000 series were used extensively by U.S. and Afghan forces for logistical support. Their reliability and mobility enable the Taliban to efficiently transport troops, supplies, and equipment across Afghanistan’s challenging terrain. The Taliban’s possession of U.S. military equipment poses significant risks to both regional and global security. These assets have increased their operational capabilities, allowing them to solidify control over Afghanistan and project power more effectively. The advanced equipment could also be used to intimidate neighboring countries or be sold to adversarial nations, further destabilizing the region. Experts warn that some of the captured technology, including UAVs and communications equipment, may be shared with state actors like China or Russia, who could study and reverse-engineer the systems to counter U.S. military technology. There is also the concern that militant groups outside Afghanistan could gain access to this weaponry, potentially fueling terrorism worldwide. Trump’s remarks have added a new dimension to the debate about the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Critics of the Biden administration view the loss of military equipment as a blunder that undermines U.S. credibility and strengthens adversaries. Trump’s call to withhold financial aid until the equipment is returned highlights his 'America First' policy stance. The loss of $7 billion worth of U.S. military equipment to the Taliban remains a stark reminder of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/detailed-list-of-us-military-equipment-trump-seeks-to-recover-from-afghanistan	2025-01-21T01:50:00-08:00

Donald Trump Announces an Ambitious Plan for a Fully American Iron Dome	On January 19, 2025, during the rally preceding his inauguration in Washington, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump generated interest by announcing his plan to order the construction of a fully American 'Iron Dome' once his second term begins. Inspired by the renowned Israeli missile defense system, this initiative, highlighted in the Republican Party's electoral platform, aims to create a 'force field' around the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launcher was placed and prepared to launch interceptors to counter ballistic missile threats at an undisclosed location in CENTCOM area of responsibility (Picture source: US DoD) Trump emphasized the project's national character, pledging that it would be developed and constructed within the United States. This plan raises critical questions regarding technical details, costs, and the technologies that might be incorporated. While the possibility of a system distinct from Israel's Iron Dome is not excluded, the proposal aligns with the goal of enhancing technological self-reliance and fostering innovation in the U.S. defense industry. The Israeli Iron Dome, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. financial support, is globally recognized for its short-range missile defense capabilities. The mobile, all-weather system intercepts and neutralizes enemy projectiles, including rockets, artillery shells, and mortars. Equipped with an EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptor missiles, it calculates threat trajectories in real time and engages only those likely to cause harm. With interception rates frequently exceeding 90%, the system has demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting civilian populations during multiple conflicts. However, the Israeli Iron Dome has limitations. While highly effective against short-range threats, it offers only partial protection against long-range missiles, advanced drones, or hypersonic weapons. As a result, it is often supplemented by other systems, such as David's Sling and Arrow, to provide layered defense. Trump’s proposed project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a system capable of addressing a broader range of threats, including emerging weapon technologies. This endeavor would require substantial investments to establish new production facilities and integrate advanced technologies. Additional challenges include ensuring compatibility with existing U.S. systems, such as the Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis, which form the backbone of the nation’s missile defense architecture. The future U.S. 'Iron Dome' could leverage existing defense systems to create a comprehensive, multi-layered network capable of countering diverse threats. The Patriot PAC-3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement) is a key component of U.S. air defense, designed to counter evolving threats like tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and low-orbit satellites. Equipped with an upgraded solid-fuel rocket motor, improved aerodynamic controls, and advanced guidance systems, this hit-to-kill missile ensures total target destruction. Operating at speeds of Mach 5, it has a range of 35 kilometers and an interception altitude of 15 kilometers. Each launcher, mounted on a mobile platform, carries up to 16 missiles, enabling rapid and effective responses to complex threats, including those employing electronic countermeasures. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system is specifically designed to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, both within (endoatmospheric) and outside (exoatmospheric) the atmosphere. Highly mobile and transportable, the system uses hit-to-kill technology, neutralizing threats with kinetic energy to minimize risks associated with weapons of mass destruction. A single THAAD battery includes up to nine mobile launchers, each carrying eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 X-band radar with a detection range of 1,000 kilometers, and command-and-control vehicles. THAAD operates seamlessly alongside systems like the Patriot and Aegis, ensuring robust protection for military forces, strategic infrastructure, and civilian populations. The Aegis combat system, at the core of Aegis-equipped destroyers, provides unparalleled air defense and ballistic missile interception capabilities. Paired with the AN/SPY-1D phased-array radar, it can detect and track multiple aerial threats over 300 kilometers. Aegis-equipped destroyers are armed with Standard Missiles (SM), including SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6, capable of intercepting threats ranging from aircraft to medium-range ballistic missiles. Incorporating the Aegis system into the proposed U.S. Iron Dome could offer a formidable shield for critical locations and infrastructure. The U.S. is also heavily investing in high-powered lasers and directed energy weapons to counter drones and missiles. These technologies could complement the system by providing cost-effective and rapid solutions for neutralizing specific threats. Advanced radars, such as the Sentinel A4, used for aerial threat detection and surveillance, could play an integral role in the proposed Iron Dome. These radars are critical for real-time detection, tracking, and engagement of threats, ensuring optimal system performance. Integrating the Iron Dome with the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) could further enhance coordination between different defense platforms. Through real-time data sharing, this would improve interception speed and accuracy. The proposed Iron Dome could serve as a catalyst for the U.S. defense industry, promoting strategic independence and reinforcing the country’s position on the global stage. However, its success will depend on the ability to develop a system that is efficient, adaptable, and economically sustainable. This initiative could also redefine global standards in missile defense. Trump’s announcement marks a potential turning point in the evolution of U.S. defense technologies. This project represents a critical step in safeguarding the nation against adversaries such as China, Russia, and North Korea, whose advancements in ballistic and hypersonic missile technologies pose significant threats. By addressing these strategic challenges, the U.S. Iron Dome could provide a vital defensive edge while strengthening alliances with key partners who share similar security concerns.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/donald-trump-announces-an-ambitious-plan-for-a-fully-american-iron-dome	2025-01-20T00:51:26-08:00	
Analysis: How Russia’s Innovative Submarine Coating Reduces Detection Risks	The Russian Ministry of Defense initiated a significant modernization program in 2022 to upgrade the hydroacoustic coatings of its nuclear-powered submarines. This effort aims to improve the stealth capabilities of these vessels, enabling them to evade detection more effectively. The new coating reduces the acoustic signature of the submarines by suppressing noises generated by the vessels and external sonar signals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of Project 677 Lada submarines Vologda and Yaroslavl. (Picture source: bmpd) The hydroacoustic coating is made up of specialized plates, each weighing up to 80 kilograms. These plates are composed of multiple pressed layers of advanced rubber materials and feature unique channels designed for acoustic performance. They are affixed to the submarine's lightweight hull using an adhesive with a classified composition. Once attached, the plates are coated with paint to ensure durability and optimal performance. Each nuclear-powered submarine requires approximately 10,000 of these plates, meticulously installed to create an effective barrier against enemy sonar detection. The stringent testing process for the new hydroacoustic coating was recently showcased on the Russian television program Voennaya Priyomka (Military Acceptance) aired on the Zvezda channel. The tests, conducted at the Sevmash shipyard—Russia’s premier submarine manufacturing facility—demonstrated the robustness of the adhesive bonding the plates to the hull. The testing procedure begins with a drill featuring a cup-shaped bit, which is lubricated with soapy water and used to bore into the rubber coating. A metal corkscrew is then inserted into the resulting hole and pulled out using a specialized device that measures the force required to dislodge it. Results show that the adhesive can withstand a force of over 4.5 kN (kilonewtons), confirming its exceptional strength. To ensure minimal impact on the coating’s acoustic properties, the hole is sealed with a fast-curing sealant, rendering it virtually undetectable. This rigorous process is applied to every tenth plate, meaning approximately 1,000 plates are tested before a submarine undergoes state trials. The upgraded hydroacoustic coating is expected to enhance the operational effectiveness of Russia’s nuclear submarine fleet. By reducing detectability, these submarines will have a greater edge in strategic missions, such as patrolling and covert operations, particularly in contested waters. In contrast, the United States has long utilized lightweight synthetic polymer tiles on its Virginia-class and Ohio-class submarines. These tiles are engineered to absorb sonar waves effectively while maintaining a reduced thickness to minimize weight and hydrodynamic drag. The U.S. approach integrates these coatings with other noise-reduction technologies, such as pump-jet propulsion systems, to create a multi-layered stealth system. However, issues with long-term adhesive durability have been reported, which may compromise performance over extended periods. China has focused its efforts on developing composite rubber and polymer coatings for its Type 093B Shang-class submarines. These coatings aim to absorb a broad range of sonar frequencies, enhancing stealth in the Indo-Pacific region. Recent reports suggest that China is transitioning to modular panels for easier maintenance, but the overall robustness and longevity of these systems appear to lag behind those of Russian and American technologies. Germany, representing NATO’s expertise in stealth coatings, employs advanced rubberized materials on its Type 212 and Type 214 diesel-electric submarines. These coatings are optimized for smaller, non-nuclear platforms and are used in conjunction with Air-Independent Propulsion systems to achieve near-silent operation. While highly effective for their intended platforms, these coatings are less scalable to the larger nuclear submarines operated by Russia and the U.S.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/analysis-how-russias-innovative-submarine-coating-reduces-detection-risks	2025-01-20T00:47:42-08:00

Sweden Deploys Mechanized Battalion in Latvia Near Russian Border in Historic First for NATO	For the first time since joining NATO, Sweden has deployed a mechanized battalion in Latvia, consisting of Strf 9040 infantry fighting vehicles and Strv 122 tanks. This deployment marks a step in Sweden's international military engagement and highlights its integration into NATO's collective defense framework. On Saturday, January 18, 2025, approximately 600 Swedish soldiers arrived in Riga, accompanied by their military equipment, as part of an operation to strengthen NATO's presence on its eastern flank, near the Russian border. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These exercises also emphasize the capabilities of the Strf 9040 and Strv 122, equipped with advanced systems like the 40 mm Bofors cannon and the 120 mm Rheinmetall gun, respectively (Picture source: Saab) The deployment of this mechanized battalion, part of the South Scandinavian Armored Regiment, was a pivotal moment for the Swedish Army. This regiment, comprising the 71st and 72nd mechanized battalions, has a total strength of about 1,100 soldiers. For this mission, 48 Strf 9040 vehicles and 12 Strv 122 tanks were transported to the strategic Ādaži base, where units from 14 other NATO member nations are also stationed. Sweden's arsenal includes over 500 Strf 9040s and 120 Strv 122s, underscoring its substantial armored capabilities. This mission is part of NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence initiative, designed to deter any attempts to compromise the territorial integrity of member states. Regular exercises in the Baltic region enhance interoperability among allied forces and test their readiness to respond to potential crises. In Latvia, Swedish soldiers will train intensively alongside allied forces, preparing for complex scenarios and ensuring operational cohesion. These exercises also emphasize the capabilities of the Strf 9040 and Strv 122, equipped with advanced systems like the 40 mm Bofors cannon and the 120 mm Rheinmetall gun. The Strv 122, derived from the German Leopard 2A5, has been adapted to meet Sweden’s specific operational needs. In service since 1997, it features enhanced armor protection against modern threats and the ability to fire precision munitions developed domestically. Powered by a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine, it achieves a top speed of 68 km/h despite its 62-ton weight. The Strf 9040, operational since 1991, is the backbone of Sweden’s mechanized units. It combines mobility, firepower, and advanced protection, making it well-suited for escort and close-support missions. This operation signifies a shift in Sweden’s defense posture. The country’s previous European military engagements, such as its peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, primarily focused on stabilizing conflict zones. In contrast, this deployment in Latvia is a deterrence mission aimed at preventing conflict in a strategically critical yet currently peaceful region. According to Marcus Nilsson, the regiment's communications officer, this mission reflects a fundamental evolution in Sweden's defense approach. Unlike prior missions centered on restoring peace, this deployment emphasizes deterrence and protection. By establishing a credible military presence, Sweden contributes to collective security and ensures stability in a strategically significant region. Sweden's official accession to NATO in March 2024, after more than 200 years of neutrality, was a strategic decision influenced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since joining, Sweden has enhanced its military capabilities and increased its defense budget to meet NATO’s requirements. This deployment in Latvia underscores the growing importance of military cooperation among NATO members. NATO forces’ Baltic commander, Jette Albinus, commended the Swedish contribution, noting the professionalism and capability of its troops. While this mission begins under relatively stable conditions, NATO's future appears uncertain. The inauguration of Donald Trump, who has previously expressed skepticism about NATO's efficacy, may challenge the current balance within the alliance. His administration’s focus on increasing defense spending among NATO members could pose difficulties for some nations, although Sweden has already started boosting its military budget. In this context, operations like the one in Latvia carry significant strategic weight, demonstrating NATO’s relevance in maintaining European stability. By deploying its mechanized battalion, Sweden is not only protecting an allied nation's borders but also solidifying its role within NATO and affirming its military credibility. This first ground operation as a NATO member reflects Sweden’s commitment to addressing contemporary geopolitical challenges and its determination to play a key role in collective security efforts.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/sweden-deploys-mechanized-battalion-in-latvia-near-russian-border-in-historic-first-for-nato	2025-01-20T00:13:46-08:00	
Dutch Defense Budget 2025 Reaches 2% GDP Target as Trump May Demand 5%	The Netherlands achieved a significant milestone in 2024, reaching the NATO requirement of spending 2% of GDP on defense. This decision comes in a global context marked by rising tensions, particularly with the war in Ukraine and China's growing military presence. After several decades of military budget reductions, this increase marks a major shift, illustrating a growing awareness of global threats and the need to strengthen the Netherlands' military posture. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. (Picture source: Dutch MoD) Since the end of the Cold War, Dutch defense spending has been heavily influenced by the idea of the 'peace dividend.' In 2013, defense spending dropped to just 1% of GDP, a trend that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis when austerity measures led to significant cuts in the military budget. However, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and, more recently, the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, highlighted Europe's vulnerability to rising military threats. These events accelerated a realignment of priorities, progressively strengthening the Netherlands' defense capabilities to respond to new geopolitical realities. In response, the Dutch government decided to increase its military spending. In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. This increase is the result of adopting a more proactive defense policy aimed at modernizing the armed forces and strengthening the country's deterrence and defense capabilities. This effort is supported by the recent adoption of the Defense Financial Obligations Act, which ensures the long-term maintenance of this goal. The Netherlands' increase in defense spending aligns with a broader global trend. NATO as a whole has seen rising contributions from its members, with countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Eastern European members significantly increasing their military budgets. Notably, the United States remains by far the largest contributor to NATO, with an estimated defense budget of $28.791 trillion in 2024, representing around 66% of the Alliance's total defense spending. Globally, other major powers such as Russia and China have also increased their military expenditures. Russia's defense spending for 2025 is projected to reach $120 billion, while China's defense spending in 2024 is estimated at $231 billion. These figures illustrate the growing commitment of these nations to strengthen their military capabilities, particularly in cybersecurity, nuclear armaments, and advanced technologies. These developments highlight the growing military competition among major powers and emphasize the need for European countries, including the Netherlands, to maintain a modern and effective defense posture. In this unstable geopolitical context, the Dutch government has implemented a series of initiatives to modernize its armed forces. This includes investments in advanced military equipment, increased training for soldiers, and an increase in the number of military personnel to ensure that the Netherlands' armed forces are ready to respond to any threat. The strengthening of defense capabilities translates into investments in modern weapon systems, including missile defense, cybersecurity, and electronic warfare. These areas are seen as essential in the face of contemporary threats, such as cyberattacks and hybrid warfare. Additionally, the Netherlands is enhancing its cooperation within NATO, actively participating in joint exercises and increasing its contribution to Alliance missions. Despite achieving the 2% target, challenges remain. The Netherlands' defense budget will need to continue growing to meet future military threats. The ongoing increase in military spending, necessary to keep up with evolving threats, is likely to pose significant challenges for the national economy. In particular, balancing defense needs with other budgetary priorities such as healthcare, education, and social services will be crucial. Another challenge for the Netherlands, as for other NATO members, is the need to modernize the armed forces to address new military technologies continually. Adapting to new forms of warfare, such as cyber warfare and autonomous weaponry, will be a key area of investment for the coming years. The 2% of GDP allocated to defense is now considered not a ceiling, but a minimum. Several NATO officials, including the Secretary General of the Alliance, have emphasized that defense spending above this threshold will be necessary to make up for the accumulated gap and prepare for the future. Indeed, the pace of global threats and new geopolitical dynamics necessitate a constant reassessment of defense budgets. The Netherlands' position on this issue is clear: although the 2% target has been met, the government is ready to consider future increases to further strengthen national security and continue playing a significant role within NATO. Additionally, discussions are underway to incorporate this standard into more binding legislation, ensuring the continued increase in military spending in the years to come. The Netherlands has taken an important step by meeting the 2% defense spending target, but this increase is just the beginning. The growing global challenges, new geopolitical threats, and the need to modernize the armed forces mean that the country will need to continue investing heavily in its defense to respond to the evolving global situation effectively. In the face of these challenges, the Netherlands will continue to strengthen its military capabilities and support NATO in its collective missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/dutch-defense-budget-2025-reaches-2-gdp-target-as-trump-may-demand-5	2025-01-20T00:01:15-08:00

The contract, valued at US$308.65 million, is set to be completed within 46 months. According to KAI, the project aims to create a homegrown amphibious assault helicopter capable of providing crucial fire support during amphibious operations. This helicopter will cover the Marine Corps’ amphibious maneuver helicopters and air assault units, offering air support during deep maneuvers and final operations. DAPA first announced the requirement for the RoKMC's attack helicopter on April 26, 2021, with an initial buy projected to range from 20 to 24 rotorcraft, at a provisional cost of approximately US$1.44 billion. The program, which began in 2022, is expected to be completed by 2031. The amphibious assault helicopters are intended to operate in high-stakes environments, including the strategically important north-western islands near the inter-Korean border. The MAH will also be designed to operate alongside the Marineon helicopters, which are already in service with the Marine Corps. Once operational, the MAH will play a pivotal role in enhancing the Marine Corps’ amphibious assault capabilities. It is expected to provide vital fire support during amphibious landings, protect Marineon transport helicopters as they conduct raids, and support ground units engaged in combat. This increased firepower and operational flexibility will be crucial to maintaining the readiness of South Korea’s amphibious forces, especially in the event of a conflict in the region. The MAH's development is a testament to South Korea’s ongoing efforts to modernize its defense infrastructure and ensure the self-reliance of its military capabilities. The integration of advanced technology into the MAH, such as avionics and armament systems, aligns with the nation's broader strategy to produce state-of-the-art military equipment that meets the specific needs of its armed forces. Brigadier General Koh Hyung-seok, head of the Helicopter Business Division at DAPA, emphasized that the MAH will enhance the Marine Corps' ability to perform both offensive and defensive operations, particularly in vulnerable regions near the border. 'The amphibious assault helicopter project is essential for strengthening our Marine Corps' air fire support capabilities,' said Brigadier General Koh. 'It will also enable us to better prepare for surprise attacks, particularly in the north-western regions, which are critical to our national defense strategy. We are confident that the remaining development process will proceed without delay, allowing us to complete the project successfully.' As the full-scale testing progresses in 2025 and beyond, the MAH is poised to become a cornerstone of South Korea’s amphibious operations, offering increased air support capabilities and enhancing the Marine Corps’ overall operational effectiveness.

Breaking News: Iran's IRGC Navy Reveals Secret Underground Naval Base Housing Dozens of Missile Assault Boats	On January 18, 2025, Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveiled an underground naval missile base at an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf. The base, one of several underground facilities built to house vessels capable of launching long-range missiles and conducting distant warfare, was revealed by IRGC Chief Commander Hossein Salami. During ongoing war games, Salami visited the secret base and highlighted its strategic significance in enhancing Iran’s naval capabilities and deterrence in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from a video broadcast by IRGC-affiliated media showing the newly unveiled underground naval base in the Persian Gulf, housing several missile-equipped assault boats. (Picture source: Iranian state media video footage) This naval underground facility is part of a larger network of 'cities' specifically designed to house and deploy the IRGC (Iran Revolutionary Guard) Navy’s combat vessels. These subterranean complexes are central to Iran's naval defense strategy, allowing the IRGC to quickly mobilize its fleet of missile-equipped assault boats in the region. General Salami, in his speech at the unveiling, emphasized that the base is just one small component of a much larger system of subterranean installations. He asserted that the IRGC Navy operates numerous such bases, all designed to reinforce its operational resilience and readiness against external threats. By hiding these vessels in underground facilities, the IRGC significantly complicates efforts to locate and neutralize its fleet, providing a strategic advantage in the event of regional conflict. The underground base is specifically tailored to house fast-moving, missile-equipped boats, which are a core component of the IRGC Navy's asymmetric warfare strategy. These boats, capable of launching precision-guided missiles, allow the IRGC to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries, particularly the U.S. Navy, which operates in the region. The base also includes vessels equipped for mine-laying, further enhancing the IRGC’s ability to control key maritime chokepoints in the Strait of Hormuz and the broader Persian Gulf. The ability to lay naval mines is a critical element of Iran's strategy to deny access to critical shipping routes, complicating operations for foreign naval forces in the region. The choice to build such a base underground stems from several strategic considerations. First, it offers protection from airstrikes, which is increasingly important as satellite surveillance and precision-guided munitions become more advanced. With many foreign powers, particularly the United States, capable of targeting and destroying surface ships, housing assets in hidden underground facilities helps mitigate this risk. Furthermore, by dispersing its fleet across multiple hidden sites, the IRGC enhances the survivability of its naval forces. This network of subterranean bases ensures that if one or more facilities are attacked, others remain operational, allowing for continuity in defense operations. Another crucial reason behind this underground infrastructure is the IRGC's focus on asymmetric warfare. Unlike traditional naval forces, which rely on large surface ships, Iran uses small, fast-moving missile boats that can strike quickly and retreat before enemy forces can respond. This hit-and-run tactic is central to Iran's approach to naval defense, allowing them to challenge more powerful forces using low-cost, high-impact weapons. The underground bases also make it more difficult for enemies to predict the locations of these vessels, giving the IRGC the element of surprise. The unveiling of this base also underscores Iran’s growing emphasis on maritime defense, especially as tensions in the Persian Gulf continue to rise. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil passes, is a vital geopolitical chokepoint. By deploying missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels, Iran can create a constant threat to any foreign navy operating in the region, potentially disrupting global oil trade. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies persist, these developments serve as a reminder of Iran's commitment to maintaining control over this strategic waterway. Looking forward, General Salami's remarks suggest that the underground base is only a fraction of the IRGC’s broader defense infrastructure. Iran is continuing to build a network of such subterranean complexes, all designed to enhance its naval deterrence capabilities. These bases, hidden from view and designed to withstand airstrikes, play a key role in Iran’s defense strategy. As the IRGC expands its network of underground facilities, it is clear that the regime intends to continue fortifying its naval power while challenging foreign naval dominance in the region. The unveiling of this underground combat vessel base marks a significant milestone in Iran's ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen its IRGC Navy. With missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels strategically housed in these subterranean complexes, Iran is positioning itself to exert greater influence over the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This move further solidifies the IRGC’s asymmetric warfare capabilities, and as the region remains on edge, global powers will be closely watching Iran's growing naval infrastructure for its broader implications on regional security and maritime stability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-irans-irgc-navy-reveals-secret-underground-naval-base-housing-dozens-of-missile-assault-boats	2025-01-18T17:50:50-08:00	
Flash Info: US Navy MH-60R Seahawk Helicopter Shoot Down Aerial Drone in Flight for the First Time	On January 16, 2025, Admiral James Kilby, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, revealed an important milestone for U.S. Navy aviation. During his address at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium near Washington, D.C., Admiral Kilby confirmed that a U.S. Navy MH-60R 'Romeo' Seahawk helicopter deployed to the Red Sea had successfully shot down a drone operated by Houthi militants. This event, first reported by The War Zone, an online platform covering defense, military technology, and security-related topics, marks the first time a U.S. Navy helicopter has engaged and downed an enemy UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in flight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, a multi-role maritime helicopter, played a pivotal role in the first-ever shootdown of an aerial drone in flight over the Red Sea, marking a significant milestone in counter-drone operations. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The specific type of aerial drone targeted and the exact method used by the U.S. Navy Mh-60R Seahawk naval helicopter to neutralize the UAV remain undisclosed. However, Admiral Kilby mentioned that the helicopter crew had employed 'a little bit of an unconventional system' to carry out the operation. This statement hints at the use of non-traditional or advanced technologies to deal with the increasingly common threat posed by drones in maritime and conflict zones. The MH-60R Seahawk is a versatile and multi-role maritime helicopter used extensively by the U.S. Navy. Primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), and reconnaissance missions, the MH-60R is equipped with a suite of advanced sensors and armaments, making it well-suited for conventional and unconventional operations. Its core capabilities include detecting and tracking submarines, conducting surface strikes against maritime targets, and providing real-time intelligence and surveillance for fleet operations. The Seahawk is fitted with the state-of-the-art APS-153 radar system, a multi-mode radar capable of detecting both surface and airborne threats, which would have been crucial in identifying and tracking the Houthi drone. Additionally, the helicopter is equipped with advanced sonar and communications systems that allow for precise coordination with other naval assets. Regarding armament, the MH-60R is armed with a range of precision-guided weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Mk 50 torpedoes, and various machine guns.

The versatility of the MH-60R, coupled with its powerful sensors and armament, positions it as an essential tool in modern naval warfare, capable of addressing a broad range of threats from conventional naval targets to emerging asymmetrical threats like drones. In this case, it can be speculated that the U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, with its advanced radar and sensor systems, likely played a key role in detecting the Houthi drone. However, downing a drone in flight, especially in a maritime environment, is far from simple. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are often small, agile, and capable of flying at low altitudes, which makes them challenging to detect and track. Given the operational challenges in the Red Sea, including potential interference from variable weather conditions, electromagnetic noise from the sea, and the unpredictable flight patterns of drones, the engagement would have required precise coordination and possibly unconventional methods to overcome these obstacles. The success of this operation underscores the Seahawk's advanced detection and tracking capabilities, but the exact nature of how the drone was engaged remains speculative at this stage. The growing use of drones in the Red Sea region, particularly by Houthi rebels, has added another layer of complexity to maritime security operations. The Houthis have increasingly deployed drones in their ongoing conflict with Saudi-led coalition forces, targeting both military assets and civilian shipping. Drones are often used to strike critical infrastructure, including oil tankers and naval vessels, raising concerns over the safety of international shipping routes. In this context, the successful downing of a drone by a U.S. Navy Seahawk is more than just a tactical victory—it represents a significant step in the evolving counter-drone capabilities of naval forces. The Red Sea's importance as a vital global trade route means that ensuring its security is of paramount concern for international naval forces. With the proliferation of UAV technology, particularly in conflict zones, the ability to intercept and neutralize these threats is becoming an essential capability for modern naval operations. The engagement of the drone by the U.S. Navy's MH-60R Seahawk is a noteworthy achievement, signaling the increasing importance of counter-drone capabilities within naval forces. As Admiral Kilby’s comments highlight, the use of 'unconventional systems' to take out the UAV underscores the innovative approaches needed to address the growing threat of drones in maritime operations. This successful mission also reinforces the idea that the battlefield is evolving—naval forces are no longer just focused on traditional threats like surface combatants and submarines but must also contend with the growing menace of UAVs. As demonstrated in this historic operation, the U.S. Navy’s ability to adapt to these new challenges will be crucial for maintaining maritime security in the Red Sea and beyond. As drone technology continues to evolve, it is likely that naval forces will increasingly rely on both conventional and unconventional means to detect, track, and neutralize these threats. The integration of advanced sensors, electronic warfare, and other countermeasures will shape the future of naval operations in increasingly complex and contested environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-info-us-navy-mh-60r-seahawk-helicopter-shoot-down-aerial-drone-in-flight-for-the-first-time	2025-01-18T03:10:41-08:00

Could the Canadian Roshel Senator 4x4 replace Chile’s outdated fleet of Piranha 6x6 armored vehicles?	On January 15, 2025, Infodefensa reported that the Chilean Army is considering purchasing Senator 4x4 armored vehicles from the Canadian manufacturer Roshel Inc. as part of a revised approach to the Cromo project. Initiated in 2018 by the Army Projects and Research Directorate (Dipride), the Cromo project aimed to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Over 1,400 Roshel Senator 4x4 armored vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation, and Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility in Shelby Township, Michigan. (Picture source: Roshel) The original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles for the Mechanized Battalion of the 1st Buin Infantry Regiment, with a budget allocation of $111.8 million. Due to delays and complications, the tender process was declared void in April 2024, prompting an expansion of the project’s scope to include 4x4 and 6x6 platforms. The initial tender specified several requirements, including vehicles capable of carrying ten personnel, meeting NATO STANAG 4569 Level 3 standards for ballistic and mine protection, and integrating remote weapon stations for NATO-classified armaments. These vehicles were intended for use in non-war military operations, disaster response, and training in Peldehue, located north of Santiago. However, financial limitations and challenges integrating L3Harris telecommunications systems led to the rejection of all submitted bids. Following the cancellation of the tender, the Chilean Army issued a request for information (RFI) to manufacturers, expanding its interest to 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 configurations. Companies responding to the RFI include BMC and Otokar from Turkey, Excalibur Army from the Czech Republic, Iveco from Italy, Patria Group from Finland, and General Dynamics Land Systems. The RFI outlined specifications such as STANAG 4569 Level 2/2A/2B protection, operational functionality in extreme conditions at altitudes above 4,500 meters, and temperature ranges from -20°C to 45°C. The vehicles are also expected to demonstrate versatility across various terrains. Roshel’s Senator 4x4 is among the vehicles being evaluated. This Canadian-made Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle has been used in Ukraine, with more than 1,400 units delivered since 2022. Reports from Ukraine have described the vehicle’s reliability and off-road performance under frontline conditions. Therefore, the Chilean Army is reportedly considering direct procurement of the Senator through the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), bypassing a competitive bidding process. This method has been criticized for potentially limiting market competition and excluding alternatives, such as Colombia’s Hunter TR-12 or France’s Arquus Bastion. Chile's original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle. (Picture source: Chilean MoD) As part of the evaluation process, the Chilean Army is planning a visit to Roshel’s facilities in Canada to assess the Senator directly. This decision has raised concerns regarding the impartiality of the RFI process, as it may suggest a preference for the Senator despite the ongoing review of other vehicles. Additionally, legal constraints exist, as the Ministry of Defense has not amended the Supreme Decree that originally allocated funds specifically for 8x8 vehicles. Without such amendments, the use of these funds for 4x4 vehicles is not permitted. The Chilean Army’s interest in 4x4 platforms appears linked to priorities such as border surveillance in the Southern Macrozone and addressing irregular immigration and security issues in the Araucanía Region. However, this focus has been criticized for diverging from the original Cromo project’s aim of equipping mechanized infantry units with 8x8 or 6x6 vehicles, which are considered more aligned with global trends and offer greater versatility. Argentina and Peru, for example, have reportedly prioritized 8x8 platforms for their mechanized forces. Compared to 6x6 and 8x8 configurations, 4x4 vehicles have reduced payload capacities, less off-road mobility, and are less suited for integrating heavier weapon systems. Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility on December 13, 2024, in Shelby Township, Michigan. The facility consolidates manufacturing processes, accommodates U.S. federal and government clients, and includes a service center. The plant produces the Senator Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, which is built on the Ford F-550 chassis. This version features STANAG 4569 Level 2 certification, a V-shaped hull for blast mitigation, composite materials for reduced weight, and thermal and acoustic insulation. The MRAP is equipped with a 6.7L turbo diesel engine, an 800-kilometer range, a payload capacity of 2,000 kilograms, and space for ten occupants. It is compatible with various weapon systems, including remote-controlled weapon systems and anti-tank guided missiles. Roshel operates four facilities in Ontario, producing up to 140 vehicles per month. Over 1,400 Senator vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation. Ukrainian reports indicate the vehicle’s ability to withstand attacks, including those involving First-Person View drones. Roshel is planning to establish a factory in Germany to meet NATO and European demands and intends to localize part of its production in Ukraine. Beyond the Senator, Roshel manufactures the Captain, a light tactical armored vehicle based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 70 chassis, as well as other configurations of the Senator designed for emergency response. The company has delivered vehicles to Costa Rica, South Korea, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and continues efforts to expand its presence in Europe and the United States.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/could-the-canadian-roshel-senator-4x4-replace-chiles-outdated-fleet-of-piranha-6x6-armored-vehicles	2025-01-17T05:54:50-08:00	
Japan and Indonesia Explore Co-Development of Warship	According to information published by Kyodo News on January 7, 2025, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Indonesian Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin have initiated discussions on the joint development of a naval vessel.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Navy's JS Izumo and Mogami-class frigate JS Noshiro. (Picture source: Japanese MoD) According to a Japanese government official, the proposed ship may be modeled on a destroyer from Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). These vessels are renowned for their advanced capabilities, including anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine warfare systems. Adapting such a design would significantly enhance Indonesia’s naval strength, aligning with its strategic goals in safeguarding its vast archipelagic territory. The collaboration aims to leverage Japan’s expertise in naval engineering and Indonesia’s growing defense industry. By sharing technological knowledge and manufacturing responsibilities, the project could serve as a cornerstone for long-term defense collaboration. Although the idea of joint ship development has been under consideration for several years, progress was hindered during the administration of former Indonesian President Joko Widodo. His government prioritized the relocation of Indonesia’s capital from Jakarta on Java to Nusantara in Borneo, diverting resources and attention away from defense-related initiatives. The renewed focus on maritime cooperation underscores Indonesia's recognition of its strategic vulnerabilities in the face of rising regional tensions. For Japan, this partnership aligns with its Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy, which emphasizes collaboration with Southeast Asian nations to maintain maritime stability. Japan’s stringent 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology' pose challenges for defense exports. However, these restrictions can be navigated through joint development agreements. Under this framework, Japan can engage in co-manufacturing with partner nations, enabling the transfer of advanced military technology while adhering to domestic legal constraints. The joint naval ship development signals a growing strategic partnership between Japan and Indonesia. Both nations face security challenges, including territorial disputes and the need to secure vital sea lanes for trade and energy supply. The initiative also reflects a broader trend of regional countries strengthening ties with Japan as a counterbalance to assertive maritime activities in the Indo-Pacific. For Indonesia, the partnership offers access to defense technology and training, potentially setting the stage for more collaborative projects in the future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-and-indonesia-explore-co-development-of-warship	2025-01-17T05:49:00-08:00	
Flash info: Russian S-400 System Targets a French Atlantique 2 Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	During the night of January 15-16, 2025, a French Navy Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, operating as part of a NATO mission, was illuminated by the targeting radar of a Russian S-400 air defense system. This action, described as aggressive and contrary to international norms, was condemned on X (formerly Twitter) by French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu. The incident occurred amidst heightened tensions in the Baltic Sea, a strategically critical region where Russian and Western interests frequently clash. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Atlantique 2 was inspecting Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning 200 ships without detecting threats when targeted by a Russian S-400 radar (Picture source: French MoD) NATO patrols in the Baltic Sea aim to ensure maritime security and protect critical infrastructure in the region. These operations have intensified in response to recent incidents, including damage to undersea telecommunications and power cables, which European leaders attribute to potential acts of sabotage by Russia. The Baltic Sentry operation mobilizes frigates, maritime patrol aircraft like the Atlantique 2, and naval drones to effectively monitor these strategic waters. On this occasion, the French Atlantique 2 was conducting inspections near Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning around 200 ships without identifying any suspicious vessels. Based on radar capabilities and operational ranges of the S-400 system, it is likely the responsible battery was located in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. Kaliningrad, a Russian territory situated between Poland and Lithuania, plays a pivotal role in Russia's air defense strategy. The region has hosted S-400 batteries since their initial deployment in April 2012, aimed at bolstering the Baltic Fleet’s air defense. Additional systems were installed at the Gvardeysk military base near Kaliningrad in March 2019 to further secure this strategically sensitive area. These deployments also serve as a deterrent to NATO forces operating in the region, where tensions continue to rise. The S-400 Triumf, developed by Almaz-Antey, is a sophisticated air defense system featuring an advanced radar architecture. At its core is the 92N6 Grave Stone fire control radar, capable of detecting targets up to 400 kilometers away and at altitudes exceeding 50 kilometers. Supporting this is the 96L6 Cheese Board radar, optimized for tracking targets at both low and high altitudes, and the 91N6E Big Bird radar, which can identify threats at ranges up to 600 kilometers in some configurations. This combination enables the S-400 to detect a wide range of threats, from ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft to drones and cruise missiles. The S-400 is further distinguished by its ability to deploy a variety of missiles tailored to specific threats. The 40N6E missile, with a range of 380 kilometers, can engage targets beyond the radar horizon, including those flying at low altitudes. The 48N6DM/48N6E3 missiles with ranges of 250 kilometers and 48N6E2 with 200 kilometers are designed to intercept high-altitude threats, while the 9M96E missiles with a range of 40 kilometers and 9M96E2 with 120 kilometers are optimized for maneuverable threats and those at low altitudes. These hypersonic missiles, capable of speeds up to Mach 15, ensure rapid and precise interception. In its maximum configuration, an S-400 battery can engage up to 80 targets simultaneously and direct 160 missiles within a 360-degree radius. While the S-400’s modular design and advanced capabilities make it a formidable defense system, they come with significant logistical demands, including maintenance and highly trained personnel. These factors underscore the importance of the S-400 systems stationed in Kaliningrad within Russia's broader anti-access and area denial strategy, effectively securing the region against unauthorized aerial incursions. This incident highlights the growing geopolitical tensions between NATO and Russia, particularly against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, specializes in anti-submarine warfare and surveillance missions. With a flight endurance of 14 hours and a range of 4,300 nautical miles, it is a critical asset for NATO operations in the Baltic Sea. Equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, including a magnetic anomaly detector and a 360-degree radar, the Atlantique 2 can efficiently monitor maritime activity in strategic zones. The use of a targeting radar against the Atlantique 2 represents a provocative act, often interpreted as a warning or show of force. While the situation did not escalate further, it underscores the risks of operating in a region where NATO and Russian forces frequently interact. NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, noted that such incidents, though serious, are relatively common and not confined to European theaters. This incident underscores the need for NATO to maintain heightened vigilance against destabilizing actions in the region. In conclusion, this event reflects the delicate balance of power in the Baltic Sea, a critical theater in the broader NATO-Russia rivalry. The advanced capabilities of the S-400 system, coupled with NATO’s strategic resilience, highlight the precarious nature of this region, where each action carries potential implications for international security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-russian-s-400-system-targets-a-french-atlantique-2-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T05:40:11-08:00	
Belgium Invests in Mine Countermeasures with New Ship Liege	According to information published by the Belgian MoD on January 16, 2025, a momentous occasion for the Belgian Navy and the city of Liege unfolded at the Giurgiu shipyard in Romania with the keel-laying ceremony for the Liege, a new mine countermeasures vessel (MCMV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of the Belgian City-class rMcM Liege. (Picture source: Belgian MoD) The keel-laying, a traditional naval ceremony symbolizing the beginning of a ship’s construction, was attended by Belgian Navy officials, local dignitaries, and representatives from Liège. The Liège is being constructed as part of the Belgian-Dutch Replacement Mine Countermeasures (rMCM) program, a joint initiative to replace the aging minehunting fleets of both nations. The ship’s construction follows a phased approach, beginning with the assembly of its hull in Romania. Once this stage is completed, the vessel will be transported to Concarneau, France, where advanced systems and equipment will be installed by Naval Group, a key partner in the project. After its completion, the Liège will undergo rigorous testing, including harbor and sea trials, before being equipped with its weapon systems in Lorient, France. The Liège is one of 12 vessels being built under the rMCM program, with six designated for the Belgian Navy and six for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Scheduled for full operational deployment by 2030, these ships will incorporate innovative minehunting technologies, including a fleet of approximately 100 unmanned drones. These systems, part of a modular toolbox, will enhance the fleet’s ability to detect and neutralize mines effectively. Context Historically, mine warfare in the North Sea has been a pivotal aspect of naval strategy due to the region's strategic importance as a maritime gateway. During the World Wars, the North Sea became a critical theater for deploying naval mines to control access, protect key shipping routes, and limit the movement of enemy fleets. In World War I, the North Sea saw the implementation of extensive minefields, such as the North Sea Mine Barrage. This Allied operation aimed to deter German U-boat activity by creating a massive minefield stretching between Scotland and Norway. Over 70,000 mines were laid in deep waters, marking one of the most ambitious mining operations of the time. The barrage was a logistical feat, demonstrating the role of mines in countering undersea threats, although its actual effectiveness remains debated. During World War II, the North Sea once again became a contested space. Both the Axis and Allied forces employed mines extensively, using them to blockade ports, disrupt shipping lanes, and deny access to critical areas. Mines proved to be a relatively inexpensive yet highly effective tool for naval dominance. The German Navy used magnetic mines, a technological innovation of the era, to great effect, challenging traditional mine-sweeping techniques and forcing the Allies to develop countermeasures. The aftermath of these conflicts left thousands of mines scattered across the seabed, posing long-term risks to navigation, fishing, and infrastructure development. The effort to clear these mines was a monumental task undertaken in the post-war years, and unexploded ordnance from these periods continues to be discovered and neutralized today.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/belgium-invests-in-mine-countermeasures-with-new-ship-liege	2025-01-17T04:49:25-08:00	
Brazilian Army completes the firing tests for its new Italian-made Centauro II BR 8x8 tank destroyers	As reported by Roberto Caiafa on January 17, 2025, the Brazilian Army has completed the final phase of operational evaluations for its first Centauro II BR 8x8 tank destroyers at the Saicã Firing Range. These tests included live firing of 120mm HEAT and APFSDS ammunition at a decommissioned Urutu 6x6 vehicle to assess the firepower of the two Italian-made Centauro II vehicles against armored threats. These evaluations are part of the approval process to determine the suitability of the Centauro II for operational use under the Army's modernization program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Centauro II BR tank destroyer is armed with a manually loaded 120mm L45 smoothbore gun capable of firing NATO-standard ammunition, as well as a coaxial FN MAG58 7.62mm machine gun and another pintle-mounted MAG58. (Picture source: 6ª Bda Inf Bld) Brazil’s procurement of the Centauro II tank destroyer is intended to replace the aging fleet of EE-9 Cascavel 6x6 reconnaissance vehicles, developed domestically in the 1970s and now inadequate for modern operational needs. Armed with 90mm guns, the Cascavel has become obsolete, necessitating the acquisition of a more advanced vehicle. The initial contract, signed in November 2022, covers 98 vehicles valued at approximately $1 billion, with delivery planned over 15 years. A second tranche for 123 additional vehicles, worth an estimated $1.1 billion, is proposed to bring the total fleet to 221 vehicles, addressing Brazil’s long-term requirements for armored mobility and firepower. The decision to acquire the Centauro II followed a competitive evaluation process in which it was selected over other platforms based on operational performance, industrial benefits, and compatibility with existing infrastructure. The program has faced delays, including logistical challenges when the first two vehicles were temporarily held in Germany during transit. Initial deliveries have undergone trials, and production is expected to transition to Brazil, where Iveco’s Sete Lagoas facility will oversee assembly. Modified to meet Brazilian Army specifications, the Centauro II BR features a 720-horsepower Iveco Vector V8 engine, modular armor, a V-shaped hull for mine resistance, and a CBRN protection system. The Centauro II BR is equipped with a manually loaded 120mm L45 smoothbore gun capable of firing NATO-standard ammunition, including APFSDS and HEAT rounds. Its turret includes a coaxial FN MAG58 7.62mm machine gun and a pintle-mounted MAG58, with plans to integrate the Brazilian-made REMAX 4 remote weapon station in future batches. The vehicle is fitted with eight 76mm smoke grenade dischargers, an advanced fire control system, and a situational awareness suite featuring thermal and day cameras. Communication systems include the L3Harris Falcon III VHF radio, Thales SOTAS M3 intercom, and the SGB battle management system. Locally developed solutions, such as a software-defined multi-band radio under the RDS-Defesa project by CTEx and AEL Sistemas, may replace these systems in future iterations. Brazil’s procurement of the Centauro II tank destroyer is intended to replace the aging fleet of EE-9 Cascavel 6x6 reconnaissance vehicles, developed domestically in the 1970s and now inadequate for modern operational needs. (Picture source: 6ª Bda Inf Bld) This procurement is part of a broader initiative to modernize Brazil’s armed forces through the acquisition of advanced equipment and the development of domestic production capabilities. These efforts include purchasing 12 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, upgrading the A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, and exploring options for a new fighter to complement the Gripen, with candidates such as the Indian Tejas and the Chinese J-10 under consideration. Domestically, the KC-390 Millennium, Brazil's largest military aircraft, the MSS 1.2 AC anti-tank missile, and the ASTROS multiple rocket launcher system represent several advancements in the country’s defense manufacturing. The primary goal of these initiatives is to enhance Brazil’s sovereignty and address regional security challenges. Brazil’s extensive borders with countries such as Paraguay and Bolivia are critical transit points for transnational crimes, including drug trafficking and smuggling. To combat these threats, the government has deployed armed forces to secure borders, ports, and airports, forming part of a broader strategy to ensure territorial integrity and internal stability. Brazil has also enhanced its military presence along the border with Venezuela, partly due to tensions stemming from the Venezuela-Guyana territorial dispute over the Essequibo region. In early 2024, additional troops and armored vehicles were deployed to Roraima state to enhance security and monitor developments. This effort is complemented by Brazil’s participation in joint military exercises with global powers such as the United States and China. The Italian Army has ordered 150 units of the Centauro II tank destroyer to replace its Centauro I fleet, following several contracts signed in 2018, 2020, and 2024. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Centauro II tank destroyer succeeds the Centauro I, introduced in the early 1990s to provide mobile firepower against armored threats. Developed during the Cold War, the Centauro I combined an 8x8 wheeled platform with a 105mm gun. It was employed in various conflict and peacekeeping scenarios, including Somalia and Lebanon, and was recognized for its effectiveness in reconnaissance and fire support missions. The Centauro II builds on this legacy, integrating advancements in armament and protection. The Centauro II features a 120mm smoothbore gun compatible with NATO-standard ammunition, including advanced airburst and APFSDS rounds. Its fire control systems and targeting equipment, such as stabilized sights and optronics, enable precise target engagement. Powered by a 720-horsepower Iveco Vector V8 engine, the vehicle achieves a maximum speed of 105 km/h and a range of 800 kilometers. Protection measures include modular armor meeting AEP 55 standards, a V-shaped hull for mine resistance, and NBC protection systems, enhancing its effectiveness in varied combat scenarios. The Italian Army, the original operator of the Centauro II, has ordered 150 units to replace its Centauro I fleet. Initial contracts were signed in 2018, followed by additional orders in 2020 and 2024. These vehicles feature upgraded armor, advanced communication systems, and NATO-compliant configurations. Italy’s procurement strategy integrates the Centauro II into its cavalry regiments, addressing both conventional and asymmetric operational needs. The vehicles have also been deployed in NATO contexts, highlighting their role in Italy’s modernization efforts.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/brazilian-army-completes-the-operational-tests-for-its-italian-made-centauro-ii-br-8x8-tank-destroyers	2025-01-17T03:57:58-08:00
