HMS Agamemnon: newest Astute-class submarine launched by Royal Navy	According to information published by the UK MoD on October 3, 2024, the Royal Navy's newest hunter-killer submarine, HMS Agamemnon, has officially taken to the water following her launch at BAE Systems' shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's Astute-class submarine Agamemnon. (Picture source: British MoD) The 7,400-tonne vessel, nicknamed 'Awesome Aggie,' is the sixth of seven Astute-class submarines being constructed for the UK’s Silent Service. Named after the legendary Greek king who led the siege of Troy, HMS Agamemnon is designed to operate at the forefront of the Royal Navy’s operations well into the latter half of the 21st century. Equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles and advanced intelligence capabilities, she will play a critical role in protecting the UK’s nuclear deterrent and carrier strike groups from hostile threats while also being able to carry out precision strikes on land when necessary. The launch, which coincides with the 123rd anniversary of the nation’s first submarine being completed at the same Barrow shipyard, is a significant milestone for all involved in the Astute programme. With construction still underway on the seventh and final Astute-class submarine, HMS Agincourt, and the first of the next-generation nuclear deterrent submarines, HMS Dreadnought, the Barrow facility remains a hub of vital naval engineering. HMS Agamemnon enters the final phases of testing and commissioning. Royal Navy The Royal Navy is currently facing a multitude of challenges, driven by both external threats and internal limitations. One of the most pressing issues is the aging fleet, compounded by difficulties in introducing new vessels and technologies quickly enough. Although progress is being made with the construction of new ships like the Type 31 frigates and the Dreadnought-class submarines, these projects face significant delays and logistical bottlenecks. As a result, older ships must remain in service longer than anticipated, which increases maintenance costs and risks operational readiness​. Another critical challenge is funding. While the UK government has committed to expanding the fleet, a significant budgetary shortfall remains. For example, many programs, including the development of new frigates and support ships, are still unfunded. This creates a scenario where the Navy must carefully balance immediate needs with long-term investments, often leading to compromises that prioritize cheaper options over operationally optimal solutions​. The Navy also faces substantial workforce challenges. Recruitment and retention of skilled personnel have become increasingly difficult, particularly in technical fields. This problem is exacerbated by the push towards lean crewing and automation, which, while improving efficiency, also introduces cyber vulnerabilities and places additional strain on the workforce​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/hms-agamemnon-newest-astute-class-submarine-launched-by-royal-navy	2024-10-03T06:08:48-07:00	
KAI Poised to Secure Support Contract for Philippine FA-50PHs	The Philippines is set to sign a performance-based logistics (PBL) contract with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to support its fleet of FA-50PH light combat aircraft. This deal marks a first for KAI, as it is the first PBL contract awarded for an aircraft exported by South Korea. KAI has received a notice of award for this task, representing a new milestone in the defense cooperation between South Korea and the Philippines. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Introduced to the Philippines in 2013, the FA-50 Fighting Eagle is equipped with advanced ejection seats, sophisticated weapons control systems, and long-range detection and tracking capabilities (Picture source: PAF) The FA-50 is a light combat aircraft developed by KAI, derived from the T-50 Golden Eagle, originally designed as a supersonic advanced trainer and light attack aircraft. It is in service with several air forces, including those of South Korea, Poland, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. A cost-effective and capable platform, the FA-50 offers performance levels comparable to higher-end fighter aircraft. Equipped with advanced systems, the FA-50 features a tandem cockpit for two crew members, night vision imaging capabilities, modern avionics with inertial navigation and GPS, and a multifunction radar. It can carry up to 4.5 tons of weapons, including AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, JDAM precision-guided bombs, and a 20mm internal cannon. Powered by a General Electric F404-GE-102 turbofan engine, the aircraft can reach a maximum speed of Mach 1.5. The FA-50PH variant used by the Philippines enhances their air defense capabilities with similar features, making it a key asset for their air force. The initial agreement covers a one-year period, valued at approximately 27 billion won (around $20 million). It includes the supply of spare parts, maintenance, inventory management, and other essential services to support the Philippine Air Force’s 12 FA-50PH aircraft. This pilot phase is intended to serve as the foundation for securing longer-term, multi-year contracts in the future. The significance of this contract is reinforced by the high availability rates of the FA-50s during the recent Pitch Black exercise in Australia, thanks to the client support provided by KAI. This experience has allowed KAI to leverage its expertise in PBL contracts, developed over the years with similar programs for the South Korean military, including the T-50 series, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the KUH-1 Surion utility helicopter. KAI estimates that over a 30-40 year lifespan, the follow-up support costs of the aircraft could range from two to five times the original acquisition price. The performance-based support model is expected to benefit both parties by enhancing the operational capabilities of the aircraft while reducing long-term operating costs. KAI President Kang Koo-young stated that this contract with the Philippines could serve as the foundation for future international PBL contracts, enabling KAI to expand its maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services to other countries operating FA-50 or similar systems. In August 2024, KAI signed a memorandum of understanding with Thai Aerospace Industries to provide local support for the Royal Thai Air Force’s T-50TH advanced jet trainers. The company also hopes to secure a PBL contract for these aircraft. Introduced to the Philippines in 2013, the FA-50 Fighting Eagle is equipped with advanced ejection seats, sophisticated weapons control systems, and long-range detection and tracking capabilities. Measuring 13 meters in length and 9 meters in wingspan, the aircraft is powered by a General Electric turbofan engine, allowing it to reach a maximum speed of 1,852 km/h. Armed with a three-barrel cannon, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, and precision-guided bombs, the FA-50 provides a versatile, multi-role platform for the Philippine Air Force.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/kai-poised-to-secure-support-contract-for-philippine-fa-50phs	2024-10-03T05:57:47-07:00	
US Open to Selling F-15 Fighter Jets to Türkiye: A Possible Alternative if the Eurofighter Deal Fails	According to information from TurDef on October 3, 2024, defense relations between Türkiye and the U.S. could take a significant turn with the potential sale of F-15 fighter jets to Ankara. When asked about the possibility of Türkiye acquiring Boeing F-15C Eagle or F-15EX Eagle II fighters, U.S. sources expressed openness to the idea, stating, 'We would love to sell our jets to Türkiye.' However, the same sources clarified that no meetings or official requests have taken place regarding the potential sale of F-15s.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-15C Eagle assigned to the 44th Fighter Squadron returns from a training sortie at Kadena Air Base, Japan, Dec. 20, 2022 (Picture source: US DoD) Interest in the F-15s has emerged as Türkiye explores alternatives to its previous plans to acquire Russian fighter jets and its more recent focus on the Eurofighter Typhoon, a deal supported by the United Kingdom. However, reports indicate that Germany, a partner in the Eurofighter program, may oppose the acquisition behind the scenes, raising concerns that the deal could fail. In such a scenario, the F-15s could become a viable option for Türkiye. While the U.S. is open to the sale of these aircraft, any such transaction would likely be contingent on resolving the ongoing issue surrounding the S-400 air defense system, which Türkiye purchased from Russia in 2019. This acquisition led to the imposition of CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) sanctions and Türkiye’s removal from the F-35 program. Under U.S. law, specifically the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021 and Section 1241 of CAATSA, sanctions can only be lifted if Türkiye relinquishes the S-400 systems, removes Russian personnel involved in their maintenance, and guarantees that it will not attempt to reacquire them in the future. Without these assurances, progress in negotiations for F-15 sales would remain stalled. The S-400 issue continues to be a major obstacle in U.S.-Turkish defense relations. Recently, Greek media reported that the U.S. proposed stationing the S-400 systems at Incirlik Air Base in Türkiye to bypass the impasse. This suggestion was firmly rejected by Ankara, which refuses any relocation of the S-400 systems. U.S. sources confirmed that this idea would not resolve the underlying issue, as the U.S. requires full compliance with CAATSA and NDAA provisions to lift the sanctions. An F-15EX Eagle II from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron, 53rd Wing, takes flight for the first time out of Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., April 26, 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) Despite these challenges, there is cautious optimism about a possible post-CAATSA era in U.S.-Turkish defense relations. U.S. sources believe that, once sanctions are lifted, opportunities for cooperation could expand, particularly in the defense industry. 'There is a lot of potential for deeper cooperation in this field, as we know Turkish defense companies employ highly skilled engineers and produce excellent equipment,' one source noted. The source also mentioned potential interest in exploring the integration of Turkish products into U.S. platforms, depending on how the situation evolves. In the meantime, negotiations are underway for a $23 billion deal between Türkiye and the U.S. as part of a modernization program for the Turkish F-16 fleet. This deal includes the acquisition of AIM-120 C-8 AMRAAM missiles, AN/APG-83 AESA SABR radars, as well as other weapons such as GBU-39/B bombs, AGM-88B and AGM-88E missiles, AIM-9X Block II missiles, and JDAM kits. These discussions, initially expected to conclude in June, are still ongoing, partly due to the complexity of the CAATSA-related issues. Additionally, questions remain about the F-35 program, from which Türkiye was excluded. Six F-35 jets originally intended for Türkiye remain stored at U.S. air bases, where they are regularly maintained. U.S. sources have declined to provide details on the storage costs but confirmed that the jets are kept operational. Regarding the possibility of Türkiye rejoining the F-35 program, the option is still on the table, although current political and legal conditions have yet to allow progress in this direction.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-open-to-selling-f-15-fighter-jets-to-tuerkiye-a-possible-alternative-if-the-eurofighter-deal-fails	2024-10-03T05:23:21-07:00

(Picture source: Belgian MoD) REPMUS is not a typical naval exercise. It serves as an annual gathering of NATO members, scientists, and leading technology firms, all focused on experimenting with groundbreaking autonomous systems. This year’s exercise placed a particular emphasis on unmanned systems like drones and autonomous vessels, capable of tasks ranging from mine detection to drug interdiction and search-and-rescue missions. The 2024 edition saw participation from 26 navies, alongside over 30 scientific institutions and companies. Belgium's Very Shallow Water (VSW) team played a significant role in the exercise. Specializing in mine detection in shallow waters, the team used an underwater drone to locate hidden objects on the seabed. After conducting initial surveys, the team assessed the objects and investigated them further using drones with cameras or divers. The team also tested new technology to improve the efficiency of their operations, significantly speeding up tasks that once took hours of manual labor. During the exercise, emerging systems were also tested that will be deployed on Belgium’s future mine countermeasure vessels. In partnership with industry and academia, Belgium's defense forces are researching technologies for detecting floating mines, with earlier tests having been conducted on drones equipped with advanced sensor and camera systems. Given the differences between the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean—especially in terms of visibility, wind, and currents—REPMUS24 provided a critical opportunity to test floating mine detection in challenging conditions. Belgian Navy unmanned systems The Belgian Navy is advancing its use of unmanned systems, with particular emphasis on improving mine countermeasures and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) capabilities. Through the rMCM (replacement Mine Countermeasures) program, Belgium, in collaboration with the Netherlands, is replacing its older minehunters with new vessels that are equipped with a range of unmanned systems. These systems, which include underwater, surface, and aerial drones, are designed to enhance the detection and disposal of underwater mines. Each navy will receive six vessels, with the Belgian ships expected to be operational by 2024​. Additionally, the Belgian Navy has incorporated the Exail R7 Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) into its fleet. This ROV, specifically designed for EOD missions, can operate in various underwater conditions up to a depth of 300 meters. It is equipped with advanced sonar, positioning systems, and cameras, which enable it to conduct inspections and neutralize underwater explosive threats. This acquisition complements other unmanned technologies being integrated into Belgium's maritime defense, including the K-STER mine disposal system​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/belgian-navy-embraces-drone-technology-at-repmus24-exercise-in-portugal	2024-10-03T02:48:57-07:00

South Korea and Japan resume joint maritime resource talks after 40-year hiatus	According to information published by The Korea Herald on September 26, 2024, Seoul and Tokyo are set to reignite discussions on joint maritime resource development in the East China Sea, marking the first such dialogue in nearly 40 years.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The talks focus on undersea resource exploration beneath the continental shelf south of Jeju Island, an area that has long been contested for its untapped reserves of petroleum and other minerals. This significant development comes just months before Japan could potentially issue a termination notice for their 1974 agreement, which established a joint development zone (JDZ) covering 82,557 square kilometers of the East China Sea. The agreement, which was designed to mitigate disputes over maritime boundaries, is set to expire in June 2028 unless one party opts out with three years’ notice. The last formal discussions were held in 1985, with negotiations stalling due to economic and legal challenges. Japan, citing concerns about the viability of the resources in the JDZ, had resisted further engagement. However, pressure from South Korea and the looming deadline for potential termination have brought Japan back to the table. In this latest round of talks, both countries are expected to reassess the economic potential of the area and explore possibilities for new joint research initiatives. The discussions, however, will remain centered on the implementation of the existing agreement, rather than on its potential extension. The talks will be led by high-level representatives from both countries' foreign and energy ministries, with South Korea expected to emphasize the importance of continued exploration efforts, despite past setbacks. While Japan's stance remains uncertain, the resumption of dialogue signals a cautious willingness to revisit the long-dormant collaboration. The outcome of these talks could shape the future of resource development in the East China Sea, as both nations weigh their options ahead of the agreement’s possible termination. South Korea - Japan relations Naval relations between South Korea and Japan have seen notable improvement in recent years, largely driven by shared security concerns, particularly North Korea's growing nuclear threat. Both countries, along with the United States, have been increasingly involved in trilateral military exercises, which serve to enhance cooperation and interoperability among their naval forces. One key development has been the institutionalization of joint exercises, such as the 'Freedom Edge' drills, which involve complex, multi-domain operations spanning naval, air, and cyber domains. These exercises not only improve operational coordination but also signal a unified stance against regional threats, especially from North Korea, whose missile tests have escalated regional tensions. These trilateral exercises often involve advanced assets, including aircraft carriers and Aegis-equipped destroyers, underscoring the seriousness of the security environment. However, the historical tension between South Korea and Japan, stemming from Japan's colonization of Korea (1910-1945), continues to be a sensitive issue. Efforts to improve relations, such as resolving incidents like the 2018 patrol aircraft dispute, have been crucial for the countries to move forward in their defense cooperation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/south-korea-and-japan-resume-joint-maritime-resource-talks-after-40-year-hiatus	2024-10-03T01:13:58-07:00

Iranian Media Alleges Destruction of Israeli F-35 Fighters in Missile Strike	On October 2, 2024, a series of reports and videos began circulating on social media, particularly on Telegram and X, claiming that Iranian missiles had successfully targeted and destroyed Israeli airbases, including entire squadrons of Lockheed Martin F-35I Adir fighters. These claims, mostly propagated by Iranian state media, quickly gained traction among pro-Iranian supporters. The claims followed Iran’s largest missile attack on Israel to date, with more than 180 missiles launched. The strikes, involving Fattah-1 and Kheybarshekan missiles, were said to be larger and more complex than those carried out in April.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35I is a customized version of the F-35A, featuring Israeli-made modifications to its avionics, electronic warfare systems, and weapons. (Picture source: Israeli Air Forces) Israel was the first country to select the F-35 through the U.S. government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program after signing a Letter of Agreement in October 2010. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) named the F-35 'Adir,' meaning 'The Mighty One' in Hebrew. On June 22, 2016, the IAF received its first F-35 Adir. The Israeli F-35 fleet was declared operational in December 2017, marking the end of an intensive integration and training effort at Nevatim Airbase, Israel. Israel’s procurement of the Lockheed Martin F-35I 'Adir' began with a formal agreement in 2010, making it the first country to acquire this aircraft via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The first batch of nine F-35Is became operational with the IAF in December 2017. By November 2022, Israel had 36 F-35Is in service, including a unique testbed version for integrating Israeli-made systems. These aircraft, based at Nevatim Airbase, are part of three operational squadrons. The F-35I is a customized version of the F-35A, featuring Israeli-made modifications to its avionics, electronic warfare systems, and weapons. The stealth capabilities, advanced sensor systems, and versatility of the F-35I provide Israel with significant advantages in situational awareness, precision targeting, and combat effectiveness. In May 2018, Israel became the first country to use the F-35 in combat, demonstrating its operational capabilities. Despite these speculations, Israeli authorities quickly claimed that most of the missiles had been intercepted and destroyed, minimizing damage and avoiding any casualties in Israel. Iranian propagandists, however, insisted that significant damage was inflicted, particularly at Nevatim Airbase, home to two F-35I squadrons, claiming it had been completely destroyed. Videos showing missiles targeting Tel Aviv and footage purportedly showing damage to F-35s in Gaza further fueled the controversy. Satellite image of Nevatim Air Base before the Iranian strikes on September 19, 2024. (Picture source: Esry) The Israeli military acknowledged that some of its airbases were hit during Iran’s massive ballistic missile attack but clarified that the strikes did not impair the operational capacity of the IAF. Missiles caused minor damage to offices and maintenance areas at the bases, but critical infrastructure and aircraft remained unaffected. The attack involved about 200 ballistic missiles, but most were intercepted by Israeli and U.S. defense systems, limiting the damage. Several experts pointed out that these claims lack verifiable evidence. According to Dr. Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of public communication at American University, while it is possible that some missiles struck Israeli airbases, the claim that dozens of F-35s were destroyed appears to be fabricated. Braddock also referenced reports of a protest by Palestinian activists at a factory producing F-35 components, though this seemed to have little impact on production. Despite doubts, disinformation continued to spread on social media. Exaggerated claims of Iranian success were widely shared, lending further credibility to the initial reports. This resulted in a mix of misinformation and disinformation. According to Braddock, misinformation occurs when individuals share images or videos believing them to be true without critically evaluating the content. In contrast, disinformation involves a deliberate effort to spread false information for strategic purposes. Satellite image of Nevatim Air Base after the Iranian attacks with the various visible impacts, October 3, 2024 (Picture source: X Channel @ClashReport) In this case, it is likely that Iranian state media and its operatives engaged in a coordinated campaign to present a fictional narrative, using false or exaggerated claims to reinforce the perceived success of the missile strikes. Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor at the University of New Haven, emphasized that these campaigns aim not necessarily to convince the public of outright lies but to create confusion by flooding the media with contradictory information. This tactic aims to overwhelm individuals with data, making it harder to discern truth from falsehood. Even if Israeli authorities were to counter these claims by providing evidence of minimal damage, such as photos of largely intact airbases, there is a risk that this too would be dismissed as misinformation. In this way, Tehran could gain a short-term advantage by casting doubt on Israel's defensive capabilities and downplaying the ineffectiveness of its missile attack. In reality, reports indicate that while not all Iranian missiles were intercepted, those that reached their targets caused minimal damage, with no casualties in Israel. This outcome is likely embarrassing for Iran, whose missile attack failed to achieve the level of destruction it may have intended. However, by spreading exaggerated claims about the effectiveness of the attack, Iranian propagandists seek to shift the narrative in their favor, creating the perception that the strikes were far more successful than they actually were.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iranian-media-alleges-destruction-of-israeli-f-35-fighters-in-missile-strike	2024-10-03T00:47:11-07:00

Comments China’s naval and geopolitical interests in the Arctic are driven by a combination of strategic, economic, and scientific objectives. Although China is not an Arctic state, it has declared itself a 'near-Arctic' nation and aims to play a significant role in the region. This ambition is articulated through its 'Polar Silk Road' strategy, which promotes the use of Arctic shipping routes, particularly the Northern Sea Route (NSR), as a faster and safer alternative for transporting goods, including energy supplies, between Asia and Europe. These Arctic passages are becoming more viable as climate change reduces sea ice, shortening transit times significantly compared to traditional routes like the Suez Canal. China’s Arctic strategy emphasizes scientific research, commercial interests, and navigational rights. Beijing operates multiple icebreakers, and its investments in polar ship technology and Arctic infrastructure, including partnerships with Russia, reflect its long-term commitment to the region. The country has also been involved in shipping along the NSR, reducing transport times and costs for energy imports from Russia. Militarily, China maintains a cautious approach in the Arctic, seeking to balance its growing presence with a focus on international law and peaceful development. However, concerns about dual-use technologies—such as synthetic aperture radar for sea ice monitoring, which can also support naval operations—indicate that Beijing's Arctic ambitions have military implications. This is particularly significant as China seeks to enhance its understanding of Arctic conditions, which could support submarine operations in the region. China's Arctic interests are multifaceted, blending scientific exploration with economic and strategic objectives, while carefully navigating the legal complexities of the region. Its growing partnership with Russia, particularly in polar operations and Arctic governance, further solidifies its stake in the future of the Arctic.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinese-and-russian-coast-guards-conduct-first-ever-joint-patrols-in-arctic-ocean	2024-10-02T07:30:59-07:00

Spain's UAV Navigation Joins European Future Combat Air System Program	Spanish company UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía has officially announced its participation in the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program, one of Europe's most ambitious defense initiatives. The FCAS program aims to develop a Next-Generation Weapon System (NGWS), integrating both manned combat aircraft and remotely piloted air systems, all connected through an advanced Combat Cloud. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía contributes to FCAS under Pillar 3, focusing on remote operators (Picture source: BAE Systems) This integration seeks to ensure air superiority in future conflicts by combining human and unmanned assets into a coordinated cloud-based network. The program was initially launched by France, Germany, and Spain to develop a new generation of combat aircraft that will replace current fighters such as the French Rafale and the German and Spanish Eurofighter by 2040. The core of the program is the development of a 6th-generation fighter, known as the New Generation Fighter (NGF), which will be integrated with drones and other remotely operated systems. FCAS was conceived in 2017 through the efforts of France and Germany, with Spain joining later. The main industrial partners are Dassault Aviation, Airbus Defence and Space, Thales, and Indra. Dassault is in charge of the NGF, while Airbus oversees the development of the Remote Carriers (drones) and the Combat Cloud to enable coordination between these systems. The overarching goal is to maintain Europe's air dominance while meeting the needs of future conflicts. UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía contributes to FCAS under Pillar 3, focusing on remote operators. The company collaborates with SATNUS Technologies SL, a consortium made up of GMV, Sener Aeroespacial, and Tecnobit-Grupo Oesía. SATNUS is responsible for maturing technologies and reducing risks related to the development of remotely piloted components of the NGWS. Airbus GmbH leads this pillar at the European level, while MBDA oversees French involvement, and SATNUS heads Spanish efforts. UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía's key contribution is providing its autopilot system for the Manned-Unmanned Teaming &amp; Common Systems Demonstrator (MCSD). This demonstrator, led by SATNUS, is crucial for advancing the Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUT) architecture, allowing for the integration of human and remotely piloted systems. The MCSD is part of the first phase of technology demonstrations within FCAS, testing and validating new technologies. Despite its ambitious scope, the FCAS program has faced challenges. Tensions between French and German industrial partners have led to significant delays. Dassault and Airbus have disagreed over task allocation, particularly regarding flight controls and stealth technology, pushing back the program's completion date from 2040 to possibly 2050. Additionally, disagreements over industrial workload, funding, and Germany’s reluctance to arm certain drones have caused further complications. These internal challenges are compounded by political differences among the participating countries. Germany, historically more pacifist and cautious about certain military aspects like nuclear deterrence, differs from France in its vision for the offensive capabilities of the future aircraft. Therefore, FCAS still faces political and industrial hurdles that must be overcome to ensure the success of this crucial European defense project. UAV Navigation-Grupo Oesía's autopilot system will play a vital role in the technical development, integration, and operation of remotely piloted systems, helping them meet the stringent requirements of the FCAS program. This collaboration showcases the importance of European defense companies working together to develop cutting-edge solutions for future combat scenarios, which may help overcome some of the challenges currently faced by the program.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/spains-uav-navigation-joins-european-future-combat-air-system-program	2024-10-02T04:54:46-07:00	
Japan to unveil new submarine at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries naming and launch ceremony	According to information published by the Japanese MoD on October 2, 2024, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will host the naming and launch ceremony for the fifth Taigei-class submarine at its Kobe shipyard. The official name of the vessel will remain undisclosed until the conclusion of the ceremony.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Navy's Taigei-class submarine. (Picture source: Japanese MoD) The Taigei-class submarines represent a significant advancement in Japan’s undersea warfare capabilities, succeeding the Soryu-class within the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). Designed to improve stealth, endurance, and combat efficiency, these submarines showcase cutting-edge technology while maintaining a traditional diesel-electric propulsion system, supported by the innovative use of lithium-ion batteries. The shift to lithium-ion batteries allows the Taigei-class submarines to operate underwater for longer periods compared to their predecessors, without the need for an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. This is particularly important for enhancing the stealth profile, as it reduces the need to surface frequently, thus minimizing detection risks. Additionally, these batteries offer higher energy efficiency and are compact, allowing for more effective power management during extended missions. Structurally, the Taigei-class maintains a similar size to the Soryu-class but incorporates a redesigned pressure hull made from high-strength steel, enhancing its durability under extreme underwater pressure. The acoustic signature has been further reduced through the use of new sound-absorbing materials and a floating floor structure, ensuring quieter operations—critical for stealth missions in contested waters. On the operational side, the Taigei-class submarines are equipped with advanced sonar systems that improve detection capabilities, especially in tracking other submarines and vessels in complex maritime environments. The combat management systems have been upgraded to integrate various sensors and weapons more seamlessly. These submarines carry an array of armaments, including the Mitsubishi-built Type 89 torpedoes and UGM-84 Harpoon Block II missiles, providing both anti-submarine and anti-ship strike capabilities. The lead vessel, JS Taigei, entered service in 2022 and serves as a test platform for future JMSDF submarine technologies, while its successors like Hakugei and Jingei are fully operational units	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japan-to-unveil-new-submarine-at-mitsubishi-heavy-industries-naming-and-launch-ceremony	2024-10-02T04:22:12-07:00	
Lockheed Martin Given Authority to Choose Contractor for F-35 Fighter Jet’s Power and Thermal Management System Program	In an official statement released on October 1, 2024, the Joint Program Office (JPO) revealed that Lockheed Martin has been identified as the only entity capable of successfully leading the next phase of the Power and Thermal Management Upgrade (PTMU) program, following a 'comprehensive market research' conducted this year.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Power and Thermal Management Upgrade program, PTMU. (Picture source: Pratt &amp; Whitney) The JPO also specified that 'the contract award for the upcoming phase of the PTMU program is expected in Fall 2024.' In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, the goal will be to ensure that all available PTMU solution options are evaluated in terms of performance and economic feasibility for integration into existing aircraft, thereby maximizing fighter capability while taking budgetary constraints into account. However, the statement did not clarify whether Lockheed Martin will have the authority to choose the contractor responsible for the Power and Thermal Management System (PTMS). The current PTMS, manufactured by Honeywell, has shown limitations in meeting the growing needs of the F-35 program, particularly due to additional electronic upgrades associated with the Block 4 of the aircraft. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) had already raised concerns in a May 2023 report, indicating that the current PTMS is 'overtasked.' This forces the F135 engine to operate 'beyond its design parameters,' leading to increased engine wear and high maintenance costs. Over the projected 58-year lifespan of the F-35 program, these costs could reach up to $38 billion. Collins Aerospace, another company under RTX, has proposed an alternative solution with its Enhanced Power and Cooling System (EPACS). The company stated in 2022 that it would be ready to enter an engineering and manufacturing development phase for EPACS by mid-2024 if a tender was launched. Although Collins seems prepared to take on the challenge, the JPO's direction in selecting the new PTMS system remains to be seen. At the same time, the Pentagon made a significant decision regarding the future of F-35 propulsion. It opted not to adopt the engines developed under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) by Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE Aerospace. While these engines promised a 30% performance improvement over the F135 engine, they were not compatible with the F-35B variant used by the Marine Corps, which requires short take-off and vertical landing capabilities. Adapting them to the Navy's F-35C variant would have also posed technical challenges. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall expressed his regret last year that the service could not include the development and production of the AETP engines in the fiscal year 2025 budget request. However, the Pentagon insisted on maintaining compatibility among all F-35 variants for both U.S. and international users, leading to the choice of the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) as the preferred solution. Despite the abandonment of the AETP program, Pratt &amp; Whitney claims that the ECU will incorporate many innovations developed under AETP. A company spokesperson emphasized that 'over 1,200 F135 engines have been produced, with over 900,000 flight hours logged.' These figures highlight the significance of this engine for the global F-35 fleet. The PTMU program and the decisions surrounding the future of the F-35’s energy and cooling management system will play a crucial role in optimizing the aircraft’s performance and reducing long-term maintenance costs. Fall 2024 will mark a pivotal moment with the contract award and the start of the next development phase for the F-35, one of the most costly and strategic armament programs in the United States.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/lockheed-martin-given-authority-to-choose-contractor-for-f-35-fighter-jets-power-and-thermal-management-system-program	2024-10-02T03:30:38-07:00	
India set to finalize deal for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets after major price cut	According to information published by Times of India on September 30, 2024, India is on the verge of sealing a deal with France for the acquisition of 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets, which are expected to enhance the Indian Navy's operational capabilities aboard its aircraft carriers.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Rafale-M fighter aircraft. (Picture source: Dassault) After a series of negotiations spanning over a year, a final price has been reached, marking a considerable reduction from initial estimates. The agreement, anticipated to be signed soon, is closely modeled on the 2016 contract that saw the Indian Air Force acquire 36 Rafale jets. Discussions around the deal have gained momentum ahead of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval's visit to Paris, where talks will likely cover both the fighter jets and a separate order for three additional Kalvari class submarines to be constructed in Mumbai. These discussions are set within the framework of India and France's robust defense partnership. The Rafale Marine jets are intended to operate from India's aircraft carriers, addressing a critical requirement for 26 carrier-borne fighters. Following extensive evaluations of both Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and Dassault's Rafale M, the Indian Navy opted for the Rafale on technical grounds. The aircraft is seen as a suitable complement to the Air Force's fleet, and will be equipped with advanced anti-ship weaponry and long-range fuel tanks optimized for maritime operations. Additionally, the Rafale Ms will come equipped with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, one of the most advanced systems of its kind in the region. The acquisition is being conducted through the government-to-government route, similar to the previous deal for the Air Force. Recent amendments by the Defence Acquisition Council, led by Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, streamlined the process. This included the removal of plans to integrate Indian radar and weapon systems into the naval jets, a decision made due to the high costs and an estimated eight-year timeline for completion. While this purchase of Rafale Marine jets is seen as a temporary solution, it bridges the gap until India's Aeronautical Development Agency completes its indigenous twin-engine deck-based fighter project.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/india-set-to-finalize-deal-for-26-rafale-marine-fighter-jets-after-major-price-cut	2024-10-02T02:29:03-07:00	
Imminent Stationing of Nearly 100 Leopard 2 A8 Tanks in Lithuania: A New Force Against Russian Threat	On October 1, 2024, Lithuanian Minister of National Defense, Laurynas Kasčiūnas, reaffirmed in an interview with the television channel LRT the government's intention to order Leopard 2 main battle tanks by the end of the year. This statement marks a crucial step in a project that has been ongoing since the beginning of the year, initiated under the leadership of Arvydas Anušauskas, the previous Minister of Defense. Anušauskas had previously announced the formation of a Lithuanian tank battalion designed to be fully interoperable with German forces. During initial discussions, it was determined that the Leopard 2 A8 was the most efficient and suitable tank to meet the requirements of the Lithuanian Army.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) The Leopard 2A8 is the latest evolution in the Leopard 2 family of main battle tanks, developed by German companies KMW and Rheinmetall. This modern tank is equipped with a 120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun, capable of firing a variety of munitions, including the programmable DM11 for precise strikes. The Leopard 2A8 also features an advanced protection system, integrating next-generation multi-layered armor and the Israeli Trophy Active Protection System (APS), providing an effective defense against anti-tank missiles and rockets. The tank boasts impressive mobility thanks to its 1,600-horsepower engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 70 km/h and overcome various obstacles, with an operational range of 450 kilometers. In terms of crew protection and safety, the Leopard 2A8 is equipped with reinforced armor, particularly around the turret and hull, to enhance its resistance to mines and other modern threats. Its advanced fire control system allows for exceptional precision, even while on the move, and its optical systems, such as third-generation thermal imaging, ensure increased visibility in adverse conditions. Additionally, this tank is equipped with an NBC protection system against nuclear, biological, and chemical threats, ensuring the survival of the crew in hostile environments. Lithuania aims to build a powerful land division capable of addressing the region's growing security needs. In July, Kasčiūnas spoke about strengthening the heavy combat capabilities of the Lithuanian army, mentioning the possible acquisition of a tracked infantry fighting vehicle in addition to the Leopard 2. However, he also noted that the number of combat vehicles to be ordered would depend directly on available financial resources, indicating that the extent of the project would be contingent on the budget. The Leopard 2 A8, the latest version of the renowned German battle tank, was first presented to the public during the Eurosatory 2024 exhibition. Minister Kasčiūnas confirmed that the platform selected for equipping Lithuanian forces would undoubtedly be the Leopard. At the same time, Lithuania seeks to enhance its military arsenal with the acquisition of other vehicles and systems, including Boxer armored personnel carriers (known as Vilkas in Lithuania) and air defense systems. However, the current priority remains the establishment of this tank battalion, in close cooperation with Germany. Negotiations on the contract for these tanks are progressing rapidly. Kasčiūnas indicated that the Lithuanian National Defense Council would meet by the end of October to finalize decisions related to this acquisition project. The minister also hinted that negotiations with the KNDS consortium, responsible for producing the Leopard, were already well advanced. If the Council gives the green light, the contract could be signed as early as November 2024. Protection features of the Leopard 2A8 include multi-layered armor combining steel, tungsten, composite filler, and ceramic components, along with the EuroTrophy Active Protection System (APS) for 360-degree coverage against projectiles. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Cooperation with Germany involves two major aspects. Firstly, the Lithuanian tank battalion will be structured similarly to that of the German army, with 44 tanks divided into three companies. With a small reserve added, Lithuania's order would amount to around 50 tanks, a number previously discussed during preliminary talks. Secondly, Lithuania will acquire the same modernized version of the Leopard 2 A8, identical to the one that will equip the German tank battalion. On the German side, the tank battalion of the combat forces brigade, which is expected to reach full operational capacity by 2027, will also be equipped with Leopard 2 A8 tanks, with deliveries starting in 2025. This battalion will be outfitted with 44 Leopard 2 A8 tanks, ensuring a formidable strike force. Thus, by 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces. This strategic deployment is particularly critical in a sensitive area: the Suwalki Corridor, a narrow strip of land linking the Baltic states to the rest of Europe and separating Belarus from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. This region represents a crucial point in NATO's defense against potential threats from Russia. By strengthening its military capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment such as the Leopard 2 A8, Lithuania aims to increase its defense autonomy while reinforcing its integration into NATO's military framework. This project reflects the country's commitment to adapting to new security realities and being ready to respond effectively to any potential escalation of regional tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/imminent-stationing-of-nearly-100-leopard-2-a8-tanks-in-lithuania-a-new-force-against-russian-threat	2024-10-02T02:06:36-07:00

The FS Guépratte, a vessel with a legacy rooted in French naval tradition, exemplifies a design optimized for specific operational scenarios. Typically, ships like the Guépratte are engineered with a focus on anti-submarine warfare and surface combat, reflecting the strategic priorities during the periods they were commissioned. Their technical specifications often include a balanced mix of armaments, such as torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, alongside sophisticated sonar systems tailored for detecting and neutralizing underwater threats. The propulsion systems in such frigates are designed to offer a combination of speed and endurance, enabling sustained operations in varied maritime environments. In contrast, the FREMM class represents a more contemporary approach to frigate design, embodying advancements in technology and multi-mission flexibility. These vessels are characterized by their modular design, which allows for rapid reconfiguration to suit different mission profiles, whether it be anti-aircraft, anti-surface, or humanitarian operations. The FREMM frigates are equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and weaponry, including vertical launch systems capable of deploying a range of missiles for air defense and land attack roles. Their propulsion systems are often more efficient, providing enhanced speed and range, which is crucial for global deployments and extended missions far from home bases. Adding another layer to France's maritime strategy, the deployment of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship underscores the multifaceted nature of the French Navy's current operations. The Mistral class, renowned for its ability to project power and provide humanitarian assistance, has been tasked with supporting the approximately 20,000 French nationals in Lebanon. This deployment highlights the French Navy's commitment not only to strategic military objectives but also to the protection and evacuation of its citizens in regions experiencing instability. The Mistral's capabilities in transporting troops, vehicles, and equipment, combined with its extensive medical facilities and helicopter operations, make it an indispensable asset in crisis scenarios	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navy-deploys-frigate-from-toulon-amid-middle-east-conflict-escalation	2024-10-02T01:36:38-07:00	
Israel Under Iranian Fire: How Air Defense Withstood Wave of Ballistic Missiles	On October 1, 2024, Israel was the target of a massive attack by Iran, which launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles in retaliation for the elimination of senior leaders from Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. This assault, considered one of the largest ballistic missile strikes against a nation-state, tested Israel's air defense system. Despite intercepting many missiles, videos circulating on social media show some reaching the ground, raising questions about the effectiveness and limitations of Israel's air defense capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Various screenshots from videos showing the multiple strikes carried out by Iran on Israel (Picture source: X Channel @ELINTNews) Functioning of Israel's Air Defense System Israel's air defense is a multilayered system that intercepts various aerial threats at different altitudes and ranges. This system primarily consists of three elements: Iron Dome: Deployed since 2011, this system is designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells (ranging between 4 and 70 kilometers). The Iron Dome uses radar to identify threats and assess if they are likely to hit populated areas. If a threat is confirmed, a Tamir interceptor is launched to neutralize it. The cost per interception is estimated between $40,000 and $50,000. IRON DOME, the most deployed air defense system, has intercepted 5000+ rockets with an over 90% success rate since 2011. (Picture source: Rafael) David’s Sling: This more advanced system covers medium to long ranges, intercepting short-range ballistic missiles and large-caliber rockets. Its Stunner interceptor can neutralize targets up to 300 kilometers away. Unlike the Iron Dome, the Stunner does not carry an explosive warhead but destroys its target through direct impact, increasing interception accuracy. However, the cost per interception is significantly higher, around $1 million per missile. Arrow 2 and Arrow 3: These systems are designed to intercept medium- to long-range ballistic missiles, including those reaching the exo-atmosphere. Arrow 3, in particular, can intercept missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere, neutralizing potential threats equipped with weapons of mass destruction. The cost of intercepting a missile with the Arrow 2 or Arrow 3 can reach up to $3.5 million per missile. Each layer of the system is designed to address specific types of threats, providing in-depth defense. Sophisticated radars and command and control centers coordinate efforts to ensure maximum coverage. David's Sling, developed by Israel in 2006 and operational since 2017, forms the middle layer of defense against cruise and lower-tier ballistic missiles, while the Arrow-3 interceptor, deployed the same year, protects against long-range ballistic missile threats (Picture source: MDA/IDF) Analysis of Effectiveness during the Iranian Attack During the attack on October 1, Israel successfully intercepted a significant portion of the Iranian missiles using its multilayered defense system. However, videos circulating show missiles hitting the ground, raising several questions: System Saturation: Iran launched nearly 200 missiles in a single wave over a few hours, potentially attempting to overwhelm Israel's defenses. Even with an advanced system, there is a limit to how many threats can be addressed simultaneously. Evolving Threats: Iran may have used hypersonic Fattah missiles, capable of maneuvering and traveling at speeds up to Mach 13-15, which present a significant challenge for current interception systems. These missiles are designed to be difficult to detect and intercept. While Arrow 3 is intended to counter such threats, hypersonic technology complicates early detection and interception efforts. Engagement Strategy: Israel’s defense systems prioritize threats based on their trajectory. If a missile is predicted to land in an unpopulated area, it may be left unintercepted to preserve costly interceptors for more critical threats. Operators may choose not to intercept certain missiles to conserve resources, especially if they do not directly threaten lives or critical infrastructure. However, reports of missiles hitting a military base in Nevatim may suggest otherwise. Video of the missile impacts in Israel pic.twitter.com/OZPLMe5zEn Cost and Logistics: Intercepting each missile carries a significant financial cost. In the context of a massive attack, decision-makers must balance the use of available resources with the need to protect the most sensitive areas. The presence of Iranian missiles that reached Israeli soil does not necessarily indicate a failure of the defense system. It may reflect the physical limitations of the system, which can only handle a certain number of missiles at a time due to reaction times and available interceptors. The Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, highlighted the challenges faced by Israel’s air defense system. While largely effective in intercepting the majority of the missiles, the system is not foolproof. The saturation effect from a large number of missiles, the introduction of new adversary technologies, and logistical and financial constraints are all factors that can allow certain threats to pass through the defense network. This situation underscores the importance for Israel to continue investing in research and development to improve its defense capabilities while adapting its strategies to evolving threats. Ongoing cooperation with international partners, such as the United States, also remains crucial to maintaining a technological and operational advantage, as well as participating in joint defense efforts during such events.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-under-iranian-fire-how-air-defense-withstood-wave-of-ballistic-missiles	2024-10-02T01:36:10-07:00	
Philippines Strengthens Its Defense with Indian BrahMos Supersonic Missiles and Twin-Missile Launchers	On September 25, 2024, BrahMos Aerospace unveiled for the first time at the ADAS event a model of the mobile BrahMos launcher that will be operated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

This configuration contrasts with the three-missile launchers used by the Indian Armed Forces. The displayed model also featured jungle camouflage, adopted by the AFP for its tropical operations. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BrahMos Supersonic Missile and its Twin-Missile Launcher (Picture source: Philippines MoD) According to the Twitter account Noise Alerts, the first batch of BrahMos supersonic missiles was delivered to the Philippines on April 19, 2024. Transported by an Indian Air Force IL-76TD aircraft, these missiles were delivered to the Philippine Marine Corps in Manila, accompanied by ground launch systems. This delivery, part of a $375 million agreement signed in 2022, marks the first time India has exported the BrahMos missile system. The Philippine Marine Corps confirmed that each BrahMos missile battery would consist of only two missile launchers. The BrahMos cruise missile, named after the Brahmaputra River in India and the Moscow River in Russia, is the result of a joint development between India and Russia. Based on the Russian SS-N-26 (3M55 Oniks/Yakhont/Bastion) missile, this supersonic missile is designed to engage land and sea targets with remarkable precision. BrahMos Aerospace, the company responsible for its development, was established in 1998 as a joint venture between India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyeniya. The BrahMos missiles will be operated by the Coastal Defense Regiment of the Philippine Marines. A BrahMos Aerospace representative stated to AMR that all deliveries are expected to be completed by next year. He also highlighted that India is considering replacing the imported Tatra vehicles with Indian-origin models for future deliveries. The BrahMos missile is equipped with a conventional warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kg, capable of delivering impact energy nine times greater than that of subsonic cruise missiles. The BrahMos missiles can be fitted with either a high-explosive semi-armor-piercing warhead or a submunition payload weighing between 200 and 300 kg. They can be launched from vertical or ramp launch systems, or in the case of the submarine version, from submerged vessels. In 2013, the missile was successfully tested from a submerged barge, demonstrating its capability to be deployed on missile-armed submarines. The Philippines announced the agreement with BrahMos Aerospace in January 2022 for the acquisition of three missile batteries. This contract, valued at $375 million, also includes operator and maintenance training as well as an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package. The requirement for this advanced weapon system was formally conceptualized in 2017 and approved by the Office of the Philippine President for inclusion in the Horizon 2 Priority Projects in 2020. In India, BrahMos Aerospace was also selected to supply next-generation long-range mobile coastal maritime batteries to the Indian Navy under an agreement signed in March 2023, valued at $200 million. The BrahMos missile, also designated as PJ-10, is a joint military project between India and Russia, combining the expertise of DRDO and NPO Mashinostroyeniya. In service since 2001, it can be launched from various platforms, including submarines, ships, fighter jets, and land-based mobile launchers. It can reach supersonic speeds between Mach 2 and Mach 3. Since India's induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 2016, versions of the BrahMos missile have achieved increased ranges of up to 900 km, compared to 290 km for the export version. With its stealth capabilities, advanced guidance system, and fire-and-forget mode, the BrahMos represents a major asset in modern arsenals. This phase of BrahMos deliveries to the Philippines not only strengthens military cooperation between India and Southeast Asian countries but also boosts the Philippines' coastal defense capabilities in the face of growing regional threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/philippines-strengthens-its-defense-with-indian-brahmos-supersonic-missiles-and-twin-missile-launchers	2024-10-02T00:58:37-07:00	
What Missiles Were Used in Iran's Strike on Israel?	On October 1, 2024, a large-scale attack orchestrated by Iran hit Israeli soil, marking a significant turning point in the ongoing conflict between the two nations. As part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' Iranian forces deployed a vast arsenal, including 120 ballistic missiles (including Emads), 170 drones, and 30 hypersonic missiles, among them the Fatah-2.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images of Emad MRBMs launched at Israel during Operation True Promise 2. (Picture source: Iranian Media) The 120 ballistic missiles used in this attack notably included the Emad, a medium-range missile capable of striking targets nearly 1,700 kilometers away with improved accuracy. Thanks to its terminal guidance system, these missiles can adjust their trajectory in the final phase of flight, thus increasing their effectiveness. This coordinated attack also saw the use of 170 drones, another crucial component of Iran’s military strategy. Drones have become indispensable weapons in modern warfare, and Iran’s attack on Israel featured a significant number of them. However, the most concerning aspect of this offensive lies in the deployment of 30 hypersonic missiles, a first in this conflict. Among them, the Fatah-2 was used for the first time in a conflict. This hypersonic missile, capable of flying at a speed of Mach 13, stands out due to its ability to evade conventional defense systems thanks to its high-speed maneuverability. With an estimated range of 1,400 kilometers, the Fatah-2 can not only reach its targets in record time but it is also designed to change course during flight, making interception extremely difficult. Its payload, tailored for precision strikes, makes it a formidable weapon for attacks on critical infrastructure. This coordinated offensive severely tested Israeli defense systems, notably the Iron Dome and Arrow anti-missile batteries. While these systems successfully intercepted part of the ballistic missiles and drones, the threat posed by hypersonic missiles like the Fatah-2 remains a significant concern. Current anti-missile defense systems struggle to keep up with these ultra-fast weapons, giving Iran a clear strategic advantage in its pursuit of deterrence against Israel. So far, no precise figures have demonstrated how effectively the Fatah-2 was intercepted, but Iranian officials have claimed that 90% of the means employed in the attack reached their targets. The October 1 attack thus marks an escalation in hostilities between Iran and Israel, not only due to the impressive quantity of weaponry deployed but also because of the advanced quality of these attack systems. Iran has demonstrated its ability to carry out a complex offensive, integrating drones, precision ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles, thereby pushing the limits of Israeli defenses. The drones disrupted detection systems and weakened rapid response capabilities, while Emad ballistic missiles and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles targeted infrastructure. The Emad-1, in particular, is a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) developed by Iran and used since 2015 by the Aerospace Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGCASF). It represents an important milestone in Iran’s ballistic capabilities, being one of the first weapons of its kind to incorporate an advanced guidance system, thus improving its accuracy compared to previous models. The Emad-1 missile is powered by liquid fuel, a technology that, while older than solid propellants, allows for greater flexibility in adjusting parameters before launch. With a diameter of 1.25 meters, the Emad is designed to carry a single warhead, enabling it to strike targets up to 1,700 kilometers away. This range allows it to hit targets across much of the Middle East, including Israel, with notable precision. Indeed, the missile boasts a circular error probable (CEP) of 50 meters, meaning its margin of error at impact is relatively small, a significant improvement over older ballistic systems. This makes the Emad a formidable weapon for targeted strikes on strategic infrastructure. The October 1, 2024, attack symbolizes a rise in tensions between Iran and Israel, with the use of a sophisticated and varied arsenal, including ballistic missiles, drones, and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles. This offensive, carried out as part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' highlights the evolution of Iranian military capabilities and raises new questions about Israel’s defense systems' ability to cope with these threats. While the international community calls for calm, this escalation serves as a reminder of the fragility of the situation in the Middle East and the inherent risks of increasingly technological warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/what-missiles-were-used-in-irans-strike-on-israel	2024-10-02T00:35:27-07:00

Both vessels, being Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, which serves as the cornerstone for their multi-mission versatility, particularly in ballistic missile defense (BMD). The Aegis system integrates powerful radar suites, such as the AN/SPY-1D multi-function radar, which provides the necessary detection, tracking, and discrimination of incoming ballistic threats. These destroyers leverage the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability, enabling them to engage and intercept ballistic missiles during various phases of their trajectory. The USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, outfitted with the Aegis BMD configuration, possess the requisite command and control infrastructure to process complex threat environments and coordinate defensive measures in real-time. The SM-3 is a key component of the Aegis BMD system, designed to engage short to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their midcourse phase outside the Earth’s atmosphere. The missile employs a hit-to-kill kinetic warhead, relying on precise guidance and propulsion systems to achieve successful interception. Its flight trajectory allows it to engage targets at ranges extending beyond several hundred kilometers, providing a robust defensive envelope against diverse missile threats. The propulsion and guidance systems of the SM-3 are engineered for high maneuverability and accuracy, essential for countering agile ballistic missiles. The missile’s two-stage design comprises a solid rocket booster for initial propulsion and a second stage equipped with a thrust vector control system, enhancing its ability to adjust flight paths dynamically during interception. Additionally, the SM-3’s active radar seeker provides terminal guidance, allowing for precise targeting and minimizing the risk of collateral damage. The interoperability between the U.S. Navy destroyers and Israeli defense systems likely involved the sharing of real-time data and coordinated engagement strategies. Such collaboration enhances the overall defensive posture, enabling both forces to leverage their respective technological strengths and operational expertise.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-us-navy-aids-israel-in-missile-defense-amid-major-iranian-attack-pentagon-confirms	2024-10-02T00:25:14-07:00

Notably, Lebanon is developing a more robust naval base in Beirut, part of a broader effort to strengthen its maritime security in light of future oil and gas exploration off its coast. French naval forces have also conducted joint exercises with the Lebanese Navy, further enhancing its ability to secure territorial waters and respond to asymmetric threats such as terrorism, piracy, and smuggling​. In addition to military aid, France has played a significant diplomatic role in Lebanon. Amid the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah tensions, France has proposed several initiatives to de-escalate the situation along the Lebanon-Israel border. In 2024, Paris put forward a plan a ceasefire and the deployment of Lebanese troops to stabilize the southern border. This proposal, although fraught with political obstacles, reflects France’s broader strategy of supporting Lebanese sovereignty and preventing further escalation that could destabilize the entire region​. Moreover, France has remained committed to aiding Lebanon in recovering from the devastating 2020 Beirut port explosion. French engineering firms are involved in efforts to rebuild the port's infrastructure, with the goal of reviving Beirut’s role as a key economic hub. This reconstruction effort is part of a larger French initiative to help Lebanon overcome its prolonged political and economic crises, ensuring the country’s resilience and ability to maintain its territorial integrity.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/france-deploys-military-vessel-near-lebanon-amid-rising-tensions-prepared-for-possible-evacuations	2024-10-01T05:51:39-07:00

The new entity, KNDS Ukraine LLC, aims to establish maintenance, repair, and production capabilities for equipment such as Leopard tanks and Caesar self-propelled howitzers currently deployed in Ukraine. This move includes plans to produce 155mm artillery shells and spare parts using technologies like 3D printing within the next year, with potential expansion to manufacturing entire systems in Ukraine in the future.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ukraine currently operates 386 pieces of KNDS equipment such as the Leopard 1 and 2 main battle tanks, the Caesar and PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers, the AMX10 RC tank destroyer, and the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, with orders for an additional 250 units. (Picture source: Ukrainian 47th Mechanized Brigade) As of June 7, 2024, according to KNDS Chairman Philippe Petitcolin, Ukraine operates 386 pieces of KNDS equipment such as the Leopard 1 and 2 main battle tanks, the Caesar and PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers, the AMX10 RC tank destroyer, and the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, with orders for an additional 250 units. To support this fleet, KNDS is partnering with Ukrainian firms, signing letters of intent with ENMEK for a Caesar cannon maintenance center and KZVV for 155mm shell production. Ukrainian personnel will handle Caesar's maintenance using parts shipped from France, eliminating the need for French technicians. This initiative aligns with broader international efforts to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities, as over 40 nations have participated in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to accelerate defense resource delivery. These countries have mapped global production capacities to expand ammunition and equipment supplies. France and Sweden plan to double their ammunition and explosives production capacity by 2025 and increase powder production by 2026. Meanwhile, Germany, Spain, Hungary, South Africa, and Australia plan to produce 700,000 artillery shells and 10,000 tons of gunpowder annually by 2025. KNDS's involvement is part of wider international defense investments in Ukraine. Germany's Rheinmetall signed a letter of intent to establish a KF41 Lynx armored vehicle production facility in Ukraine, and Norway's Nammo announced plans to license the production of 155mm rounds. These collaborations aim to localize defense production and ensure Ukraine’s capability to maintain and produce essential military equipment. The German company Rheinmetall plans to provide several hundred Lynx vehicles to Ukraine, which will include training, maintenance, and repair services. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Complementing these investments, France plans to train a brigade of 2,100 Ukrainian soldiers, supporting Ukraine's goal of preparing 15 to 20 brigades. Earlier in 2023, Sweden donated 50 CV90 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine and later, Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark signed a letter of intent to finance and deliver more CV90s. Denmark committed $264 million to this effort, while Sweden will manage the acquisition and delivery of vehicles produced by BAE Systems Hägglunds. These agreements also include future cooperation for CV90 production and servicing in Ukraine, potentially leading to joint manufacturing. In September 2023, the French company Arquus partnered with Ukraine to establish a repair workshop focusing on maintaining French-made Véhicules de l'Avant Blindés (VAB) armored vehicles, part of France's military aid, which also includes Caesar 6x6 self-propelled howitzers and SCALP missiles. Several defense companies have launched subsidiaries or initiated licensed production in Ukraine to support its defense industry. Rheinmetall opened a joint production facility with Ukrainian state-owned defense enterprise Ukroboronprom, including a workshop for armored vehicle repair and manufacturing. Rheinmetall plans to produce various equipment, including air defense systems, armored vehicles, and ammunition, aiming to supply the Ukrainian army and estimating potential annual revenue of $2-3 billion from its Ukrainian operations.

US Army Orders Retired M60 Machine Guns: Mystery Surrounds Recipient	This week, the U.S. Army Contracting Command in Newark, New Jersey, awarded a $14.96 million contract to U.S. Ordnance, a company based in Sparks, Nevada, for an unspecified number of M60E4 and M60E6 machine guns. The contract also includes spare parts, accessories, conversion kits, and training services, raising many questions within the defense community. The U.S. Army largely phased out the M60 machine gun decades ago, prompting speculation about the recipient and the operational needs for these weapons.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A United States Navy SEAL pictured holding a M60E4 machine gun. (Picture source: US DoD) The M60 machine gun, chambered in 7.62x51 mm, was developed in the late 1940s and entered service in the 1950s. Inspired by the German MG-42 and FG-42 automatic rifles from World War II, the M60 was widely used during the Cold War and became iconic during the Vietnam War. Over the years, several variants were introduced, adapted for infantry, vehicles, aircraft, and naval platforms. However, the M60 was gradually replaced by the M240B in U.S. Army service. The M60E4 and M60E6, also known as the MK43, are modernized versions of the original machine gun. These newer variants are lighter, shorter, and feature improvements such as accessory rails and an upgraded gas system for better reliability. Despite these enhancements, they have not been widely adopted by the U.S. Army and are primarily used by foreign forces, such as the Danish Army, which became the first user of the M60E6 in 2014. Some U.S. special forces and training units still utilize these models. Danish Army soldier armed with M60E6 general-purpose machine gun (Picture source: Danish MoD) The contract awarded to U.S. Ordnance does not specify the exact number of machine guns or conversion kits to be delivered, and the Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about the details. This secrecy has led to speculation that these weapons could be intended for a foreign ally, such as Ukraine, as part of military aid. The U.S. has already mentioned the possibility of using the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program to transfer surplus military equipment to partner countries, especially given the depletion of funds for new aid packages. It is also possible that the M60s are destined for other U.S. government entities or foreign allies. The origins of this contract remain unclear, but it reflects a renewed interest in a weapon that had largely been retired from active service in the United States. As the defense community speculates about the final destination of these machine guns, more details may emerge in the coming months, shedding light on the motivations behind this unexpected acquisition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-orders-retired-m60-machine-guns-mystery-surrounds-recipient	2024-10-01T04:49:52-07:00	
Greek military to acquire four Mark VI patrol boats for special operations in Aegean	According to information published by OnAlert on September 30, 2024, the Hellenic National Defence General Staff (GEETHA) is in advanced discussions with the U.S. to acquire four Mark VI patrol boats to strengthen Greece’s Special Amphibious Forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Patrol Boat Mk VI 1206, operating under Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron 3, moves into position to conduct boarding operations on the amphibious dock landing ship USS Comstock. (Picture source: US DoD) According to reports, the deal is progressing through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, which offers military support to U.S. allies. Notably, the U.S. government plans to cover most, if not all, of the costs, as part of its military cooperation with Greece, which has supported Ukraine by providing ammunition during the ongoing conflict. The four Mark VI boats will offer advanced capabilities for unconventional warfare, ideal for the Aegean's island-dense environment. Greece already operates four Mark V boats, delivered by the U.S. in 2020, which have proven highly effective as force multipliers in amphibious operations. The Mark VI, measuring 25.8 meters in length, can carry a crew of 10 plus eight additional personnel. For special operations, the crew size can be reduced to accommodate fully equipped commandos. With modern systems, including infrared and thermal cameras, the Mark VI boats can serve as mini-command centers, ideal for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. These patrol boats come armed with two remotely operated Mk 38 Mod 2 25mm guns and can carry up to six M2 .50 caliber machine guns, along with M240 and M134 machine guns, and Mk 19 grenade launchers. Their aluminum hull allows them to reach speeds of 45 knots (over 80 km/h) with a range of up to 750 nautical miles (1,400 km) at cruising speeds of 25 knots. The vessels also have the capacity to carry small rubber boats and drones, such as the Switchblade 600, which Greece plans to acquire soon. Aegean Sea The Aegean Sea is dotted with over 2,000 islands and islets, many of which are located near Turkey’s coastline. This creates a challenging operational landscape for the Hellenic Armed Forces, particularly for patrolling, defense, and logistical support. The islands vary in size and infrastructure, complicating efforts to defend them and respond to emergencies or threats. The scattered nature of these islands also presents difficulties in maintaining a rapid and coordinated military presence, especially in remote areas. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes in the Aegean over territorial waters, airspace, and the continental shelf. Turkey's frequent military provocations, including airspace violations and naval exercises near Greek islands, continuously challenge Greece’s sovereignty. The need to defend Greek airspace and territorial waters from encroachments requires constant vigilance, with the Hellenic Air Force and Navy often engaging in intercept missions. The Aegean is a vital maritime corridor, not only for Greece but for Europe. The region faces threats from illegal activities such as smuggling, human trafficking, and illicit fishing operations. The Aegean has also been a key route for migrants and refugees, putting additional pressure on the Hellenic Coast Guard and Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/greek-military-to-acquire-four-mark-vi-patrol-boats-for-special-operations-in-aegean	2024-10-01T04:44:30-07:00	
South Korea's new Hyunmoo-V monster missile promises nuclear-like destruction with nine-ton warhead	On October 1, 2024, South Korea unveiled its latest strategic missile, the Hyunmoo-V, during the Armed Forces Day parade commemorating the 76th anniversary of the military's founding. The event featured approximately 5,000 troops and nearly 100 pieces of heavy military equipment, marching through downtown Seoul. Streets were closed to accommodate tens of thousands of spectators, and a U.S. B-1B Lancer bomber made a rare flight over the capital, highlighting the close military ties between South Korea and the United States.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hyunmoo-V missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) Described by Seoul as a retaliatory weapon aimed at countering threats from North Korea, the Hyunmoo-V (nicknamed the 'monster missile' due to its capabilities) is capable of carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons. This substantial warhead is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. With a total weight of 36 tons and a thrust of 75 tons, the Hyunmoo-V follows a 'lofted trajectory,' flying through the exosphere to enhance its penetration capability before descending upon its target at speeds ten times faster than the speed of sound. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, noted that the missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. The missile employs a unique cold-launch system, using compressed gas to propel it before ignition. This technique minimizes damage to the launcher and increases operational stability due to the missile's powerful solid propellant. Referred to as 'High Power Missiles' (HPM) by Seoul, both the Hyunmoo-IV-1 and Hyunmoo-V are designed to penetrate deeply buried command centers by detonating above underground facilities, effectively burying them. The exact maximum range of the Hyunmoo-V remains undisclosed, but experts speculate it could potentially reach distances of up to 3,000 kilometers or more, placing it in the category of intermediate-range missiles. Comparisons have been drawn to the U.S. Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile in terms of warhead weight and thrust, although the Hyunmoo-V is believed to be a two-stage missile. Carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons, the Hyunmoo-V is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. (Picture source: South Korean MoD) Hanwha Aerospace is the manufacturer of the Hyunmoo missiles, which are all equipped with evasion systems to counteract enemy air defense systems. The South Korean Strategic Command plans to have more than 200 Hyunmoo-V missiles alone. In addition to the V-series, new variants of the Hyunmoo-II, III, and IV missiles are being developed and mass-produced. South Korea refers to these missiles as 'Extreme Precision, High Power Missiles' or 'Ultra-powerful ballistic missiles,' rather than using conventional designations like Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile or intercontinental ballistic missile. There are also plans to mount the Hyunmoo-V missiles on the Joint Support Ship, which is described as the world's first arsenal ship. In early 2024, South Korea announced that it had successfully tested the Hyunmoo-V missile. Information about missile tests is often disclosed through Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), which are notifications issued to ensure airspace safety during missile-related activities. Analyses of NOTAMs suggest that the Hyunmoo-V tests likely took place on December 26 or 27, 2023, near Jeongjuk-Ri village on the west coast. The tests targeted a group of islands approximately 185 kilometers south of the launch point, a distance comparable to that between Seoul and Pyongyang. The public unveiling of these missiles aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. This system comprises three components: the 'Kill Chain,' the Korean Air and Missile Defense system (KAMD), and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan (KMPR). The public unveiling of both the Hyunmoo and L-SAM missile launchers aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) The 'Kill Chain' component focuses on swift detection and engagement of North Korean missile threats, aiming to target nuclear and missile facilities before they can launch. It is said to have the capability to target mobile missile launchers within 30 minutes. The KAMD system is responsible for intercepting incoming missiles, providing a multi-layered defense for critical facilities and population centers. It employs the domestically produced Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) as an upper-tier interceptor capable of intercepting projectiles at altitudes up to 60 kilometers. The Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan serves as a deterrent strategy, assuming that a North Korean attack has already been initiated. In such an event, South Korea would retaliate with a combination of precision missiles, advanced aircraft, and potentially special operations forces. The objectives would include countervalue and counterforce targets, as well as leadership decapitation strikes. These defense systems integrate capabilities across different branches of the South Korean military. The Army's Strategic Missile Command operates the Hyunmoo family of missiles in both the 'Kill Chain' and retaliation roles. The Air Force employs PAC-3 systems, F-35A jets, and Global Hawk surveillance aircraft. The Navy utilizes 3,000-ton submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles and KDX-III Aegis destroyers with SM-2 missiles. Future plans include integrating military surveillance satellites, cyber warfare units, space-focused forces, and special forces units into the defense network.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-koreas-new-hyunmoo-v-monster-missile-promises-nuclear-like-destruction-with-nine-ton-warhead	2024-10-01T04:30:57-07:00

The geostrategic importance of the Indian Ocean, vital for global trade and energy security, remains central to this partnership. Australia's participation in the AUSINDEX exercise, coupled with China's growing power in the region, has prompted Canberra and New Delhi to intensify their military cooperation. In response to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and the expansion of its naval capabilities in the Indian Ocean, the two nations are aligning to ensure maritime security. However, India, adhering to its policy of non-alignment, remains cautious about formal military commitments. The Boeing EA-18G Growler, an electronic warfare aircraft derived from the F/A-18F Super Hornet, is a cornerstone of Australia's air defense. Designed to replace the U.S. Navy’s Grumman EA-6 Prowler, this aircraft is equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems provided by Northrop Grumman, capable of jamming radars and neutralizing enemy air defense systems. In 2008, the RAAF ordered six EA-18G Growlers as part of a broader acquisition of 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets. In 2012, the order evolved, with 12 of these aircraft being converted into EA-18Gs, thus enhancing Australia’s electronic warfare capabilities for a total cost of 1.5 billion Australian dollars. The first aircraft was delivered in June 2014, with a model officially presented in July 2015. The technical specifications of the EA-18G Growler make it a major strategic asset: with a length of 18.3 meters and a wingspan of 13.7 meters, it is powered by two F414-GE-400 engines, providing a total thrust of 44,000 pounds.

Netherlands signs contract with Naval Group for four Barracuda-class submarines in major defense deal	According to a PR published by Naval Group on September 30, 2024, the Netherlands Ministry of Defense has signed a contract with Naval Group for the delivery of four Barracuda-class expeditionary submarines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Dutch Barracuda-class submarine. (Picture source: Naval Group) The agreement, formalized by Dutch State Secretary for Defence Gijs Tuinman and Naval Group CEO Pierre Eric Pommellet, took place at the Directie Materiële Instandhouding (DMI) in Den Helder, marking the official launch of the Orka-class program, which will replace the Royal Netherlands Navy’s aging Walrus-class submarines. The contract follows a rigorous evaluation and bidding process conducted by the Materiel and IT Command (COMMIT), which determined that Naval Group’s Orka-class submarines were the best solution for the Netherlands' future underwater capabilities. The program will enhance the Netherlands' strategic autonomy and deepen cooperation between the Dutch maritime industry and Naval Group, particularly in the development and maintenance of submarine systems over the next two decades. About the program Before Naval Group was selected, the Dutch government extensively evaluated the proposals from TKMS and Saab Kockums. TKMS, a German company, offered a design based on its Type 212/214 submarines, which are widely regarded for their advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. These submarines are noted for their ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing, making them ideal for covert operations in shallow waters such as the Baltic Sea. Saab Kockums, on the other hand, presented a modified version of its A26 submarine, which is designed with modularity in mind and includes an AIP system. The A26’s strength lies in its versatility, allowing it to be configured for a wide range of missions, including intelligence gathering, anti-submarine warfare, and special forces operations. Saab Kockums also promised to heavily involve Dutch industry in its proposal, which was a crucial requirement for the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Both TKMS and Saab Kockums had strong offerings, and their submarines are well-regarded in the global market. However, Naval Group's proposal was ultimately deemed to offer superior capabilities for the Netherlands’ specific needs. One of the decisive factors was the ability of Naval Group to deliver a blue-water, ocean-going submarine capable of extended missions far from Dutch waters, while also ensuring long-term cooperation with Dutch industry. From a strategic standpoint, the Dutch government viewed the Naval Group’s Barracuda-class submarines as the best fit for NATO’s broader requirements. The Barracuda design is well-suited to both high-end warfare and intelligence operations in distant waters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/netherlands-signs-contract-with-naval-group-for-four-barracuda-class-submarines-in-major-defense-deal	2024-10-01T00:04:14-07:00	
Taiwan warns of escalating Chinese military drills in Taiwan Strait	According to information published by Liberty Times Net September 30, 2024, the Chinese military has been conducting increasingly frequent exercises around Taiwan, with military aircraft and naval vessels regularly intruding near the island.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Tuo Chiang-class corvette Tuo Chiang. (Picture source: Taiwanese Ministry of Defense) In a recent report from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, officials warn that China aims to 'internalize' the Taiwan Strait by combining military actions with law enforcement operations, such as deploying Chinese coast guard vessels to patrol Taiwan's eastern waters. The report outlines four key tactics China has employed to pressure Taiwan. These include joint readiness patrols, gray zone tactics, large-scale targeted military drills, and coordinated training operations. Among these tactics, joint readiness patrols have been a recurring feature, with Chinese forces conducting combined air and naval operations three to four times a month. These actions, according to the Ministry of Defense, are intended to intensify the military threat against Taiwan. Following an incident in the waters near Kinmen and Xiamen earlier this year, Chinese coast guard patrols have also increased in the areas surrounding Taiwan's outlying islands, such as Kinmen and Matsu. Notably, during large-scale military drills held on May 23-24, China organized coast guard patrols in Taiwan’s eastern waters under the guise of law enforcement, furthering its goal of asserting control over the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese defense officials also foresee the integration of China's new 'Coast Guard Law,' which authorizes the use of force by Chinese coast guard units during maritime operations. They predict that China will increasingly resort to a combination of legal, cognitive, and gray zone warfare tactics to harass Taiwan. The report also highlights recent activities involving China's aircraft carrier Shandong, which completed its 36th training mission from June 22 to July 23, traversing the South China Sea and Western Pacific. The Shandong was accompanied by various warplanes, including the H-6K bomber, conducting joint training across the island chains stretching to Taiwan’s southwest and the Western Pacific. These activities are part of China’s effort to demonstrate its capabilities in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies through planned joint training. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has concluded that China is testing its ability to both invade Taiwan and counter potential foreign intervention by combining conventional and unconventional tactics. In response, Taiwan's military remains on high alert, employing intelligence and surveillance systems to monitor Chinese military movements.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-warns-of-escalating-chinese-military-drills-in-taiwan-strait	2024-09-30T07:22:01-07:00	
South Korean Intelligence Warns North Korea Capable of Building Double-Digit Nuclear Arsenal	According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), North Korea has accumulated enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to build a 'double-digit' number of nuclear bombs, as reported by Reuters. This information, revealed during a closed-door parliamentary briefing, has heightened concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities. The briefing followed recent public statements by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un regarding the expansion of his nuclear arsenal, as well as the rare disclosure earlier this month of a secret uranium enrichment facility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States (Picture source: KCNA) The intelligence report estimates that North Korea possesses around 70 kilograms of plutonium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons, along with a significant, though unspecified, amount of weapons-grade uranium. Combined, these materials would be sufficient to produce at least ten nuclear bombs. These developments align with North Korea’s broader goal of 'exponentially' increasing its stockpile of nuclear weapons, as recently stated by Kim Jong-un. North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic programs continue to advance, with significant improvements in terms of accuracy and power. The South Korean intelligence agency also highlighted North Korea’s progress in missile technology, particularly in developing more precise and powerful systems capable of targeting South Korea. The NIS has not ruled out the possibility of a seventh nuclear test, speculating that such an event could take place after the U.S. presidential election in November. Kim Jong-un’s visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute in September underscored North Korea’s ambitions to further expand its nuclear arsenal. This visit, which included an inspection of facilities producing military-grade nuclear materials, reinforced the regime’s commitment to strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities. These actions come despite long-standing international sanctions and diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. South Korea and its allies are closely monitoring these developments, concerned about the growing threat posed by North Korea’s expanding nuclear capabilities. This concern is heightened by Pyongyang’s continued missile testing and development, including those designed to carry nuclear warheads. In response to the increasing obsolescence of its conventional military capabilities, North Korea has focused for decades on developing asymmetric capabilities and weapons of mass destruction, including long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The country has a range of short- and medium-range missiles, such as the Scud and No-Dong missiles, along with more modern systems like the KN-23 and KN-25. Significant advancements include the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-14, with a range of 10,400 km, and the Hwasong-15, still in development, with an estimated range between 8,500 and 13,000 km. North Korea has also made progress in miniaturizing its nuclear weapons, allowing them to be integrated into its ballistic missiles. The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States. Continued development of ballistic missile and nuclear technologies remains central to Pyongyang’s strategy to deter external intervention and ensure the regime’s survival. The latest intelligence assessments suggest that North Korea now has the capacity to produce a significant number of nuclear weapons, with further advancements expected in the near future. As the regime continues to progress in both nuclear and missile domains, regional security dynamics are likely to face increasing pressure. The possibility of further nuclear tests and the expansion of North Korea’s arsenal remain key concerns for South Korea and the international community.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korean-intelligence-warns-north-korea-capable-of-building-double-digit-nuclear-arsenal	2024-09-30T06:56:03-07:00	
Taiwan adopts non-lethal ammunition to strengthen maritime law enforcement against gray zone tactics	According to information published by Liberty Times Net on September 28, 2024, Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) is adopting new measures to improve maritime law enforcement, in response to increasing gray zone tactics employed by Chinese forces, which include frequent incursions into Taiwan's air and maritime zones as well as the deployment of Chinese Coast Guard vessels.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Anping-class offshore patrol vessel. (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) Senior government officials have confirmed that the Executive Yuan has approved a three-year pilot program to procure non-lethal ammunition and equipment, aiming to boost enforcement capabilities. Starting in fiscal year 2025, the program will trial the use of non-lethal munitions, such as high-decibel shock rounds, which will be compatible with the Zhenhai rocket system aboard the CGA’s 600-ton vessels. These vessels are currently equipped with domestically produced 2.75-inch rockets capable of launching high-explosive, armor-piercing, and cluster munitions—powerful weapons deemed unsuitable for standard law enforcement operations in Taiwan's waters. The new non-lethal options, designed to deter rather than destroy, are intended to be safer alternatives during such operations. According to military sources, these shock rounds will emit a loud noise upon detonation, creating a psychological deterrent. Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology will work with the CGA to produce and supply these rounds according to the approved annual plan. The project has an allocated budget of NT$86.24 million (approximately USD 2.7 million) and is scheduled to be implemented over the next three years. Besides shock rounds, the procurement plan also includes 40mm flashbangs, single-shot 40mm grenade launchers, and other non-lethal firearms. Depending on the results of the trial, the program may be expanded in future years. The Zhenhai rocket system, developed by Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute, is a remotely controlled weapon platform with six launchers capable of firing various 2.75-inch rockets with an effective range of up to 5 kilometers and a maximum range of 10 kilometers. Currently, the system is configured to launch high-explosive, armor-piercing, cluster munitions, and flares for search and rescue operations. About the Anping class The Anping-class offshore patrol vessels have a displacement of 750 tons and measure 65.4 meters in overall length, with a waterline length of 60.7 meters. The vessels have a beam of 14.8 meters and a draft of 2.1 meters. Powered by two MTU 20V4000M93L engines driving four Hamilton HT900 waterjet propulsion systems, the ships produce a total output of 8,600 kW.

New stage in US military support for Taiwan $567 million to counter Beijing	U.S. President Joe Biden has approved $567 million in new support to strengthen Taiwan's defense, the White House announced. This decision aligns with Washington's commitment to support the self-governed island in response to growing tensions with China. Although the United States does not officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, it remains its most important international ally and arms supplier, a point of frequent contention with Beijing. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly demanded that Washington stop selling arms to Taipei, accusing the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Taiwanese Army's Third, Fourth, and Fifth Operational Zones conducted heavy artillery firing exercises in August 2024 (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) In a brief statement, the White House indicated that Biden had delegated authority to the Secretary of State 'to direct the provision of defense articles and services from the Department of Defense, as well as military education and training, for assistance of up to $567 million for Taiwan.' No further details were provided about the specific nature of this latest aid package. This initiative follows a previous military assistance package approved in April 2024, during a period when China intensified its political and military pressures on the island. That multi-billion-dollar aid aimed to bolster Taiwan’s defense capabilities amid increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing. Although U.S. support for Taiwan is informal diplomatically, it represents a major source of friction in U.S.-China relations. Taiwan has repeatedly expressed concerns over delays in the delivery of certain military equipment from the United States, including modernized F-16 fighter jets. Nevertheless, Washington continues to provide significant military aid to the island to enhance its ability to face a potential Chinese invasion. The approval of this new $567 million assistance reaffirms the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Taiwan's defense amid growing challenges posed by China. Before the approval of the $567 million aid package in September 2024, the United States had already sent several significant military deliveries to Taiwan. One of the most notable was a $345 million package approved in 2023, which included air defense systems such as Patriot PAC-3 missiles aimed at strengthening the island’s missile defense capabilities. In addition to these systems, Washington also provided munitions, including AGM-88 HARM missiles designed to target enemy radar, as well as long-range artillery munitions. The U.S. also delivered M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, which offer enhanced mobility on the battlefield, allowing Taiwan to improve its response to ground attacks. These deliveries are part of the ongoing efforts to bolster Taiwan's defense capabilities amid increasing military threats from China.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/new-stage-in-us-military-support-for-taiwan-567-million-to-counter-beijing	2024-09-30T05:23:57-07:00

As a reminder on August 24, 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a new hybrid missile-drone named Palianytsia against a Russian military base in Voronezh Oblast. This marked the first confirmed use of this new weapon system, which successfully targeted the base, causing a major fire and multiple secondary explosions. The attack is part of a broader strategy aimed at neutralizing Russian military assets deep within Russian territory, as Ukraine continues to develop indigenous capabilities in response to restrictions on the use of Western-supplied weapons. The Palianytsia missile-drone, designed to strike Russian military airfields, represents a critical advancement for Ukraine's military efforts. The weapon is intended to neutralize platforms used to launch thousands of missiles and glide bombs at Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the successful deployment of the Palianytsia during his Independence Day speech on August 24, stating, 'Today, we witnessed the first successful combat use of our new weapon, the Palianytsia missile-drone. This is a completely new class of weapon—our own Ukrainian innovation.' A video released on August 25 provided an overview of the Palianytsia's development and capabilities. This long-range attack drone, powered by a turbojet engine, is equipped with a JetCat P400-PRO micro-turbojet, weighing 4 kg and generating 43 kg of thrust. Its structure is primarily fiberglass with wooden frames, and it features a large fuel tank to maximize range. The Palianytsia is also armed with a 20 kg blast-fragmentation warhead. The drone has an aerodynamic design similar to traditional cruise missiles, with a central body, forward-positioned wings, and a tail section equipped with four control surfaces. The drone is designed for easy transport and storage, with detachable wings and tail, allowing for quick access to the engine and reducing space requirements during transport. The Palianytsia can strike long-distance targets, including two dozen Russian military airfields. The weapon was developed in a remarkably short time, just a year and a half. Additionally, the cost of the Palianytsia is reportedly lower than that of similar systems, making it a more sustainable option for Ukraine as the conflict continues. In conclusion, the United Kingdom’s initiative with Project Brakestop clearly demonstrates the strategic learning derived from the conflict in Ukraine. By observing the effectiveness of systems like the Palianytsia drone, the British were able to identify crucial needs and innovation opportunities within their own defense industry. This experience has not only accelerated the development of advanced technologies capable of addressing modern threats but has also strengthened the collaboration between the Ministry of Defence and the private sector to rapidly adapt military capabilities to the realities of the contemporary battlefield.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/uk-launches-project-brakestop-a-jet-powered-long-range-attack-drone-initiative-modeled-after-ukraines-palianytsia-owe-uav	2024-09-30T03:13:06-07:00

AUKUS advancing Indo-Pacific security with nuclear submarines and emerging tech, Austin reports	According to information published by the US DoD on September 26, 2024, the trilateral security alliance known as AUKUS, consisting of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, is rapidly advancing military capabilities and deterrence strategies in the Indo-Pacific region, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. During a recent meeting in London with his counterparts, British Defense Secretary John Healey and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles, Austin emphasized the progress made under the partnership.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Australian Minister for Defence Richard Marles, the UK Ministry of Defence John Healey and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. (Picture source: US DoD) One of AUKUS's key objectives is to equip Australia with conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Austin highlighted that over the past year, efforts have been accelerated, with more Australian sailors receiving specialized training at U.S. and U.K. nuclear reactor schools. Additionally, a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine made a port visit to Australia, marking an early milestone toward establishing Australia's sovereign submarine capability. Austin also outlined plans for a rotational deployment of U.S. submarines to Australia, which could begin as early as 2027. He reiterated the United States’ commitment to assisting Australia in developing the skilled workforce needed to operate and maintain these advanced submarines. The AUKUS partnership is structured around two main pillars. The first aims to ensure that Australia acquires nuclear-powered submarine capability by the early 2030s. The second pillar focuses on accelerating cutting-edge military technologies such as uncrewed maritime systems, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and hypersonics. Japan has committed to contributing to the development of maritime autonomy, while discussions with Canada, South Korea, and New Zealand are ongoing regarding their potential involvement in these emerging technologies. In addition to these advancements, the AUKUS nations have committed to easing export controls to enhance secure trade within the partnership. This includes the sale of U.S. Virginia-class submarines to Australia. Recent legislative changes under the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act have amended export regulations, providing exemptions for Australia and the United Kingdom, further facilitating defense cooperation. Background From a geopolitical perspective, China has been vocal in its opposition, framing AUKUS as a destabilizing move that exacerbates regional tensions and threatens to spark an arms race. This has added fuel to the existing rivalry between China and the U.S. over influence in the Pacific, with Beijing accusing the pact of adopting a 'Cold War mentality' that undermines the nuclear non-proliferation regime. This sentiment resonates with some Pacific nations, many of which are wary of nuclear-powered submarines in their waters, especially given the region's history of nuclear testing and its commitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone. Countries like Fiji and the Solomon Islands have expressed concerns, suggesting that the presence of such vessels contradicts the ideals of peace in the Pacific, raising further diplomatic hurdles for Australia in maintaining regional relations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/aukus-advancing-indo-pacific-security-with-nuclear-submarines-and-emerging-tech-austin-reports	2024-09-30T02:14:00-07:00

(Picture source: French MoD) France's naval strategy in the Indo-Pacific is anchored in its significant territorial presence, sovereignty interests, and its broader geopolitical goals. With 1.65 million French citizens living in the region and vast territories in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, France sees itself as an Indo-Pacific power. Its strategy focuses on several key areas: maintaining territorial integrity, ensuring freedom of navigation, and promoting regional stability through multilateralism and alliances. One of the primary objectives is to protect France's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the second largest in the world, from threats like illegal fishing and maritime crime. To do so, France has permanently deployed about 7,000 military personnel along with 20 naval vessels and 40 aircraft, spread across bases in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and La Réunion. These forces are tasked with defending France’s sovereignty, providing disaster relief, and supporting international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which ensures freedom of navigation across global waters. Given the rising tensions between major powers like the United States and China, France has increased its naval deployments, regularly sending frigates and surveillance ships through strategic waterways like the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. French forces also collaborate with key regional allies, including India, Japan, Australia, and the United States, participating in major maritime exercises such as RIMPAC and strengthening diplomatic and defense ties. The French Navy also plays a critical role in countering narcotics trafficking and illegal fishing, using advanced maritime domain awareness tools like satellite imagery and electronic surveillance to monitor its waters. Despite this, France faces challenges in sustaining its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific due to resource constraints. Its naval assets in the region are often stretched thin, and many of its vessels require modernization. Efforts are underway to address these issues, including the procurement of new patrol vessels and the upgrade of surveillance frigates, but there remains a gap between France’s strategic objectives and its current capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navys-offshore-patrol-vessel-auguste-techer-completes-first-sea-trials	2024-09-30T00:35:01-07:00	
Azerbaijan brings upgraded Israeli-made Plasan SandCat Stormer with Spike NLOS missiles to ADEX 2024	During the 5th Azerbaijan International Defence Exhibition (ADEX) 2024, Azerbaijan presented an upgraded variant of its Israeli SandCat Stormer vehicle, possibly equipped with the Spike NLOS missile system. This event follows Azerbaijan's recent military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh and aligns with the country's defense spending, projected to reach around USD 3.8 billion in 2024.

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Azerbaijan conducted a military operation on September 19, 2023, to gain control over the remaining parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a territory mainly inhabited by Armenians but located within Azerbaijan’s borders. The operation raised concerns about potential broader violence and led to a significant displacement of Armenians fearing reprisals. Russian peacekeepers were killed during the fighting, but Russia did not intervene. Azerbaijan's economic position, partly influenced by the Ukraine war's effects on natural gas exports to the European Union, has allowed it to expand its military capabilities. The country has acquired military equipment from Turkiye, such as upgrading Su-25 combat aircraft, and from Israel, acquiring a remote-sensing satellite and additional Barak air defense systems. Azerbaijan plans to increase military spending by around 6% in 2024, reaching approximately USD 3.8 billion. Armenia has also increased its defense spending, with a budget of USD 1.28 billion in 2023, a 46% rise compared to the previous year, and plans to expand it to about USD 1.4 billion in 2024. Due to delays in Russian arms deliveries, affected by Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, Armenia has sought alternative suppliers, including India, signing contracts for 155mm ATAGS towed howitzers, Pinaka multiple-launch rocket systems, and Akash air defense systems. Additionally, Armenia is transitioning toward NATO-standard artillery, incorporating Western military education systems and command approaches. Armenia has distanced itself from Russia's security role, as Moscow did not intervene during the 2022 border conflict with Azerbaijan. This led Armenia to invite an EU monitoring mission, comprising 103 civilian members, while Armenia has effectively halted its participation in CSTO activities. Azerbaijan's armed forces, consisting of 64,050 active personnel (57,800 in the Army, 1,750 in the Navy, and 8,650 in the Air Force) and 300,000 reservists, focus mainly on territorial defense. Azerbaijan maintains a conscript-based system, with service terms of 18 months (12 for graduates). The country has shifted from reliance on Russian military support to establishing defense ties with Israel, Turkiye, and Pakistan, signing agreements such as the 2021 'Shusha Declaration' with Turkiye and engaging in joint exercises like the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk-2023 in October 2023. Additionally, Azerbaijan signed bilateral defense cooperation agreements with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 2023 and has developed limited but expanding domestic defense-industrial capabilities through its Ministry of Defence Industry. Azerbaijan has acquired various military equipment from Israel, including dozens of Plasan Sandcat armored vehicles, a remote-sensing satellite, and Barak air defense systems.

Heavy Air Transport: DARPA Seeks a Drone with Twice Lifting Power of CH-53K King Stallion	The U.S. Department of Defense, through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), has recently launched an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing heavy air transport. This initiative, named 'Cost Efficient Cargo,' explores the design of an autonomous drone capable of carrying up to 31.75 tons of cargo, which is double the lifting capacity of the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter, currently in service with the U.S. Marine Corps. Unlike the King Stallion, this drone would not be designed for long-range missions but rather for moving heavy loads between ships and beaches or crossing rivers and other natural obstacles inland.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marines with Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron (VMX) 1 transport a Light Armored Vehicle 25 with a CH-53K King Stallion helicopter over Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, April 27, 2022 (Picture source: US-DoD) DARPA recently issued a Request for Information (RFI), seeking innovative proposals for uncrewed heavy-lift systems capable of carrying a 70,000-pound payload (around 35 tons). This RFI specifies that the drone must utilize existing engine and transmission technologies while deviating from systems currently employed by traditional helicopters. The intended operational range for this drone would be 25 miles (40.23 km), flying at an altitude of 500 feet between the cargo pickup point and its destination, with a return trip to the base. This project is driven by the growing logistical needs of the U.S. military, particularly in high-intensity conflict scenarios against adversaries with significant anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, such as China. Amphibious and airborne operations, where troops and equipment must be rapidly moved from sea to land, increasingly face natural or artificial obstacles such as ravines, rivers, or destroyed bridges. Currently, these barriers are often overcome through engineering solutions like floating bridges or amphibious vehicles, but these methods are time-consuming and provide adversaries with the opportunity to mount counterattacks. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project aims to address the urgent need for faster and more efficient heavy-lift transport, particularly in scenarios where swift execution is critical to establishing a beachhead or crossing contested areas. Although the CH-53K can lift an impressive 36,000 pounds (16.33 tons), it remains costly, with a unit price of approximately $118 million. Additionally, current solutions, while effective, are limited in range, cost, and vulnerability to enemy defenses. The CH-53K King Stallion prepares for take-off during sea trials in June 2020 on the USS Wasp (LHD-1) (Picture source: US DoD) DARPA is considering a variety of configurations for this future heavy-lift drone, including hybrid propulsion systems powered by internal combustion engines, electric motors, or a combination of both. While autonomous capabilities are desired, they are not the immediate focus of this RFI. The main goal is to identify groundbreaking concepts and mitigate risks through scaled-down prototypes before investing in full-scale development. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the importance of overcoming obstacles and rapidly maneuvering forces, underscoring the vulnerabilities of static infrastructure like temporary bridges, which are often exposed to precision strikes and real-time surveillance. Similarly, in a potential conflict with adversaries like China, U.S. amphibious capabilities could be hampered by anti-ship missiles, limiting the proximity of landing ships to shore. The heavy-lift drone proposed by DARPA is designed to overcome these challenges by facilitating the rapid transfer of cargo from ships at sea to land or across obstacles such as rivers and canyons inland. The concept includes the possibility of transporting 40-foot ISO containers (12.19 meters) or even armored vehicles like the M2 Bradley. However, while the Bradley's combat weight is approximately 80,000 pounds (36.29 tons), which slightly exceeds the drone’s projected capacity, DARPA anticipates that these vehicles could be transported empty, without ammunition or fuel, reducing their weight. The logistical challenges facing the U.S. military, particularly in the rapid transport of heavy equipment in contested environments, have prompted the exploration of solutions such as this drone project. DARPA acknowledges that this program could significantly change how the U.S. military deploys its forces and equipment, especially in distributed operations at sea and on land, where flexibility and speed are essential. While questions remain about the actual efficiency of a fleet of high-lift drones, particularly in terms of cost and their ability to meet operational demand, this project reflects the growing need for innovative logistical solutions in the U.S. armed forces. In the long term, this drone could integrate into the future air mobility ecosystem of the U.S. military, addressing increasingly complex operational requirements. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project marks a significant step in the development of the U.S. military’s heavy-lift air transport capabilities. This drone, capable of lifting twice the load of the King Stallion, offers an opportunity to enhance military maneuvers by increasing the speed, flexibility, and resilience of U.S. ground and amphibious forces in the face of increasingly sophisticated adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/heavy-air-transport-darpa-seeks-a-drone-with-twice-lifting-power-of-ch-53k-king-stallion	2024-09-30T00:24:17-07:00

It stands as a symbol of China's military modernization, equipped with cutting-edge systems for firepower, mobility, and protection. A recent development, as shared by 'David Wang' on X (formerly Twitter) on September 19, 2024, reveals that China is currently developing a variant of the ZTZ-99 outfitted with an advanced Active Protection System (APS). This APS includes two projectile launchers and four fire control radars, similar to the GL-6 system, first revealed in 2022.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New Chinese-made ZTZ-99 MBT Main Battle Tank fitted with APS Active Protection System. (Picture source: X account David Wang) The ZTZ-99 main battle tank, also named Type 99, was developed in the 1990s by China as part of its broader effort to modernize its armored forces. Its design was influenced by earlier Soviet tank models, particularly the T-72, but it incorporates advanced technologies, making it one of the most sophisticated tanks in China’s arsenal. Development of the ZTZ-99 began in the late 1980s, and the first prototype was completed by 1993. After rigorous testing and refinements, the ZTZ-99 officially entered service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1999. It made its public debut during the National Day parade in 1999, signaling China’s commitment to fielding a modern, competitive armored force. Regarding combat capabilities, the ZTZ-99 is equipped with a 125mm smoothbore cannon, capable of firing APFSDS rounds, HEAT shells, and ATGMs, enabling it to engage heavily armored vehicles at various ranges. The tank is protected by advanced composite armor and explosive reactive armor (ERA), designed to defend against high-explosive and kinetic threats. Recent variants of the ZTZ-99 have integrated an Active Protection System (APS), like the GL-6, which offers hard-kill protection by intercepting incoming missiles or projectiles. The tank is powered by a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 80 km/h, ensuring excellent mobility on diverse terrain. This combination of firepower, protection, and speed solidifies the ZTZ-99's role as a highly capable and modern main battle tank​. The GL-6 Active Protection System (APS) is a hard-kill defense system developed by China, primarily designed to protect armored vehicles from incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. It is similar in function to other APS like Israel's 'Iron Fist.' The GL-6 system is integrated into vehicles such as the VT-4A1 main battle tank and offers advanced interception capabilities. It uses radar to detect and neutralize threats by launching countermeasures that destroy or deflect incoming missiles before they can strike the vehicle. The GL-6 is a significant upgrade over earlier models like the GL-5, offering better performance and modular features that allow it to be adapted to various platforms. The system effectively counters anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and high-explosive projectiles, making it a valuable asset in modern armored warfare. In terms of performance, the GL-6 can intercept multiple types of threats from various angles, adding a layer of survivability for vehicles like the VT-4A1 and potentially the VN-22 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), although its functionality on the latter is still debated and may be limited to experimental or demonstration purposes Adding the APS to the ZTZ-99 tank is a game-changer for its defensive capabilities. An APS is designed to provide 'hard-kill' protection, which means it actively intercepts and destroys incoming anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and other high-velocity projectiles before they can hit the tank. The two APS projectile launchers and radar system work in tandem to detect and neutralize threats, providing 360-degree coverage. This level of protection enhances the tank's survivability in both offensive and defensive operations, especially in environments where advanced anti-tank weaponry is deployed. By adding this advanced APS, the ZTZ-99 becomes far more resistant to modern anti-armor threats, ensuring it can remain operational on the battlefield even when facing the latest missile and projectile systems. The GL-6 system, in particular, is known for its efficiency in intercepting multiple threats simultaneously, further increasing the tank's durability in combat. These improvements make the ZTZ-99 not only a powerful offensive machine, with its 125mm smoothbore gun capable of firing various munitions, but also a highly resilient vehicle, able to withstand a wide range of battlefield threats. This development aligns with China's strategic focus on enhancing the survivability and effectiveness of its armored forces, allowing the ZTZ-99 to maintain its cutting-edge position among global main battle tanks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-unveils-cutting-edge-ztz-99-tank-upgrade-with-advanced-active-protection-system	2024-09-27T10:18:47-07:00

China's newest nuclear submarine reportedly sank at dock earlier this year, say U.S. officials	According to information published by CNN on September 26, 2024, China's latest nuclear-powered submarine, the first of its Zhou-class attack vessels, reportedly sank earlier this year while docked.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a Chinese Navy submarine. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The submarine, under construction at a shipyard near Wuhan, is believed to have gone down in the spring. Chinese authorities have attempted to keep the incident out of public view. The Zhou-class submarine, distinguished by its unique X-shaped stern designed for enhanced maneuverability, was seen docked in satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on March 10. By June, however, further imagery indicated the submarine was no longer at the pier, raising questions about its fate. An unusual concentration of cranes at the shipyard during that period, spotted by Tom Shugart, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, hinted at ongoing recovery efforts. Shugart noted this level of activity was atypical for the site. Beijing has prioritized modernizing its submarine fleet as part of broader efforts to enhance the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy). The PLA currently operates a mix of nuclear-powered ballistic missile and attack submarines, alongside a significant fleet of diesel-powered submarines. Despite this modernization, the PLA Navy’s transparency on incidents such as this remains limited. When asked about the situation, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., said they had no information to provide. U.S. defense officials have not confirmed whether nuclear fuel was loaded onto the submarine at the time of the sinking, leaving critical details about the incident unknown. The loss has prompted questions about the oversight of China’s defense industry, which has historically been troubled by issues of corruption and accountability. The PLA Navy, currently the world’s largest by the number of ships, is expected to expand its submarine fleet in the coming years, with projections suggesting 65 submarines by 2025 and 80 by 2035. This growth comes as the U.S. identifies China as its principal strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in naval power.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinas-newest-nuclear-submarine-reportedly-sank-at-dock-earlier-this-year-say-u-s-officials	2024-09-27T00:46:55-07:00

Exclusive: Iran mediating talks for Russian missile transfer to Yemen's Houthis	According to information published by Reuters on September 24, 2024, Iran has facilitated secret negotiations between Russia and Yemen's Houthi rebels, aiming to transfer advanced anti-ship missiles to the militant group. The ongoing discussions, which have yet to result in a confirmed transfer, focus on supplying the Yakhont missile, also known as the P-800 Oniks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian P-800 Oniks missile. (Picture source: Wikipedia/ Boevaya mashina) Seven sources have indicated that while Moscow has not finalized the decision, the Yakhont missile would significantly enhance the Houthis' ability to target vessels in the Red Sea. Experts warn that this could increase the threat to U.S. and European warships, as well as disrupt global maritime trade further. The Wall Street Journal had reported in July that Russia was considering this missile transfer, but Iran's involvement in brokering the talks had not been previously disclosed. The Houthis have intensified their drone and missile strikes on ships in the Red Sea since November, partly in solidarity with Palestinians during the ongoing Gaza conflict. Their actions have already caused significant disruptions, sinking two ships and seizing another, forcing shipping companies to reroute cargo and prompting rising insurance costs for vessels navigating the area. Despite retaliatory strikes by the U.S. and Britain on Houthi positions, the group’s attacks continue. Two regional officials revealed that Russian and Houthi representatives have met in Tehran at least twice this year, with further meetings expected soon. These talks reportedly include plans to supply the Houthis with dozens of Yakhont missiles, which have a range of approximately 300 kilometers. Russia has previously provided Yakhont missiles to Iran-backed Hezbollah, and the current discussions, which began under Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, reflect a growing alignment between Moscow and Tehran. Western intelligence sources emphasize that Iran is mediating the talks but seeks to avoid direct involvement in the transfer. Some sources suggest that Russia's willingness to arm the Houthis may be linked to Western military aid to Ukraine. The transfer of Yakhont missiles, regarded as highly advanced, would represent a significant shift in regional security dynamics. Experts believe that the Houthis could use these weapons not only against Western naval forces but also as land-attack missiles, potentially threatening Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have raised the issue with Saudi Arabia, which shares concerns over the missile transfer. Russia's potential involvement has drawn alarm across the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/exclusive-iran-mediating-talks-for-russian-missile-transfer-to-yemens-houthis	2024-09-26T05:11:06-07:00

Japan's first warship passage through Taiwan Strait signals growing regional tensions	According to information published by Al Jazeera on September 26, 2024, Japan has reportedly sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time, signaling increased naval activity in a region marked by growing tensions with China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Takanami-class destroyer JS Sazanami. (Picture source: JMSDF) The destroyer, Sazanami, made the passage through the 180-kilometer strait, sailing alongside vessels from Australia and New Zealand. This transit, reported by Japanese media, comes as China intensifies its military presence near Japan. The Sazanami entered the strait from the East China Sea, taking more than 10 hours to complete its southward journey. The operation, conducted ahead of joint drills in the contested South China Sea, saw participation from New Zealand’s HMNZS Aotearoa and Australia’s HMAS Sydney. This move follows a recent passage by China’s aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, between two Japanese islands near Taiwan. Japan, which described this activity as 'totally unacceptable,' remains on alert over China's expanding military footprint. Tokyo recently reported a Chinese spy plane violating its airspace near islands off its southwestern coast, heightening concerns over Beijing’s growing assertiveness. Japan’s government has refrained from confirming details of the warship's passage, but spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi voiced concern over the increasing frequency of military actions in the region, particularly airspace violations. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reportedly ordered the Taiwan Strait transit in response to fears that Beijing’s actions could escalate if left unchecked. Taiwan Strait The Taiwan Strait is a strategically significant body of water that separates Taiwan from mainland China. It is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) wide at its narrowest point and connects the East China Sea to the north with the South China Sea to the south. This region has long been a focal point of geopolitical tension due to its critical location, historical claims, and military significance. One of the most pressing issues surrounding the Taiwan Strait is the status of Taiwan itself. Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates as a self-governing democracy but is claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a breakaway province. The PRC views reunification with Taiwan as a core national objective and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal, especially in light of Taiwan's growing international partnerships and the evolving dynamics of global defense alignments. The Taiwan Strait is crucial to global shipping, as many of the world's largest container ships pass through it. This waterway is a major conduit for goods moving between Asia and the rest of the world, particularly energy supplies like oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-first-warship-passage-through-taiwan-strait-signals-growing-regional-tensions	2024-09-26T04:05:54-07:00	
Brazilian Air Force receives new Saab F-39 Gripen fighter jet from Sweden	On September 24, 2024, the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) announced the arrival of another Saab F-39 Gripen aircraft in Brazil, registered as 4108. This aircraft arrived on September 23, completing a journey of approximately 20 days. It was shipped from Norrköping, Sweden, to the port of Navegantes on the Catarinense coast. After its arrival, the aircraft was transferred to Navegantes International Airport, where the necessary technical procedures will be conducted to prepare it for its flight to Anápolis Air Base (BAAN).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link After its arrival, the Saab F-39 Gripen was transferred to Navegantes International Airport, where the necessary technical procedures will be conducted to prepare it for its flight to Anápolis Air Base. (Picture source: Força Aérea Brasileira) The F-39E Gripen’s arrival is part of the FAB’s modernization program, aimed at enhancing Brazil’s air combat capabilities. The transition comes after the prolonged use of older fighter jets, particularly the American-made Northrop F-5, which became the primary fighter jet following the retirement of the Mirage 2000 in late 2013. The Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) acquired a total of 79 F-5s over the years, with the initial purchase consisting of 42 new units in 1973 (including 6 two-seat B training units and 36 one-seat E units). In 1988, another 26 new units were acquired (comprising 4 B training units and 22 E units), followed by the acquisition of 11 used units from Jordan in 2000, as the production of F-5s had ended in the United States in 1987. Currently, approximately 50 of these jets remain in active service. To ensure the continued service of the F-5 fleet, a modernization program began in 2005 and was completed in October 2020. Embraer managed the modernization, upgrading the F-5s with new avionics systems, multifunctional displays, Italian Grifo F multimode radars, electronic countermeasures, and compatibility with modern missiles and laser-guided bombs. The modernization project, known as the FX project, resulted in the F-5s being designated as F-5EM/F-5FM variants, with contributions from Israeli companies ATL and Elbit Systems. The final modernized F-5M fighter was delivered to the FAB on October 14, 2020, concluding the 15-year program and resulting in a total of 49 fighters being upgraded. The shift towards the Gripen began in 2013 with the Brazilian Gripen Program, when Saab was selected for the F-X2 contract to replace the aging fleet. In October 2014, a contract was signed with the Brazilian government for the development and production of 36 Gripen NG aircraft, consisting of 28 single-seat F-39Es and eight dual-seat F-39Fs, along with two flight simulators, with a total value of SEK38.9 billion (USD4.25 billion). The shift towards the Gripen began in 2013 with the Brazilian Gripen Program, when Saab was selected for the F-X2 contract to replace the aging fleet of 79 American-made F-5s. (Picture source: Saab) As the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) operates both F-5 and Gripen-E fighters, Brazilian Air Force Commander, Lieutenant Brigadier Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno, emphasized that Brazilian regulations require the fleet to consist of at least two but not more than three fighter types, suggesting the Indian Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) could serve as the second or third type alongside the Gripen-E once the F-5 is phased out. This consideration was confirmed in a meeting with Indian defense officials, including Air Chief Marshal V.R. Chaudhari and Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi, on September 11, 2024. On November 24, 2021, the FAB formally received its first four series-production Saab F-39Es, Brazil's designation for the single-seat Gripen E variant. These jets were accepted at the Saab Aeronautics plant in Linköping, Sweden, and later shipped to Brazil to join the Jaguar Squadron at Wing 2 in Anápolis, Goiás. These fighters joined a single-seat F-39E Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) aircraft that had been delivered to Brazil on September 11, 2019, for testing in both Sweden and Brazil. The entire delivery schedule for the Gripen fleet is structured in multiple phases, with the last two fighters expected to be delivered by 2026. The Gripen program includes Embraer as the main Brazilian partner, receiving about 60 to 70% of the technology transfer and offset packages. The FAB currently operates nine F-39Es and has another 27 Gripen E/Fs on order, scheduled for delivery from 2019 to 2026. This will create a total fleet of 36 F-39E/Fs, operated by the 'Jaguar' Squadron of the 1st Air Defense Group.

Russian spy ships suspected of espionage in Baltic and North Seas	According to information published by Suddeutsche Zeitung on September 24, 2024, alarming activity by Russian ships in the Baltic and North Seas has raised suspicions of espionage and sabotage of critical infrastructure.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 865 Hydrographic survey vessel Sibirykov. (Picture source: Сделано у нас) The investigation, which involved journalists from six countries, revealed that Russian research ships, often equipped with military technology, have been spying on gas pipelines, data cables, wind farms, and military infrastructure in the region. One incident from October 2023 highlights the concern. The containership Newnew Polar Bear abruptly slowed down while crossing the Balticconnector pipeline, causing severe damage to the pipeline with its anchor. This came just months after the Russian seabed survey ship Sibiryakov was observed performing suspicious maneuvers, at least once directly over the pipeline, sparking suspicions that it might have been preparing for sabotage. Ships like the Sibiryakov are part of a broader network of Russian vessels conducting surveillance missions in the area. These research ships are said to be under the control of the Russian Ministry of Defense and are fitted with sophisticated equipment, including military-grade radar systems. The investigation tracked 72 Russian research vessels, which have made 428 voyages since the start of the war in Ukraine. Analysis of over 1,000 Morse code transmissions and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data points indicate that these activities have increased in recent months. Ships have been detected entering the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of several EU countries at low speeds, often below 5 knots, a tactic experts associate with espionage missions. Many of these incursions were in close proximity to vital infrastructure like gas pipelines and offshore wind farms. In Germany alone, over 2,600 Russia-affiliated vessels have reportedly made 'area visits' in German territorial waters since the Ukraine conflict began, with 143 of them flying the Russian flag. This prompted German authorities to increase their surveillance efforts, with government figures confirming that since 2023, 107 escort missions by police and navy frigates have been conducted to monitor suspicious activity in the country’s EEZ. One notable case involved the Yevgeniy Gorigledzha, a Russian vessel that loitered for more than eight hours near Fehmarn Island, a known NATO submarine diving area. The ship’s erratic zigzag movements raised concerns of potential espionage, leading to intervention by both a German police ship and a navy vessel. NATO experts warn that these activities could be preparatory steps for sabotage. Many of these Russian ships are believed to carry advanced military equipment, such as mini-submarines and underwater drones, which could be used to disrupt or damage critical infrastructure in the event of heightened geopolitical tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-spy-ships-suspected-of-espionage-in-baltic-and-north-seas	2024-09-25T05:45:54-07:00

Egypt Sends Military Aid to Somalia as Territorial Tensions with Ethiopia Persist	On Tuesday, September 24, 2024, Egypt confirmed it had sent military aid to Somalia, demonstrating its support for the Horn of Africa nation, currently in conflict with Ethiopia over a breakaway territory. This aid comes in the midst of growing tensions between Somalia and Ethiopia, aggravated by the issue of Somaliland’s recognition, a region that seceded from Somalia three decades ago.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This cooperation agreement followed a controversial proposal from landlocked Ethiopia, which planned to formally recognize Somaliland in exchange for access to a port and a military base on the Gulf of Aden (Picture source: Somalian MoD) A shipment, that recently arrived in Mogadishu, is part of Egypt's commitment to support Somalia's efforts to ensure security and stability, combat terrorism, and maintain its sovereignty and unity, according to a brief statement released Monday by the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although the specifics of the military assistance were not disclosed, it was indicated that the aid aims to strengthen the Somali army's capabilities. This support is part of a military cooperation protocol signed between the two nations in August. This cooperation agreement followed a controversial proposal from landlocked Ethiopia, which planned to formally recognize Somaliland in exchange for access to a port and a military base on the Gulf of Aden. Somalia, which still regards Somaliland as part of its territory, reacted angrily to this proposal, intensifying regional tensions. In response to the announcement of Egyptian military aid, Somaliland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed deep alarm over the transfer of weapons, stating that 'the Mogadishu administration currently lacks the capacity to effectively manage or safeguard such a large cache of military equipment.' This statement highlights concerns over Somalia's ability to handle military resources, given its ongoing struggles with insurgent groups and internal security challenges.

US deploys laser-equipped destroyer to Japan amid growing concerns over China’s military threat by 2027	According to information published by Nikkei Asia on September 25, 2024, the U.S. Navy has deployed the USS Preble, a destroyer equipped with advanced laser weaponry, to Yokosuka, Japan.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Navy's destroyer USS Preble fitted with the HELIOS laser weapon system. (Picture source: US DoD) The deployment, which began with the ship’s departure from San Diego on Sunday, follows the release of the Navy's 2024 Navigation Plan. This blueprint outlines readiness goals, including preparing for the possibility of conflict with China by 2027. The USS Preble is currently the only vessel in the U.S. fleet of 73 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers to carry a high-energy laser system designed for defense against drones and missiles. This technology, known as Helios—developed by Lockheed Martin—features integrated optical-dazzler and surveillance capabilities. While still undergoing at-sea testing, Helios represents a step forward in shipboard defenses, potentially offering a more sustainable method for countering drone swarms and missile threats compared to conventional missile systems. As stated by a Navy spokesperson, the USS Preble's forward deployment will allow continued testing of the Helios system. The decision to deploy comes as the Navy, under the leadership of Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, focuses on readiness to counter China's growing military capabilities. Franchetti’s latest Navigation Plan emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for a potential conflict with the People’s Republic of China by 2027. Directed-energy weapons like Helios are anticipated to play a key role in future U.S. military operations, particularly in countering drones and anti-ship missiles. Traditional missile defense systems, while effective, are costly and unsustainable in prolonged engagements where inexpensive drones and missiles can be deployed in large numbers. A report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) highlighted the cost efficiency of laser weapons, noting that they can be fired repeatedly at minimal expense—estimated at less than $10 per shot—compared to multimillion-dollar surface-to-air missiles. The USS Preble joins 12 other U.S. warships stationed in Yokosuka, including the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which is expected to arrive in November. The Preble replaces the USS Benfold, which is being reassigned to Everett, Washington. Laser systems provide a cost-effective solution for neutralizing large numbers of threats, including drones—a lesson underscored by the widespread use of drone fleets in conflicts such as the war in Ukraine. Despite the promise of lasers, some remain skeptical about their operational readiness. Concerns have been expressed about the effectiveness of laser technology, particularly in adverse weather conditions such as rain or dust storms. Other forms of directed energy weapons, such as microwave systems, could provide more reliable alternatives.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-deploys-laser-equipped-destroyer-to-japan-amid-growing-concerns-over-chinas-military-threat-by-2027	2024-09-25T01:58:22-07:00

This project is led by Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) under an experimental design commission from the Russian Ministry of Defense.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The T-72 tank was chosen as the platform for the Shturm Remote-Controlled Tank (RTK) due to its cost-effectiveness, reliability, protection features, and mobility. (Picture source: Russian social media) Murakhovsky, a retired colonel and editor-in-chief of 'Arsenal of the Fatherland,' stated that the T-72 tank was chosen as the platform for the Remote-Controlled Tank (RTK) due to its cost-effectiveness, reliability, protection features, and mobility. The selection of the T-72 aims to create a protected and maneuverable platform for integrating various weapons systems and control units, utilizing a tested and established chassis. Development began before the conflict in Ukraine but has since accelerated. Army Recognition reported on September 10, 2023, that UVZ started testing the Shturm unmanned tank, built on the T-72B3 tank chassis, with intentions for deployment on the Ukrainian frontline. The testing program involves live-fire exercises against diverse target scenarios, emphasizing the use of the robot’s main armament (a 125mm 2A46 tank gun with a shortened barrel) and refining its autonomous operational capabilities. The T-72 Remote-Controlled Tank (RTK) is equipped with weaponry that includes the RPO-2 'Shmel-M' flame rocket launcher, 30mm automatic cannons, and 220mm thermobaric unguided rockets from the TOS-1A Solntsepyok heavy flamethrower system. Additionally, an assault gun has been developed using the 2A46 125mm tank gun with a shortened barrel, representing the use of weapon systems previously tested for effectiveness on this platform. The testing program of the T-72 Shturm involves live-fire exercises against diverse target scenarios, emphasizing the use of the robot’s main armament and refining its autonomous operational capabilities. (Picture source: Russian social media) The fire control system is based on technology already used in the T-90M and T-14 Armata tanks, with adaptations that incorporate intelligent elements enabling the tank to identify various target types and make autonomous firing decisions. This adaptation is designed to enhance the RTK’s capability to engage targets without direct human input. The RTK’s control and movement systems combine components previously tested in other RTKs with new elements, facilitating automatic movement in formation, route planning, terrain evaluation, and obstacle navigation. The system employs sensors that operate across ultrasonic, visible, and infrared ranges, supported by a technical vision system and AI using trainable neural networks. This setup allows the RTK to assess its surroundings and respond accordingly.

(Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) Army Recognition previously reported that the Shturm project involves four combat vehicle types. The first variant is equipped with a 125mm gun with a shortened barrel, the second carries missiles or a rocket-propelled infantry flamethrower with a thermobaric 'Shmel-M' warhead, the third is a robotic adaptation of the Terminator fire support vehicle fitted with two 30mm automatic cannons that launch thermobaric missiles instead of anti-tank missiles, and the fourth is an unmanned vehicle intended to operate alongside the TOS-1A 'Solntsepek' thermobaric rocket launcher system. The unmanned tanks feature sensors across ultrasonic, visible, and infrared spectrums that support automatic convoy movement, terrain assessment, and obstacle navigation. A comprehensive all-angle technical vision system, combined with AI based on trainable neural networks, allows these systems to evaluate situations and make operational decisions, ensuring the ability to navigate natural and engineered obstacles without direct human intervention. Military expert Yuri Knutov commented that deploying T-72-based unmanned tanks could change operational dynamics for the Russian Armed Forces, as these vehicles can be remotely controlled, thereby reducing risks to personnel under enemy fire. Knutov noted that integrating such robots might necessitate adjustments in the use of tanks and heavy armored vehicles, particularly considering the observed effectiveness of anti-tank guided missiles in recent conflicts. The use of unmanned tanks, including a captured Ukrainian T-72AMT now labeled 'Vasya' by Russian forces, may lead to adjustments in traditional armored tactics, emphasizing strategic deployment and reducing personnel risks. Knutov observed that despite the presence of numerous armored vehicles, anti-tank guided missiles have been notably effective in neutralizing them during the Ukraine conflict. For effective combat operations, it might be more efficient to deploy armored vehicles strategically, such as in a 'tank carousel' formation with three vehicles, rather than deploying larger numbers simultaneously. Introduced in 2011, the T-72B3 is an updated version of the T-72B tank, achieving performance levels comparable to more modern tanks like the T-90A. (Picture source: Russian social media) Introduced in 2011, the T-72B3 is an updated version of the T-72B tank, achieving performance levels comparable to more modern tanks like the T-90A.

Breaking News: Lebanese Hezbollah launches Qader 1 missile targeting Israeli intelligence headquarters	Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, launched a surface-to-surface Qader 1 ballistic missile from southern Lebanon targeting central Israel early this morning. Hezbollah has claimed the missile was aimed at the Mossad Israeli intelligence services headquarters near Herzliya, a city just north of Tel Aviv.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image of a Qadr missile being launched from a truck-mounted launcher during the Velayat-90 Naval Exercise. (Picture source: FARS Iranian Media) The Qader 1 ballistic missile is a surface-to-surface missile developed by Iran and supplied to its regional allies, including Hezbollah. It is designed for medium-range attacks and is part of a family of Iranian missiles aimed at enhancing the military capabilities of non-state actors. The missile is known for its precision and ability to carry significant payloads, making it a potent weapon in regional conflicts. With an estimated range of 200 to 300 kilometers, the Qader 1 can strike deep into enemy territory, making it a strategic threat to areas such as Tel Aviv when deployed by groups like Hezbollah. The missile, launched from Hezbollah-controlled territory in southern Lebanon, was intercepted by Israel’s David’s Sling air defense missile system, which is designed to protect against medium-range missile threats. The system successfully neutralized the missile in mid-air, preventing any damage or casualties in the densely populated area of Tel Aviv. This marks one of the most brazen attacks by Hezbollah on Israeli territory in recent years, significantly raising the stakes in the already volatile Israel-Lebanon dynamic. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retaliated by targeting the Hezbollah missile launcher believed to be responsible for the attack. The launcher was located in Nafakhiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Lebanon. Israeli fighter jets carried out precision airstrikes on the site, destroying the launcher and reportedly crippling Hezbollah’s immediate missile-launch capabilities in the region. Israeli military officials have emphasized that this was a direct response to the attack and part of Israel’s broader strategy of deterrence against Hezbollah’s growing missile arsenal. Israel has long been concerned about Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated weaponry, much of which is believed to be supplied by Iran, and its ability to strike deep into Israeli territory. This attack from Hezbollah marks a dramatic escalation in the ongoing hostilities between Israel and the militant group, which operates with significant autonomy within Lebanon. The incident also puts Lebanon, a country grappling with severe economic and political crises, at the center of yet another potentially devastating conflict. Hezbollah’s decision to launch such a high-profile missile strike, targeting an intelligence installation in Israel’s heartland, signals a bold move by the group and could indicate increased Iranian influence on Hezbollah’s military strategy. Hezbollah, which wields considerable political and military power in Lebanon, has increasingly positioned itself as a key player in the region’s broader geopolitical struggles, particularly in the context of the Iran-Israel rivalry. In Lebanon, political leaders are facing increasing pressure as Hezbollah’s actions threaten to drag the country into a broader military conflict. With Lebanon already dealing with an economic collapse, the country may struggle to cope with the fallout from an extended military confrontation with Israel. As of now, both Israel and Hezbollah are closely watching the situation. The IDF continues to monitor Hezbollah's missile sites and its military infrastructure in Lebanon, and further retaliatory strikes could be launched depending on Hezbollah’s next moves. Today’s events mark a dangerous turning point in the longstanding conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. With both sides now directly engaging in military actions, the potential for a broader conflict looms large.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-lebanese-hezbollah-launches-qader-1-missile-targeting-israeli-intelligence-headquarters	2024-09-25T01:15:46-07:00	
China Conducts First Public Test of DF-41 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile in Pacific Ocean	On Wednesday, September 25, China publicly acknowledged the successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean, an unprecedented event that raises international concerns. The missile, carrying a dummy warhead and likely a DF-41, was launched by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force at 8:44 a.m. Beijing time. The Chinese Ministry of Defense emphasized that this test was part of routine annual exercises and was not directed against any particular country.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link DF-41 ICBM TELs on parade, 2019 (Picture source: PLA) The DF-41 (Dong Feng-41) is a Chinese ICBM known for its maximum range, estimated between 12,000 and 15,000 kilometers, making it China's longest-range missile. It is designed for mobile deployment on roads, railways, or from silos, offering significant flexibility. Powered by a three-stage solid-fuel engine, the missile can carry up to 10 independently targetable nuclear warheads (MIRVs), allowing it to strike multiple targets simultaneously. It uses an inertial guidance system with stellar or satellite updates and has an estimated circular error probable (CEP) of about 100 meters.Developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), the DF-41 began testing in 2012, demonstrating its ability to carry MIRVs. It entered limited production in 2019, and 16 launchers were unveiled during China's 70th-anniversary parade. This missile is part of China's ongoing modernization of its nuclear deterrent capabilities, aiming to counter advancements in missile defense systems and maintain a credible retaliatory strike capacity.Analysts point out that China usually conducts such tests within its own airspace, making this event particularly noteworthy. Ankit Panda, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, commented that this test could reflect China's nuclear modernization efforts, especially in response to improvements in U.S. missile defenses and enhanced surveillance systems.According to the Ministry of Defense's statement, the missile 'landed in predetermined maritime areas,' confirming that the test had achieved its objectives. The ministry also indicated that the concerned countries had been notified in advance. This exercise aimed to test the weapon's performance as well as the training level of the troops involved. The last time China launched a full-range ICBM was during the DF-5 missile launch in May 1980.In May 2023, a leak of U.S. intelligence revealed that China had successfully tested a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), designated as the DF-27. This missile, according to a classified U.S. intelligence report published in 2023, was reportedly tested on February 25 and traveled 2,100 kilometers in 12 minutes. Although the U.S. Department of Defense has not confirmed the authenticity of this report, it suggests that the DF-27 could have a range between 5,000 and 8,000 kilometers, capable of reaching targets as distant as Guam, Alaska, or parts of Australia. China conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), likely the DF-41, capable of traveling approximately 12,000 kilometers (Picture source: Duan Dang) This test illustrates China's strategic military modernization, which includes the expansion of its nuclear arsenal. In 2023, the Pentagon reported that China possessed more than 500 operational nuclear warheads, a number expected to exceed 1,000 by 2030. Meanwhile, China is constructing hundreds of silos for ground-based ICBMs. This increase in Chinese nuclear capabilities contrasts with the arsenals of the United States and Russia, each of which has over 1,700 deployed warheads.Despite this buildup, China has reaffirmed its commitment to a 'no first use' policy regarding nuclear weapons, with its arsenal under the exclusive control of the Central Military Commission led by President Xi Jinping. However, tensions remain high, particularly with Taiwan, which has reported an increase in Chinese military activities around the island. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense confirmed detecting 23 Chinese military aircraft operating near its territory on the same day as the missile test.This test takes place in the context of intensified military activities in the Asia-Pacific region, where China and other regional actors like North Korea continue their missile tests. In September, North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan, further heightening regional tensions.The People's Republic of China is building and deploying a sophisticated and modern missile arsenal, although this process remains shrouded in mystery due to Beijing's intentional ambiguity and refusal to adhere to arms control or transparency agreements. Chinese missiles play a central role in emerging anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) doctrines, combining ballistic and cruise missiles launched from air, land, and sea to target U.S. and allied military assets in the Asia-Pacific region. China is also developing several advanced capabilities, such as maneuverable anti-ship ballistic missiles, multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), and hypersonic glide vehicles.These combined trends threaten the survival of key elements of U.S. power projection, such as aircraft carriers and forward air bases. Additionally, China possesses a relatively small but developing contingent of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking U.S. territory, as well as a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-conducts-first-public-test-of-df-41-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-in-pacific-ocean	2024-09-25T01:02:03-07:00

Spanish Army Confirms Acquisition of 4,500 Peugeot Landtrek for Non-Combat Missions	The Ejército de Tierra has officially confirmed the acquisition of 4,500 Peugeot Landtrek vehicles as part of its VMTT (Vehículo Militar Todoterreno Táctico) program. This contract, which will span over four years, marks a significant step in the renewal of the Spanish Army's fleet of military vehicles. These new vehicles are intended to replace the PS10 Anibal, purchased in 2004, which has never fully met the army's expectations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Peugeot Landtrek is a versatile mid-size pickup truck designed for a variety of terrains and tasks (Picture source: Peugeot) Two companies competed for this contract: Iturri, representing the Peugeot Landtrek, and TSD, which offered the Ford Ranger. In March 2024, the Army’s Logistics Support Command (MALE) had already expressed its preference for the Landtrek, a decision that was subsequently contested. TSD filed a legal appeal to challenge the procurement process. However, the Spanish court rejected TSD's appeal, allowing MALE to confirm the contract with Iturri, valued at 217 million euros.The choice of the Peugeot Landtrek may surprise some observers, as the vehicle is based on the Kaicene F70, a pick-up truck designed by Chinese manufacturer Chang’an Automobile. Despite this partially non-French origin, the vehicle convinced Spanish authorities with its performance and suitability for the army's specific needs. It is important to note that these vehicles will not be used for combat missions. The Spanish Ministry of Defense clarified that they will be employed for 'tactical tasks removed from combat-related activities,' such as liaison missions within the national territory.In addition to the Ejército de Tierra, other Spanish armed forces will benefit from this acquisition. Peugeot Landtreks will also be delivered to the Guardia Civil, the Ejército del Aire y del Espacio, and the Armada Española, as part of a broader modernization of unprotected military vehicles. The Peugeot Landtrek is a versatile mid-size pickup truck designed for a variety of terrains and tasks, offering both 4x2 and 4x4 drive options. It is available with two main engine types: a 1.9L turbodiesel engine delivering 150 hp and 350 Nm of torque, and a 2.4L turbocharged petrol engine with 210 hp and 320 Nm of torque. Depending on the model, these engines are paired with either a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission.The Landtrek is built for durability and can handle heavy-duty tasks, with a payload capacity exceeding 1 ton and a towing capacity up to 3 tons. Its off-road capabilities are supported by features such as Hill Descent Control and a rear differential lock, making it suitable for rough terrains. Depending on the version, the ground clearance ranges from 214 mm to 235 mm, providing the vehicle with excellent off-road performance.This type of procurement echoes similar situations in other countries, such as France, where the selection of military vehicles has sometimes sparked debate. For example, in 2015, the French Ministry of Defense faced criticism after announcing the acquisition of Ford Rangers to replace Peugeot P4s, instead of choosing vehicles offered by French brands such as Renault or Citroën. Similarly, the Gendarmerie faced controversy when it opted for the Seat Leon Cupra to replace the Megane RS within its rapid intervention teams. In both cases, the preference for non-French brands led to protests, with some officials arguing that the military and security forces should prioritize supporting the national industry.These instances demonstrate that decisions regarding military equipment can raise complex issues involving performance, cost, and political or industrial considerations. In Spain's case, the choice of the Peugeot Landtrek, despite its partial Chinese origins, appears to be driven by the need to quickly and efficiently modernize the army’s fleet of off-road vehicles while adhering to strict budgetary constraints.The acquisition of these 4,500 vehicles is part of a broader effort to modernize Spain’s military capabilities, addressing current operational needs while anticipating future challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/spanish-army-confirms-acquisition-of-4-500-peugeot-landtrek-for-non-combat-missions	2024-09-25T00:18:54-07:00

Hezbollah Uses Soviet Tu-143 Drones Converted into Cruise Missiles Amid Growing Conflict with Israel	The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has escalated significantly with Hezbollah’s use of Soviet-era Tu-143 drones, converted into cruise missiles. On September 23, 2024, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) released a video claiming to show an airstrike that occurred several weeks earlier, targeting a house in southern Lebanon containing what they referred to as a 'DR-3 cruise missile' ready for launch. The DR-3 is another designation for the Soviet Tu-143 Reys reconnaissance drone. This conversion marks the first known appearance of these modified drones in Hezbollah’s arsenal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link According to IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the missile was hidden inside a house, and Hezbollah had created a specific opening for its launch (Picture source: X Channel @manniefabian) For months, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been on the rise, driven by a series of border incidents and inflammatory rhetoric from both sides. Hezbollah, which already possesses a large stockpile of missiles and rockets, views the introduction of the converted Tu-143 as a new offensive capability. Originally designed for reconnaissance, this drone has been adapted for long-range strikes, a tactic also used by Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.The IDF used a photo of the Tu-143 to illustrate the missile they claimed to have destroyed before its launch. According to IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the missile was hidden inside a house, and Hezbollah had created a specific opening for its launch. 'The terrorists created a designated opening for the missile launch. Here, you can see how we identified the terrorists preparing the missile for launch,' Hagari explained. The IDF claimed that they precisely struck the missile and its infrastructure, eliminating the threat shortly before it could be fired.The Tu-143 is independent of runways, using rocket assistance for launch from a rail on a trailer or launch vehicle. In its cruise missile form, it has an estimated range of around 200 kilometers and is capable of carrying a 272-kilogram warhead, allowing Hezbollah to target cities as far away as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. However, the accuracy of these converted missiles remains uncertain unless substantial upgrades have been made to their guidance systems.Israel has voiced concerns about Hezbollah’s use of civilian structures to hide and launch weapons, complicating counter-strike efforts and raising humanitarian concerns. The IDF claims to have destroyed additional weapons hidden within civilian homes and buildings in Lebanon. Hezbollah, on the other hand, claims to have an extensive underground network for launching its weapons, including multiple rocket launch systems.The origin of these converted Tu-143 drones is not entirely clear. Russia had previously supplied some of these drones to the Assad regime in Syria, which is also supported by Hezbollah’s key ally, Iran. Additionally, Tehran has provided Moscow with ballistic missiles and drones as part of a growing military relationship between the two nations. It is possible that Hezbollah obtained these drones either via Syria or directly from Iran. In its cruise missile form, the Tu-143 has an estimated range of around 200 kilometers and is capable of carrying a 272-kilogram warhead, allowing Hezbollah to target cities as far away as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Picture source: WikiCommun) This escalation comes in the context of increased tensions following the surprise attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hezbollah launched its most recent campaign of missile, rocket, and drone strikes against Israel the day after, and both sides have been trading fire almost daily since. Israel has conducted heavy bombardments of Lebanon for several days, with some analysts suggesting that a limited invasion might be considered to create a buffer zone, allowing thousands of residents in northern Israel to return to their homes.Recent coordinated explosions targeting thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon have also contributed to the growing tensions. Hezbollah has attributed these explosions to Israel and vowed retaliation. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, has threatened Israel with 'severe retribution and just punishment,' claiming that the retaliation will occur 'where it expects and where it does not.'In response to the escalating violence, the Pentagon announced on Monday that additional U.S. troops would be deployed to the region. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon’s spokesperson, did not provide specific details regarding the number of troops or their mission, citing operational security reasons. This drone was adapted for long-range strikes, a tactic also used in Ukraine by Russia, as shown by the debris found (Picture source: X Channel @COUPSURE ) The extent of Hezbollah’s converted jet drone arsenal remains unknown, as does whether these weapons have already been used. Unlike in Ukraine, no wreckage has yet been found confirming their use in Lebanon. This situation highlights the spread of improvised long-range strike tactics in current conflicts.According to the IDF, Hezbollah’s known arsenal includes the following:Hezbollah possesses the DR-3 missile (Tu-143), which has a range of several hundred kilometers, an explosive warhead weighing between 2 and 3 tons, and a missile weight of 300 kilograms. The group also has short-range attack drones, like the Model 107, which are used for surveillance and attack purposes. These drones have a range of 15-100 kilometers and carry a 1.5-kilogram warhead, capable of striking targets across Israel, particularly critical infrastructure, with the aid of advanced targeting systems.Regarding rockets, Hezbollah has a large stockpile of short-range rockets, with a range of up to 50 kilometers and the ability to carry warheads of up to 100 kilograms. The group also has heavy rockets with a range of up to 15 kilometers, carrying warheads of up to 1,000 kilograms.Finally, Hezbollah possesses long-range rockets capable of penetrating fortified targets, with a range of 50-200 kilometers and warheads weighing between 100 and 500 kilograms. This diverse arsenal represents a serious threat to Israel’s security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/hezbollah-uses-soviet-tu-143-drones-converted-into-cruise-missiles-amid-growing-conflict-with-israel	2024-09-24T06:52:40-07:00	
Escalation of Conflict Between Israel and Hezbollah: Northern Arrows Operation at Heart of Tensions	The conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has reached a new level with the launch of the 'Northern Arrows' operation by the Israeli army on September 23, 2024. As hostilities intensify, this major military operation aims to neutralize the threat posed by Hezbollah on Israel's northern border.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshots from video footage of the strikes conducted by Israel on Lebanon on September 23, 2024 (Picture source: X channel @0Informations) For several months, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been increasing, fueled by a series of border incidents and escalating rhetoric on both sides. Hezbollah, a Shiite political-military organization backed by Iran, has intensified its rocket attacks toward northern Israel in support of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. These actions prompted a strong response from the Israeli army, determined to ensure the security of its citizens and neutralize Hezbollah's offensive capabilities. In recent weeks, exchanges of fire have multiplied. Hezbollah has launched thousands of rockets and drones toward Israeli territory, targeting military installations and civilian areas. Israel, in turn, has conducted targeted airstrikes against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. The situation reached a critical point on September 23, 2024, when the Israeli army initiated the 'Northern Arrows' operation. This operation, announced by Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, aims to significantly weaken Hezbollah's military capabilities. 'The situation requires continuous and intense action on all fronts,' Halevi stated. The Israeli air forces have struck over 1,300 targets in Lebanon, including missile launchers, military buildings, and weapons depots. These strikes have affected southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and, for the first time in years, regions further north such as Mount Lebanon. Image of a Hezbollah rocket allegedly located in a civilian house in Lebanon (Picture source: IDF) The primary objective of the 'Northern Arrows' operation is to destroy Hezbollah's offensive capabilities and secure Israel's northern border. According to Israeli military sources, Hezbollah was preparing a major offensive called 'Conquer the Galilee,' aiming to infiltrate Israeli territory and carry out attacks against civilians. The elimination of senior Hezbollah figures, including Ibrahim Aqil, the alleged architect of this plan, is a key component of this strategy. Israel asserts that it is acting based on precise intelligence to target Hezbollah's military infrastructure while minimizing civilian casualties. Warnings have been sent to civilian populations to evacuate certain areas before the strikes. However, reports indicate difficulties for civilians attempting to leave dangerous zones, with Hezbollah accused of preventing evacuations to use inhabitants as human shields. The operation also seeks to prevent Hezbollah from strengthening its positions by taking advantage of international attention focused on the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah, with its military experience and an arsenal estimated at 150,000 rockets and missiles, represents a threat to Israel's security. Israeli strikes aim to degrade its command and control capabilities and reduce its stockpiles of armaments. In response, Hezbollah has intensified its rocket fire, targeting Israeli northern cities such as Haifa and Kiryat Shmona. Alerts have sounded in several localities, and material damage has been reported. The current escalation raises concerns about a potential expansion of the conflict, with the risk of more direct involvement by Iran and other regional actors. Map showing the various strikes conducted by Israel on Lebanon since September 23, 2024 (Picture source: LiveuaMap) The international community is apprehensive about this volatile situation. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed concern over the escalation of violence and has called for restraint. The United States, an ally of Israel, has announced it is working on 'concrete ideas' to restore calm, while Russia has warned of the risk of regional destabilization. The 'Northern Arrows' operation marks a turning point in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. While Israel had previously favored targeted actions to contain the threat, this large-scale offensive demonstrates its determination to eliminate Hezbollah's offensive capabilities. The extent to which this escalation will continue remains uncertain. A ground invasion of Lebanon by Israel is not ruled out, although such an option carries the risk of a prolonged and costly engagement. Hezbollah faces a dilemma. Despite its arsenal and experience, it is suffering significant losses and sees its capabilities further reduced, especially following last week's explosion of beepers and walkie-talkies. In the short term, there is currently no indication that a de-escalation of the conflict is on the horizon, despite international pressure and the growing risks of destruction to Lebanese infrastructure.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/escalation-of-conflict-between-israel-and-hezbollah-northern-arrows-operation-at-heart-of-tensions	2024-09-24T05:50:52-07:00	
Norwegian shipyards compete for historic Navy frigate contract in 2029 modernization plan	According to information published by Aftenposten on September 23, 2024, for the first time in 60 years, Norway could once again see frigates built domestically. However, at least three foreign shipyards are vying for the opportunity.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Constellation class frigate. (Picture source: Fincantieri Marinette Marine) The Vard Group made their case to Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram (Sp), presenting a model of the Constellation-class frigate, highlighting why Norway should opt for this American design. Vard’s key argument lies in their connection to the American shipyard constructing the same frigates for the U.S. Navy. Both Vard and the U.S. yard share the same Italian parent company, Fincantieri. If Norway’s new frigates are to be built domestically, Vard’s Tomrefjord facility is seen as the most likely location. The defense minister expressed satisfaction with the presentation but offered no promises. The competition is heating up, with 11 countries initially invited to bid, a list that will be narrowed to three or four by winter. The frigate procurement is part of a broader modernization plan, with at least five new warships to be introduced starting in 2029. These vessels are projected to become one of Norway’s largest defense investments, potentially rivaling the F-35 fighter jet program. A single frigate could cost between 7 and 12 billion NOK, with total costs, including helicopters, weapons, and maintenance over several decades, approaching 100 billion NOK. One key requirement is that the new frigates must excel in anti-submarine warfare, equipped with advanced sonar, torpedoes, and space for helicopters. The consensus is clear: this time, Norway must buy an off-the-shelf design already in production to meet tight timelines. The strategic decision on which country to partner with for this project is critical. The new frigates will be procured, operated, and maintained in collaboration with a close ally, one whose strategic interests align with Norway's need to monitor the North Atlantic, home to Russia’s Northern Fleet bases. Among the most likely candidates are the U.S. and the U.K., although France and the Netherlands/Belgium are also in the running. The potential designs include the American Constellation-class, the British Type 26, the French FDI, and the Dutch ASWF.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/norwegian-shipyards-compete-for-historic-navy-frigate-contract-in-2029-modernization-plan	2024-09-24T05:44:18-07:00

US considers sending AGM-154 glide bombs to Ukraine to strike distant Russian positions	On September 20, 2024, information published by 'Politico' indicated that the United States is considering sending the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) called glide bomb to Ukraine as part of a new $375 million military aid package. This advanced precision-guided munition is expected to significantly enhance the operational effectiveness of Ukraine's new fleet of F-16 fighter jets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35 Lightning II Pax River Integrated Test Force from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 23 conducted the first weapons separation test of an AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) from an F-35C Lightning II carrier variant March 23. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The AGM-154 JSOW is a family of low-cost, air-to-ground glide bombs developed by Raytheon Technologies. Designed for standoff engagements, it allows aircraft to release the weapon from a considerable distance away from the target area, thereby minimizing the risk to pilots and aircraft from enemy air defenses. With a range of up to 130 km when launched from high altitude, the JSOW enables strikes without entering heavily defended airspace. Its GPS/INS navigation systems provide high accuracy against both stationary and moving targets. A Glide bomb is a type of precision-guided munition designed to glide towards its target after being released from an aircraft, allowing it to hit distant targets without requiring the plane to fly directly over them. Unlike traditional bombs that fall freely under gravity, Glide bombs are equipped with aerodynamic surfaces and control systems, enabling them to maneuver and extend their range. Some Glide bombs are equipped with GPS or laser guidance systems for enhanced accuracy, and they are often used to minimize risks to pilots by allowing attacks from standoff distances. This weapon can be configured with various warheads, including unitary blast-fragmentation and submunitions, making it effective against a wide range of targets such as armored vehicles, infrastructure, and air defense systems. Advanced versions of the JSOW are equipped with datalink capabilities, allowing for in-flight target updates and retargeting, which enhances mission flexibility. The introduction of the AGM-154 JSOW into Ukraine's arsenal is poised to significantly boost its combat capabilities. The standoff range of the JSOW allows Ukrainian forces to engage high-value targets deep within contested territories without exposing their aircraft to enemy air defenses. This capability is crucial for disrupting supply lines, command and control centers, and other strategic assets held by opposing forces. By enabling attacks from outside the reach of most surface-to-air missiles, the JSOW reduces the risk to pilots and aircraft—a critical factor given the advanced air defense systems deployed in the region. The weapon's advanced guidance systems ensure high accuracy, minimizing collateral damage and increasing the likelihood of mission success. This precision is vital for operations conducted in areas where avoiding civilian casualties is a priority. The JSOW's ability to be reprogrammed in-flight allows pilots to respond dynamically to changing battlefield conditions, making operations more adaptive and effective. Its compatibility with F-16 fighter jets means Ukraine can fully leverage the capabilities of its new aircraft fleet, thereby enhancing overall air combat effectiveness. The potential transfer of AGM-154 JSOWs signifies a deepening military collaboration between the United States and Ukraine. It reflects a strategic effort to equip Ukraine with advanced offensive systems that can serve as a deterrent against aggression. However, this move may also escalate regional tensions, as supplying such advanced weaponry could be perceived by opposing forces as a significant shift in the balance of power, potentially leading to heightened military responses. As of October 2023, the United States has continued to provide substantial military aid to Ukraine in response to Russia's ongoing invasion. This aid includes advanced weaponry such as High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), anti-aircraft systems, armored vehicles, and various types of drones. The U.S. has also supplied significant amounts of ammunition and provided training to Ukrainian forces to enhance their operational effectiveness. In addition to equipment and training, the U.S. government has allocated billions of dollars in financial assistance to support Ukraine's defense efforts. This support is part of a broader international coalition aimed at upholding Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The aid underscores the U.S. commitment to maintaining regional stability and deterring further aggression.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-considers-sending-agm-154-glide-bombs-to-ukraine-to-strike-distant-russian-positions	2024-09-24T03:10:22-07:00

Indonesia to receive its first A400M Atlas transport aircraft from Airbus in 2025	As reported by FlightGlobal on September 19, 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space expects to deliver Indonesia's first of two A400M tactical transport aircraft by late 2025. Ed Horne, senior product advisor for air mobility at Airbus, indicated that Indonesia's versions will be equipped with underwing pods designed for refueling combat aircraft. The second aircraft is scheduled to follow in 2026, shortly after the first.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Indonesia's A400Ms will maintain a clean cargo hold to perform transport duties while still providing air-to-air refueling capabilities using the underwing pods. (Picture source: Airbus) Horne made these remarks on September 19 at the Bali International Air Show 2024 during a media tour of a German Air Force A400M displayed in the show's static park. The aircraft on display is configured for air-to-air refueling and features underwing hose-and-drogue refueling pods for fighters, as well as a centerline hose installed in the turboprop's ramp. This centerline hose can deliver 50% greater fuel flow than the wing-mounted pods and is optimized for refueling larger aircraft, such as other A400Ms. However, the centerline refueling station limits the aircraft's cargo transport capability due to the installation of two large fuel tanks and extensive piping inside the cargo hold. Indonesia's A400Ms will maintain a clean cargo hold to perform transport duties while still providing air-to-air refueling capabilities using the underwing pods. Horne explained that the refueling pods for helicopters look identical to those used for fighters but contain longer hoses to remain clear of a helicopter's rotor disc. Air-to-air refueling has been a significant shortfall for Indonesia's air force. According to Cirium fleets data, its only current dedicated tanker is a Lockheed Martin KC-130B that has been in service since 1961. Given the vast area that Indonesia's air force must protect and its orders for 42 Dassault Aviation Rafale fighters, enhancing aerial refueling capabilities appears to be a priority for Jakarta. Indonesia finalized its order for the two A400Ms in late 2022. At the time of the order, the delivery timeframe was given as 2026. Additionally, Indonesia has expressed interest in the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport, but a firm order has yet to materialize. Despite initial delays and budget overruns, serial production began in January 2011, and as of July 2024, a total of 127 A400Ms have been built. (Picture source: Airbus) The Airbus A400M development began in the 1980s as a collaborative effort among European nations to replace transport aircraft such as the Transall C-160 and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Initially part of the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, the project faced delays due to varying requirements and international politics. After several changes and the withdrawal of partners like Lockheed, the program continued under Airbus Military. Development challenges included engine selection issues, with the Europrop TP400-D6 eventually chosen over the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada offering. The program experienced delays, cost overruns, and technical problems, but participating nations maintained their support, leading to the maiden flight in December 2009 and entry into service in 2013. The Airbus A400M Atlas is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft designed to fill the gap between tactical airlifters like the C-130 Hercules and strategic airlifters like the C-17 Globemaster III. It features a high-wing design with a T-tail empennage and employs fly-by-wire flight controls, including side-stick controllers and a glass cockpit. The aircraft uses four Europrop TP400-D6 engines driving eight-bladed scimitar propellers in a counter-rotating configuration. Over 30% of its structure is made from composite materials, including the wings and tail. The A400M can carry up to 37 metric tons over strategic distances and operate from short, rough airstrips, allowing it to perform various military and humanitarian missions. Production of the A400M is managed by Airbus Defence and Space, with final assembly taking place in Seville, Spain. Major components are produced across Europe and transported to Seville by Airbus Beluga aircraft. Despite initial delays and budget overruns, serial production began in January 2011.

Netherlands Plans to Supply Ukraine with Three Patriot Launchers Very Soon	The Netherlands is set to deliver three launchers of the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine soon. The Dutch government had already sent a radar system as part of this military support. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced this news in an interview with Delfi. 'We have delivered a radar system, and we will soon deliver three launchers. We are also looking to obtain other necessary components to complete the system,' said Brekelmans.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Patriot system is a long-range air defense system designed to operate at all altitudes and in all weather conditions. (Picture source: US DoD) This initiative is part of the project called the 'Patriot Puzzle,' launched by former Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren. According to this plan, the Netherlands, along with other partner countries, will provide different components of the Patriot system so that Ukraine can have a complete and operational air defense system. Brekelmans emphasized that several nations are ready to help Ukraine strengthen its air defense capabilities, though some are facing logistical or technical difficulties that are slowing the delivery of necessary equipment. 'These countries are encountering obstacles that make it difficult to assemble this system. It also depends on the willingness of other nations to disclose information about what they are providing. However, we are not always transparent about this because it is crucial not to inform Russia. Sharing too many operational details could enhance their knowledge, which we want to avoid,' Brekelmans added. At the end of the summer, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba expressed his frustration with the delays in delivering the Patriot systems, calling on Ukraine's international partners to speed up the process. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the military estimates it needs 25 Patriot defense systems to effectively cover the entire Ukrainian territory. The Patriot system is a long-range air defense system designed to operate at all altitudes and in all weather conditions. Developed in the United States, it is currently used by many countries such as Germany, Israel, Japan, Poland, Qatar, Romania, and more recently, Ukraine. Its design relies on missiles capable of targeting and destroying various aerial threats, such as aircraft and ballistic missiles. The missile used by the Patriot system, the PAC-3, weighs around 700 kg and measures approximately 5.2 meters in length. Its range varies from 20 to 35 kilometers, offering extensive coverage against enemy threats. Unlike many other systems, the PAC-3 missile does not use an explosive warhead. Its destruction relies on a 'hit-to-kill' approach, meaning it destroys its targets through the kinetic energy generated by direct impact. This makes it particularly effective against ballistic missiles, where precision and impact force are crucial. The PAC-3 is equipped with a sophisticated guidance system, based on an active radar located in the nose of the missile. This radar allows the missile to autonomously track and engage its targets. Additionally, mid-course updates are provided by the ground-based radar, the AN/MPQ-65, complementing the missile's onboard inertial navigation system. With a maximum speed of Mach 5 (approximately 6,173 km/h), the PAC-3 is capable of responding rapidly to aerial threats. The AN/MPQ-65 radar, in turn, is a key component of the Patriot system, providing critical information on targets and enabling constant monitoring of airspace. In July, the United States announced a new military aid package that included a Patriot system, while President Zelensky confirmed the arrival of a Patriot system from Germany.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/netherlands-plans-to-supply-ukraine-with-three-patriot-launchers-very-soon	2024-09-24T01:27:50-07:00

South Africa's new RG41 GT7 105mm self-propelled howitzer strengthens fire support for infantry units	Denel announced at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) 2024 event (the company's first public exhibition since its recent move to the South African Department of Defence) the integration of its RG41 eight-wheeled combat vehicle with a modified version of the G7 105 mm gun. This combination, which could be referred to as the RG41 GT7, is expected to offer fire support capabilities as a self-propelled artillery system for mechanized or motorized infantry units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 105 mm gun mounted on this vehicle is based on the G7 105 mm LEO towed howitzer but required technical modifications for vehicle mounting, resulting in the Denel GT7 gun. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Business Development Manager Isaac Karelse explained that the RG41 platform originated from Project Hoefyster, where it was intended as Denel's alternative to the Finnish Patria eight-wheeled platform, which eventually became the South African Army's Badger 8x8. At that time, the Patria was among the few eight-wheeled infantry fighting vehicles available. The RG41 was designed, tested, and sent to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for summer trials, where it performed according to expectations. However, changes in the UAE's requirements led to the selection of the RG35 vehicle instead of the RG41. As delays arose in the manufacturing of the Patria/Badger system, Denel proposed the RG41 as a potential option for Project Hoefyster to complement the Badger across various vehicle types. Karelse described this situation as the RG41 becoming a 'future requirement.' The vehicle was advertised for Middle Eastern markets, but the process was paused due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interim, Denel equipped the RG41 with remotely-operated turrets, specifically the Tactical Remote Turret (TRT), tested with both 20 mm and 30 mm cannon variants. During shooting trials at Armscor’s Alkantpan test range with the G6 155 mm self-propelled howitzer and the truck-mounted T5 system, Denel identified the potential to install a 105 mm gun on the RG41. The 105 mm gun is based on the G7 105 mm LEO towed howitzer but required technical modifications for vehicle mounting, resulting in the Denel GT7 gun. The RG41 originated from Project Hoefyster, where it was developed as Denel's alternative to the Finnish Patria eight-wheeled platform. This latter eventually became the South African Army's Badger 8x8, as depicted here in the Badger-MsIV missile carrier variant. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Denel then developed the T7 105 mm turret, which weighs 3,750 kg. Karelse noted that, while the turret is currently manned for testing and trials, plans are in place for it to be unmanned in the future. The RG41 GT7 can seat 11 personnel, including one driver, one vehicle commander, one gunner, one section commander, and seven section crew members. A standard infantry section usually comprises ten personnel, but in a mechanized environment, this number can be adjusted based on the vehicle's role. The vehicle is equipped with a safety belt system featuring a 4-point harness. The protection features of the RG41 include ballistic protection in accordance with STANAG 4569 Level 2, with an option to upgrade to Level 4 or 5. It also provides mine protection meeting STANAG 4569 Level 4A/3B standards, with the possibility of upgrading to Level 4B. The specific level of improvised explosive device (IED) protection has not been disclosed. Constructed with a V-shaped hull to offer landmine protection, the RG41 has a hardened armored 'shell' for the crew's safety. There is a gap between this shell and the external 'armor package,' ranging from 100 mm to 130 mm, which can be further reinforced with add-on armor. In counter-insurgency operations, wire mesh can be added with a gap to shield the armor from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and other projectiles. Karelse emphasized that the design prioritizes crew survivability, allowing the vehicle to protect its occupants even if damaged. Other variants of the RG41 were also developed in the past, such as an infantry fighting vehicle, a command vehicle, an ambulance, a recovery vehicle, and an engineering vehicle (Picture source: Army Recognition). The T7/G7 combination remains in the prototype stage and requires further development. It is projected to serve as a mobile self-propelled artillery system within mechanized battalion settings. The G7 gun has a maximum range of 30 km, and its ammunition is designed to offer effects comparable to standard 155 mm high-explosive shells, effectively delivering similar capabilities within a 105 mm framework. Rheinmetall Denel Munition (RDM) developed the ammunition types, which include high explosive, high explosive pre-formed fragmentation, smoke, illuminating, and other variants. The standard projectile range is 24 km with a boat tail and 30 km with base bleed, while the direct fire range extends from 500 to 2,000 meters. The G7/RG41 system is equipped with an Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) that interfaces with the Gun Control Unit (GCU), allowing for automatic gun laying through hydraulic elevation and traverse drives for rapid target engagement. The ammunition handling system utilizes a positive chain-type rammer controlled from the integrated Loader Control Panel, supporting fully automatic ramming of both the projectile and charge. Manual loading is also possible to ensure redundancy. In terms of specifications, the RG41 GT7 has a length of 7,780 mm, a hull width of 2,800 mm, and a hull height of 2,380 mm. The wheelbase dimensions are 1,693 mm between the first and second axles, 2,257 mm between the second and third axles, and 1,550 mm between the third and fourth axles. Ground clearance is measured at 440 mm, featuring an angle of approach of 64 degrees and an angle of departure of 54 degrees. The vehicle has a curb weight of 18,200 kg and a payload capacity of 9,800 kg to support the new turret, resulting in a total Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) of 28,000 kg. Like many South African-designed vehicles, the RG41 GT7 self-propelled howitzer benefits from a V-shaped armored hull to enhance mine protection. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The vehicle is powered by a Deutz engine, specifically the Model 2015TCD V6, with a displacement of 12.1 liters. The engine's maximum power output is 390 kW at 2,100 rpm, and it generates a maximum torque of 2,130 Nm at 1,300 rpm. The RG41 uses a ZF5HP902 transmission system, featuring a 5-speed configuration with an integral 2-speed drop-down capability. In terms of performance, the RG41 reaches a maximum speed of 100 km/h and can handle a gradeability of up to 70%. The transfer box is manufactured by Denel, with the gear ratio categorized under the Type 17,000 series. The steering system is a twin-steer, power-assisted, fully-integral model. The wheel heads are made by AxleTech, and the suspension system is independent, using hydro-pneumatic struts with hydraulic shock absorbers. The vehicle's braking system includes pneumatic disc brakes with ABS for the main brakes, while the parking brake is activated with air release disc brakes on all four rear wheels. The RG41 uses road wheels and tires with a 10.00R20 aluminum rim type, equipped with 16.00R20 Michelin XZL tires. Additionally, the vehicle is fitted with an RFI system, offering a 100 km range when traveling at a speed of 50 km/h.

Russia gains Atlantic Port access through military deal with São Tomé and Príncipe	According to information published by Russian sources on September 23, 2024, Russia has moved to expand its military cooperation with São Tomé and Príncipe, opening potential new access points for the Russian Navy in the Atlantic.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Slava-class cruiser Marshal Ustinov in South Africa. (Picture source: Tass) The Russian government submitted an agreement for ratification by the State Duma that establishes military cooperation between Russia and the island nation. This agreement, which was signed in April 2024, has already been approved by the legal commission. The cooperation framework includes intelligence sharing and collaboration in the military sphere, as well as granting Russian naval vessels access to São Tomé and Príncipe’s ports for resupply and rest. This development is seen as strategically valuable given the limited number of ports currently available to Russian vessels globally. Comments Russia’s defense relationships with African nations have expanded significantly in recent years, reflecting a mix of security cooperation, economic interests, and geopolitical strategy. These ties are often cemented through arms deals, military training, and the provision of security forces, notably through private military contractors (PMCs) like Wagner Group. Russia has signed military cooperation agreements with 43 African countries, offering a broad range of services from personnel training to the supply of military equipment. This cooperation has increased notably in countries facing instability, coups, or Western disengagement, such as Mali, Central African Republic (CAR), and Sudan. One key feature of Russia’s approach has been its avoidance of imposing political conditions, making it an appealing partner for African regimes that prioritize regime security over democratic reforms. This is in contrast to Western powers that often tie military support to governance and human rights conditions. For example, Russia has established a strong presence in CAR, where Wagner Group supports the government in exchange for access to lucrative natural resources, including gold and diamonds. Similarly, in Mali and Niger, recent coups have led to a shift away from France and the West, with these nations now leaning toward Russian military support. Russia’s strategy in Africa also seeks to challenge Western influence by establishing strategic footholds, including potential naval bases and expanding its reach in critical maritime regions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-gains-atlantic-port-access-through-military-deal-with-sao-tome-and-principe	2024-09-24T00:38:01-07:00

Kongsberg secures contract to upgrade Norway's Ula-class submarines	According to information published by Kongsberg on September 23, 2024, Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace has signed a new agreement with the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA) to upgrade the Ula-class submarines. The contract, valued at approximately NOK 436 million, covers both hardware and software upgrades to the submarines' combat systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Norwegian Navy's Ula-class submarine. (Picture source: Kongsberg) These upgrades are intended to maintain the Ula-class submarines' effectiveness until Norway introduces its next generation of submarines, the Type 212CD, expected to enter service in the 2030s. Kongsberg, having originally supplied the Ula-class combat systems and previously undertaken modernization efforts, will once again enhance the submarines' capabilities. Kongsberg is also responsible for supplying the combat systems for the upcoming 212CD submarines, which will be delivered to both Norway and Germany in the future. Technical comparison The Type 212CD and Ula-class submarines represent distinct phases in diesel-electric submarine technology. The Ula-class, commissioned between 1989 and 1992, was designed for coastal defense, leveraging its small size for stealth in shallow waters. However, it lacks some modern features found in newer submarines, such as air-independent propulsion (AIP), which limits its ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing to recharge. In contrast, the Type 212CD, developed jointly by Germany and Norway, integrates AIP, allowing it to stay submerged for significantly longer, enhancing its stealth by avoiding the need to 'snort' at periscope depth. Its larger size and enhanced hydrodynamics further increase its range and versatility, allowing for operations in both coastal and deep-water environments. While the Ula-class submarines remain effective due to regular upgrades, such as new sonar and navigation systems, they lack the strike capabilities of the Type 212CD. The newer design can deploy advanced weapons like the Naval Strike Missile, enabling engagements with both surface ships and land targets, a feature absent in the Ula-class. The Type 212CD also benefits from significant improvements in signature management, with the use of non-magnetic steel and advanced acoustic quieting technologies, making it harder to detect compared to the Ula-class.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/kongsberg-secures-contract-to-upgrade-norways-ula-class-submarines	2024-09-23T01:25:29-07:00

After Acquiring M1A2 SEPv3, Australia Could Transfer Its M1A1 Abrams Tanks to Ukraine	According to information reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, in collaboration with the Biden administration, the Australian government is working on a plan to send 59 M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. As the war in Ukraine continues, where Ukrainian forces struggle to compensate for material losses against a Russian army capable of quickly replacing its tanks through a robust defense industry, the question of tank supply has become critical. With losses of Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams Situational Awareness (SA) tanks, provided by the United States in September 2023, mounting, the possibility of reinforcements from other countries may soon materialize.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Australian Army M1A1 Abrams tank firing during Exercise Gauntlet Strike in Puckapunyal. (Picture source: Australian Army) The Russian army, supported by its defense industry, has recently received an additional batch of T-90M Proryv tanks, further strengthening its ability to maintain a steady flow of heavy equipment to the front lines. Conversely, Ukraine, dependent on military aid from its Western partners, has seen its number of M1A1 Abrams tanks decrease by half, with no additional deliveries from the U.S. scheduled in the near term.The M1A1 Abrams is an improved version of the U.S.-designed M1 Abrams main battle tank. First produced in 1985, this tank features several upgrades over the initial version, including a new suspension system, transmission modifications, and enhanced armor protection. Its main armament is a 120mm M256 smoothbore cannon, capable of firing kinetic energy penetrator rounds with an effective range of over 3,500 meters. The tank is also equipped with two 7.62mm coaxial machine guns and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun, providing significant firepower.The M1A1 uses Chobham composite armor, supplemented with depleted uranium plates, offering effective protection against kinetic and chemical energy rounds.

(Picture source: Ukrainian Army) Another country that could help offset Ukraine's losses is Australia. In January 2022, Canberra confirmed the acquisition of 75 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks for approximately $2.5 billion to replace the 59 M1A1 Abrams tanks in service with the Australian Army. These tanks, which had not seen extensive use, were retired in July 2024 and placed in reserve as the first M1A2 SEPv3 deliveries were imminent. As of late September 2024, Ukraine has received all 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks that were promised by the United States earlier in the year. These deliveries were part of a U.S. pledge made in January 2023 to supply Ukraine with modern tanks to strengthen its defense against Russian forces. However, reports suggest that Ukraine has already lost at least half of these tanks in the ongoing conflict.Kiev's interest in these decommissioned tanks is not new, but the Australian government had previously declined the request, citing the high cost of such a transfer. This same argument was used to justify the refusal to send a fleet of MRH-90 'Taipan' helicopters, also retired from Australian service to Ukraine.However, Australia's Defense Minister, Richard Marles, appears to have reconsidered the issue and is now considering supplying the tanks to Kyiv, subject to U.S. defense export regulations.If this transaction goes through, it could provide significant support to the Ukrainian military, which is struggling against Russia's material strength. Ongoing discussions between Canberra and Washington underscore the strategic importance of Ukraine in maintaining the balance of power in Eastern Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/after-acquiring-m1a2-sepv3-australia-could-transfer-its-m1a1-abrams-tanks-to-ukraine	2024-09-23T00:30:22-07:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The L55 smoothbore gun, known for its enhanced range and accuracy, fired a DM63 APFSDS (Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) round against the Russian T-72B3 tank. The results were devastating. The round penetrated the tank’s glacis plate—its heavily armored front slope—punched through the crew compartment, tore through the engine block, and exited the rear of the vehicle. This level of penetration demonstrates the lethality of the Challenger 3’s armament against modern armor, especially against Russian tanks, which are frequently encountered in conflict zones. The L55 gun is a 120mm smoothbore cannon developed by German Company Rheinmetall as an upgraded version of the L44, designed primarily for main battle tanks like the Leopard 2A6. It features a longer barrel compared to its predecessor, which improves muzzle velocity and enhances the gun's overall accuracy, range, and armor-piercing capability. This increased length allows the L55 to fire more advanced and powerful kinetic energy rounds, making it more effective against modern armored threats. Initially introduced to equip the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent variants, the L55 has been adopted by several NATO countries. Its improved performance allows tanks to engage targets at greater distances with higher precision and increased penetration power, making it a crucial advancement in tank armament, particularly against heavily armored opponents.The DM63 APFSDS (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) is a modern kinetic energy tank round developed by Rheinmetall for 120mm smoothbore guns, such as those found on the Leopard 2 and other NATO tanks. It is designed to penetrate advanced armor by using a long, dense tungsten penetrator that discards its outer sabot upon firing, allowing the dart-like core to maintain speed and accuracy. The DM63 features a temperature-independent propellant, ensuring consistent performance in varying climates, and is optimized for use with both the L44 and L55 guns, offering enhanced penetration power against modern armored threats. The T-72B3 tank is a modernized version of the Soviet-era T-72 MBT (Main Battle Tank), designed to enhance its capabilities and keep it relevant on the modern battlefield. The tank has seen extensive use in Ukraine, where it is one of the most common armored vehicles employed by Russian forces. Its durability, ease of production, and various upgrades have made it a staple in Russia's armored fleet. The armor on the T-72B3 is a combination of composite and reactive technologies, intended to provide protection against a wide range of modern anti-tank weapons. The base armor of the T-72B3 is composed of composite materials, which combine layers of steel with non-metallic substances, such as ceramics. This setup improves the tank’s resistance to kinetic energy penetrators, such as armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, as well as high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads, which rely on explosive force to punch through armor. In addition to the composite armor, the T-72B3 is equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA) blocks, typically the Kontakt-5 system. These ERA blocks are placed on the tank's turret and hull and work by detonating upon impact, disrupting the penetrating jet or projectile from a HEAT round or significantly reducing the effectiveness of kinetic energy rounds. The combination of ERA and composite armor gives the T-72B3 considerable protection against the most common threats on the battlefield, although it is still vulnerable to modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and advanced APFSDS rounds. Despite these upgrades, the T-72B3's armor is not on par with the latest Western tanks, such as the Challenger 3 or the M1A2 Abrams, which feature more advanced composite armor arrays and reactive systems. In tests like the one conducted by Rheinmetall, the Challenger 3's 120 mm L55 cannon with the DM63 APFSDS round was able to penetrate the T-72B3's highlighting the vulnerabilities of the T-72B3 when facing cutting-edge Western armor-piercing technology. German Company Rheinmetall’s demonstration underscores the strategic advantage the Challenger 3 will bring to the British Army, offering enhanced firepower, mobility, and survivability. The tank is part of the UK's broader effort to modernize its armored forces, ensuring they remain a formidable force on the battlefield. This live-fire test not only highlights the effectiveness of modern Western tank technology against Russian designs but also provides a clear signal of the Challenger 3’s battlefield dominance in future conflicts. With this demonstration, the Challenger 3 is poised to become one of the most powerful tanks in NATO’s arsenal.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-rheinmetall-demonstrates-challenger-3-tanks-firepower-against-russian-t-72b3-in-live-fire-test	2024-09-22T05:37:24-07:00

This year, over 2,500 U.S. service members participated, nearly doubling the number of partner nation forces involved. The exercise now includes eight fully participating nations—Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand—not counting the U.S. and Indonesia. Additionally, twelve other nations sent observers who participated in a staff exercise.New to this year's Super Garuda Shield was the introduction of U.S. Air Force assets such as C-130 aircraft, and the deployment of a Combat Aviation Brigade from the 25th Infantry Division, equipped with CH-47F Chinook helicopters. These resources contributed to the formation of a fully combined Aviation Task Force, which played a critical role in pushing the logistics tail throughout the Indonesian archipelago.

The introduction of the U.S. Army’s Integrated Tactical Network and additional mission command nodes provided a clearer operational picture for all participants.Participants also tested logistics capabilities, over-the-horizon communication systems, and the ability to integrate and synchronize assets across multiple domains. In Java, a joint strike exercise saw the U.S. Army deploying its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), alongside U.S. Marine Corps attack aviation, F-16 fighter jets from partner nations, and other missile systems. This allowed forces to evaluate sensor-to-shooter capabilities across air, land, and sea platforms in targeting operations.Amphibious operations were also highlighted during the exercise. The U.S. Marine Corps, in conjunction with Indonesian, Japanese, and Singaporean forces, conducted an amphibious assault using three platforms, including an assault craft from Singapore and the amphibious transport dock USS Green Bay. Long-range fires and reconnaissance were coordinated to set the conditions for the beachhead assault, followed by an air assault operation using the Marine Corps V-22 Osprey aircraft to insert ground forces, which were later extracted as part of the exercise.In preparation for the exercise's final phase, the U.S. Army conducted a combined arms live-fire operation, integrating ground maneuvers with partner forces in a complex scenario. This exercise was part of the U.S. Army’s broader Operation Pathways initiative, which has expanded significantly across the Indo-Pacific in recent years. Operation Pathways is designed to strengthen relationships with regional allies and ensure the ability to conduct complex joint operations in the event of conflict or other contingencies.Brig. Gen. Williams highlighted that exercises like Super Garuda Shield build crucial readiness and interoperability between allied forces, reinforcing trust among partners and ensuring preparedness for any situation. 'It really just provides capable, ready land forces that allow us to be positioned throughout the Indo-Pacific. It bolsters our allies and partners with that trust, and it really ensures we and Indonesia are prepared for any contingency or conflict or disaster that comes along,' Williams concluded.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/super-garuda-shield-a-unique-us-airborne-assault-to-strengthen-operational-capabilities-in-indonesia	2024-09-20T04:40:43-07:00

(Picture source: Indian MoD) The carrier is now part of a carrier battle group led by INS Vikramaditya, India's other flagship aircraft carrier. This battle group has begun multi-domain exercises in the Arabian Sea, showcasing dual-carrier operations. INS Vikrant Constructed by Cochin Shipyard Limited, Vikrant is the largest warship ever built in India, weighing approximately 45,000 tonnes and measuring around 262 meters in length. The ship's name pays tribute to its predecessor, the original INS Vikrant, which served with distinction during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. The development and commissioning of INS Vikrant mark a pivotal shift in India's maritime strategy. It plays a critical role in enhancing India's blue-water naval capabilities, allowing for extended power projection in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and beyond. The carrier can house a total of 30 aircraft, including MiG-29K fighter jets and various helicopters like Kamov-31, MH-60R, and the indigenous Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH). The carrier's layout includes a ski-jump-assisted Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) system, allowing the jets to launch effectively from its deck. This advanced system provides enhanced operational capabilities for both offensive and defensive naval air operations. INS Vikrant features technologies, many of which are of Indian origin. It is equipped with advanced radar systems, modern air defense mechanisms such as Barak-8 surface-to-air missiles, and a vast array of electronic warfare suites. The vessel is designed to operate in various tactical roles, including sea control, power projection, and humanitarian missions. With a crew capacity of about 1,600 personnel, including both officers and sailors, Vikrant operates at a speed of up to 28 knots, with a range extending over 7,500 nautical miles. In terms of significance, INS Vikrant is more than just a military asset. It symbolizes India's growing defense-industrial base, signifying a shift from dependency on foreign technologies to indigenous development. This aligns with the broader 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, promoting self-reliance in various industrial sectors. The ship's construction saw the involvement of more than 500 Indian companies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indigenous-aircraft-carrier-ins-vikrant-inducted-into-indian-navys-western-fleet	2024-09-20T03:48:19-07:00
