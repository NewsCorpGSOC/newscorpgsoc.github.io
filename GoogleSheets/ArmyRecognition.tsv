We examine the contributing factors to this incident and explore its implications for the future of joint military operations and the integration of defense systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet, similar to the aircraft involved in the recent friendly fire incident over the Red Sea. This multirole fighter jet, integral to U.S. naval operations, was accidentally shot down by a missile launched from the USS Gettysburg Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser, highlighting the risks of friendly fire in modern, high-tech military operations. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet, which was part of a routine operation involving multiple U.S. naval and aerial assets, was mistakenly targeted by the warship's defense systems. The missile—likely an RIM-66 Standard Missile 2 (SM-2), a medium-to-long-range surface-to-air missile—was launched from the Gettysburg, leading to the destruction of the Super Hornet. This incident is being described as a case of 'friendly fire' and raises serious concerns about the risks associated with such incidents in modern, complex military operations, where advanced technologies and integrated systems are meant to prevent such accidents. The tragic downing of the F/A-18 Super Hornet underscores the persistent challenges in contemporary warfare, where even the most sophisticated military assets—such as the F/A-18 and the USS Gettysburg—can become entangled in operational errors, miscommunications, or technical malfunctions. The Gettysburg, equipped with cutting-edge systems like the Aegis Combat System and the RIM-66 SM-2, is a key part of the U.S. Navy’s fleet, capable of engaging air threats with high precision. However, the incident highlights how even these advanced systems, which are designed to protect against enemy missiles and aircraft, can be susceptible to misidentification and errors, particularly in high-pressure, fast-moving combat situations. The incident occurred in the Red Sea, a region of strategic importance to U.S. military operations, where the complex environment of joint and coalition operations heightens the risk of misidentification. In such operations, where multiple assets from various branches of the military and allied forces are working in close proximity, the chance for operational confusion and mistakes increases. Despite the technological sophistication of modern weapons systems, the tragic event involving the Gettysburg and the Super Hornet serves as a stark reminder that friendly fire remains a constant threat in today’s fast-paced, multi-domain military engagements. The USS Gettysburg, a Ticonderoga-class cruiser, carries the RIM-66 Standard Missile 2, which is primarily used for air defense against a wide range of targets, including aircraft and incoming missiles. The SM-2 has a solid reputation for its ability to intercept high-speed, high-altitude targets, providing ships like the Gettysburg with significant defensive capabilities. However, in the case of the Red Sea incident, the missile may have been fired in response to a misidentification of the Super Hornet, possibly triggered by malfunctioning identification systems, a breakdown in communication, or the complexities of targeting algorithms. The Super Hornet, a highly advanced multirole fighter jet, is equipped with sophisticated avionics, radar, and identification systems designed to avoid such accidents. However, the integration of these systems with the ship’s defense platforms is a delicate operation, and when misidentification occurs—whether due to human error, technical malfunction, or electronic interference—the consequences can be catastrophic. The use of Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) technology is critical in preventing friendly fire incidents, but as seen in this case, these systems are not infallible. Electronic warfare (EW) tactics from adversaries or system malfunctions can disrupt IFF signals, complicating the identification process. This incident also highlights the risks inherent in joint and coalition operations, where multiple military forces, each with their own operational procedures and systems, are working together. Coordination between different branches of the U.S. military—such as the Navy and Air Force—is crucial in preventing such tragic errors. In regions like the Red Sea, where U.S. and allied forces often operate together to counter a range of threats, the complexities of joint operations are exacerbated by rapid decision-making and the challenges of coordinating between various advanced technologies. In this case, the USS Gettysburg was operating in a high-tempo environment, with multiple assets in the air and on the sea, making it more difficult to ensure accurate identification and targeting. Despite the advancements in automation and technology, the human element remains a key factor in preventing friendly fire. High-stress environments, where quick decisions are needed, can lead to mistakes, particularly when military personnel are under pressure to respond swiftly to perceived threats. Even the most advanced systems—such as the Aegis Combat System on the Gettysburg—are only as effective as the operators who manage them. In moments of intense stress, misjudgments can occur, and mistakes that would otherwise be avoidable can have tragic consequences. As the F/A-18 incident demonstrates, even in an era of high-tech warfare, the risks of friendly fire remain present. The increasing reliance on automated systems and integrated technologies does not fully eliminate the potential for operational errors or miscommunication. As military forces around the world continue to evolve and rely more on advanced technology, the challenge of minimizing friendly fire incidents will persist. The downing of the F/A-18 Super Hornet by the USS Gettysburg serves as a powerful reminder of the vulnerabilities that still exist in modern military operations, despite the advent of sophisticated weaponry and defense systems. It highlights the need for continued training, robust communication protocols, and better integration of technology across military branches and allied forces. In order to prevent such accidents in the future, military leaders must focus on improving the coordination between air and naval forces, enhancing the reliability of identification systems like IFF, and ensuring that both human judgment and technological tools are aligned to reduce the chances of misidentification. The incident in the Red Sea will likely prompt a reevaluation of current safety systems, operational procedures, and the effectiveness of training programs for personnel involved in joint operations. While modern technology offers significant advantages, it is clear that the integration of systems, the human element, and the speed of modern combat all play pivotal roles in determining the success or failure of military operations. The downing of the F/A-18 Super Hornet is a tragic reminder that, in modern warfare, even the most advanced technology cannot fully eliminate the risks of friendly fire.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/analysis-of-friendly-fire-in-todays-military-f-a-18-fighter-jet-incident-and-the-limits-of-modern-technology	2024-12-22T02:12:51-08:00

(Picture source: Algerian MoD) The Tartus Naval Base, Russia’s only permanent military facility in the Mediterranean, has been a key operational hub since its establishment during the Cold War. However, in early December 2024, Russia evacuated the base under mounting regional instability. The move, confirmed through satellite imagery showing the withdrawal of Russian warships and support vessels, represents a major reconfiguration of Russia's Mediterranean strategy. Local sources suggest deteriorating security conditions, coupled with logistical challenges and rising costs, forced Moscow’s hand. The departure comes as a significant blow to Russia’s ability to project power in the Mediterranean, leaving it scrambling to reorganize its naval presence. The docking of the Yelnya in Algiers offers insight into Moscow’s recalibrated approach. The fuel tanker, vital for resupplying naval operations, is en route to an undisclosed location, likely to support alternative deployments following the loss of Tartus. Algeria, a steadfast Russian ally, has become a critical logistical partner, providing Moscow with access to its ports and military infrastructure. High-level discussions during the Yelnya’s stopover are expected to focus on deepening bilateral military ties and exploring ways for Algeria to facilitate Russian naval operations. This partnership reflects Algeria’s broader strategy of maintaining close ties with Moscow while asserting itself as a regional power broker. Reports indicate that Russia is negotiating with Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar to establish a new naval foothold in Libya, potentially in Tobruk or Benghazi. This move would allow Russia to maintain its Mediterranean presence while leveraging the fragmented political situation in Libya. However, such a relocation risks exacerbating tensions with NATO, particularly given the proximity of these ports to key European maritime routes. The Russian withdrawal from Tartus and potential establishment of a presence in Libya mark a significant shift in Mediterranean geopolitics. NATO has already increased its naval activities in response to the evolving security landscape, while Russia's repositioning signals its intent to adapt to changing realities rather than cede influence in the region. For Algeria, the Yelnya’s visit underscores its growing importance as a strategic partner for Moscow. Algeria’s access to the Mediterranean and its robust military infrastructure make it an ideal ally for Russia as it seeks to mitigate the impact of losing Tartus. However, this partnership could draw increased scrutiny from Western nations, potentially impacting Algeria’s diplomatic balancing act.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-tanker-yelnya-docks-in-algeria-following-strategic-withdrawal-from-tartus-naval-base	2024-12-20T03:56:59-08:00

This strike, aimed at showing solidarity with Gaza amidst escalating regional tensions, marks a significant escalation in Yemen's role in the broader Middle Eastern conflict.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Propaganda footage released by Yemen showcases the launch of the advanced 'Palestine 2' hypersonic missile. (Picture source: Yemen armed forces) The 'Palestine 2' hypersonic missile represents a technological milestone for Yemen’s military. Capable of speeds up to Mach 16 and a range of 2,150 kilometers, the missile utilizes a two-stage solid fuel system, making it highly efficient and reliable. Enhanced with advanced stealth technology and exceptional maneuverability, it poses a direct challenge to even the most advanced air defense systems, such as Israel’s Iron Dome. Yemen’s deployment of this weapon underscores its commitment to supporting the Palestinian cause, while highlighting its increasing alignment with Iran’s regional strategy. Yemen’s involvement in the conflict against Israel is not limited to symbolic gestures but now extends to active military engagement. By launching the 'Palestine 2' missile in support of Gaza, Yemen has positioned itself as a vital member of the regional resistance front. This alliance, supported by Iranian expertise and resources, includes actors such as Hamas and Hezbollah, all of whom share a common goal of challenging Israel’s dominance in the region. Yemen’s ability to deploy such advanced weaponry not only signals its growing military capabilities but also intensifies the pressure on Israel, forcing it to contend with threats from multiple directions. For Israel, the arrival of hypersonic missile technology in the region represents a grave threat. Israel’s advanced missile defense systems—Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow—are designed to counter conventional missile threats. However, the unique characteristics of hypersonic missiles, including their extreme speed and ability to maneuver unpredictably, significantly reduce the effectiveness of these defenses. The 'Palestine 2' missile’s capacity to evade interception makes critical infrastructure and population centers like Tel Aviv particularly vulnerable. The psychological impact of this new threat cannot be overstated. Israel’s reputation for maintaining an impenetrable defense network has been a cornerstone of its security doctrine. Yemen's successful deployment of hypersonic technology undermines this perception, potentially eroding public confidence and emboldening adversaries. Furthermore, the threat of coordinated attacks involving Yemen, Hamas, and Hezbollah stretches Israel’s military resources, increasing the likelihood of defensive oversaturation and failure to address all threats effectively. The risks extend far beyond Israel’s borders. The 'Palestine 2' missile also introduces significant challenges for the United States and its allies, particularly naval forces operating in the region. Hypersonic missiles are a game-changer for maritime warfare, capable of targeting large and mobile assets such as aircraft carriers, destroyers, and amphibious ships. Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons combine extreme speed with unpredictable flight paths, rendering existing ship-based defenses, such as the Aegis Combat System, less effective. The potential for Yemen to target U.S. vessels not only threatens military operations but also undermines the perception of American dominance in the region. In addition to naval assets, Yemen’s hypersonic capabilities threaten key maritime chokepoints, including the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden. These waterways are critical for global commerce and military logistics. A strike or even the credible threat of disruption in these areas could have catastrophic economic consequences, affecting trade routes and energy supplies worldwide. U.S. allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are also at significant risk. Their naval forces and offshore energy infrastructure remain particularly vulnerable, given their relatively limited defensive capabilities compared to those of the U.S. Navy. On a broader scale, the emergence of hypersonic missile technology in Yemen reshapes the balance of power in the Middle East. Hypersonic missiles combine speed, precision, and maneuverability, making them extremely difficult to counter. Their deployment undermines traditional deterrence frameworks, heightens the risk of miscalculation, and complicates military planning for nations dependent on conventional defense systems. The proliferation of such technology to smaller states and non-state actors like Yemen, often through Iranian support, accelerates the destabilization of an already volatile region. Yemen’s deployment of 'Palestine 2' missile underscores its commitment to the Palestinian cause and its role in the broader anti-Israel alliance. Its use of advanced technology highlights a growing willingness to engage directly in regional conflicts, challenging Israel and its allies both strategically and militarily. For the United States and its partners, this development necessitates urgent investment in next-generation defensive technologies, such as directed-energy weapons, enhanced early-warning systems, and hypersonic interception capabilities. As tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate, the strategic, economic, and military implications of Yemen’s actions are profound. By introducing hypersonic missiles into the theater, Yemen has reshaped the contours of conflict, setting a precedent that will likely influence regional and global security strategies for years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-yemen-targets-israel-with-palestine-2-hypersonic-missile-posing-new-threats-for-us-and-allies	2024-12-18T02:00:13-08:00

Bulgaria's Naval Modernization: Second Patrol Vessel Successfully Launched	According to information published by MTG Dolphin on December 13, 2024, the second Multipurpose Modular Patrol Vessel (MMPV) for the Bulgarian Navy was successfully launched at the MTG Dolphin Shipyard in Varna.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launching ceremony of the second Bulgarian Navy's Multipurpose modular patrol vessel or MMPV. (Picture source: MTG Dolphin Shipyard) The MMPVs, designed for versatility and multi-role operations, are being constructed at MTG Dolphin Shipyard under a contract with the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense. The project is carried out in cooperation with NVL Group (formerly known as Lürssen Defence), a renowned German shipbuilder specializing in naval vessels. The Multipurpose Modular Patrol Vessels are intended to perform a variety of missions, including maritime surveillance, search and rescue (SAR), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), and environmental monitoring. The first MMPV was launched earlier this year, marking the beginning of the new generation of patrol vessels for Bulgaria. With the successful launch of the second vessel, the Bulgarian Navy is on track to further enhance its naval capabilities and operational readiness in the Black Sea region, a strategically important area for both national and NATO interests. The MMPVs are expected to feature a displacement of approximately 2,300 tons, a length of around 90 meters, and a speed exceeding 21 knots. The vessels will accommodate 50-60 personnel and be equipped with modular weapons systems for anti-surface and anti-air defense, as well as advanced radar and surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness. They will also support mission-specific equipment, including unmanned systems and auxiliary boats for interception, rescue, or inspection operations. Black Sea The Black Sea remains a vital and contested maritime domain, with the navies of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia all navigating evolving challenges and roles in the region. Russia's Black Sea Fleet, once dominant, has faced severe disruptions. Ukrainian attacks, particularly with drones and long-range missiles, have significantly reduced Russia’s operational freedom. The loss of the Moskva cruiser and repeated strikes on Sevastopol have forced Russia to reposition much of its fleet to Novorossiysk and further into the Sea of Azov. While it retains submarines and missile-capable corvettes, Russia’s ability to project power in the Black Sea has been hampered, forcing it into a more defensive posture. The Ukrainian Navy, though diminished in conventional strength, has revolutionized naval warfare in the Black Sea. With innovative use of unmanned surface vessels and domestically produced Neptune missiles, Ukraine has inflicted disproportionate damage. This asymmetric strategy has not only targeted major Russian vessels but has also disrupted supply lines to Crimea, diminishing Russia's naval control. Turkey, as the most significant naval power in the Black Sea, carefully manages its position. Its navy, which operates advanced frigates, corvettes, and submarines, focuses on safeguarding Turkish interests while balancing its geopolitical relationships. Turkey’s strict enforcement of the Montreux Convention limits external naval intervention in the Black Sea, ensuring it remains a regional actor with considerable influence. Romania’s naval forces are modest but active. While relying on aging Type 22 frigates and smaller patrol vessels, Romania has increasingly focused on modernization programs to enhance its capabilities. This includes upgrading its fleet for better coastal defense and mine-clearance operations, vital for maintaining the safety of Black Sea shipping lanes. Georgia does not maintain a formal navy. Its Coast Guard remains responsible for maritime security, focusing on territorial water patrols and countering smuggling. Heavily reliant on external support, Georgia continues to upgrade its patrol capabilities through assistance programs.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/bulgarias-naval-modernization-second-patrol-vessel-successfully-launched	2024-12-17T01:43:55-08:00

Argentine Prepares To Field First 10 VC TAM 2C-A2 Main Battle Tanks	On 20 December 2024, the President of Argentine, Javier Milei, will visit the facilities of the Dirección de Arsenales in Boulogne to preside over the ceremony marking the delivery of the first 10 VC TAM 2C-A2 main battle tanks to the Argentine Army. However, the announced number of tanks raises questions, as not all units will be fully operational due to various delays and issues encountered in the modernization program. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The VC TAM 2C-A2 project is seen as a key element in the modernisation of the Argentine army's armoured capabilities. (Picture source: Social Media) The VC TAM 2C-A2 project, considered a key element in modernizing the armored capabilities of the Argentine Army, is facing financial and logistical difficulties that are slowing its execution. One of the main challenges is the shortage of critical spare parts for the chassis of the selected tanks, which has hindered the completion of the planned units. This issue also extends to other essential supplies needed for the advancement of the program. According to sources consulted, concerns have been expressed regarding the lack of released financial guarantees for various suppliers. Several sectors have pointed out that difficulties related to these guarantees are causing additional delays and significant financial costs. This situation is also reflected in the shortage of spare parts and critical components, the delivery of which depends on contracts currently undergoing renegotiations with international suppliers, including key players such as the Israeli company Elbit Systems. Efforts are currently underway to amend the contract to include ammunition and spare parts, although the process is progressing slowly. Argentine faces several potential threats in its region, both military and economic. Among the major concerns is the ongoing dispute with the United Kingdom over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, a conflict that has persisted since the 1982 war and could still lead to tensions. Additionally, instability in neighboring countries, particularly in Venezuela and Bolivia, could have repercussions for regional security. The growing activities of transnational criminal groups, including drug trafficking and terrorism, also pose a threat to domestic stability. Finally, the strengthening of military capabilities by other South American nations, coupled with defense agreements with extra-regional powers like the United States or China, raises concerns about the strategic balance in the region. One of the most criticized aspects of the VC TAM 2C-A2 program is the frequency with which the systems are presented at ceremonial events. While these events aim to showcase progress and maintain visibility of the program, they disrupt modernization efforts due to the shortage of personnel assigned. As a result, this exacerbates the delays in the program and reduces the number of fully operational systems. The financial difficulties related to the release of guarantees have had a significant impact on both suppliers and the program itself. As highlighted in a previous article by Zona Militar, these debts are creating a bottleneck in the development of military capabilities and raising concerns about the financial management of the Argentine Armed Forces. Despite these challenges, the VC TAM 2C-A2 program remains a central component of the Argentine Army's modernization efforts. However, the lack of significant progress highlights the need for a reassessment to ensure the program’s continuity and adherence to reasonable timelines. Ceremonial events, such as the one scheduled for Friday, reinforce the narrative of progress in the public eye but also highlight the structural limitations of the program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/argentine-prepares-for-integration-of-first-10-vc-tam-2c-a2-main-battle-tanks	2024-12-17T01:24:49-08:00

15th Khordad Air Defense Systems: Iran’s Response to Growing US-Israel Strike Threats	According to information published by Russian sources on December 15, 2024, Iran has begun deploying its 15th Khordad air defense systems near critical nuclear facilities, a move aimed at countering escalating threats from the United States and Israel. The latest reports confirm the presence of these systems around the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear site in Natanz, a key location in Iran’s uranium enrichment efforts situated in Isfahan Province.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Iran fortifies its nuclear facilities with advanced 15th Khordad air defense systems, signaling preparedness against potential U.S. and Israeli strikes. (Picture source: Defa Press) The Natanz facility, one of Iran’s key nuclear sites, has long been under international scrutiny due to allegations by the U.S. and Israel that it plays a central role in Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Both nations claim that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities, a charge Tehran vehemently denies, asserting its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Despite these denials, Israel and the U.S. have reiterated their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, with Israel in particular warning of preemptive military action if diplomatic efforts fail. The 15th Khordad air defense system, introduced in 2019, represents a significant leap in Iran’s ability to defend its airspace. As a domestically designed and manufactured platform, it symbolizes Iran’s push for self-reliance in military technology, especially under the weight of international sanctions that limit its access to foreign arms. This advanced system is capable of detecting and engaging a wide range of aerial threats, including fighter jets, drones, and stealth aircraft. It can identify targets at a distance of up to 150 kilometers, track them within a 120-kilometer radius, and engage at ranges of up to 75 kilometers. For stealth targets, the system offers detection capabilities at 85 kilometers and interception at 45 kilometers. The 15th Khordad is also capable of simultaneously tracking and intercepting six targets, making it a formidable tool against coordinated aerial attacks. One of its standout features is its rapid deployment time, requiring less than five minutes to become operational, allowing Iranian forces to quickly respond to potential threats. The system is equipped with Sayyad-3 missiles, which are designed for medium- to long-range engagements. These missiles enhance the system’s capacity to neutralize advanced aerial threats, including those posed by modern fighter aircraft and high-altitude surveillance platforms. The system’s maximum operational altitude is 27 kilometers, enabling it to engage targets across a broad vertical range. The placement of the 15th Khordad systems near the Natanz nuclear facility signals Iran’s intent to shield its most sensitive sites from potential airstrikes. This move comes amid heightened tensions with Israel, which has a history of targeting Iranian-linked assets in Syria and is widely believed to have carried out sabotage operations against Iranian nuclear sites in the past. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasized that his country will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability, and Israeli military officials have reportedly developed operational plans for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. U.S. rhetoric has also been strong, with Washington maintaining that all options remain on the table to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program. However, the Biden administration has so far prioritized diplomatic efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. Despite these efforts, the lack of progress in negotiations has fueled speculation that military action by either Israel or the U.S. remains a possibility. The deployment of the 15th Khordad systems also reflects Iran’s broader strategy to counter increasing Israeli activity in the region. Over recent years, the Israeli Air Force has conducted numerous strikes in Syria, targeting Iranian-aligned forces and infrastructure. These operations, facilitated by the limited air defense capabilities in Syria, demonstrate Israel’s ability to project power across the region. Analysts suggest that these missions could serve as a precursor to strikes on Iran, as they test Israel’s operational readiness and tactics. Iran’s deployment of the 15th Khordad systems adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile Middle East. While Tehran views these measures as defensive, their strategic implications are likely to alarm its adversaries.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/15th-khordad-air-defense-systems-irans-response-to-growing-us-israel-strike-threats	2024-12-16T05:27:35-08:00

Currently, the Indian Army has deployed dozens of Russian-designed T-72 and T-90 tanks to the Ladakh theater. While these tanks are combat-proven and formidable in many scenarios, their operational effectiveness is limited by the thin air, steep inclines, and rugged terrain of high-altitude areas. Designed originally for operations on level ground and in desert environments, the T-72s and T-90s do not possess the same adaptability when confronted with the harsh mountain conditions. The introduction of the Zorawar is intended to close these capability gaps. By optimizing the platform for high altitude performance, agility, and quick reaction times, India aims to field a light tank that can excel where heavier platforms struggle. Beyond just firepower and armor, the Zorawar’s design priorities include improved engine performance in low-oxygen environments, advanced suspension systems to handle uneven terrain, and state-of-the-art target acquisition sensors to ensure accuracy despite difficult visibility and weather conditions. This evolution in India’s armored forces could be instrumental in maintaining a credible defensive and, if necessary, offensive stance in one of the world’s most demanding operational theaters. As both India and China continue to reinforce their positions along disputed border areas, the introduction of a homegrown, high-altitude-capable tank like the Zorawar underscores India’s strategic emphasis on self-reliance, technological innovation, and readiness to operate effectively in extreme conditions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/india-conducts-high-altitude-trials-of-its-new-zorawar-light-tank	2024-12-16T02:29:01-08:00

Belarus Hosts Russian Nuclear Weapons and Prepares for Oreshnik Ballistic Missile Deployment	Amid heightened international tensions fueled by the conflict in Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his country is hosting dozens of Russian tactical nuclear weapons and is preparing to deploy the new Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile. Reported by AP News on December 10, 2024, this statement, made during discussions on strengthened security guarantees between Minsk and Moscow, highlights an increasingly strategic partnership between the two allies in their stance against the West. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belarus notably possesses Russian Iskander-M launchers and missiles capable of being equipped with nuclear warheads (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) This nuclear deployment aligns with a significant revision of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, which now explicitly includes Belarus under Moscow’s 'nuclear umbrella.' This marks a historical shift for Minsk, which relinquished its nuclear arsenal following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. At that time, Belarus transferred its nuclear weapons to Russia and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear state. However, recent events, including a 2022 constitutional referendum that removed Belarus’ nuclear-free status, have paved the way for this return to hosting nuclear capabilities. President Lukashenko stated that these weapons were transferred discreetly, avoiding detection by Western intelligence agencies. He emphasized their defensive role against potential threats, particularly from Belarus’ borders. This strategy relies on Iskander ballistic missiles, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, as well as fighter jets equipped with nuclear bombs. These systems enable rapid targeting of potential positions in Ukraine or NATO member states, enhancing the deterrence capabilities of the Russo-Belarusian alliance. In addition, Lukashenko revealed preparations are underway for the deployment of the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile in 2025. Capable of carrying multiple warheads and reaching speeds exceeding Mach 10, this system is designed to evade missile defense systems, offering Russia an unparalleled strategic advantage. Russian President Vladimir Putin has highlighted the conventional power of the Oreshnik, stating its destructive capability rivals that of nuclear strikes. While control of these weapons will remain with Moscow, Minsk will be involved in selecting targets, further integrating the military strategies of the two nations. The Oreshnik missile represents a notable development in Russia's strategic arsenal. With hypersonic capabilities and an estimated range of 1,000 to 5,500 kilometers, it can strike critical infrastructure across Europe and parts of Asia. Equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), it can deliver conventional or nuclear warheads to several targets simultaneously with precision. First used operationally in November 2024 during the conflict in Ukraine, the missile demonstrated its strategic potential in a strike against an industrial facility. Although the warheads used were inert, the kinetic energy generated by the hypersonic speed caused significant damage, showcasing its effectiveness as both a tactical weapon and a tool of strategic deterrence. Lukashenko also noted that Belarus has retained dozens of Soviet-era sites suitable for deploying such systems. These facilities, combined with local production of transport vehicles for ballistic missiles, underline Minsk’s commitment to strengthening its role within its strategic partnership with Moscow. This alliance, formalized through a recently signed mutual security treaty, aims to deter any external aggression, particularly from NATO. The deployment of these systems, however, raises international concerns about regional stability and the risk of military escalation. While Moscow and Minsk assert that the measures are purely defensive, they represent a substantial increase in strategic pressure on Eastern Europe. Additionally, the recent lowering of Russia’s threshold for nuclear weapon use amplifies fears of potential conflict involving weapons of mass destruction. The hosting of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus and the planned deployment of Oreshnik missiles mark a significant evolution in regional security dynamics. For Minsk, these developments strengthen its strategic position alongside Moscow but also pose questions about its long-term sovereignty and security. As Belarus becomes an integral part of Russia’s nuclear strategy, these actions underscore growing tensions among major powers, signaling considerable challenges for international stability and security. Belarus’ interest in hosting advanced missile systems such as the Oreshnik lies in its strategic value. By accommodating these advanced systems, Belarus enhances its military alliance with Russia, securing stronger defense guarantees amid growing tensions with NATO and Western nations. These weapons provide Minsk with a deterrent against potential foreign intervention and bolster its geopolitical leverage in international negotiations. For European nations and NATO, the deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus represents a significant escalation of threats near their eastern borders. These missiles, with their ability to carry nuclear warheads and strike at intermediate ranges, pose a risk to critical European infrastructure, altering the regional strategic balance. This development compels NATO to reassess its defense mechanisms and bolster its deterrent capabilities to counter this emerging threat. Furthermore, it could intensify an arms race in the region, increasing the potential for misunderstandings and unintended confrontations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/belarus-hosts-russian-nuclear-weapons-and-prepares-for-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-deployment	2024-12-16T00:38:23-08:00

US says Russia plans Oreshnik ballistic missile test against Ukraine soon	During a press conference on December 11, 2024, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin had publicly stated plans to conduct another test launch of the Oreshnik ballistic missile against Ukraine. While specific details of the test remain unclear, Singh indicated that the launch could take place 'in the coming days,' though no precise date has been provided by Russian officials.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Oreshnik ballistic missile is a next-generation Russian weapon believed to feature hypersonic capabilities, precision guidance, and the ability to carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), making it a significant threat to both air defenses and strategic targets. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The Oreshnik ballistic missile, an experimental weapon in Russia’s arsenal, has garnered significant attention within the global defense community. First introduced publicly as part of Russia’s advanced missile development programs, the Oreshnik is believed to be a precision-guided, hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) designed to enhance strike capabilities. It reportedly travels at speeds exceeding Mach 10, making it highly challenging to intercept with current defense systems. The missile is equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing it to carry several warheads—either conventional or nuclear—capable of striking multiple targets simultaneously. Its range is estimated to be between 1,000 and 5,500 kilometers, enabling it to reach targets across Europe and parts of Asia. The Oreshnik saw its first confirmed operational use on November 21, 2024, during the Russo-Ukrainian War. The missile was employed in an attack on Ukraine's PA Pivdenmash facility in Dnipro. Initially, Ukrainian reports speculated that the attack involved an intercontinental ballistic missile; however, subsequent assessments identified the Oreshnik as the weapon used. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast, likely the Kapustin Yar training ground. It reportedly carried a MIRV payload, as suggested by unverified footage. Later analyses indicated the strike may not have involved explosives and was potentially intended as a political demonstration. According to senior Ukrainian officials, the missile was equipped with 'dummy' warheads that lacked explosives, prompting U.S. experts to describe the method as an 'expensive way to deliver not that much destruction.' Despite that, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that Oreshnik's warheads, even inert, can cause 'a lot of damage' because of the kinetic energy created by their hypersonic speed. The launch appears to have been conducted with a lofted trajectory. Eyewitness accounts described prolonged explosions lasting up to three hours. Deputy Press Secretary Singh sought to temper speculation about the missile’s potential impact, emphasizing that it would not constitute a decisive shift in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 'Should Russia choose to launch this type of missile, it’s not going to be a game changer on the battlefield,' Singh said. 'They’re trying to use every weapon in their arsenal to intimidate Ukraine.

Japan selects US-made T-6 Texan II as new trainer aircraft to replace locally-made Fuji T-7	Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on November 29, 2024, the selection of the Textron Aviation Defense Beechcraft T-6 Texan II turboprop aircraft, proposed by Kanematsu Corporation, as the next-generation primary trainer for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). This selection is part of the replacement program for the Fuji T-7 trainers, which have been in service since 2003 and are approaching the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The selection process commenced on August 21, 2024, when the MoD issued requests for proposals. Evaluations were conducted in two stages. The first stage assessed compliance with performance, ground training systems, logistical support, and operational requirements. Out of four proposals, only the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II and the PC-7MKX, proposed by Subaru Corporation, advanced to the second stage. The Turkish Hurkus, proposed by Daihyaku Shoji, did not meet critical requirements, while Shintoa Trading’s proposal was disqualified due to the absence of a required aircraft component. In the second stage, a scoring system was used to evaluate performance, cost, and operational factors. The T-6 Texan II achieved the highest score and was selected. The total program cost for the T-6, including six simulators and other ground training equipment, is estimated at JPY 133.65 billion ($882.09 million). Each aircraft is projected to cost JPY 1.21 billion ($7.99 million). The FY2025 budget includes an allocation of JPY 21.2 billion ($139.92 million) for two aircraft and related systems. Japan plans to procure 36 aircraft in total, all to be imported, with deliveries scheduled through FY2030 to align with the planned retirement of the Fuji T-7 fleet. The selection of the T-6 Texan II did not include trial flights, relying instead on document-based evaluations. This methodology, while less common, reflects the MoD’s focus on cost-effectiveness and operational compliance. The decision builds on Japan’s historical use of earlier T-6 variants, including the T-6D/F/G and SNJ-5/6, operated by the JASDF and Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) from 1955. These earlier variants were replaced by jet-powered trainers in the 1960s, though some are preserved in museums, and one remains operational at Shizuhama Air Base. The MoD’s selection of the T-6 Texan II is part of a broader modernization of Japan’s pilot training infrastructure. The program is designed to prepare pilots for advanced fighter aircraft while addressing operational requirements. It remains uncertain whether the T-6 could also replace other training platforms, such as the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s T-5 trainer or the Kawasaki T-4 advanced trainer. The T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Japan’s acquisition of the T-6 aligns with international trends toward standardization in training systems. Deliveries are set to begin in 2027, marking the first step in Japan’s phased approach to upgrading its training fleet. The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II is equipped with a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-68 turboprop engine generating 1,100 horsepower. Its specifications include a maximum speed of 586 km/h, a climb rate of 1,372 meters per minute, a service ceiling of 9,500 meters, and a range of 1,574 kilometers.

The aircraft incorporates a digital glass cockpit with multi-function displays, a head-up display, and navigation systems. Safety features include ejection seats capable of zero-zero operations and a pressurized cockpit. It also supports synthetic air-to-ground and air-to-air training capabilities. The Fuji T-7, developed by Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru), has served as the JASDF’s primary trainer since 2003, replacing the T-3. Its design is derived from the Fuji T-3, which was influenced by the Beechcraft T-34C Turbo Mentor, highlighting the historical use of American aircraft designs in JASDF training. Officially adopted in 2003, the T-7 introduced the Rolls-Royce 250-B17F turboprop engine for improved operational reliability. It was selected over the Pilatus PC-7, despite procurement-related controversies. Key features include a low-wing monoplane design, tandem seating, and cockpit modifications, with cost efficiency achieved through component reuse from the T-3. Of the 49 units produced, all remain in use at JASDF training bases. Their retirement is scheduled to begin in 2030 as the T-6 Texan II is phased in. The T-7 has not been exported due to political considerations rather than technical constraints.

Officially adopted in 2018, the DFE strategy combines strategic foresight with operational flexibility to respond effectively to threats in disputed areas. Developed against the backdrop of growing rivalries with powers like China and Russia, this approach prioritizes agile and short-term deployments over prolonged or fixed rotations. Since its implementation, DFE missions have been conducted in strategic regions, including Europe and the Indo-Pacific, to test and demonstrate force responsiveness. These rapid, often unannounced, deployments are designed to keep adversaries uncertain about U.S. intentions while enhancing deterrence. At the same time, this strategy maximizes troop readiness for rapidly evolving geopolitical threats, a critical factor in sensitive areas like the Indo-Pacific, where DFE was recently applied with the A-10 deployment to the Philippines in December 2024. This joint training operation occurs against the backdrop of escalating tensions in the South China Sea, where reports from late November 2024 indicated the presence of nearly 100 Chinese vessels near Thitu Island, occupied by the Philippines. The contested waters are central to overlapping territorial claims involving China, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian nations. The Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951 between the United States and the Philippines obligates both nations to respond jointly to any attack on their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces in the Pacific region, highlighting the importance of these military collaborations. Military ties between the Philippines and the United States are deeply rooted, dating back to the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, which commits both nations to mutual defense in the event of armed attacks in the Pacific region. These ties were further solidified by the 1947 military base agreement, which allowed the U.S. to maintain strategic installations such as Clark Air Base, north of Manila, and Subic Bay Naval Base, on the western coast of Luzon. Although the U.S. withdrew from these bases in 1991 following a Philippine Senate vote, cooperation resumed vigorously with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed in 2014. This agreement grants U.S. forces access to several key bases, including Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, near the South China Sea, and Basa Air Base in Pampanga, for temporary rotations. These bases play a strategic role in regular joint exercises like Balikatan, which aim to enhance interoperability and address security challenges, particularly amid China's growing claims in the South China Sea. Today, this alliance remains a cornerstone of stability in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Department of Defense has designated the Indo-Pacific region as a priority due to escalating Chinese military and maritime activities. Regular joint training exercises, such as the arrival of A-10s and a recent air drill over the Philippine Sea in November, are central to Washington's strategy for maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. According to U.S. officials, these exercises aim to bolster interoperability and shared capabilities, ensuring preparedness for emerging regional challenges. The A-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the 'Warthog,' is a twin-engine attack aircraft renowned for its rugged design and close air support capabilities. Powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines, it achieves a maximum speed of 833 km/h and has a combat range of 460 km. The aircraft is heavily armored to withstand ground fire and features redundant systems for enhanced survivability. Its primary weapon is the GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm rotary cannon, capable of firing 3,900 rounds per minute, optimized for destroying armored vehicles. Additionally, the A-10 can carry up to 7,260 kg of mixed ordnance, including missiles, bombs, and rockets, across 11 hardpoints. Its ability to operate at low altitude and slow speeds makes it unmatched in close air support and battlefield interdiction. The development of the A-10 Thunderbolt II dates back to the late 1960s when the U.S. Air Force initiated the AX (Attack Experimental) program to design an aircraft capable of providing close air support in hostile environments. The A-10's maiden flight occurred in May 1972, and it officially entered service in 1976. Designed to withstand ground fire and neutralize enemy armor, the A-10 first demonstrated its combat prowess during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, destroying hundreds of Iraqi tanks. It is equipped with the GAU-8/A Avenger rotary cannon, utilizing depleted uranium armor-piercing (API) or high-explosive incendiary (HEI) ammunition to neutralize heavily armored targets. The aircraft has also proven effective in conflicts such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, and more recently in Syria, where it was deployed against Islamic State positions. Despite multiple attempts to retire the aircraft due to its age, field reports emphasize its durability, precision, and unique ability to support ground troops, qualities that continue to justify its active service.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-deploys-a-10-thunderbolt-ii-ground-attack-aircraft-squadron-to-counter-china-threats-in-the-philippines	2024-12-11T02:10:48-08:00

Greece Prioritizes M113 Modernization Over US Bradleys and French VBCIs	According to information published by the specialized website OnAlert on December 9, 2024, the Greek military has decided to modernize its fleet of M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) rather than acquire new vehicles like the American M2 Bradleys or the French VBCIs. This decision, driven by budgetary constraints and operational requirements, represents a significant move in Greece's efforts to upgrade its armored vehicle fleet while addressing its military needs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Army soldiers conducted a convoy operation to an objective during force-on-force training at Petrochori Range, Triantafyllides Camp, Greece, as part of Olympic Cooperation 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) For years, the Greek General Staff has sought to modernize its mechanized infantry, which has faced growing obsolescence in its equipment. The Kentauros Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) project, launched in the 2000s, was abandoned, leaving Greece without a viable replacement for its aging vehicles. In 2020, a proposal was made to acquire M2A2/M2A2OD Bradleys from the United States. Although approved in 2023 for the transfer of 300 units, the refurbishment costs of the vehicles proved prohibitive. Even an offer involving 62 Bradleys free of charge and 102 more under favorable financial terms was deemed unaffordable by Athens due to budgetary limitations. Simultaneously, France proposed a compelling alternative: the immediate delivery of 120 VBCIs, with an additional 250 units to be co-produced with Greek industry. However, this option was also considered too costly. A competing offer from Rheinmetall for its KF-41 Lynx failed to secure interest for similar reasons. Ultimately, the Greek military opted for a more economical solution by modernizing its M113 fleet. This program, a collaboration between the Israeli company Rafael and the Greek firm METKA, involves upgrading over 500 M113 vehicles. The modernization includes the installation of remote-controlled weapon stations with 30mm cannons, enhanced armor, a new, more powerful propulsion system, advanced communication systems, and modern optronic sensors. The upgrades will be conducted at METKA’s facility in Magnesia, with costs significantly lower than the alternatives proposed, making this option particularly attractive for Athens. However, M113s remain APCs with a weight of 12 tons, which is significantly lighter than modern IFVs like the Bradley and VBCI, which weigh nearly twice as much and offer superior firepower. The standard M113 armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun, suitable for defense against infantry and lightly armored threats. In contrast, the VBCI is equipped with a 25mm cannon mounted on a remote turret, while the Bradley boasts a 25mm M242 cannon and can be fitted with TOW anti-tank missiles, providing substantial offensive capabilities against heavily armored targets. Regarding protection, the M113 features aluminum armor designed to withstand small arms fire and shell fragments but remains vulnerable to modern anti-tank weapons. By contrast, the VBCI and Bradley provide more robust protection against ballistic threats and improvised explosive devices. Both IFVs also incorporate advanced detection and communication systems, enhancing their battlefield efficiency. While the M113 fulfills its primary role as a troop carrier, the VBCI and Bradley surpass it in firepower, protection, and operational versatility. This choice reflects a pragmatic approach by Greece to extend the lifespan of existing equipment while addressing immediate operational needs. Modernizing the M113 fleet offers a cost-effective alternative to acquiring modern IFVs, especially considering the purchase, maintenance, and training costs associated with new vehicles. Moreover, the program supports local industry through partnerships like that with METKA, contributing to the Greek defense economy. Modernizing the M113 allows Greece to respond swiftly to operational demands. While these vehicles do not match the capabilities of Bradleys or VBCIs, upgrades such as remote weapon stations, improved armor, and advanced communication systems enhance their battlefield utility. This approach also enables Greece to deploy a larger number of modernized vehicles, reinforcing its mechanized forces quantitatively, even if qualitatively they remain behind modern IFVs. Currently, the Greek military possesses approximately 2,900 M113 APCs, including various variants acquired over decades to meet operational requirements. The decision to modernize these vehicles underscores Greece’s commitment to strengthening its military capabilities within strict budgetary limits. Although economical, this strategy raises questions about its long-term viability in addressing evolving threats and operational challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-prioritizes-m113-modernization-over-american-bradleys-and-french-vbcis	2024-12-10T23:53:47-08:00	
Analysis: With Fewer Forces Than Cold War British Army Could Collapse in 6 Months of Ukraine-Style War	Veterans Minister Al Carns, a former Royal Marine colonel, has issued a grave warning about the readiness of the British Armed Forces. He cautioned that in a conflict of the scale and intensity of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the British Army could be 'expended in six months to a year.' This stark assessment underscores significant limitations in the UK’s capacity to sustain prolonged, high-intensity military engagements, raising pressing questions about its ability to fulfill national defense obligations and meet NATO commitments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British soldiers during training exercises, highlighting efforts to maintain readiness as the Army faces historic reductions in troop numbers and challenges in sustaining prolonged high-intensity conflicts. (Picture source: British MoD) Data released earlier this year by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) lends weight to these concerns. British troop numbers have plummeted to their lowest levels since the early 1800s, with a 38% decline in recruits over the past two decades. Total personnel in the armed forces has dropped from 207,000 in 2000 to just 131,000 in 2024. The British Army now fields approximately 73,000 regular soldiers—the smallest force in its modern history—while the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force stand at 29,000 and 33,000 personnel, respectively. This dramatic erosion contrasts sharply with the Cold War, when the UK maintained robust military forces designed to counter large-scale threats such as the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the British Army was one of NATO’s strongest and most capable forces. Though smaller than the U.S. military, the UK played a pivotal role in the alliance’s defense strategy, particularly in Europe. Its reputation rested on a combination of highly trained personnel, modern equipment, and strategic positioning, bolstered by its independent nuclear deterrent. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), stationed in West Germany, exemplified this strength, consisting of four armored divisions equipped with over 800 Chieftain and Challenger 1 tanks, advanced artillery, and air defense systems like the Rapier missile. The UK’s global reach further enhanced its military power. The Royal Navy operated over 130 combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and a formidable submarine fleet. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force fielded more than 850 aircraft, including Tornado, Harrier, and Jaguar fighters, alongside robust reconnaissance and transport capabilities. Today, this once-formidable capability has been significantly diminished. The British Army now operates only 227 Challenger 2 tanks, with upgrades to Challenger 3 underway. Artillery inventories have been severely reduced, and the British Army’s ability to sustain high-volume, long-range firepower in prolonged engagements falls short of modern requirements. The Royal Navy, once boasting 130 vessels, now operates just 73, including two Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but with only 19 frigates and destroyers to escort them. Similarly, the Royal Air Force’s fleet has declined to around 500 aircraft, even as advanced platforms like the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II have entered service. The war in Ukraine vividly illustrates the resources and resilience required for sustained, high-intensity conflict. Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia has depended on continuous supplies of tanks, artillery, drones, and ammunition, much of it provided by NATO allies. If the UK faced a similar-scale conflict, the British Armed Forces would likely struggle to sustain operations beyond a few months. Insufficient ammunition stockpiles, aging equipment, and gaps in critical systems such as air defense are significant vulnerabilities. British ammunition reserves, in particular, would be quickly exhausted, given the consumption rates observed in Ukraine, where thousands of artillery rounds are fired daily. Logistical endurance remains a critical challenge. The lack of robust air defense systems capable of countering drones and precision missile strikes further exposes vulnerabilities in prolonged engagements. These deficiencies underscore the UK's challenges as it seeks to modernize its forces and rebuild its capacity. Efforts to address these issues are underway. The Future Soldier initiative aims to restructure the British Army into smaller, agile Brigade Combat Teams with enhanced digital capabilities. Procurement projects, including upgrades to Challenger 3 tanks, the acquisition of Archer self-propelled howitzers, and investments in counter-drone technologies, represent steps in the right direction. However, the pace of modernization has been slow, and the gap between current capabilities and the demands of high-intensity warfare remains substantial. Financial constraints further complicate these efforts. The UK’s defense budget for the 2023/24 fiscal year was £53.9 billion, with planned increases to £56.9 billion in 2024/25 and £59.8 billion in 2025/26. This represents an annual real-terms growth rate of 2.3%. While former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030—potentially delivering an additional £75 billion—specific plans to achieve this target remain unclear. Current allocations may be insufficient to address existing capability gaps and modernization needs. The warnings from Veterans Minister Al Carns, coupled with British MoD data and lessons from the Ukraine war, highlight the urgent need for a reassessment of the UK’s defense priorities. The sharp decline in personnel, equipment, and logistical endurance underscores a critical challenge in maintaining a credible deterrent. Heavy weaponry, robust air defenses, and sustained logistical support are essential areas for investment if the British Armed Forces are to remain effective in modern warfare. Without decisive action and adequate funding, the UK risks further erosion of its military capabilities and its standing as a global military power.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-with-fewer-forces-than-cold-war-british-army-could-collapse-in-6-months-of-ukraine-style-war	2024-12-10T09:38:27-08:00

China Develops a Near-Light-Speed Radar System to Counter Submarine Stealth	Chinese scientists have developed a 'ghost' radar capable of emitting electromagnetic waves at speeds close to the speed of light, enabling submarine detection. This innovation is based on the advanced use of the Doppler effect and high-energy microwave synthesis, as detailed in a study published on November 28, 2024, in the Chinese academic journal Modern Radar. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chinese Academy of Sciences designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky that generates continuously moving extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic capable of penetrating seawater and effectively detecting submarines several hundred meters below the surface. (Picture source: China Military) The team, led by Li Daojing of the National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky. This constantly moving source continuously generates extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves capable of penetrating seawater to detect submarines several hundred meters below the surface. These ELF signals, with wavelengths exceeding 100 meters, allow for effective submarine detection due to their interaction with the aquatic environment. The researchers describe this technology as capable of transforming underwater detection. When ELF signals at 100 Hz interact with a nuclear submarine, its radar cross-section (RCS) can reach up to 88 square meters, enabling identification using standard magnetic detectors. Compact detectors mounted on drones could achieve gradient detection across wide areas, providing extensive and precise coverage. Traditionally, ELF signals required massive antennas, such as the ELF facility in central China, which spans over 100 km. Li Daojing's team has significantly reduced the size of these structures. Their new transmitter, measuring only 100 meters in length, is compact enough to be installed on Chinese naval ships. The high-frequency, high-power microwaves emitted by these antennas converge in the sky to form a virtual radio source. As one source dissipates, another is instantly generated, creating a continuous flow of ELF signals. This technique employs a network structure to simulate high-speed motion using Doppler signals in space. It reduces signal frequency while widening pulse width. The Doppler effect—where wave frequency changes based on relative motion between the source and observer—is a fundamental principle of this development. The perceived frequency increases as the source and observer approach each other and decreases as they move apart. Beyond submarine detection, the technology has potential applications for communication between surface ships and submarines, with an estimated range of 6,000 kilometers. Following successful ground-based trials, the team plans to reduce the transmitter's size to about 30 meters, making it more adaptable for various uses.

Taiwan ramps up Wanjian cruise missile production to strengthen the country’s naval and air capabilities	As reported by the Liberty Times on December 7, 2024, Taiwan has completed the mass production of its domestically developed Wanjian air-to-ground cruise missile, providing new capabilities for preemptive strikes on key Chinese military positions. Over 150 units of the Wanjian-1 bomb, with a range of 200 kilometers, have been produced, and the development of an extended-range version, the Wanjian-2 with a range of 400 kilometers, is now being carried out under the Ministry of National Defense's annual budget for further testing and small-batch production.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. (Picture source: Twitter/Taepodong) The development of Taiwan's Wanjian missile, also known as the Wan Chien or the 'Ten Thousand Swords Bomb,' began in the early 2000s as a response to the growing threat posed by China's military advancements. Initiated under the codename 'Project Divine Axe' by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the missile was designed to neutralize strategic targets such as airstrips, radar installations, and troop concentrations on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Drawing inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the Storm Shadow, its development incorporated advanced features like GPS and inertial navigation guidance, as well as a turbofan engine for extended range. The missile first underwent testing in the mid-2000s, achieved combat readiness in 2010, entered service in 2011, and entered mass production in 2015 after system integration with Taiwan’s AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter jets. Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. Live-fire exercises by F-CK-1 units in Tainan and Taichung demonstrated its effectiveness, targeting simulated installations on the southeastern coast of China, including strikes targeting facilities in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces from positions near the midline of the Taiwan Strait. It supports Taiwan’s defensive strategy by enabling precision strikes on key installations beyond the reach of short-range defenses. The Wanjian bomb is integrated with the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, with each aircraft capable of carrying one missile under each wing. The missile is guided by GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain recognition (TERCOM) systems for mid-flight adjustments, along with terminal guidance technologies such as image infrared (IIR) and digital scene matching area correlation (DSMAC). The missile’s design features a square body, foldable wings for compact storage and aerodynamic performance, an X-shaped rudder for directional control, and a turbofan engine that allows subsonic speeds up to Mach 0.8. It carries a 350-kilogram warhead containing submunitions equipped with delayed fuzes. These submunitions are engineered to penetrate surfaces and detonate underground, maximizing damage to hardened targets. The development of the Wanjian-2, also known as the Extended-Range Wanjian Bomb, is now being carried out to realize precision strikes at ranges up to 400 km. Also designed for the F-CK-1 fighter, it features a cluster munition warhead capable of targeting runways, radars, and troop concentrations. The missile utilizes GPS and inertial navigation with advanced terminal guidance for enhanced accuracy. Its design includes foldable wings, an X-tail configuration, and a turbofan engine for subsonic flight. It seems that small-scale production of the Wanjian-2 variant is set to continue under Taiwan's annual defense budget to bolster long-range strike capabilities. This extended-range version will enhance strike capabilities by allowing deeper penetration into adversary-controlled areas. However, it remains in the development phase under the Ministry of National Defense’s regular budget allocations. The Wanjian draws inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the British Storm Shadow. (Picture source: NCSIST) Despite its capabilities, the Wanjian missile's reliance on a non-stealthy design and subsonic speed makes it vulnerable to modern air defense systems, particularly during low-altitude flight paths needed for accurate targeting of runways or other fixed installations. The missile's effectiveness is further constrained by the limited range and survivability of its carrier platform, the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter, which risks interception before launch in contested airspace. Additionally, dependence on civilian GPS navigation rather than military-grade systems reduces its accuracy under electronic countermeasure conditions. These factors could collectively undermine the Wanjian's operational potential in high-threat environments. In addition to its existing applications, the feasibility of adapting the Wanjian bomb for use on helicopters was proposed by Kuomintang legislators in 2019. The proposal emphasized the need to overcome the dependency on operational runways during a conflict, addressing the expected asymmetry in air force readiness caused by immediate damage to airfields. However, a feasibility assessment by the Air Force concluded that adapting the Wanjian bomb for helicopter deployment is both technically challenging and impractical. The assessment cited the size and weight of the missile, the limited payload capacity of helicopters, and the need for U.S. approval for modifications to American-made rotorcraft as significant obstacles. While the suggestion aimed to reduce dependency on runways, the Air Force stated that the Wanjian bomb’s current integration with AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo aircraft remains the optimal approach. In recent years, Taiwan has been enhancing its cruise missile capabilities through the development and deployment of several systems. For instance, the Ching Tien (擎天) supersonic cruise missile, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, has entered mass production and is being deployed by the Air Force, enabling it to reach targets north of Beijing. The Hsiung Sheng, an extended-range variant of the Hsiung Feng IIE land-attack cruise missile, is planned for deployment in 2024, offering a range of up to 1,200 kilometers to target critical sites such as the People's Liberation Army's Eastern and Southern Theater Command bases. With the production of the Wanjian missile system, these missiles are part of Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid regional security concerns. Taiwan is responding to increased military pressure from China by enhancing its defense capabilities through various measures. The United States has approved arms sales to Taiwan, including a $2 billion package featuring the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Taiwan has increased its defense budget by 7.7% for 2025, with allocations for new fighter jets and missile production. Domestically, Taiwan launched its first indigenously built submarine, the Haikun, to strengthen naval deterrence. The US Department of Defense is also working with Taiwan on deploying drone swarms aimed at deterring potential Chinese actions. These measures reflect Taiwan’s efforts to address regional security tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/taiwan-ramps-up-wanjian-cruise-missile-production-to-strengthen-the-countrys-naval-and-air-capabilities	2024-12-10T02:15:20-08:00	
Breaking News: Taiwan Launches Combat Readiness Exercises Following China's Deployment of 90 Warships	China's recent deployment of approximately 90 naval and coast guard vessels near Taiwan represents a large escalation in regional tensions, prompting a robust response from Taiwan. On December 9, 2024, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense announced the launch of combat readiness exercises to counter this unprecedented show of force, the largest in recent months. The deployment spans waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas, surpassing previous military activities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan has raised its alert level following the sighting of over 90 Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the region. However, the defense ministry has not officially classified the movements as drills. (Picture source: Taiwanese Media TV screenshot) The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has also established an emergency response center to monitor the situation closely and address all 'gray zone' incursions—non-traditional military operations designed to exert pressure without open conflict. This escalation coincides with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's recent visit to Guam, a move Beijing views as provocative due to its opposition to official interactions between Taiwan and the United States. China's actions align with its broader strategy to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, potentially through military force. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has undergone rapid modernization and expansion, significantly enhancing its power projection capabilities. Beijing's possible plans for a naval assault include several scenarios. One potential strategy is a large-scale amphibious invasion, requiring substantial lift capacity and coordination to transport troops and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. However, China's current amphibious fleet may fall short of the requirements for a full-scale invasion, potentially necessitating the use of civilian vessels. While increasing transport capacity, these vessels are more vulnerable to Taiwan’s asymmetric defenses, such as missile-armed fast attack boats and stealthy corvettes. Another strategy could involve imposing a maritime blockade to sever Taiwan's critical supply lines, aiming to force political concessions without direct confrontation. Taiwan's heavy reliance on maritime trade makes it particularly susceptible to such a strategy. Additionally, China might continue to employ gray zone tactics, such as deploying maritime militias and conducting frequent incursions into Taiwanese waters and airspace, designed to test Taiwan’s responses and exert sustained pressure without triggering outright conflict. Taiwan's Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is a critical component of its defense strategy, tasked with countering these potential threats. As of 2024, the ROCN comprises approximately 40,000 personnel and a diverse fleet. The navy operates four Kee Lung-class guided-missile destroyers, which are former U.S. Navy vessels serving as the backbone of Taiwan's surface combatants. It also operates 22 frigates, including eight Cheng Kung-class frigates (based on the U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry-class) and six Kang Ding-class frigates, offering versatile capabilities for maritime defense. Two Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvettes have been commissioned, designed for high-speed operations and equipped with advanced anti-ship missiles. The ROCN maintains four submarines, including two Hai Lung-class and two older Hai Shih-class vessels, focused on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Taiwan has launched an ambitious program to construct seven new diesel-electric submarines over the next decade, significantly bolstering its undersea capabilities. Additionally, the navy operates eight amphibious ships, including tank landing ships and a recently commissioned Yushan-class amphibious transport dock, as well as various support vessels for logistics and replenishment. Recent efforts to develop asymmetric warfare capabilities focus on smaller, stealthier vessels equipped with precision-guided weaponry to offset the PLAN's numerical superiority.The Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC), Taiwan's elite amphibious warfare unit, plays a critical role in the defense of the island nation. With a strength of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 personnel, the ROCMC is trained for specialized missions, including amphibious assaults, coastal defense, and the protection of Taiwan's offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. Equipped with a diverse array of weapons and platforms, the Marine Corps fields modern assault rifles, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers for ground operations. For amphibious missions, they rely on vehicles like the AAV-7A1 amphibious assault vehicles, capable of transporting troops from ships to shore under combat conditions. The ROCMC also trains extensively in urban warfare, jungle operations, and joint exercises with other branches of Taiwan's military to ensure interoperability. These forces are prepared to respond swiftly to invasions or incursions, emphasizing the defense of Taiwan's sovereignty and the recovery of occupied territory in a conflict scenario. China's naval forces have seen rapid growth, making the PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy - Chinese Navy) the world's largest navy, with over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface combatants. The PLAN’s modern arsenal includes advanced warships such as the Type 055 destroyers and the aircraft carrier CNS Fujian, reflecting China’s ambition to project power and assert its maritime claims. China’s shipbuilding capacity, which is over 230 times greater than that of the United States, has enabled this rapid expansion. The current developments mark a critical juncture in cross-strait relations, with China's substantial military presence near Taiwan heightening regional tensions. Taiwan's proactive defense measures and calls for international support reflect its determination to safeguard its sovereignty amidst growing external pressures. The evolving naval capabilities of both Taiwan and China will play a pivotal role in shaping the future security dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-taiwan-launches-combat-readiness-exercises-following-chinas-deployment-of-90-warships	2024-12-10T02:03:37-08:00	
Russia May Exchange MiG-29 and Su-27 Fighter Jets for North Korean Troops Deployed in Ukraine	Russia and North Korea have reportedly reached a strategic agreement marking a significant step in their military cooperation. This deal aligns with Moscow’s strategy to strengthen its alliances amidst Western sanctions, while Pyongyang sees a rare opportunity to modernize its outdated air force. According to information disclosed by Admiral Samuel Paparo at the Reagan National Defense Forum on December 7, 2024, North Korea would receive Russian MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets. In return, North Korea is believed to have sent approximately 12,000 soldiers to support Russian military operations in Ukraine. These troops, though not directly involved in combat, are reportedly deployed in conflict zones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This agreement offers North Korea a critical upgrade from its outdated second-generation aircraft fleet to more advanced MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) The delivery of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets is part of Russia’s broader strategy to leverage its allies to counter international pressures. While the exact number of aircraft to be transferred remains unclear, their inclusion in North Korea’s fleet would significantly bolster Pyongyang’s military capabilities. However, these jets are technically inferior to fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. This agreement comes as North Korea’s air force, historically reliant on Soviet and Chinese support, struggles with decades of stagnation and international sanctions. Its current fleet is largely composed of Soviet-era aircraft from the 1980s, many of which are no longer operational. The MiG-29, developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich, is a twin-engine, fourth-generation fighter designed for air superiority. It is equipped with a Phazotron N019 radar capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' operations. The jet’s armament includes a 30mm cannon and air-to-air missiles such as the medium-range R-27 and short-range R-73. Renowned for its exceptional maneuverability, the MiG-29 features advanced aerodynamics and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, reaching speeds of Mach 2.3 and operating at altitudes up to 17,000 meters. The Su-27, designed by Sukhoi, is a long-range air superiority fighter equipped with a Phazotron N001 Myech radar, also capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' targeting. It is armed with a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 30mm cannon and up to ten hardpoints for air-to-air missiles like the R-73 and R-27. Known for its agility, the Su-27 incorporates advanced fly-by-wire controls and can execute complex maneuvers such as the 'Cobra.' It achieves speeds of Mach 2.35 and operates at altitudes up to 18,500 meters. For North Korea, this agreement addresses a major strategic gap. Its air force currently includes over 400 combat aircraft, but a significant portion belongs to the second generation, such as the Chinese-made J-5 and J-6, copies of the Soviet MiG-17 and MiG-19. Adding MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters from the 1980s would represent a considerable technological upgrade. These jets, equipped with relatively modern radars and weapon systems for their era, would enhance Pyongyang’s defensive capabilities against advanced South Korean forces. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The deal also underscores Pyongyang’s broader interest in advanced military technologies. In addition to fighter jets, North Korea may seek Russian expertise in ballistic missile re-entry vehicles, modern submarines, and air defense systems. This cooperation could help North Korea counter South Korea’s 'three-axis' doctrine, which focuses on neutralizing North Korean threats through preemptive, defensive, and offensive measures. This exchange occurs amid heightened regional tensions between the two Koreas. In June 2024, North Korean soldiers crossed into South Korea before retreating under warning shots from South Korean forces. More recently, in October 2024, North Korea destroyed sections of roads symbolizing reunification efforts and bolstered defensive structures along the border. These incidents highlight escalating tensions, marked by border clashes and military threats. Integrating MiG-29 and Su-27 jets into North Korea’s air force could improve its air defense and air superiority capabilities. However, these aircraft remain outclassed by fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. Additionally, the operational effectiveness of these jets will depend on pilot training and maintenance, areas where North Korea faces significant challenges. While this agreement strengthens North Korea’s air fleet quantitatively, it is unlikely to shift the aerial power balance significantly in the Korean Peninsula. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China. Recently, Iran received Su-35 jets and Mi-28 helicopters, while China has benefited from increased Russian technological support in sensitive areas like submarines and missiles. These partnerships reflect Russia’s growing reliance on allies to sustain its military capabilities under international sanctions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-may-exchange-mig-29-and-su-27-fighter-jets-for-north-korean-troops-deployed-in-ukraine	2024-12-10T01:55:42-08:00	
Russia to receive newest nuclear submarine Arkhangelsk with Kalibr Missiles in summer 2025	According to information published by Russian sources on December 6, 2024, the Russian Navy is preparing to enhance its underwater warfare capabilities with the addition of the Arkhangelsk, a multipurpose nuclear-powered submarine, slated for delivery in the summer of 2025. This submarine, part of the modernized Project 885M Yasen-M class, is being constructed by Sevmash, a division of the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Arkhangelsk, Russia's advanced Yasen-M class nuclear-powered submarine, is set to join the Navy in 2025, equipped with Kalibr and Oniks missiles. (Picture source: Paluba Media) Currently undergoing state trials, the Arkhangelsk represents the latest in naval engineering and technology. The submarine entered sea trials in June 2024. It was launched on November 29, 2023, from Sevmash's shipyard in Severodvinsk for final outfitting and floating completion. In the event of a military conflict between NATO and Russia, the Arkhangelsk submarine, as part of the modernized Yasen-M class, could play a pivotal role in shifting the balance of power in the maritime domain and beyond. Its advanced capabilities make it an asset capable of addressing several strategic and tactical objectives: The Arkhangelsk is equipped with Kalibr-PL cruise missiles, capable of striking NATO targets at long distances, including critical infrastructure, command centers, and military bases. This capability serves as a strong deterrent, as the threat of precision strikes can dissuade adversaries from escalating conflict. Additionally, its ability to launch Oniks supersonic missiles provides a credible countermeasure to NATO surface fleets, including aircraft carrier strike groups. Operating in key maritime regions such as the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, or the Arctic, the Arkhangelsk could enforce sea denial strategies, restricting NATO's freedom of movement. Its stealth capabilities enable it to approach high-value targets undetected, posing a constant threat to NATO naval operations. By deploying near NATO maritime chokepoints, the submarine could effectively challenge or block naval reinforcements. With its advanced sensors, weaponry, and stealth design, the Arkhangelsk would likely be a formidable opponent in undersea warfare. It could hunt NATO submarines, including those tasked with deploying ballistic or cruise missiles, thus undermining NATO’s strategic deterrent capabilities. The submarine’s ability to operate covertly in the Atlantic could allow it to disrupt NATO's vital maritime supply routes between North America and Europe. Striking supply convoys and transport vessels would complicate NATO’s logistical efforts, potentially delaying reinforcements and resupply operations. The Kalibr-PL missiles on board the 'Arkhangelsk' are capable of precision strikes on land-based targets. In a conflict, the submarine could launch coordinated missile barrages against NATO military installations, communication hubs, or missile defense sites, potentially neutralizing critical components of NATO’s operational network. Given its Arctic-capable design, the 'Arkhangelsk' could support operations in the increasingly contested Arctic region. Control over this region is crucial for both Russia and NATO, as it holds strategic sea lanes and natural resources. The submarine could patrol under the Arctic ice, undetected, projecting power and securing Russian claims in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-to-receive-newest-nuclear-submarine-arkhangelsk-with-kalibr-missiles-in-summer-2025	2024-12-10T01:32:35-08:00	
US Army Explores PrSM Inc. 5 Missile for Autonomous Launchers Exceeding 1000 km	The US Army is advancing its technological capabilities in long-range precision strikes with plans to develop a fifth iteration of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), designed to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers. During a December 3, 2024 event hosted by the Association of the US Army, two senior military officials shared insights into this project, which could significantly enhance the Army's strike range capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Major General Winston Brook, commander of the Fires Center of Excellence, presented a slide that identified the PrSM Increment 5 as a prospective future capability. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, explained that preliminary work on this fifth version of the PrSM has commenced, with a formal science and technology development initiative scheduled for fiscal year 2026. According to Brig. Gen. Crooks, the primary goal of Increment 5 is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous platform, departing from traditional systems like the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS. This innovation involves creating a launcher without a cab, allowing for potentially larger and longer-range munitions. 'If you’re familiar with an MLRS pod, it’s about 13 feet long. With an autonomous system, you might be able to use something longer,' Crooks noted, suggesting the possibility of achieving ranges currently deemed unrealistic. Although the program has received initial funding for science and technology research, Crooks clarified that there is no definitive timeline for formal competition or development. This highlights the program's exploratory nature, with its future depending on results from these early stages. For several years, the Army has been developing earlier versions of the PrSM to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and ensure compatibility with current launch systems like HIMARS and the M270A2 MLRS. Currently, Increment 1 missiles, produced by Lockheed Martin, are being fielded and are capable of striking targets at distances of at least 500 kilometers. Subsequent increments include Increment 2, which features a multimode seeker known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and Increment 3, which is designed to incorporate enhanced lethality payloads. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team are working on competing designs for Increment 4, which aims to double the range of earlier versions, surpassing 1,000 kilometers. The development of Increment 5 represents a pivotal step toward integrating autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, the initiative underscores the Army’s commitment to extending the boundaries of precision long-range strikes. If successful, the PrSM Increment 5 could offer substantial strategic advantages in future military scenarios.

(Picture source: BAE Systems) The contract, valued at approximately £2.8 billion, will benefit the production facilities of BAE Systems in Samlesbury and Warton, ensuring continuity of operations at these key sites. This new order builds on Qatar’s 2017 purchase of 24 Typhoons and complements its diverse fleet, which also includes French Rafales and American F-15QAs. The integration of the Typhoons into the joint No. 12 Squadron, operated by the Qatari Air Force and the British Royal Air Force, underscores their strategic role in strengthening bilateral military collaborations. Qatar has significantly enhanced its military air fleet over the past decade by adopting a strategy of supply diversification to ensure its security and operational independence. In 2017, Doha signed a €5.6 billion contract for the acquisition of 24 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters from the Eurofighter consortium (BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo), reinforced by an additional order for 12 units announced in December 2024, valued at an estimated £2.8 billion. These aircraft are integrated into the joint No. 12 Squadron with the British Royal Air Force, symbolizing strengthened military cooperation between Qatar and the United Kingdom. In December 2024, during the state visit of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to the United Kingdom, the two nations strengthened their defense partnership by signing agreements to extend their collaboration on joint squadrons of Typhoon and Hawk aircraft. On this occasion, two Typhoon fighters from the joint No. 12 Squadron escorted the Emir’s aircraft as it entered British airspace, illustrating their operational synergy. This visit highlights the deepening military ties between the United Kingdom and Qatar, based on their historical relationship and shared commitment to regional security. The Typhoon offers Qatar’s armed forces a modern and versatile combat platform capable of meeting diverse operational needs. With its advanced avionics, high-speed performance (Mach 2), and exceptional maneuverability, it is perfectly suited for air-to-air combat and ground attack missions. Equipped with the AESA Captor-E radar and a wide array of precision-guided munitions, including Meteor and Brimstone missiles, the Typhoon enhances Qatar’s air superiority and strike capabilities. Additionally, its integration into the joint No. 12 Squadron between the United Kingdom and Qatar provides valuable training, NATO-standard interoperability, and a strategic partnership with a key ally, further strengthening Qatar’s defensive posture and regional influence. In parallel, Qatar has also invested in French Rafale fighters, signing an initial contract for 24 aircraft in 2015, followed by an additional order for 12 units in 2017, bringing the total cost to approximately €6.3 billion. These Rafales are expected to be upgraded to the F4 standard, adding enhanced capabilities such as advanced connectivity systems and next-generation armaments. Finally, Qatar purchased 36 American F-15QA fighters under a $12 billion contract signed in 2017. These acquisitions reflect a pragmatic strategy, balancing strategic alliances and military enhancement, with a fleet combining the strengths of major aviation powers. While the announcement surprised France, where negotiations for additional Rafales and other military equipment were ongoing, it illustrates Qatar’s delicate balance between maintaining operational readiness and developing strong relationships with major defense suppliers. This agreement is particularly significant as the Typhoon had not received recent export orders before Qatar’s renewed interest, positioning the United Kingdom as a key strategic partner for Doha in a competitive regional landscape. This development also reflects changes in Qatar’s defense procurement strategy, including its exploration of joint infantry mechanisms with the United Kingdom, potentially centered on ARTEC’s Boxer armored vehicle. By diversifying its defense assets and partnerships, this Typhoon agreement highlights Qatar’s commitment to a robust and versatile military posture aligned with NATO standards and adapted to an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Qatar’s decision not to opt for additional Rafales, despite the aircraft’s excellent performance, can be attributed to several strategic and political reasons. Firstly, Qatar already has 36 Rafales in its fleet, which may limit the immediate appeal of a new order, especially with existing aircraft undergoing upgrades to the F4 standard. In contrast, the Typhoon provides an opportunity to further diversify operational capabilities and strategic partnerships, strengthening the already solid military cooperation with the United Kingdom, particularly through the joint No. 12 Squadron. Additionally, the purchase of new Typhoons can be seen as a political decision aimed at balancing relationships with multiple major defense suppliers, avoiding over-reliance on France, which has already supplied Rafales and various military equipment. Furthermore, support for the British industry, facing challenges with the Typhoon in the international market, may have influenced the decision. This strategic choice also allows Qatar to leverage the specific advantages of the Typhoon, such as its enhanced air superiority through the Captor-E radar and Meteor missile, complementing the capabilities already offered by the Rafale. In summary, this decision seems driven more by diplomatic and strategic considerations than by any technical shortcomings of the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon operated by Qatar is a high-tech multirole fighter equipped with the most advanced technologies. It features the AESA Captor-E radar for superior target detection and tracking, along with the advanced Defensive Aids Subsystem (DASS) for enhanced survivability and modern avionics that ensure high operational versatility. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines, the Typhoon reaches a maximum speed of Mach 2 and has a combat range of over 1,500 km. Its armament systems include a wide range of air-to-air missiles, such as the Meteor, precision-guided munitions, and the Brimstone missile for ground-attack missions, making it a formidable force in modern aerial combat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/qatar-increases-air-combat-power-with-additional-order-of-twelve-new-typhoon-fighters	2024-12-09T07:28:26-08:00

The first operational F-35A arrived in the Netherlands in October 2019 at Leeuwarden Air Base. By December 2021, the RNLAF declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its fleet, signaling readiness for limited combat operations. Initially, the Netherlands planned to acquire 85 F-35As to replace its aging F-16 fleet, but budget constraints later reduced the order. As of 2022, the Ministry of Defence expanded its plans, increasing the total to 52 aircraft. The first operational deployment of Dutch F-35s occurred in April 2022 when four jets were stationed in Bulgaria to support NATO’s enhanced Air Policing mission. The F-35A’s advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and electronic warfare capabilities have made it an essential component of NATO operations. Its introduction has significantly enhanced the RNLAF’s ability to detect, monitor, and respond to threats, particularly in high-tension areas like the Baltic. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans praised the rapid response of Dutch forces during the recent interceptions. 'This is why our people are there: to protect our collective airspace against Russian threats. As was once again evident on Friday, Russian forces are active in various ways near NATO airspace. Our allies in the Baltic states are pleased with our efforts. I am proud of our people who were able to immediately demonstrate their value to our security,' he said. The Baltic region remains a hotspot for military activity, with frequent incursions by Russian aircraft testing NATO’s readiness. These incidents underscore the importance of the QRA protocol, which allows NATO fighter jets to scramble within minutes to intercept and identify potential threats. The successful interception mission by Dutch F-35s highlights NATO’s resolve to protect its members and affirms the Netherlands’ role as a critical player in the alliance’s defense strategy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-dutch-f-35-fighter-jets-conduct-first-interceptions-of-russian-spy-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2024-12-09T06:59:02-08:00

On December 9, 2024, three K808 'White Tiger' vehicles paraded, proudly displaying the Peruvian and South Korean flags, symbolizing South Korea's growing importance to the Peruvian Armed Forces and Peru’s commitment to modernizing its aging fleet. The fleet, still largely composed of Soviet-era vehicles such as the T-55 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), demonstrates the need for modernization. The BMP-1, developed in the 1960s, is equipped with a 73mm cannon and anti-tank missile launcher but is outdated in terms of armor and weaponry by current standards. This reliance on aging equipment underscores the necessity for Peru to upgrade its armored fleet to meet the demands of modern battlefields and provide better protection and operational effectiveness for its troops. Peru has shown an increasing willingness to diversify and modernize its armed forces by turning to Western partners. This trend was reinforced in September 2024 when the government included funding for 24 new fighter jets in the 2025 budget. Among the options considered, the French Rafale emerged as a favorite, outpacing competitors like the American F-16 and Swedish Gripen. In November 2024, this shift continued with the Peruvian Congress authorizing the entry of 600 U.S. military personnel to assist with security preparations for the 2024 APEC meetings, further strengthening military ties with the United States. This shift represents a notable departure from Peru’s historical reliance on Russian military equipment. In the 2010s, the country had considered acquiring T-90 tanks to replace its aging T-55s. However, in 2023, significant challenges in obtaining spare parts for its MiG-29 fleet highlighted the limitations of cooperation with Russia. While relations with Moscow persist, decisions made between 2023 and 2024 demonstrate Peru’s growing commitment to strengthening partnerships with Western nations to meet the demands of modernizing its armed forces and aligning with contemporary military standards. Discussions about the South Korean agreements began several years ago, supported by consistent diplomatic efforts. In 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sent a letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, celebrating 60 years of bilateral relations and emphasizing the potential for increased defense cooperation. Between 2023 and 2024, Peruvian military delegations visited South Korea to witness demonstrations of the K808’s capabilities in scenarios simulating mountainous operations and counterterrorism missions. The K808, also known as 'Baekho' (White Tiger), was designed in 2003 and has proven its reliability in the South Korean Army, with over 500 units delivered. Capable of overcoming 40cm obstacles, crossing 1.5-meter trenches, and navigating waterways with its jet propulsion system, it is well-suited to Peru's challenging geography. Its central tire inflation system (CTIS) and advanced mobility make it a strategic asset for the Peruvian Armed Forces. This contract is part of a broader modernization program for Peru's armored fleet, which is still heavily reliant on outdated main battle tanks such as the T-55 and AMX-13 from the 1950s. With this initial order, the long-term outlook is promising. STX and Hyundai Rotem are already in discussions for additional orders and expanded technical collaboration with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian state arms manufacturer. This partnership, which could span several years, enhances South Korea’s strategic presence in the Latin American defense market. A Hyundai Rotem representative reaffirmed the company’s commitment to leveraging its technological expertise to ensure the success of this collaboration and support Peru’s defense objectives in the years ahead. The partnership between Hyundai Rotem and FAME S.A.C. aims to establish a lasting collaboration, paving the way for future contracts and supporting Peru’s defense modernization efforts. This agreement also solidifies South Korea’s position as a competitive player in the Latin American defense market, aligning with its global strategy for growth in the defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-modernizes-armored-fleet-with-south-korean-4x4-k808-ifvs-and-k2-tanks-to-replace-soviet-era-vehicles	2024-12-09T06:51:39-08:00
