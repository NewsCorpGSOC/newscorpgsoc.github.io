China's newest nuclear submarine reportedly sank at dock earlier this year, say U.S. officials	According to information published by CNN on September 26, 2024, China's latest nuclear-powered submarine, the first of its Zhou-class attack vessels, reportedly sank earlier this year while docked.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a Chinese Navy submarine. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The submarine, under construction at a shipyard near Wuhan, is believed to have gone down in the spring. Chinese authorities have attempted to keep the incident out of public view. The Zhou-class submarine, distinguished by its unique X-shaped stern designed for enhanced maneuverability, was seen docked in satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies on March 10. By June, however, further imagery indicated the submarine was no longer at the pier, raising questions about its fate. An unusual concentration of cranes at the shipyard during that period, spotted by Tom Shugart, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, hinted at ongoing recovery efforts. Shugart noted this level of activity was atypical for the site. Beijing has prioritized modernizing its submarine fleet as part of broader efforts to enhance the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy). The PLA currently operates a mix of nuclear-powered ballistic missile and attack submarines, alongside a significant fleet of diesel-powered submarines. Despite this modernization, the PLA Navy’s transparency on incidents such as this remains limited. When asked about the situation, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., said they had no information to provide. U.S. defense officials have not confirmed whether nuclear fuel was loaded onto the submarine at the time of the sinking, leaving critical details about the incident unknown. The loss has prompted questions about the oversight of China’s defense industry, which has historically been troubled by issues of corruption and accountability. The PLA Navy, currently the world’s largest by the number of ships, is expected to expand its submarine fleet in the coming years, with projections suggesting 65 submarines by 2025 and 80 by 2035. This growth comes as the U.S. identifies China as its principal strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in naval power.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinas-newest-nuclear-submarine-reportedly-sank-at-dock-earlier-this-year-say-u-s-officials	2024-09-27T00:46:55-07:00

Exclusive: Iran mediating talks for Russian missile transfer to Yemen's Houthis	According to information published by Reuters on September 24, 2024, Iran has facilitated secret negotiations between Russia and Yemen's Houthi rebels, aiming to transfer advanced anti-ship missiles to the militant group. The ongoing discussions, which have yet to result in a confirmed transfer, focus on supplying the Yakhont missile, also known as the P-800 Oniks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian P-800 Oniks missile. (Picture source: Wikipedia/ Boevaya mashina) Seven sources have indicated that while Moscow has not finalized the decision, the Yakhont missile would significantly enhance the Houthis' ability to target vessels in the Red Sea. Experts warn that this could increase the threat to U.S. and European warships, as well as disrupt global maritime trade further. The Wall Street Journal had reported in July that Russia was considering this missile transfer, but Iran's involvement in brokering the talks had not been previously disclosed. The Houthis have intensified their drone and missile strikes on ships in the Red Sea since November, partly in solidarity with Palestinians during the ongoing Gaza conflict. Their actions have already caused significant disruptions, sinking two ships and seizing another, forcing shipping companies to reroute cargo and prompting rising insurance costs for vessels navigating the area. Despite retaliatory strikes by the U.S. and Britain on Houthi positions, the group’s attacks continue. Two regional officials revealed that Russian and Houthi representatives have met in Tehran at least twice this year, with further meetings expected soon. These talks reportedly include plans to supply the Houthis with dozens of Yakhont missiles, which have a range of approximately 300 kilometers. Russia has previously provided Yakhont missiles to Iran-backed Hezbollah, and the current discussions, which began under Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, reflect a growing alignment between Moscow and Tehran. Western intelligence sources emphasize that Iran is mediating the talks but seeks to avoid direct involvement in the transfer. Some sources suggest that Russia's willingness to arm the Houthis may be linked to Western military aid to Ukraine. The transfer of Yakhont missiles, regarded as highly advanced, would represent a significant shift in regional security dynamics. Experts believe that the Houthis could use these weapons not only against Western naval forces but also as land-attack missiles, potentially threatening Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have raised the issue with Saudi Arabia, which shares concerns over the missile transfer. Russia's potential involvement has drawn alarm across the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/exclusive-iran-mediating-talks-for-russian-missile-transfer-to-yemens-houthis	2024-09-26T05:11:06-07:00

Japan's first warship passage through Taiwan Strait signals growing regional tensions	According to information published by Al Jazeera on September 26, 2024, Japan has reportedly sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time, signaling increased naval activity in a region marked by growing tensions with China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Takanami-class destroyer JS Sazanami. (Picture source: JMSDF) The destroyer, Sazanami, made the passage through the 180-kilometer strait, sailing alongside vessels from Australia and New Zealand. This transit, reported by Japanese media, comes as China intensifies its military presence near Japan. The Sazanami entered the strait from the East China Sea, taking more than 10 hours to complete its southward journey. The operation, conducted ahead of joint drills in the contested South China Sea, saw participation from New Zealand’s HMNZS Aotearoa and Australia’s HMAS Sydney. This move follows a recent passage by China’s aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, between two Japanese islands near Taiwan. Japan, which described this activity as 'totally unacceptable,' remains on alert over China's expanding military footprint. Tokyo recently reported a Chinese spy plane violating its airspace near islands off its southwestern coast, heightening concerns over Beijing’s growing assertiveness. Japan’s government has refrained from confirming details of the warship's passage, but spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi voiced concern over the increasing frequency of military actions in the region, particularly airspace violations. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reportedly ordered the Taiwan Strait transit in response to fears that Beijing’s actions could escalate if left unchecked. Taiwan Strait The Taiwan Strait is a strategically significant body of water that separates Taiwan from mainland China. It is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) wide at its narrowest point and connects the East China Sea to the north with the South China Sea to the south. This region has long been a focal point of geopolitical tension due to its critical location, historical claims, and military significance. One of the most pressing issues surrounding the Taiwan Strait is the status of Taiwan itself. Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates as a self-governing democracy but is claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a breakaway province. The PRC views reunification with Taiwan as a core national objective and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal, especially in light of Taiwan's growing international partnerships and the evolving dynamics of global defense alignments. The Taiwan Strait is crucial to global shipping, as many of the world's largest container ships pass through it. This waterway is a major conduit for goods moving between Asia and the rest of the world, particularly energy supplies like oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-first-warship-passage-through-taiwan-strait-signals-growing-regional-tensions	2024-09-26T04:05:54-07:00

Russian spy ships suspected of espionage in Baltic and North Seas	According to information published by Suddeutsche Zeitung on September 24, 2024, alarming activity by Russian ships in the Baltic and North Seas has raised suspicions of espionage and sabotage of critical infrastructure.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 865 Hydrographic survey vessel Sibirykov. (Picture source: Сделано у нас) The investigation, which involved journalists from six countries, revealed that Russian research ships, often equipped with military technology, have been spying on gas pipelines, data cables, wind farms, and military infrastructure in the region. One incident from October 2023 highlights the concern. The containership Newnew Polar Bear abruptly slowed down while crossing the Balticconnector pipeline, causing severe damage to the pipeline with its anchor. This came just months after the Russian seabed survey ship Sibiryakov was observed performing suspicious maneuvers, at least once directly over the pipeline, sparking suspicions that it might have been preparing for sabotage. Ships like the Sibiryakov are part of a broader network of Russian vessels conducting surveillance missions in the area. These research ships are said to be under the control of the Russian Ministry of Defense and are fitted with sophisticated equipment, including military-grade radar systems. The investigation tracked 72 Russian research vessels, which have made 428 voyages since the start of the war in Ukraine. Analysis of over 1,000 Morse code transmissions and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data points indicate that these activities have increased in recent months. Ships have been detected entering the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of several EU countries at low speeds, often below 5 knots, a tactic experts associate with espionage missions. Many of these incursions were in close proximity to vital infrastructure like gas pipelines and offshore wind farms. In Germany alone, over 2,600 Russia-affiliated vessels have reportedly made 'area visits' in German territorial waters since the Ukraine conflict began, with 143 of them flying the Russian flag. This prompted German authorities to increase their surveillance efforts, with government figures confirming that since 2023, 107 escort missions by police and navy frigates have been conducted to monitor suspicious activity in the country’s EEZ. One notable case involved the Yevgeniy Gorigledzha, a Russian vessel that loitered for more than eight hours near Fehmarn Island, a known NATO submarine diving area. The ship’s erratic zigzag movements raised concerns of potential espionage, leading to intervention by both a German police ship and a navy vessel. NATO experts warn that these activities could be preparatory steps for sabotage.

(Picture source: Russian social media) The fire control system is based on technology already used in the T-90M and T-14 Armata tanks, with adaptations that incorporate intelligent elements enabling the tank to identify various target types and make autonomous firing decisions. This adaptation is designed to enhance the RTK’s capability to engage targets without direct human input. The RTK’s control and movement systems combine components previously tested in other RTKs with new elements, facilitating automatic movement in formation, route planning, terrain evaluation, and obstacle navigation. The system employs sensors that operate across ultrasonic, visible, and infrared ranges, supported by a technical vision system and AI using trainable neural networks. This setup allows the RTK to assess its surroundings and respond accordingly. Murakhovsky mentioned that these heavy-class robotic systems might become part of the standard equipment in Russian Ground Forces units, potentially forming 'robotic' companies within larger formations, such as combined-arms regiments, which could contribute to their integration into military operations.

(Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) Army Recognition previously reported that the Shturm project involves four combat vehicle types. The first variant is equipped with a 125mm gun with a shortened barrel, the second carries missiles or a rocket-propelled infantry flamethrower with a thermobaric 'Shmel-M' warhead, the third is a robotic adaptation of the Terminator fire support vehicle fitted with two 30mm automatic cannons that launch thermobaric missiles instead of anti-tank missiles, and the fourth is an unmanned vehicle intended to operate alongside the TOS-1A 'Solntsepek' thermobaric rocket launcher system. The unmanned tanks feature sensors across ultrasonic, visible, and infrared spectrums that support automatic convoy movement, terrain assessment, and obstacle navigation. A comprehensive all-angle technical vision system, combined with AI based on trainable neural networks, allows these systems to evaluate situations and make operational decisions, ensuring the ability to navigate natural and engineered obstacles without direct human intervention. Military expert Yuri Knutov commented that deploying T-72-based unmanned tanks could change operational dynamics for the Russian Armed Forces, as these vehicles can be remotely controlled, thereby reducing risks to personnel under enemy fire. Knutov noted that integrating such robots might necessitate adjustments in the use of tanks and heavy armored vehicles, particularly considering the observed effectiveness of anti-tank guided missiles in recent conflicts. The use of unmanned tanks, including a captured Ukrainian T-72AMT now labeled 'Vasya' by Russian forces, may lead to adjustments in traditional armored tactics, emphasizing strategic deployment and reducing personnel risks. Knutov observed that despite the presence of numerous armored vehicles, anti-tank guided missiles have been notably effective in neutralizing them during the Ukraine conflict. For effective combat operations, it might be more efficient to deploy armored vehicles strategically, such as in a 'tank carousel' formation with three vehicles, rather than deploying larger numbers simultaneously. Introduced in 2011, the T-72B3 is an updated version of the T-72B tank, achieving performance levels comparable to more modern tanks like the T-90A. (Picture source: Russian social media) Introduced in 2011, the T-72B3 is an updated version of the T-72B tank, achieving performance levels comparable to more modern tanks like the T-90A.

Breaking News: Lebanese Hezbollah launches Qader 1 missile targeting Israeli intelligence headquarters	Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, launched a surface-to-surface Qader 1 ballistic missile from southern Lebanon targeting central Israel early this morning. Hezbollah has claimed the missile was aimed at the Mossad Israeli intelligence services headquarters near Herzliya, a city just north of Tel Aviv.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image of a Qadr missile being launched from a truck-mounted launcher during the Velayat-90 Naval Exercise. (Picture source: FARS Iranian Media) The Qader 1 ballistic missile is a surface-to-surface missile developed by Iran and supplied to its regional allies, including Hezbollah. It is designed for medium-range attacks and is part of a family of Iranian missiles aimed at enhancing the military capabilities of non-state actors. The missile is known for its precision and ability to carry significant payloads, making it a potent weapon in regional conflicts. With an estimated range of 200 to 300 kilometers, the Qader 1 can strike deep into enemy territory, making it a strategic threat to areas such as Tel Aviv when deployed by groups like Hezbollah. The missile, launched from Hezbollah-controlled territory in southern Lebanon, was intercepted by Israel’s David’s Sling air defense missile system, which is designed to protect against medium-range missile threats. The system successfully neutralized the missile in mid-air, preventing any damage or casualties in the densely populated area of Tel Aviv. This marks one of the most brazen attacks by Hezbollah on Israeli territory in recent years, significantly raising the stakes in the already volatile Israel-Lebanon dynamic. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retaliated by targeting the Hezbollah missile launcher believed to be responsible for the attack. The launcher was located in Nafakhiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Lebanon. Israeli fighter jets carried out precision airstrikes on the site, destroying the launcher and reportedly crippling Hezbollah’s immediate missile-launch capabilities in the region. Israeli military officials have emphasized that this was a direct response to the attack and part of Israel’s broader strategy of deterrence against Hezbollah’s growing missile arsenal. Israel has long been concerned about Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated weaponry, much of which is believed to be supplied by Iran, and its ability to strike deep into Israeli territory. This attack from Hezbollah marks a dramatic escalation in the ongoing hostilities between Israel and the militant group, which operates with significant autonomy within Lebanon. The incident also puts Lebanon, a country grappling with severe economic and political crises, at the center of yet another potentially devastating conflict. Hezbollah’s decision to launch such a high-profile missile strike, targeting an intelligence installation in Israel’s heartland, signals a bold move by the group and could indicate increased Iranian influence on Hezbollah’s military strategy. Hezbollah, which wields considerable political and military power in Lebanon, has increasingly positioned itself as a key player in the region’s broader geopolitical struggles, particularly in the context of the Iran-Israel rivalry. In Lebanon, political leaders are facing increasing pressure as Hezbollah’s actions threaten to drag the country into a broader military conflict. With Lebanon already dealing with an economic collapse, the country may struggle to cope with the fallout from an extended military confrontation with Israel. As of now, both Israel and Hezbollah are closely watching the situation. The IDF continues to monitor Hezbollah's missile sites and its military infrastructure in Lebanon, and further retaliatory strikes could be launched depending on Hezbollah’s next moves. Today’s events mark a dangerous turning point in the longstanding conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. With both sides now directly engaging in military actions, the potential for a broader conflict looms large.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-lebanese-hezbollah-launches-qader-1-missile-targeting-israeli-intelligence-headquarters	2024-09-25T01:15:46-07:00	
China Conducts First Public Test of DF-41 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile in Pacific Ocean	On Wednesday, September 25, China publicly acknowledged the successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean, an unprecedented event that raises international concerns. The missile, carrying a dummy warhead and likely a DF-41, was launched by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force at 8:44 a.m. Beijing time. The Chinese Ministry of Defense emphasized that this test was part of routine annual exercises and was not directed against any particular country.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link DF-41 ICBM TELs on parade, 2019 (Picture source: PLA) The DF-41 (Dong Feng-41) is a Chinese ICBM known for its maximum range, estimated between 12,000 and 15,000 kilometers, making it China's longest-range missile. It is designed for mobile deployment on roads, railways, or from silos, offering significant flexibility. Powered by a three-stage solid-fuel engine, the missile can carry up to 10 independently targetable nuclear warheads (MIRVs), allowing it to strike multiple targets simultaneously. It uses an inertial guidance system with stellar or satellite updates and has an estimated circular error probable (CEP) of about 100 meters.Developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), the DF-41 began testing in 2012, demonstrating its ability to carry MIRVs. It entered limited production in 2019, and 16 launchers were unveiled during China's 70th-anniversary parade. This missile is part of China's ongoing modernization of its nuclear deterrent capabilities, aiming to counter advancements in missile defense systems and maintain a credible retaliatory strike capacity.Analysts point out that China usually conducts such tests within its own airspace, making this event particularly noteworthy. Ankit Panda, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, commented that this test could reflect China's nuclear modernization efforts, especially in response to improvements in U.S. missile defenses and enhanced surveillance systems.According to the Ministry of Defense's statement, the missile 'landed in predetermined maritime areas,' confirming that the test had achieved its objectives. The ministry also indicated that the concerned countries had been notified in advance. This exercise aimed to test the weapon's performance as well as the training level of the troops involved. The last time China launched a full-range ICBM was during the DF-5 missile launch in May 1980.In May 2023, a leak of U.S. intelligence revealed that China had successfully tested a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), designated as the DF-27. This missile, according to a classified U.S. intelligence report published in 2023, was reportedly tested on February 25 and traveled 2,100 kilometers in 12 minutes. Although the U.S. Department of Defense has not confirmed the authenticity of this report, it suggests that the DF-27 could have a range between 5,000 and 8,000 kilometers, capable of reaching targets as distant as Guam, Alaska, or parts of Australia. China conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), likely the DF-41, capable of traveling approximately 12,000 kilometers (Picture source: Duan Dang) This test illustrates China's strategic military modernization, which includes the expansion of its nuclear arsenal. In 2023, the Pentagon reported that China possessed more than 500 operational nuclear warheads, a number expected to exceed 1,000 by 2030. Meanwhile, China is constructing hundreds of silos for ground-based ICBMs. This increase in Chinese nuclear capabilities contrasts with the arsenals of the United States and Russia, each of which has over 1,700 deployed warheads.Despite this buildup, China has reaffirmed its commitment to a 'no first use' policy regarding nuclear weapons, with its arsenal under the exclusive control of the Central Military Commission led by President Xi Jinping. However, tensions remain high, particularly with Taiwan, which has reported an increase in Chinese military activities around the island. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense confirmed detecting 23 Chinese military aircraft operating near its territory on the same day as the missile test.This test takes place in the context of intensified military activities in the Asia-Pacific region, where China and other regional actors like North Korea continue their missile tests. In September, North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan, further heightening regional tensions.The People's Republic of China is building and deploying a sophisticated and modern missile arsenal, although this process remains shrouded in mystery due to Beijing's intentional ambiguity and refusal to adhere to arms control or transparency agreements. Chinese missiles play a central role in emerging anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) doctrines, combining ballistic and cruise missiles launched from air, land, and sea to target U.S. and allied military assets in the Asia-Pacific region. China is also developing several advanced capabilities, such as maneuverable anti-ship ballistic missiles, multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), and hypersonic glide vehicles.These combined trends threaten the survival of key elements of U.S. power projection, such as aircraft carriers and forward air bases. Additionally, China possesses a relatively small but developing contingent of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking U.S. territory, as well as a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-conducts-first-public-test-of-df-41-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-in-pacific-ocean	2024-09-25T01:02:03-07:00

China's Navy launches first-ever three aircraft carrier deployment, marking strategic shift in Asia-Pacific	According to information published by HK01 on September 24, 2024, for the first time, the Chinese Navy has simultaneously deployed three aircraft carriers: the Liaoning, Shandong, and Fujian.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Chinese PLA Navy's Carrier Strike Group Shandong. (Picture source: PLA South Sea Fleet) According to reports, these carriers are conducting exercises and sea trials in the Philippine Sea, near Hainan Island, and off the coast of Shanghai, showcasing China's entry into a new era of multi-carrier operations in the region. The Liaoning and Shandong carriers have long been integral to China's naval forces. The Fujian, China's first domestically built carrier equipped with electromagnetic catapult technology, is currently undergoing its fourth sea trial. Analysts suggest that, once fully operational, the Fujian will operate alongside the other two carriers, further enhancing China’s power projection capabilities across the Asia-Pacific region. This simultaneous deployment demonstrates China's improved combat readiness and strategic positioning, particularly in areas such as the South China Sea and around Taiwan. The presence of these carriers, supported by destroyers, submarines, and supply ships, sends a clear message to regional powers about China's growing ability to respond to potential conflicts and extend its naval reach. Recent satellite imagery confirms that all three carriers were at sea as of September 18. The Liaoning was observed near the Philippine Sea, while the Shandong was conducting maneuvers around Hainan Island. Meanwhile, the Fujian has left its dock in Shanghai for further testing. Reports indicate that each carrier group includes a number of escort ships, including destroyers and possibly submarines, further underlining the sophistication of China's carrier operations.

Spanish Army Confirms Acquisition of 4,500 Peugeot Landtrek for Non-Combat Missions	The Ejército de Tierra has officially confirmed the acquisition of 4,500 Peugeot Landtrek vehicles as part of its VMTT (Vehículo Militar Todoterreno Táctico) program. This contract, which will span over four years, marks a significant step in the renewal of the Spanish Army's fleet of military vehicles. These new vehicles are intended to replace the PS10 Anibal, purchased in 2004, which has never fully met the army's expectations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Peugeot Landtrek is a versatile mid-size pickup truck designed for a variety of terrains and tasks (Picture source: Peugeot) Two companies competed for this contract: Iturri, representing the Peugeot Landtrek, and TSD, which offered the Ford Ranger. In March 2024, the Army’s Logistics Support Command (MALE) had already expressed its preference for the Landtrek, a decision that was subsequently contested. TSD filed a legal appeal to challenge the procurement process. However, the Spanish court rejected TSD's appeal, allowing MALE to confirm the contract with Iturri, valued at 217 million euros.The choice of the Peugeot Landtrek may surprise some observers, as the vehicle is based on the Kaicene F70, a pick-up truck designed by Chinese manufacturer Chang’an Automobile. Despite this partially non-French origin, the vehicle convinced Spanish authorities with its performance and suitability for the army's specific needs. It is important to note that these vehicles will not be used for combat missions. The Spanish Ministry of Defense clarified that they will be employed for 'tactical tasks removed from combat-related activities,' such as liaison missions within the national territory.In addition to the Ejército de Tierra, other Spanish armed forces will benefit from this acquisition. Peugeot Landtreks will also be delivered to the Guardia Civil, the Ejército del Aire y del Espacio, and the Armada Española, as part of a broader modernization of unprotected military vehicles. The Peugeot Landtrek is a versatile mid-size pickup truck designed for a variety of terrains and tasks, offering both 4x2 and 4x4 drive options. It is available with two main engine types: a 1.9L turbodiesel engine delivering 150 hp and 350 Nm of torque, and a 2.4L turbocharged petrol engine with 210 hp and 320 Nm of torque. Depending on the model, these engines are paired with either a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission.The Landtrek is built for durability and can handle heavy-duty tasks, with a payload capacity exceeding 1 ton and a towing capacity up to 3 tons. Its off-road capabilities are supported by features such as Hill Descent Control and a rear differential lock, making it suitable for rough terrains. Depending on the version, the ground clearance ranges from 214 mm to 235 mm, providing the vehicle with excellent off-road performance.This type of procurement echoes similar situations in other countries, such as France, where the selection of military vehicles has sometimes sparked debate. For example, in 2015, the French Ministry of Defense faced criticism after announcing the acquisition of Ford Rangers to replace Peugeot P4s, instead of choosing vehicles offered by French brands such as Renault or Citroën. Similarly, the Gendarmerie faced controversy when it opted for the Seat Leon Cupra to replace the Megane RS within its rapid intervention teams. In both cases, the preference for non-French brands led to protests, with some officials arguing that the military and security forces should prioritize supporting the national industry.These instances demonstrate that decisions regarding military equipment can raise complex issues involving performance, cost, and political or industrial considerations. In Spain's case, the choice of the Peugeot Landtrek, despite its partial Chinese origins, appears to be driven by the need to quickly and efficiently modernize the army’s fleet of off-road vehicles while adhering to strict budgetary constraints.The acquisition of these 4,500 vehicles is part of a broader effort to modernize Spain’s military capabilities, addressing current operational needs while anticipating future challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/spanish-army-confirms-acquisition-of-4-500-peugeot-landtrek-for-non-combat-missions	2024-09-25T00:18:54-07:00

Hezbollah Uses Soviet Tu-143 Drones Converted into Cruise Missiles Amid Growing Conflict with Israel	The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has escalated significantly with Hezbollah’s use of Soviet-era Tu-143 drones, converted into cruise missiles. On September 23, 2024, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) released a video claiming to show an airstrike that occurred several weeks earlier, targeting a house in southern Lebanon containing what they referred to as a 'DR-3 cruise missile' ready for launch. The DR-3 is another designation for the Soviet Tu-143 Reys reconnaissance drone. This conversion marks the first known appearance of these modified drones in Hezbollah’s arsenal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link According to IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the missile was hidden inside a house, and Hezbollah had created a specific opening for its launch (Picture source: X Channel @manniefabian) For months, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been on the rise, driven by a series of border incidents and inflammatory rhetoric from both sides. Hezbollah, which already possesses a large stockpile of missiles and rockets, views the introduction of the converted Tu-143 as a new offensive capability. Originally designed for reconnaissance, this drone has been adapted for long-range strikes, a tactic also used by Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.The IDF used a photo of the Tu-143 to illustrate the missile they claimed to have destroyed before its launch. According to IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the missile was hidden inside a house, and Hezbollah had created a specific opening for its launch. 'The terrorists created a designated opening for the missile launch. Here, you can see how we identified the terrorists preparing the missile for launch,' Hagari explained. The IDF claimed that they precisely struck the missile and its infrastructure, eliminating the threat shortly before it could be fired.The Tu-143 is independent of runways, using rocket assistance for launch from a rail on a trailer or launch vehicle. In its cruise missile form, it has an estimated range of around 200 kilometers and is capable of carrying a 272-kilogram warhead, allowing Hezbollah to target cities as far away as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. However, the accuracy of these converted missiles remains uncertain unless substantial upgrades have been made to their guidance systems.Israel has voiced concerns about Hezbollah’s use of civilian structures to hide and launch weapons, complicating counter-strike efforts and raising humanitarian concerns. The IDF claims to have destroyed additional weapons hidden within civilian homes and buildings in Lebanon. Hezbollah, on the other hand, claims to have an extensive underground network for launching its weapons, including multiple rocket launch systems.The origin of these converted Tu-143 drones is not entirely clear. Russia had previously supplied some of these drones to the Assad regime in Syria, which is also supported by Hezbollah’s key ally, Iran. Additionally, Tehran has provided Moscow with ballistic missiles and drones as part of a growing military relationship between the two nations. It is possible that Hezbollah obtained these drones either via Syria or directly from Iran. In its cruise missile form, the Tu-143 has an estimated range of around 200 kilometers and is capable of carrying a 272-kilogram warhead, allowing Hezbollah to target cities as far away as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Picture source: WikiCommun) This escalation comes in the context of increased tensions following the surprise attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hezbollah launched its most recent campaign of missile, rocket, and drone strikes against Israel the day after, and both sides have been trading fire almost daily since. Israel has conducted heavy bombardments of Lebanon for several days, with some analysts suggesting that a limited invasion might be considered to create a buffer zone, allowing thousands of residents in northern Israel to return to their homes.Recent coordinated explosions targeting thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon have also contributed to the growing tensions. Hezbollah has attributed these explosions to Israel and vowed retaliation. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, has threatened Israel with 'severe retribution and just punishment,' claiming that the retaliation will occur 'where it expects and where it does not.'In response to the escalating violence, the Pentagon announced on Monday that additional U.S. troops would be deployed to the region. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon’s spokesperson, did not provide specific details regarding the number of troops or their mission, citing operational security reasons. This drone was adapted for long-range strikes, a tactic also used in Ukraine by Russia, as shown by the debris found (Picture source: X Channel @COUPSURE ) The extent of Hezbollah’s converted jet drone arsenal remains unknown, as does whether these weapons have already been used. Unlike in Ukraine, no wreckage has yet been found confirming their use in Lebanon. This situation highlights the spread of improvised long-range strike tactics in current conflicts.According to the IDF, Hezbollah’s known arsenal includes the following:Hezbollah possesses the DR-3 missile (Tu-143), which has a range of several hundred kilometers, an explosive warhead weighing between 2 and 3 tons, and a missile weight of 300 kilograms. The group also has short-range attack drones, like the Model 107, which are used for surveillance and attack purposes. These drones have a range of 15-100 kilometers and carry a 1.5-kilogram warhead, capable of striking targets across Israel, particularly critical infrastructure, with the aid of advanced targeting systems.Regarding rockets, Hezbollah has a large stockpile of short-range rockets, with a range of up to 50 kilometers and the ability to carry warheads of up to 100 kilograms. The group also has heavy rockets with a range of up to 15 kilometers, carrying warheads of up to 1,000 kilograms.Finally, Hezbollah possesses long-range rockets capable of penetrating fortified targets, with a range of 50-200 kilometers and warheads weighing between 100 and 500 kilograms. This diverse arsenal represents a serious threat to Israel’s security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/hezbollah-uses-soviet-tu-143-drones-converted-into-cruise-missiles-amid-growing-conflict-with-israel	2024-09-24T06:52:40-07:00	
Escalation of Conflict Between Israel and Hezbollah: Northern Arrows Operation at Heart of Tensions	The conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has reached a new level with the launch of the 'Northern Arrows' operation by the Israeli army on September 23, 2024. As hostilities intensify, this major military operation aims to neutralize the threat posed by Hezbollah on Israel's northern border.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshots from video footage of the strikes conducted by Israel on Lebanon on September 23, 2024 (Picture source: X channel @0Informations) For several months, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been increasing, fueled by a series of border incidents and escalating rhetoric on both sides. Hezbollah, a Shiite political-military organization backed by Iran, has intensified its rocket attacks toward northern Israel in support of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. These actions prompted a strong response from the Israeli army, determined to ensure the security of its citizens and neutralize Hezbollah's offensive capabilities. In recent weeks, exchanges of fire have multiplied. Hezbollah has launched thousands of rockets and drones toward Israeli territory, targeting military installations and civilian areas. Israel, in turn, has conducted targeted airstrikes against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. The situation reached a critical point on September 23, 2024, when the Israeli army initiated the 'Northern Arrows' operation. This operation, announced by Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, aims to significantly weaken Hezbollah's military capabilities. 'The situation requires continuous and intense action on all fronts,' Halevi stated. The Israeli air forces have struck over 1,300 targets in Lebanon, including missile launchers, military buildings, and weapons depots. These strikes have affected southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and, for the first time in years, regions further north such as Mount Lebanon. Image of a Hezbollah rocket allegedly located in a civilian house in Lebanon (Picture source: IDF) The primary objective of the 'Northern Arrows' operation is to destroy Hezbollah's offensive capabilities and secure Israel's northern border. According to Israeli military sources, Hezbollah was preparing a major offensive called 'Conquer the Galilee,' aiming to infiltrate Israeli territory and carry out attacks against civilians. The elimination of senior Hezbollah figures, including Ibrahim Aqil, the alleged architect of this plan, is a key component of this strategy. Israel asserts that it is acting based on precise intelligence to target Hezbollah's military infrastructure while minimizing civilian casualties. Warnings have been sent to civilian populations to evacuate certain areas before the strikes. However, reports indicate difficulties for civilians attempting to leave dangerous zones, with Hezbollah accused of preventing evacuations to use inhabitants as human shields. The operation also seeks to prevent Hezbollah from strengthening its positions by taking advantage of international attention focused on the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah, with its military experience and an arsenal estimated at 150,000 rockets and missiles, represents a threat to Israel's security. Israeli strikes aim to degrade its command and control capabilities and reduce its stockpiles of armaments. In response, Hezbollah has intensified its rocket fire, targeting Israeli northern cities such as Haifa and Kiryat Shmona. Alerts have sounded in several localities, and material damage has been reported. The current escalation raises concerns about a potential expansion of the conflict, with the risk of more direct involvement by Iran and other regional actors. Map showing the various strikes conducted by Israel on Lebanon since September 23, 2024 (Picture source: LiveuaMap) The international community is apprehensive about this volatile situation. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed concern over the escalation of violence and has called for restraint. The United States, an ally of Israel, has announced it is working on 'concrete ideas' to restore calm, while Russia has warned of the risk of regional destabilization. The 'Northern Arrows' operation marks a turning point in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. While Israel had previously favored targeted actions to contain the threat, this large-scale offensive demonstrates its determination to eliminate Hezbollah's offensive capabilities. The extent to which this escalation will continue remains uncertain. A ground invasion of Lebanon by Israel is not ruled out, although such an option carries the risk of a prolonged and costly engagement. Hezbollah faces a dilemma. Despite its arsenal and experience, it is suffering significant losses and sees its capabilities further reduced, especially following last week's explosion of beepers and walkie-talkies. In the short term, there is currently no indication that a de-escalation of the conflict is on the horizon, despite international pressure and the growing risks of destruction to Lebanese infrastructure.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/escalation-of-conflict-between-israel-and-hezbollah-northern-arrows-operation-at-heart-of-tensions	2024-09-24T05:50:52-07:00	
Norwegian shipyards compete for historic Navy frigate contract in 2029 modernization plan	According to information published by Aftenposten on September 23, 2024, for the first time in 60 years, Norway could once again see frigates built domestically. However, at least three foreign shipyards are vying for the opportunity.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Constellation class frigate. (Picture source: Fincantieri Marinette Marine) The Vard Group made their case to Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram (Sp), presenting a model of the Constellation-class frigate, highlighting why Norway should opt for this American design. Vard’s key argument lies in their connection to the American shipyard constructing the same frigates for the U.S. Navy. Both Vard and the U.S. yard share the same Italian parent company, Fincantieri. If Norway’s new frigates are to be built domestically, Vard’s Tomrefjord facility is seen as the most likely location. The defense minister expressed satisfaction with the presentation but offered no promises. The competition is heating up, with 11 countries initially invited to bid, a list that will be narrowed to three or four by winter. The frigate procurement is part of a broader modernization plan, with at least five new warships to be introduced starting in 2029. These vessels are projected to become one of Norway’s largest defense investments, potentially rivaling the F-35 fighter jet program. A single frigate could cost between 7 and 12 billion NOK, with total costs, including helicopters, weapons, and maintenance over several decades, approaching 100 billion NOK. One key requirement is that the new frigates must excel in anti-submarine warfare, equipped with advanced sonar, torpedoes, and space for helicopters. The consensus is clear: this time, Norway must buy an off-the-shelf design already in production to meet tight timelines. The strategic decision on which country to partner with for this project is critical. The new frigates will be procured, operated, and maintained in collaboration with a close ally, one whose strategic interests align with Norway's need to monitor the North Atlantic, home to Russia’s Northern Fleet bases. Among the most likely candidates are the U.S. and the U.K., although France and the Netherlands/Belgium are also in the running. The potential designs include the American Constellation-class, the British Type 26, the French FDI, and the Dutch ASWF.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/norwegian-shipyards-compete-for-historic-navy-frigate-contract-in-2029-modernization-plan	2024-09-24T05:44:18-07:00

US considers sending AGM-154 glide bombs to Ukraine to strike distant Russian positions	On September 20, 2024, information published by 'Politico' indicated that the United States is considering sending the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) called glide bomb to Ukraine as part of a new $375 million military aid package. This advanced precision-guided munition is expected to significantly enhance the operational effectiveness of Ukraine's new fleet of F-16 fighter jets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35 Lightning II Pax River Integrated Test Force from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 23 conducted the first weapons separation test of an AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) from an F-35C Lightning II carrier variant March 23. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The AGM-154 JSOW is a family of low-cost, air-to-ground glide bombs developed by Raytheon Technologies. Designed for standoff engagements, it allows aircraft to release the weapon from a considerable distance away from the target area, thereby minimizing the risk to pilots and aircraft from enemy air defenses. With a range of up to 130 km when launched from high altitude, the JSOW enables strikes without entering heavily defended airspace. Its GPS/INS navigation systems provide high accuracy against both stationary and moving targets. A Glide bomb is a type of precision-guided munition designed to glide towards its target after being released from an aircraft, allowing it to hit distant targets without requiring the plane to fly directly over them. Unlike traditional bombs that fall freely under gravity, Glide bombs are equipped with aerodynamic surfaces and control systems, enabling them to maneuver and extend their range. Some Glide bombs are equipped with GPS or laser guidance systems for enhanced accuracy, and they are often used to minimize risks to pilots by allowing attacks from standoff distances. This weapon can be configured with various warheads, including unitary blast-fragmentation and submunitions, making it effective against a wide range of targets such as armored vehicles, infrastructure, and air defense systems. Advanced versions of the JSOW are equipped with datalink capabilities, allowing for in-flight target updates and retargeting, which enhances mission flexibility. The introduction of the AGM-154 JSOW into Ukraine's arsenal is poised to significantly boost its combat capabilities. The standoff range of the JSOW allows Ukrainian forces to engage high-value targets deep within contested territories without exposing their aircraft to enemy air defenses. This capability is crucial for disrupting supply lines, command and control centers, and other strategic assets held by opposing forces. By enabling attacks from outside the reach of most surface-to-air missiles, the JSOW reduces the risk to pilots and aircraft—a critical factor given the advanced air defense systems deployed in the region. The weapon's advanced guidance systems ensure high accuracy, minimizing collateral damage and increasing the likelihood of mission success. This precision is vital for operations conducted in areas where avoiding civilian casualties is a priority. The JSOW's ability to be reprogrammed in-flight allows pilots to respond dynamically to changing battlefield conditions, making operations more adaptive and effective. Its compatibility with F-16 fighter jets means Ukraine can fully leverage the capabilities of its new aircraft fleet, thereby enhancing overall air combat effectiveness. The potential transfer of AGM-154 JSOWs signifies a deepening military collaboration between the United States and Ukraine. It reflects a strategic effort to equip Ukraine with advanced offensive systems that can serve as a deterrent against aggression. However, this move may also escalate regional tensions, as supplying such advanced weaponry could be perceived by opposing forces as a significant shift in the balance of power, potentially leading to heightened military responses. As of October 2023, the United States has continued to provide substantial military aid to Ukraine in response to Russia's ongoing invasion. This aid includes advanced weaponry such as High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), anti-aircraft systems, armored vehicles, and various types of drones. The U.S. has also supplied significant amounts of ammunition and provided training to Ukrainian forces to enhance their operational effectiveness. In addition to equipment and training, the U.S. government has allocated billions of dollars in financial assistance to support Ukraine's defense efforts. This support is part of a broader international coalition aimed at upholding Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The aid underscores the U.S. commitment to maintaining regional stability and deterring further aggression.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-considers-sending-agm-154-glide-bombs-to-ukraine-to-strike-distant-russian-positions	2024-09-24T03:10:22-07:00

These tests ensure that the design of the aircraft is solid and matches the previously established digital models. The next phase will involve a fatigue testing campaign aimed at assessing the long-term durability of the aircraft’s airframe. Once these tests are completed, the B-21 will be transferred to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, which will become the primary operational base for the aircraft. At the Air, Space and Cyber Conference held by the Air and Space Forces Association on September 18, 2024, updates on the B-21 Raider program were provided by Department of the Air Force officials and industry partners. The B-21 will gradually replace the B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit bombers, becoming a key element of the U.S. Air Force’s flexible global strike capability. General Thomas Bussiere, commander of Global Strike Command, emphasized that the B-21 Raider will bring unprecedented capabilities, particularly due to its advanced stealth and its ability to deliver a mix of conventional and nuclear munitions. He also noted that the demand for bomber forces from regional commands is not expected to decrease in the coming years, but rather to increase. William Bailey, director of the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office, and Thomas Jones, president of the Aeronautics Systems sector at Northrop Grumman, provided further insights into the program’s progress. Jones mentioned that the pace of flight tests is accelerating, with up to two test flights per week. He also reaffirmed the program's initial commitment to design a system capable of flying daily. The panelists highlighted the success of the static tests on a ground test article, confirming the structural integrity of the B-21’s design. Bailey added that the collaboration between operators and acquisition leaders has been crucial to the program's success, allowing it to meet the demands of great power competition. The B-21 Raider is designed to be a long-range, highly survivable stealth bomber capable of carrying out nuclear deterrence missions while also delivering conventional strikes. It will play a fundamental role in the U.S. nuclear triad as the 'air leg' of this strategic system. This flexibility will be critical to responding to evolving threats, Bailey emphasized. General Bussiere added that the B-21 fleet will provide vital support to U.S. allies while sending a strong message to potential adversaries. He also highlighted that the B-21, with its cutting-edge technology, represents a unique capability that few other nations can match, making the aircraft indispensable in future deterrence strategies. The B-21 program aims to produce at least 100 aircraft. In addition to Ellsworth Air Force Base, other bases will also host B-21 bombers. Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas will be the next to receive these revolutionary aircraft.

(Picture source: US DoD) This initiative is part of the project called the 'Patriot Puzzle,' launched by former Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren. According to this plan, the Netherlands, along with other partner countries, will provide different components of the Patriot system so that Ukraine can have a complete and operational air defense system. Brekelmans emphasized that several nations are ready to help Ukraine strengthen its air defense capabilities, though some are facing logistical or technical difficulties that are slowing the delivery of necessary equipment. 'These countries are encountering obstacles that make it difficult to assemble this system. It also depends on the willingness of other nations to disclose information about what they are providing. However, we are not always transparent about this because it is crucial not to inform Russia. Sharing too many operational details could enhance their knowledge, which we want to avoid,' Brekelmans added. At the end of the summer, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba expressed his frustration with the delays in delivering the Patriot systems, calling on Ukraine's international partners to speed up the process. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the military estimates it needs 25 Patriot defense systems to effectively cover the entire Ukrainian territory. The Patriot system is a long-range air defense system designed to operate at all altitudes and in all weather conditions. Developed in the United States, it is currently used by many countries such as Germany, Israel, Japan, Poland, Qatar, Romania, and more recently, Ukraine. Its design relies on missiles capable of targeting and destroying various aerial threats, such as aircraft and ballistic missiles. The missile used by the Patriot system, the PAC-3, weighs around 700 kg and measures approximately 5.2 meters in length. Its range varies from 20 to 35 kilometers, offering extensive coverage against enemy threats. Unlike many other systems, the PAC-3 missile does not use an explosive warhead. Its destruction relies on a 'hit-to-kill' approach, meaning it destroys its targets through the kinetic energy generated by direct impact. This makes it particularly effective against ballistic missiles, where precision and impact force are crucial. The PAC-3 is equipped with a sophisticated guidance system, based on an active radar located in the nose of the missile. This radar allows the missile to autonomously track and engage its targets. Additionally, mid-course updates are provided by the ground-based radar, the AN/MPQ-65, complementing the missile's onboard inertial navigation system. With a maximum speed of Mach 5 (approximately 6,173 km/h), the PAC-3 is capable of responding rapidly to aerial threats. The AN/MPQ-65 radar, in turn, is a key component of the Patriot system, providing critical information on targets and enabling constant monitoring of airspace. In July, the United States announced a new military aid package that included a Patriot system, while President Zelensky confirmed the arrival of a Patriot system from Germany.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/netherlands-plans-to-supply-ukraine-with-three-patriot-launchers-very-soon	2024-09-24T01:27:50-07:00	
Rare Images of Launch of HJ-10 Anti-Tank Missile from a Chinese Armored Vehicle	Rare footage was recently broadcast on September 23 by Chinese television network CCTV-7, showing the launch of the HJ-10 anti-tank missile from a Chinese armored vehicle. These images provide insight into the capabilities of this weapon system, which represents one of the latest additions to China's advanced missile arsenal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Designed with a standard aerodynamic layout, the missile features X-shaped wings that deploy after launch (Picture source: CCTV-7) The HJ-10, also known as 'Red Arrow 10,' is an anti-tank missile developed by China's NORINCO corporation. Equipped with a tandem high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead, it can penetrate up to 1,400 mm of conventional steel armor, even when protected by explosive reactive armor. Its maximum operational range is 10 km, and it has the ability to lock onto a target either before or after launch. The missile is characterized by its cylindrical body with a hemispherical nose cap. Designed with a standard aerodynamic layout, it features X-shaped wings that deploy after launch. Powered by solid propellant engines for both launch and cruise, it measures 1,850 mm in length, has a diameter of 165 mm, and weighs 43 kg at launch. Its cruising speed is 150 m/s, accelerating to 230 m/s during the final phase of its trajectory. A notable feature of the HJ-10 is its advanced guidance system, which combines television or infrared (IIR) imaging, an inertial system, and a two-way fiber-optic data transmission channel. The target image is transmitted to the operator's console, while control commands are sent back to the missile through the same channel. This system enables various applications, including 'fire-and-forget,' command guidance, post-launch course correction, and target reacquisition. Future upgrades aim to replace the fiber-optic channel with a radio channel. The HJ-10 can engage targets directly or from above, using different types of warheads. These options include a tandem HEAT warhead, capable of penetrating 1,200 to 1,400 mm of homogeneous armor, and a 'penetrating core' warhead designed to strike targets from above. When paired with the high mobility features of the MV3 launch vehicle, the system offers a combination of speed, agility, and firepower that can significantly impact the battlefield. The vehicle, based on an all-terrain chassis, is designed for rapid deployment and effective operation in various tactical environments, with the ability to engage both ground and aerial targets, including helicopters. China has developed a diverse range of anti-tank missiles over the years. In addition to the HJ-10, the 'Red Arrow' series includes the HJ-8, a second-generation missile, and the HJ-12, a third-generation portable missile with 'fire-and-forget' capability. These developments reflect China's continued efforts to modernize its armed forces and adopt advanced military technologies to enhance its ground forces' capabilities. Progress in the field of anti-tank missiles highlights China's focus on adapting its military capabilities to evolving battlefield threats.

Russian Navy claims drone neutralized in Barents Sea drills using Poliment-Redut system	According to information published by Tass on September 24, 2024, during exercises in the Barents Sea, the frigate Admiral Golovko successfully engaged a strike drone using the ship-based Poliment-Redut air defense missile system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate Admiral Golovko. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The Admiral Golovko, a Northern Fleet frigate, was conducting a planned training exercise when it intercepted and destroyed an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) simulating a threat. The live-fire drill, part of the ship's air defense training, saw the vertical-launch Poliment-Redut system demonstrate its operational readiness. The target drone, launched from the Kola Peninsula, was part of a scenario designed to mimic a UAV on a course toward the ship. The missile firing took place within designated naval training zones, which had been closed to civilian shipping and air traffic to ensure safety. Comments The recent exercise involving Russia's Admiral Golovko frigate in the Barents Sea highlights significant trends in modern naval warfare, particularly the increasing role of unmanned systems and advanced air defense capabilities. The drill, which saw the frigate engage a drone using the Poliment-Redut surface-to-air missile system, reflects broader global trends in naval defense as modern warships are forced to contend with a range of airborne threats, from drones to advanced missile systems. Drones are becoming integral to modern naval strategies, serving roles in reconnaissance, targeting, and, increasingly, direct strikes. As demonstrated in this exercise, the threat posed by UAVs to naval assets has necessitated the development of robust anti-drone systems. Russia, like many other naval powers, recognizes the potential of drones to penetrate traditional air defense systems. UAVs are particularly effective because of their relatively low cost, expendability, and capacity for swarming tactics, which can overwhelm a ship's defenses. The Poliment-Redut system allows for rapid targeting and engagement, a necessity when dealing with smaller, faster, or more numerous targets. Its inclusion on Project 22350 frigates underscores Russia's emphasis on multi-layered defense, particularly as unmanned systems become more advanced and potentially more autonomous.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-navy-claims-drone-neutralized-in-barents-sea-drills-using-poliment-redut-system	2024-09-24T01:13:56-07:00

South Africa's new RG41 GT7 105mm self-propelled howitzer strengthens fire support for infantry units	Denel announced at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) 2024 event (the company's first public exhibition since its recent move to the South African Department of Defence) the integration of its RG41 eight-wheeled combat vehicle with a modified version of the G7 105 mm gun. This combination, which could be referred to as the RG41 GT7, is expected to offer fire support capabilities as a self-propelled artillery system for mechanized or motorized infantry units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 105 mm gun mounted on this vehicle is based on the G7 105 mm LEO towed howitzer but required technical modifications for vehicle mounting, resulting in the Denel GT7 gun. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Business Development Manager Isaac Karelse explained that the RG41 platform originated from Project Hoefyster, where it was intended as Denel's alternative to the Finnish Patria eight-wheeled platform, which eventually became the South African Army's Badger 8x8. At that time, the Patria was among the few eight-wheeled infantry fighting vehicles available. The RG41 was designed, tested, and sent to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for summer trials, where it performed according to expectations. However, changes in the UAE's requirements led to the selection of the RG35 vehicle instead of the RG41. As delays arose in the manufacturing of the Patria/Badger system, Denel proposed the RG41 as a potential option for Project Hoefyster to complement the Badger across various vehicle types. Karelse described this situation as the RG41 becoming a 'future requirement.' The vehicle was advertised for Middle Eastern markets, but the process was paused due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interim, Denel equipped the RG41 with remotely-operated turrets, specifically the Tactical Remote Turret (TRT), tested with both 20 mm and 30 mm cannon variants. During shooting trials at Armscor’s Alkantpan test range with the G6 155 mm self-propelled howitzer and the truck-mounted T5 system, Denel identified the potential to install a 105 mm gun on the RG41. The 105 mm gun is based on the G7 105 mm LEO towed howitzer but required technical modifications for vehicle mounting, resulting in the Denel GT7 gun. The RG41 originated from Project Hoefyster, where it was developed as Denel's alternative to the Finnish Patria eight-wheeled platform. This latter eventually became the South African Army's Badger 8x8, as depicted here in the Badger-MsIV missile carrier variant. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Denel then developed the T7 105 mm turret, which weighs 3,750 kg. Karelse noted that, while the turret is currently manned for testing and trials, plans are in place for it to be unmanned in the future. The RG41 GT7 can seat 11 personnel, including one driver, one vehicle commander, one gunner, one section commander, and seven section crew members. A standard infantry section usually comprises ten personnel, but in a mechanized environment, this number can be adjusted based on the vehicle's role. The vehicle is equipped with a safety belt system featuring a 4-point harness. The protection features of the RG41 include ballistic protection in accordance with STANAG 4569 Level 2, with an option to upgrade to Level 4 or 5. It also provides mine protection meeting STANAG 4569 Level 4A/3B standards, with the possibility of upgrading to Level 4B. The specific level of improvised explosive device (IED) protection has not been disclosed. Constructed with a V-shaped hull to offer landmine protection, the RG41 has a hardened armored 'shell' for the crew's safety. There is a gap between this shell and the external 'armor package,' ranging from 100 mm to 130 mm, which can be further reinforced with add-on armor. In counter-insurgency operations, wire mesh can be added with a gap to shield the armor from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and other projectiles. Karelse emphasized that the design prioritizes crew survivability, allowing the vehicle to protect its occupants even if damaged. Other variants of the RG41 were also developed in the past, such as an infantry fighting vehicle, a command vehicle, an ambulance, a recovery vehicle, and an engineering vehicle (Picture source: Army Recognition). The T7/G7 combination remains in the prototype stage and requires further development. It is projected to serve as a mobile self-propelled artillery system within mechanized battalion settings. The G7 gun has a maximum range of 30 km, and its ammunition is designed to offer effects comparable to standard 155 mm high-explosive shells, effectively delivering similar capabilities within a 105 mm framework. Rheinmetall Denel Munition (RDM) developed the ammunition types, which include high explosive, high explosive pre-formed fragmentation, smoke, illuminating, and other variants. The standard projectile range is 24 km with a boat tail and 30 km with base bleed, while the direct fire range extends from 500 to 2,000 meters. The G7/RG41 system is equipped with an Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) that interfaces with the Gun Control Unit (GCU), allowing for automatic gun laying through hydraulic elevation and traverse drives for rapid target engagement. The ammunition handling system utilizes a positive chain-type rammer controlled from the integrated Loader Control Panel, supporting fully automatic ramming of both the projectile and charge. Manual loading is also possible to ensure redundancy. In terms of specifications, the RG41 GT7 has a length of 7,780 mm, a hull width of 2,800 mm, and a hull height of 2,380 mm. The wheelbase dimensions are 1,693 mm between the first and second axles, 2,257 mm between the second and third axles, and 1,550 mm between the third and fourth axles. Ground clearance is measured at 440 mm, featuring an angle of approach of 64 degrees and an angle of departure of 54 degrees. The vehicle has a curb weight of 18,200 kg and a payload capacity of 9,800 kg to support the new turret, resulting in a total Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) of 28,000 kg. Like many South African-designed vehicles, the RG41 GT7 self-propelled howitzer benefits from a V-shaped armored hull to enhance mine protection. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The vehicle is powered by a Deutz engine, specifically the Model 2015TCD V6, with a displacement of 12.1 liters. The engine's maximum power output is 390 kW at 2,100 rpm, and it generates a maximum torque of 2,130 Nm at 1,300 rpm. The RG41 uses a ZF5HP902 transmission system, featuring a 5-speed configuration with an integral 2-speed drop-down capability. In terms of performance, the RG41 reaches a maximum speed of 100 km/h and can handle a gradeability of up to 70%. The transfer box is manufactured by Denel, with the gear ratio categorized under the Type 17,000 series. The steering system is a twin-steer, power-assisted, fully-integral model. The wheel heads are made by AxleTech, and the suspension system is independent, using hydro-pneumatic struts with hydraulic shock absorbers. The vehicle's braking system includes pneumatic disc brakes with ABS for the main brakes, while the parking brake is activated with air release disc brakes on all four rear wheels. The RG41 uses road wheels and tires with a 10.00R20 aluminum rim type, equipped with 16.00R20 Michelin XZL tires. Additionally, the vehicle is fitted with an RFI system, offering a 100 km range when traveling at a speed of 50 km/h. The standard projectile range for the G7 105mm gun is 24 km with a boat tail and 30 km with base bleed, while the direct fire range extends from 500 to 2,000 meters.

Russia gains Atlantic Port access through military deal with São Tomé and Príncipe	According to information published by Russian sources on September 23, 2024, Russia has moved to expand its military cooperation with São Tomé and Príncipe, opening potential new access points for the Russian Navy in the Atlantic.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Slava-class cruiser Marshal Ustinov in South Africa. (Picture source: Tass) The Russian government submitted an agreement for ratification by the State Duma that establishes military cooperation between Russia and the island nation. This agreement, which was signed in April 2024, has already been approved by the legal commission. The cooperation framework includes intelligence sharing and collaboration in the military sphere, as well as granting Russian naval vessels access to São Tomé and Príncipe’s ports for resupply and rest. This development is seen as strategically valuable given the limited number of ports currently available to Russian vessels globally. Comments Russia’s defense relationships with African nations have expanded significantly in recent years, reflecting a mix of security cooperation, economic interests, and geopolitical strategy. These ties are often cemented through arms deals, military training, and the provision of security forces, notably through private military contractors (PMCs) like Wagner Group. Russia has signed military cooperation agreements with 43 African countries, offering a broad range of services from personnel training to the supply of military equipment. This cooperation has increased notably in countries facing instability, coups, or Western disengagement, such as Mali, Central African Republic (CAR), and Sudan. One key feature of Russia’s approach has been its avoidance of imposing political conditions, making it an appealing partner for African regimes that prioritize regime security over democratic reforms. This is in contrast to Western powers that often tie military support to governance and human rights conditions. For example, Russia has established a strong presence in CAR, where Wagner Group supports the government in exchange for access to lucrative natural resources, including gold and diamonds. Similarly, in Mali and Niger, recent coups have led to a shift away from France and the West, with these nations now leaning toward Russian military support. Russia’s strategy in Africa also seeks to challenge Western influence by establishing strategic footholds, including potential naval bases and expanding its reach in critical maritime regions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-gains-atlantic-port-access-through-military-deal-with-sao-tome-and-principe	2024-09-24T00:38:01-07:00

The purchase was made without a public tender, in accordance with Brazilian public procurement law, to ensure logistical standardization of the armed forces' equipment. The drone lost in May 2024 belonged to the First Squadron of the Twelfth Aviation Group (1º/12º GAv) of the FAB, based at Santa Maria Air Base (BASM). The aircraft was on an aerial surveillance mission to support rescue operations for flood victims in southern Brazil when it suffered a technical failure and crashed. The drone, an Hermes RQ-900 model, is known for its medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) flight capabilities, allowing it to monitor large areas for extended periods. The acquisition of the new drone was justified by the need to maintain uniformity in the Brazilian armed forces' equipment. The Elbit Hermes 900 drone, already widely used by the FAB, is a crucial component of Brazil’s aerial surveillance and rapid response strategy, as demonstrated by its use during recent natural disasters. The FAB is not the only branch of the Brazilian military using drones in its operations. The Brazilian Army and Navy also operate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for various strategic purposes. These initiatives include the Army Aviation Program, the Integrated Border Monitoring System (SISFRON), and the Full Operational Capability Acquisition Program (OCOP), which foresee increased use of drones for surveillance, reconnaissance, and border security. Drones such as the Hermes RQ-900 have proven useful not only in traditional military operations but also in disaster relief missions, as seen during the devastating floods in Brazil. The RQ-900 model is capable of flying at medium altitudes for over 30 hours, providing real-time imagery to ground teams and enabling better coordination of rescue efforts. The Hermes RQ-900 drone boasts impressive technical specifications, making it a top-tier surveillance and reconnaissance platform. Designed to be operated by a two-person ground crew, it can carry a payload of 450 kg, offering considerable flexibility for sensors, communication equipment, or weaponry. With a length of 8.3 meters and a wingspan of 15 meters, the aircraft has a gross weight of 1,100 kg, powered by a Rotax 916 engine producing 160 kW (210 hp), allowing it to reach a maximum speed of 220 km/h. In terms of endurance, it can remain airborne for up to 36 hours at a maximum altitude of 9,100 meters, providing extended coverage for long-duration missions. Additionally, it is compatible with weapons systems such as the Spike missile, enhancing its role not only in surveillance but also in targeted strike operations. The Hermes 900 is equipped to carry up to four six-person life-rafts, mounted on its wings. Using its onboard maritime radar, the UAS detects survivors in distress.

Following a series of flight tests scheduled for this fall, the aircraft will be sent to receive its official RAF livery, marking another step towards its full integration into the British armed forces. The E-7 Wedgetail's MESA radar, developed by Northrop Grumman, is a major improvement over the E-3 Sentry's rotating radar. The MESA radar uses electronic scanning technology, allowing it to track targets simultaneously over 360 degrees without moving parts, improving reliability and reducing maintenance. It also offers superior detection range and enhanced ability to track high-speed targets, providing more comprehensive and accurate situational awareness. Unlike older radar systems, operators can redirect the power from 'unused' sensors (such as those oriented towards friendly lines) to enhance the energy supply to other sensors. This increases their range and identification capabilities. The E-7 features modernized communication systems that enhance interoperability with other military forces, including ground, naval, and air units. These systems enable secure, interference-resistant data links, ensuring that critical information is reliably transmitted even in contested environments. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry's older communication systems are less robust against modern cyber threats. The E-7 is based on the Boeing 737-700 platform, offering better fuel efficiency and a longer range compared to the E-3 Sentry, which is based on the Boeing 707 platform. This allows the E-7 to cover larger areas without frequent refueling, increasing mission endurance and operational flexibility. With ten mission consoles, the E-7 allows the crew to process and analyze data in real time, optimizing battlespace management. These consoles are connected by a high-speed internal network, facilitating the handling of complex information and operation coordination. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry has older, less integrated mission systems with lower real-time processing capabilities. The E-7 benefits from integrated logistical support and advanced maintenance infrastructure, including software and hardware updates facilitated by ground support systems. This optimizes the aircraft's operational availability. The older E-3 Sentry requires more maintenance and its systems are less easily updated.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/boeing-announces-successful-first-flight-of-uks-advanced-e-7-wedgetail-aewc-aircraft	2024-09-23T02:38:06-07:00

Kongsberg is also responsible for supplying the combat systems for the upcoming 212CD submarines, which will be delivered to both Norway and Germany in the future. Technical comparison The Type 212CD and Ula-class submarines represent distinct phases in diesel-electric submarine technology. The Ula-class, commissioned between 1989 and 1992, was designed for coastal defense, leveraging its small size for stealth in shallow waters. However, it lacks some modern features found in newer submarines, such as air-independent propulsion (AIP), which limits its ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing to recharge. In contrast, the Type 212CD, developed jointly by Germany and Norway, integrates AIP, allowing it to stay submerged for significantly longer, enhancing its stealth by avoiding the need to 'snort' at periscope depth. Its larger size and enhanced hydrodynamics further increase its range and versatility, allowing for operations in both coastal and deep-water environments. While the Ula-class submarines remain effective due to regular upgrades, such as new sonar and navigation systems, they lack the strike capabilities of the Type 212CD. The newer design can deploy advanced weapons like the Naval Strike Missile, enabling engagements with both surface ships and land targets, a feature absent in the Ula-class. The Type 212CD also benefits from significant improvements in signature management, with the use of non-magnetic steel and advanced acoustic quieting technologies, making it harder to detect compared to the Ula-class.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/kongsberg-secures-contract-to-upgrade-norways-ula-class-submarines	2024-09-23T01:25:29-07:00

Alongside the frigates, Greece aims to purchase up to 40 F-35 fighter jets from the United States, in addition to French-made Rafale jets. Greece-Turkey relations Greek-Turkish relations have experienced significant fluctuations over the years, marked by both historical rivalries and modern diplomatic efforts. Key disputes between the two countries revolve around territorial issues in the Aegean Sea, including the delimitation of maritime boundaries, airspace control, and the exploitation of energy resources in contested waters. The long-standing debate over Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and continental shelf rights, especially after discoveries of gas reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean, has further intensified tensions. Additionally, Turkey’s declaration of casus belli (cause for war) if Greece extends its territorial waters beyond six nautical miles remains a critical sticking point. Despite these challenges, 2023 saw notable improvements in their relations. Greece’s rapid humanitarian response to Turkey’s devastating earthquakes fostered goodwill between the nations. This was followed by high-level meetings, culminating in the 'Athens Declaration' in December, where both leaders pledged to reduce tensions and enhance bilateral cooperation. However, underlying tensions remain. Disputes over demilitarization of islands and territorial sovereignty in the Aegean persist, with Turkey frequently challenging Greek exercises and sovereignty in the region. Both nations have also indicated a desire to address these disputes through diplomatic channels, but progress on substantial issues, such as maritime boundaries, has been slow.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/greece-to-buy-fourth-belharra-class-frigate-and-cruise-missiles-from-france	2024-09-23T00:49:12-07:00

As of late September 2024, Ukraine has received all 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks that were promised by the United States earlier in the year. (Picture source: Ukrainian Army) Another country that could help offset Ukraine's losses is Australia. In January 2022, Canberra confirmed the acquisition of 75 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks for approximately $2.5 billion to replace the 59 M1A1 Abrams tanks in service with the Australian Army. These tanks, which had not seen extensive use, were retired in July 2024 and placed in reserve as the first M1A2 SEPv3 deliveries were imminent. As of late September 2024, Ukraine has received all 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks that were promised by the United States earlier in the year. These deliveries were part of a U.S. pledge made in January 2023 to supply Ukraine with modern tanks to strengthen its defense against Russian forces. However, reports suggest that Ukraine has already lost at least half of these tanks in the ongoing conflict.Kiev's interest in these decommissioned tanks is not new, but the Australian government had previously declined the request, citing the high cost of such a transfer. This same argument was used to justify the refusal to send a fleet of MRH-90 'Taipan' helicopters, also retired from Australian service to Ukraine.However, Australia's Defense Minister, Richard Marles, appears to have reconsidered the issue and is now considering supplying the tanks to Kyiv, subject to U.S. defense export regulations.If this transaction goes through, it could provide significant support to the Ukrainian military, which is struggling against Russia's material strength. Ongoing discussions between Canberra and Washington underscore the strategic importance of Ukraine in maintaining the balance of power in Eastern Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/after-acquiring-m1a2-sepv3-australia-could-transfer-its-m1a1-abrams-tanks-to-ukraine	2024-09-23T00:30:22-07:00

According to military expert Nicholas Drummond, who shared the news on his X (formerly Twitter) account, the test involved using a real Russian T-72B3 tank as the target, simulating a real-world battlefield scenario.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New Challenger 3 main battle tank prototype at DVD 2024, defense exhibition in Millbrook, United Kingdom. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The L55 smoothbore gun, known for its enhanced range and accuracy, fired a DM63 APFSDS (Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) round against the Russian T-72B3 tank. The results were devastating. The round penetrated the tank’s glacis plate—its heavily armored front slope—punched through the crew compartment, tore through the engine block, and exited the rear of the vehicle. This level of penetration demonstrates the lethality of the Challenger 3’s armament against modern armor, especially against Russian tanks, which are frequently encountered in conflict zones. The L55 gun is a 120mm smoothbore cannon developed by German Company Rheinmetall as an upgraded version of the L44, designed primarily for main battle tanks like the Leopard 2A6. It features a longer barrel compared to its predecessor, which improves muzzle velocity and enhances the gun's overall accuracy, range, and armor-piercing capability. This increased length allows the L55 to fire more advanced and powerful kinetic energy rounds, making it more effective against modern armored threats. Initially introduced to equip the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent variants, the L55 has been adopted by several NATO countries. Its improved performance allows tanks to engage targets at greater distances with higher precision and increased penetration power, making it a crucial advancement in tank armament, particularly against heavily armored opponents.The DM63 APFSDS (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) is a modern kinetic energy tank round developed by Rheinmetall for 120mm smoothbore guns, such as those found on the Leopard 2 and other NATO tanks. It is designed to penetrate advanced armor by using a long, dense tungsten penetrator that discards its outer sabot upon firing, allowing the dart-like core to maintain speed and accuracy. The DM63 features a temperature-independent propellant, ensuring consistent performance in varying climates, and is optimized for use with both the L44 and L55 guns, offering enhanced penetration power against modern armored threats. The T-72B3 tank is a modernized version of the Soviet-era T-72 MBT (Main Battle Tank), designed to enhance its capabilities and keep it relevant on the modern battlefield. The tank has seen extensive use in Ukraine, where it is one of the most common armored vehicles employed by Russian forces. Its durability, ease of production, and various upgrades have made it a staple in Russia's armored fleet. The armor on the T-72B3 is a combination of composite and reactive technologies, intended to provide protection against a wide range of modern anti-tank weapons. The base armor of the T-72B3 is composed of composite materials, which combine layers of steel with non-metallic substances, such as ceramics. This setup improves the tank’s resistance to kinetic energy penetrators, such as armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, as well as high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads, which rely on explosive force to punch through armor. In addition to the composite armor, the T-72B3 is equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA) blocks, typically the Kontakt-5 system. These ERA blocks are placed on the tank's turret and hull and work by detonating upon impact, disrupting the penetrating jet or projectile from a HEAT round or significantly reducing the effectiveness of kinetic energy rounds. The combination of ERA and composite armor gives the T-72B3 considerable protection against the most common threats on the battlefield, although it is still vulnerable to modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and advanced APFSDS rounds. Despite these upgrades, the T-72B3's armor is not on par with the latest Western tanks, such as the Challenger 3 or the M1A2 Abrams, which feature more advanced composite armor arrays and reactive systems. In tests like the one conducted by Rheinmetall, the Challenger 3's 120 mm L55 cannon with the DM63 APFSDS round was able to penetrate the T-72B3's highlighting the vulnerabilities of the T-72B3 when facing cutting-edge Western armor-piercing technology. German Company Rheinmetall’s demonstration underscores the strategic advantage the Challenger 3 will bring to the British Army, offering enhanced firepower, mobility, and survivability.

India Seeks to Export Modernized Russian T-72 Tanks to African and Asian Markets	India has decided to modernize its fleet of Russian-origin T-72 tanks with the intention of exporting the upgraded models to international markets, particularly targeting potential buyers in Africa, the Middle East, and East Asia. This decision represents a strategic collaboration between the Indian and Russian defense industries, aimed at extending the lifespan of the T-72 tanks by refurbishing them for prospective clients.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Heavy Vehicles Factory in Avadi, which has since produced upgraded T-90 tanks, will now be used as the base for modernizing the T-72 tanks destined for export (Picture source: Flickr Channel Cell105) According to a senior defense official involved in the partnership between the two nations, the modernization process will take place in India before the tanks are exported to countries interested in acquiring these combat vehicles. The Indian Army currently operates approximately 2,500 T-72 tanks, which have served as its main battle tanks since their introduction in the 1970s. Demand for these tanks remains strong, particularly from countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Many nations have expressed interest in acquiring the T-72 as India prepares to gradually replace them with more advanced models. Production of the T-72 tanks in India began in the 1980s at the Heavy Vehicles Factory in Avadi, near Chennai. Before that, India had purchased 500 units directly from the Soviet Union. This same facility, which has since produced upgraded T-90 tanks, will now be used as the base for modernizing the T-72 tanks destined for export. Indian and Russian technical experts are working closely to ensure the success of this modernization process. The T-72 has been a reliable and durable combat vehicle in the Indian Army’s inventory, equipped with a 125 mm main gun, an anti-aircraft gun, and a machine gun. It can reach speeds of 60 km/h on roads and 35 km/h off-road, and it is capable of fording rivers up to 1.2 meters deep. During the 2020 tensions with China, India deployed these tanks to the high-altitude region of Ladakh, marking the first time the T-72 was stationed in such challenging terrain. In addition to the T-72, the Indian Army operates around 1,000 T-90 tanks and approximately 100 indigenous Arjun tanks. Despite the modernization efforts, the T-72 remains the most numerous tank in the Indian Army’s arsenal. If the initiative proves successful, India may explore the possibility of exporting other Russian-origin military vehicles, such as BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, which are also scheduled for upgrades. The modernization of the T-72 for export could represent a new opportunity for India to expand its presence in the global defense market, offering cost-effective solutions to countries in need of reliable armored vehicles. As India looks to the future, this modernization effort is part of a broader strategy to revamp its military capabilities by gradually phasing out older equipment while potentially boosting the export of surplus hardware. The collaboration between the Indian and Russian defense sectors will be crucial in achieving these goals.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/india-seeks-to-export-modernized-russian-t-72-tanks-to-african-and-asian-markets	2024-09-20T05:40:49-07:00

US raises alarm over increased Russian military activity near undersea cables	According to information published by CNN on September 18, 2024, the United States has reported a rise in Russian military operations around key undersea cables, heightening fears of potential sabotage against critical global communication infrastructure.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Nord Stream gas leak in the Baltic Sea. (Picture source: Danish MoD) According to U.S. officials, the secretive Russian military unit is believed to be focusing its efforts on disrupting undersea internet cables, raising alarms about the security of vital communications networks. This revelation underscores growing concerns about Russia’s ability to target global infrastructure. The unit in question, known by its Russian acronym GUGI (General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research), is reportedly enhancing its capabilities for undersea sabotage. U.S. intelligence highlights that GUGI deploys various vessels, submarines, and marine drones in its operations. The specialized deepwater submarines under GUGI's command are capable of reaching depths of 2,500 meters, and the Russian research vessel Yantar—spotted near sensitive cables off the coast of the U.K. in 2019—has been linked to this effort. The Kremlin appears to be placing significant emphasis on the activities of GUGI, with the unit continuing to receive robust financial backing. U.S. officials have pointed to recent statements by Dmitri Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, who in June hinted that Russia could target undersea communication networks if provoked. Further concerns were raised by reports of Russian vessels regularly patrolling near critical maritime infrastructure, often far from Russia’s own coastline. Undersea cables form the backbone of global internet and telecommunications traffic, stretching thousands of kilometers along the ocean floor, particularly between Europe and North America. Any coordinated sabotage could result in widespread economic and social disruption, especially in Europe. A well-executed attack on these cables could severely impact civilian communications, governmental operations, and military readiness. Additionally, industries reliant on these networks, such as the financial and energy sectors, would face significant challenges. Western nations, already focused on securing vital infrastructure as they develop green energy initiatives in the North Sea, are increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of these undersea assets. Around 95 percent of global internet traffic travels through these cables, which operate at speeds of approximately 200 terabytes per second. Of the 400 undersea cables, NATO considers 200 as critical infrastructure. These cables facilitate an estimated $10 trillion in financial transactions daily, highlighting their economic significance. David Cattler, former head of NATO intelligence, previously noted Russia’s increased activity in mapping out critical allied infrastructure, both on land and at sea. The threat posed by Russia’s focus on undersea cables has not gone unnoticed. NATO sources have confirmed a growing concern over Moscow’s intentions. Data released in June revealed that over the past decade, more than 160 non-military Russian ships have carried out 945 suspicious activities near key infrastructure in the North Sea. Of these incidents, 749 occurred within a one-kilometer radius of essential pipelines. Repairing any damage to such pipelines is both costly and time-consuming. Additionally, 72 suspicious movements involved power cables, and 124 were near telecommunications cables.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-raises-alarm-over-increased-russian-military-activity-near-undersea-cables	2024-09-20T02:43:10-07:00

This new contract builds on recent developments in the U.S. Army's exploration of launched effects technology, particularly focusing on Anduril’s ALTIUS 700 model. Earlier this year, the Army indicated plans to make a rapid fielding decision by 2025 for a prototype based on the ALTIUS 700. The U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (USASOAC) has been evaluating how to integrate these capabilities, with small drones being deployed from other platforms mid-flight. In December 2023, the Army conducted a test flight of the ALTIUS 700 prototype from a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, which provided crucial data on launch, flight, landing, and recovery. This test was part of a broader risk reduction strategy, ensuring the system's reliability before moving toward full deployment. Anduril Industries leads the development of the ALTIUS 700 air vehicle, with Collins Aerospace providing the mission system, and Aurora Flight Sciences serving as the integrator. Several other companies contribute to the system's payload capabilities. Further tests are planned throughout 2024, with the Army focusing on a fully integrated version of the launched effects system. If successful, a final operational test will guide the Army’s rapid fielding decision in fiscal year 2025. The U.S. Army sees launched effects as essential for large-scale combat operations, enabling advanced collaboration between manned and unmanned systems.

U.S. Coast Guard monitors Russian naval vessels near Alaska's maritime border	According to information published by the US Armed Forces on September 16, 2024, the U.S. Coast Guard encountered four Russian Federation Navy (RFN) vessels approximately 57 miles northwest of Point Hope, Alaska. The vessels were identified during a routine patrol by the crew of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Stratton (WMSL 752) in the Chukchi Sea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Severodvinsk-class submarine and Steregushchiy-class frigate. (Picture source: US Coast Guard) The Russian ships were initially seen transiting along the Russian side of the Maritime Boundary Line (MBL) before crossing into U.S. waters, approximately 30 miles into the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Their movements appeared to be in response to sea ice on the Russian side, and they operated in compliance with international maritime law during their transit. Coast Guard Cutter Stratton’s patrol was part of Operation Frontier Sentinel, a mission designed to ensure the U.S. presence is maintained in areas where strategic competitors operate. The Russian naval group consisted of a Severodvinsk-class submarine, Dolgorukiy-class submarine, Steregushchiy-class frigate, and a Seliva-class tug. US Coast Guard The interactions between enemy navies and the U.S. Coast Guard are shaped by the Coast Guard's dual role as both a law enforcement entity and a military service under the Department of Homeland Security. This unique position allows it to engage in a variety of operations that overlap with traditional naval missions, including maritime security, border enforcement, and support for U.S. Navy activities. In regions like the South China Sea, where tensions run high due to territorial disputes and freedom of navigation issues, the Coast Guard has been increasingly involved alongside the Navy. For instance, U.S. Coast Guard cutters have been deployed to participate in freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs), challenging excessive maritime claims, such as those asserted by China. These deployments allow the Coast Guard to take on missions that complement the Navy’s focus on power projection and deterrence, while also potentially de-escalating military confrontations by presenting a non-military, law enforcement-oriented presence. The Coast Guard also plays a critical role in countering 'gray zone' tactics, where adversarial forces use civilian or paramilitary assets to challenge territorial waters without direct military confrontation. In these cases, the Coast Guard’s authority in law enforcement helps manage confrontations that might not warrant a full military response but still threaten maritime sovereignty and security. This approach has been particularly useful in places like East Asia, where coast guard-to-coast guard cooperation can help manage incidents involving fishing vessels or coast guard ships from adversarial nations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/u-s-coast-guard-monitors-russian-naval-vessels-near-alaskas-maritime-border	2024-09-19T06:09:13-07:00

Taiwan's first indigenous submarine Haikun to begin sea trials in 2025 plans for 8-submarine fleet	According to information published by CNA on September 19, 2024, the prototype of Taiwan's first domestically produced submarine, the Narwhal (Haikun), is currently undergoing harbor acceptance tests (HAT), with plans to begin sea acceptance tests (SAT) by late March or early April 2025. The Haikun, launched in September 2023, is the first step in Taiwan's submarine production program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launching ceremony of the Taiwanese Hai-Kun class submarine Hai Kun. (Picture source: Taiwan presidency) The Ministry of National Defense has outlined a phased production plan, starting with two additional submarines based on the Haikun design, followed by three enhanced models. A total of eight submarines are planned for Taiwan's fleet. The timeline for the Haikun project has been extended, with final project completion now expected by 2029. This extension is due to phased deliveries of the critical MK-48 Mod 6 AT torpedoes, affected by global supply chain challenges. To support this initiative, Taiwan's Executive Yuan has approved a budget of NT$284 billion, covering construction costs, training facilities, crew accommodations, weapons systems, and related infrastructure. The budget includes allocations for anti-ship missiles and torpedoes, ensuring the full combat capability of the submarine fleet once operational. In addition, Admiral Chiu Chun-jung, Chief of Staff of the Navy, revealed that Taiwan has signed mutual rescue agreements with allied nations to enhance submarine rescue capabilities. These agreements ensure reliable support for underwater operations, though specific countries involved have not been disclosed. Plans for a dedicated submarine rescue vessel are also in development, with a detailed proposal expected by 2027. Comments Taiwan's pursuit of a modern submarine fleet is a critical element in its broader defense strategy to counterbalance the growing capabilities of China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The island currently operates an outdated submarine force, consisting of just four submarines, two of which are World War II-era vessels. Recognizing the urgent need for modernization, Taiwan has embarked on the Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS) program. The main goal of Taiwan's submarine fleet expansion is to enhance its asymmetric defense capabilities. Submarines, difficult to detect and highly effective in disrupting naval operations, are viewed as essential for protecting Taiwan against blockades or potential invasion attempts. In a blockade scenario, Taiwan’s submarines would play a crucial role in keeping critical supply routes open. Moreover, their ability to operate stealthily could impose significant risks to Chinese surface vessels, including larger assets like aircraft carriers, as demonstrated by past naval conflicts where submarines had an outsized impact. Despite these advantages, Taiwan faces challenges in its submarine program. The IDS relies heavily on foreign technology, with contributions from countries like the U.S., U.K., and others. This has complicated procurement efforts, given China’s diplomatic pressure on potential suppliers. Additionally, some critics argue that Taiwan’s focus on expensive submarines may divert resources from more cost-effective, asymmetric systems better suited for defense in the Taiwan Strait, where shallow waters could limit submarine operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwans-first-indigenous-submarine-haikun-to-begin-sea-trials-in-2025-plans-for-8-submarine-fleet	2024-09-19T03:24:14-07:00

Boeing Develops New Land-Based Version of MQ-25 Autonomous Aerial Refueling System for US Air Force	On September 16, 2024, at the Air &amp; Space Forces Association’s Air Space &amp; Cyber Conference, Boeing unveiled a new land-based version of its unmanned MQ-25 tanker, specifically adapted to meet the future refueling needs of the U.S. Air Force (USAF). This new design significantly expands the capabilities of the device, aiming in particular to refuel Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) in contested airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Boeing MQ-25 Autonomous Aerial Refueling System (Picture source: Wikimedia) According to Boeing officials, this new land-based model of the MQ-25, named the MQ-25 Land-Based Variant (LBV), features a wingspan extended to 92 feet from the 75 feet of the Navy's Stingray version. This modification eliminates the need for folding wings, a requirement for the carrier-based version, and increases the fuel capacity in the wings by 40%. Although this project is developed internally at Boeing, it is designed in consultation with the Air Force. It aligns with the Air Force’s ongoing analysis of the Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System (NGAS), whose conclusions are expected this fall. This analysis anticipates an integrated approach involving multiple systems, including a smaller autonomous tanker for operations in high-risk areas. John Scudi, interim director of the MQ-25 advanced capabilities program and senior manager of business development at Boeing, emphasized that the land-based adaptation of the MQ-25 could also serve intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, airborne early warning, and electronic warfare missions. The LBV was presented at the conference with an image showing the device receiving fuel from a KC-46’s wing refueling pods. Notably, the LBV uses a hose-and-drogue system instead of a refueling boom, initially focusing on aircraft equipped with a receiver probe. Scudi also mentioned that the use of the LBV could be extended to refuel CCAs, anticipating possible adaptations to meet the more complex needs of future CCA increments. Additionally, the LBV could be used to refuel U.S. Navy fighters already equipped with receiving receptacles. The innovative design of the LBV seeks to maximize the investment already made by the U.S. Navy in the MQ-25 program, with the main change being the widened wings. After thousands of hours of modeling and simulation, Boeing settled on the 92-foot wingspan, which not only increases fuel capacity but also adds two additional 3,000-pound pylons that could carry refueling equipment or other systems, including weapons. As a reminder, the MQ-25 Stingray, intended for the Navy, is an unmanned aerial refueling aircraft developed by Boeing for the U.S. Navy. Designed primarily to extend the combat range of carrier-based aircraft such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet and the F-35C Lightning II, the MQ-25 increases operational flexibility and endurance. It represents the first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft in U.S. naval aviation, marking a significant advancement. The aircraft is equipped with sophisticated avionics and an aerial refueling system capable of delivering approximately 15,000 pounds of fuel 500 nautical miles from the carrier, fundamentally transforming the role and capability of carrier air wings. Currently, six MQ-25s are under production at Boeing's facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Of these, one is intended for static tests while the other five are development, engineering, and manufacturing (EMD) models. These EMD models are essential as they serve as aerial test vehicles, laying the groundwork for the eventual Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP). The first flight of an MQ-25 EMD is scheduled for December 2025. Additionally, Boeing plans to relocate MQ-25 production to MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, by the end of 2025. This move is part of a broader strategy to transition the MQ-25 program from development to full-scale production. In a significant development effort, Boeing's team is also focusing on internally funded software improvements. This new software would enable a USN F/A-18 Super Hornet or E-2D Hawkeye to remotely control MQ-25s. The main function of this capability is to allow aircraft requiring refueling to directly command the Stingray in its flight path and refueling operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/boeing-develops-new-land-based-version-of-mq-25-autonomous-aerial-refueling-system-for-us-air-force	2024-09-19T01:25:32-07:00	
German-Norwegian Type 212CD submarine program reaches major design milestone	According to a PR published by TKMS on September 18 , 2024, the design phase for the Type 212CD submarines, a collaboration between Germany and Norway, has been successfully completed. thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), responsible for the development, announced the conclusion of the 'Critical Design Review' (CDR).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Type 212CD submarine. (Picture source: TKMS) The CDR involved an extensive review of over 100,000 pages of documentation over three years in cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency and the German procurement authority BAAINBw. With the design phase complete, production is set to accelerate, and initial tests are expected by 2027. Delivery of the first submarine to the Norwegian Navy is scheduled for 2029. Both Germany and Norway are reportedly considering increasing the number of submarines beyond the initial six. TKMS expressed readiness to meet this potential demand, with political decisions expected in the coming months. About the program The Type 212CD submarine is an advanced diesel-electric class developed jointly by Germany and Norway to modernize their naval capabilities. A key feature of the Type 212CD is its increased size and enhanced stealth capabilities compared to its predecessor, the Type 212A. The new design boasts a 65% increase in surface displacement, now reaching around 2,500 tons, and a length extended to 73 meters. These submarines are optimized for reduced sonar detection, using faceted hull designs and advanced anechoic coatings to minimize acoustic and active sonar signatures, making them more difficult to detect. This stealth shaping is a major advancement in submarine design, drawing on principles similar to stealth aircraft technology. Another major improvement is the integration of an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using hydrogen fuel cells, which allows for extended submerged operations without surfacing. The Type 212CD may also include vertical launch systems for the Norwegian submarines, capable of deploying advanced missiles like the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), although this remains speculative. Norway-Germany relations The partnership is strongly anchored in NATO's framework, with Norwegian and German troops regularly participating in NATO-led operations, particularly in Eastern Europe. Both countries contribute to NATO's presence in Lithuania, where Germany leads a battle group that includes Norwegian forces. This cooperation has been instrumental in securing NATO’s eastern flank. Energy security has also emerged as a crucial area of military focus, particularly after the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Norway has increased its defense posture around critical subsea infrastructure, with German support, underscoring the connection between national security and energy stability in the region. In addition to military projects, Norway and Germany collaborate within EU defense initiatives, despite Norway not being an EU member. Through projects like the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) on military mobility.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/german-norwegian-type-212cd-submarine-program-reaches-major-design-milestone	2024-09-19T01:23:58-07:00	
British Army to Double Its Fleet of M270 MLRS by 2029	The British Army is set to double its fleet of M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) by the end of the decade.

The full delivery of these M270 MLRS is planned by the end of 2029.This significant increase in the number of M270s in the British Army could lead to a substantial restructuring of the country's long-range artillery units, particularly following the donation of more than half of its AS90 Braveheart 155mm self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine. To bridge this gap, the UK temporarily acquired 14 Archer 155mm self-propelled howitzers from Sweden, though this remains a limited solution while awaiting the delivery of the future RCH 155, developed in collaboration with Germany. The M270 MLRS, often described as a tracked version of HIMARS with double the payload capacity, carries 12 rockets housed in two pods of six rockets each (Picture source: British MoD) With the expansion of the M270 MLRS fleet, the British Army could find itself in a more favorable position regarding its indirect fire capabilities. These efforts to strengthen long-range strike capacity echo NATO's concerns in recent years, especially in light of observations from the conflict in Ukraine. The need to bolster long-range strike fleets, including both 155mm artillery and MLRS systems, has been widely acknowledged.It was previously announced in 2022 that the UK would upgrade nine of its M270 MLRS launchers to the A2 variant, as part of a $32 million contract. This upgrade process includes installing a new engine and redesigning the cabin, bringing it in line with the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). That same year, Lockheed Martin, the original manufacturer of the M270, indicated that the modernization of an unspecified number of British MLRS would be completed by 2026.The M270 MLRS, often described as a tracked version of HIMARS with double the payload capacity, carries 12 rockets housed in two pods of six rockets each. Mounted on a stretched Bradley chassis, this launch system features self-loading and autonomous aiming capabilities. The crew, consisting of three members (driver, gunner, and section chief), can launch 12 rockets in less than 60 seconds without leaving the enclosed cabin. Initially entering service in 1990, the British Army's modernized M270s are now expected to remain operational until at least 2050.Additionally, the United States maintains a significant reserve of non-operational M270A0 MLRS launchers at its Red River storage facility, which has also been used for the U.S. Army's own M270 fleet modernization program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/british-army-to-double-its-fleet-of-m270-mlrs-by-2029	2024-09-19T01:07:07-07:00

It is also designed to be highly mobile, capable of rapid deployment and withdrawal, which allows it to operate efficiently within a larger defense network.France has stated that it can deliver an operational system within two years of a contract's commencement. A missile testing campaign set for October marks a critical step toward the system's deployment. This rapid development and delivery schedule reflect the confidence in MBDA and Thales' ability to accelerate production rates for both the SAMP/T systems and the Aster 15 and 30 missiles. The French Air Force is expected to receive the first batch of Aster missiles ordered in early 2023 within the current year, with several dozen more planned for delivery in 2024.During the conference in Rome, Sébastien Lecornu highlighted that 'the SAMP/T is now an off-the-shelf product,' emphasizing its availability for acquisition. He also noted that the SAMP/T is the only fully European system capable of intercepting short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, including hypersonic ones, while offering strategic autonomy compared to competing systems like the American Patriot.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-orders-seven-additional-next-generation-samp-t-air-defense-systems	2024-09-18T06:07:33-07:00	
French Army Deploys Serval Armored Vehicle on External Theater for First Time near Russian Border	The French Army has recently deployed the multi-role armored vehicle (VBMR) Serval for the first time in an external theater of operations. These vehicles have arrived in Estonia, marking their engagement in the Lynx mission, a few days behind the originally planned schedule. This deployment aligns with France's ongoing efforts to strengthen strategic solidarity with its allies, as emphasized by General Pierre Schill, the Chief of Staff of the French Army.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Armed with a remotely operated turret with a 12.7 mm machine gun and threat detectors, the Serval can transport eight soldiers equipped with the FELIN (Integrated Dismounted Soldier) system, in addition to its two crew members (Picture source: French MoD) Unlike the VBMR Griffon and the Jaguar Armored Reconnaissance and Combat Vehicle (EBRC), the Serval had not been tested in the harsh climate of the Sahel, as its delivery to the army coincided with France's withdrawal from the Sahel-Saharan strip. However, the military quickly sought to test the Serval in other operational conditions. The 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment (REC) had previously deployed several Jaguar vehicles to Estonia in May as part of the same Lynx mission.In January, Colonel Patrick Ponzoni, then head of the French detachment in Estonia, announced that the Serval would be involved in the Lynx mission from August. Despite a slight delay, the recent arrival of the Serval in Estonia marks a significant step for the French Army in deploying its newest equipment.The first four Serval vehicles were delivered to the Combat Support Center (CAPCIA) - 51st Infantry Regiment in Mourmelon, Marne. A year later, the 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment (RPIMa) became the first operational unit to be equipped with the Serval.Designed to equip the rapid reaction force for national emergency response, the Serval is a 4x4 armored vehicle weighing between 15 and 17 tons, produced by KNDS France (formerly Nexter) in collaboration with Texelis. It shares several systems with other vehicles in the SCORPION program, such as vetronics and command information systems. The operational projection in Estonia of this equipment is a major new capability milestone and marks an important step in the SCORPION modernization of the French Army (Picture source: French MoD) Armed with a remotely operated turret with a 12.7 mm machine gun and threat detectors, the Serval can transport eight soldiers equipped with the FELIN (Integrated Dismounted Soldier) system, in addition to its two crew members. The vehicle has a range of 600 km and a maximum speed of 90 km/h.The VBMR-L Serval was developed as part of the SCORPION program to meet the French Army's needs. Production began following a contract awarded in February 2018. The French Ministry of Defense plans to acquire more than 2,000 of these vehicles by 2030, with 978 expected to be in service by that date. The initial batch of 364 Servals was ordered in December 2020, with deliveries starting in 2022.This deployment of the Serval in Estonia showcases its collaborative combat capabilities, along with its tactical and strategic mobility, which sets it apart from the Armored Forward Vehicle (VAB) it is meant to replace. According to the Technical Section of the French Army (STAT), these features enhance the versatility of the Serval in various operational environments.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/french-army-deploys-serval-armored-vehicle-on-external-theater-for-first-time-near-russian-border	2024-09-18T05:21:38-07:00	
Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning enters Japan's contiguous zone for first time	According to information published by NHK on September 18, 2024, Japan's Ministry of Defense announced that three Chinese naval vessels, including the aircraft carrier Liaoning, briefly entered Japan's contiguous zone early on the 18th of September.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Chinese Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier Liaoning. (Picture source: Chinese Ministry of Defense) This marks the first time a Chinese aircraft carrier has navigated these waters. The Ministry confirmed that the vessels were sighted by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force navigating the East China Sea near Okinawa on the evening of the 17th. The Chinese fleet, consisting of the Liaoning and two missile destroyers, was seen heading south past the Senkaku Islands, approximately 70 kilometers west of Uotsuri Island. Shortly after, they moved between Yonaguni and Iriomote Islands, temporarily entering Japan's contiguous zone before continuing toward the Pacific. Japan's contiguous zone lies just outside its territorial waters, where international law permits foreign ships to navigate. However, coastal nations are allowed to enforce measures to prevent illegal activities within their territorial waters. While the Ministry of Defense confirmed that there was no violation of Japan's territorial waters or any dangerous actions by the Chinese vessels, the event has sparked increased vigilance. This naval passage follows other recent incidents involving Chinese military activity near Japan, including an airspace violation by a reconnaissance aircraft off Nagasaki in August and a brief incursion by a survey ship into Japan's territorial waters near Kagoshima. In response to these activities, Japan has expressed its concerns through diplomatic channels, deeming the latest developments unacceptable in light of previous Chinese military actions. Simultaneously, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense reported that the Liaoning's group had passed through waters northeast of Taiwan and was heading southeast of Yonaguni Island. Taiwanese forces also closely monitored the carrier's movements, maintaining heightened surveillance throughout its passage. Both Japan and Taiwan continue to watch the situation closely as China's naval operations extend further from its shores.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinese-aircraft-carrier-liaoning-enters-japans-contiguous-zone-for-first-time	2024-09-18T04:45:49-07:00

Indonesian Defense Ministry launches locally-built OPV 90M vessel in Lampung	According to information published by the Indonesian MoD on September 18, 2024, Major General TNI Drs. Nugroho Sulistyo Budi, M.M., M.Han., Special Advisor to the Minister of Defense on Political Affairs, presided over the launch ceremony of the OPV 90M vessel.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launching ceremony of the OPV 90M vessel. (Picture source: Indonesian MoD) The OPV 90M vessels, set for delivery in 2025, feature a robust configuration to handle multiple mission profiles, including anti-submarine and anti-ship operations. Each vessel is equipped with a combat management system (CMS) from the Turkish firm Havelsan, integrating advanced sensors and weaponry. The ship’s armaments include a 76mm Super Rapid gun, provisions for 35mm and 20mm cannons, and missile launchers. These ships, measuring 90 meters in length with a displacement of approximately 2,100 tonnes, are powered by four diesel engines, providing a top speed of 28 knots. Additionally, one of the vessels will include a helideck and hangar, allowing for helicopter operations. TNI AL The Indonesian Navy is undergoing a critical phase of modernization, driven by both domestic imperatives and regional security concerns. Indonesia’s vast maritime domain, which includes critical sea routes such as the Malacca, Sunda, and Lombok Straits, makes its naval capacity essential for national defense and the protection of its economic interests. However, the Navy faces substantial challenges in meeting its ambitious 'Green-Water Navy 2024' goals, which were part of a broader military plan for achieving a 'Minimum Essential Force' (MEF) by 2024. A key focus of the Navy’s modernization is expanding its underwater and surface capabilities. The TNI-AL aims to develop a fleet of 274 ships, including submarines, frigates, and patrol vessels. Currently, there is a significant shortfall, particularly in the submarine fleet, which has only four operational units against the target of 12. This shortage is particularly concerning given Indonesia’s vulnerabilities to underwater intrusions, notably by unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) from foreign actors such as China. Enhancing underwater detection systems and anti-submarine warfare capabilities are therefore priorities, alongside the acquisition of more advanced submarines and maritime patrol aircraft. In addition to hardware challenges, geopolitical tensions, particularly in the South China Sea, are putting increased pressure on Indonesia to modernize its naval forces. China's expanding claims and illegal fishing activities in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone have underscored the need for a more robust naval presence, particularly in Indonesia's eastern waters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indonesian-defense-ministry-launches-locally-built-opv-90m-vessel-in-lampung	2024-09-18T03:58:08-07:00	
Indian Air Force to Receive Tejas Mk 1A Combat Aircraft Next Month After Engine Delivery Delays	The Indian Air Force (IAF) is set to receive the long-anticipated Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas Mk 1A starting next month. According to the Financial Express, this delivery marks a crucial step in bolstering the IAF's fighter fleet, which has faced delays. The Tejas Mk 1A, an upgraded version of the LCA, offers enhanced capabilities with modern features and improved performance. Currently, the aircraft is undergoing final testing after modifications to the integrated Israeli software were completed.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Mk 1A variant is equipped with the Uttam Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, capable of scanning the sky and tracking multiple targets simultaneously, with a detection range of over 200 kilometers (Picture source: Indian Air Force) The initial delivery will include aircraft equipped with Category B engines, which are either previously used or acquired under earlier agreements with General Electric (GE) for the Tejas series. The new General Electric F404-IN20 engines, vital for optimal performance, are expected to arrive in November. HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) is anticipated to receive two GE-F404 engines per month starting from November, based on GE's recent commitments.Originally, the first aircraft delivery was planned for February-March 2024, but delays in engine delivery have pushed this timeline to November. This delay was addressed during the recent visit of Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Washington, resulting in a revised delivery schedule from GE. HAL, the state-run aerospace manufacturer responsible for the Tejas, had aimed to commence deliveries in March 2024, following the contract signed in February 2021. However, the first flight of the Tejas Mk 1A took place only in March this year, necessitating additional trials and a postponement of at least four months due to software changes requested by the IAF.In response to these persistent delays and to meet future demand, the IAF has proposed a public-private partnership (PPP) model to establish additional production lines for the Tejas. Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhary emphasized the need to expand production capabilities to fulfill the IAF’s requirements. The plan includes diversifying production lines and exploring joint ventures with private sector partners to support the induction of nearly 300 Tejas variants over the next fifteen years, thereby strengthening the fighter fleet and fostering collaboration within India's aerospace industry.

Analysis: Exploring relationship between China's Naval and Commercial shipbuilding industries	The RAND report titled 'PRC Shipbuilding: Naval and Commercial' delves into the evolving relationship between China's naval and commercial shipbuilding sectors, offering insights into how these two industries have influenced one another over the past two decades. China's rise as a dominant maritime power, both commercially and militarily, is explored through a detailed analysis of shipbuilding trends, which reveal complex interactions between these sectors.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a Chinese Naval Shipyard. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Since the 2000s, China has emerged as a global leader in shipbuilding. On the commercial side, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) increased its global market share from 4.7% of ship completions in 2000 to 51.9% of the world's open order tonnage by 2023. On the naval front, the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has been rapidly expanding its fleet, especially from the mid-2000s onward. This dual rise has sparked speculation about the relationship between China's naval and commercial shipbuilding capacities. Some argue that these sectors complement each other, with advancements in commercial shipbuilding supporting the naval industry, and vice versa. However, the report demonstrates that this relationship is more nuanced and not simply additive. Data analysis reveals that while there were periods when naval and commercial shipbuilding compensated for each other (e.g., when commercial activity fell during economic downturns and naval production increased), these two sectors have become increasingly distinct in recent years. China's commercial shipbuilding reached its peak in 2011, and although it declined in the following years, it remained globally dominant, particularly in bulk carrier production. The naval sector, however, saw a significant uptick after 2010, peaking in 2014 and sustaining a more steady, high-level production aimed at building sophisticated warships. At the national level, trends show that naval and commercial shipbuilding operated somewhat inversely through the 2000s. Commercial shipbuilding boomed when naval production was low, and vice versa. However, as China's shipyards became more specialized, the two industries began to diverge. Key shipyards, such as Dalian and Jiangnan (Changxingdao), which previously handled both naval and commercial vessels, have increasingly focused on naval projects, especially for advanced platforms like the Type 052D destroyers and Type 055 cruisers. This specialization has made it more challenging for China to leverage its massive commercial shipbuilding infrastructure for naval purposes, particularly as modern warships require more complex designs and production techniques. Regional analyses support this divergence. For example, Shanghai-based shipyards have maintained a leading role in both commercial and naval shipbuilding. Yet, while commercial capacity stabilized after the 2008 financial crisis, naval shipbuilding continued to expand, driven by the construction of major platforms like aircraft carriers and destroyers. This shift is particularly evident in high-end naval yards, where commercial production has diminished as naval work increased, especially for vessels that demand specialized construction expertise. On a broader level, this trend reflects the modernization of the PLAN. Historically, Chinese naval vessels were simpler and could be built in large numbers using commercial shipbuilding techniques. However, as the PLAN has shifted toward more sophisticated platforms comparable to those of the U.S. Navy, the need for dedicated, highly specialized shipyards has grown. This shift underscores that while China’s commercial shipbuilding prowess remains formidable, its ability to quickly repurpose this capacity for naval production is limited by the increasing technical demands of modern warships. In conclusion, the RAND report highlights a complex relationship between China's naval and commercial shipbuilding sectors. While there were historical overlaps, the increasing sophistication of China's navy has led to a separation of these industries, with specialized yards focusing on naval construction. This divergence underscores the limits of China's ability to convert its dominant commercial shipbuilding capacity into a naval advantage, particularly as its navy pursues increasingly advanced vessels requiring dedicated facilities and expertise.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/analysis-exploring-relationship-between-chinas-naval-and-commercial-shipbuilding-industries	2024-09-18T02:25:16-07:00

The radar's scalable nature also opens possibilities for integration into other naval platforms, such as amphibious ships and aircraft carriers.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/raytheon-secures-us-navy-contract-to-streamline-spy-6-radar-module-production	2024-09-18T01:30:02-07:00	
French Army's TOUTATIS Project Targets Hostile Interference in Space	During his last hearing before the National Assembly as Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, General Stéphane Mille discussed the current situation in space. He highlighted the growing number of 'close approaches between objects' in all orbits, necessitating the development of active defense capabilities. In response to these challenges, the Ministry of the Armed Forces has implemented a series of programs to strengthen space security, including the TOUTATIS demonstration, which complements other initiatives such as YODA.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The TOUTATIS demonstration, complementing the YODA project, aims to establish a comprehensive knowledge and response chain in low Earth orbit (LEO) (Picture source: Agence Innovation Defense) In 2019, the Ministry of the Armed Forces launched the Space Defense Strategy (SSD) and the YODA program (Eyes in Orbit for an Agile Demonstrator). This initiative aims to deploy two 'watcher-patrol' nanosatellites in a near-geostationary orbit. The goal is to ensure continuous monitoring of space objects and prevent any malicious activity. Additionally, two projects have been included in the 2024-30 Military Programming Law (LPM): BLOOMLASE, a laser system intended to blind observation satellites from the ground, and FLAMHE, which involves deploying lasers in orbit.However, the risks of spatial interference affect all types of orbits. It is in this context that the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) initiated the TOUTATIS demonstration (In-Orbit Test of Action Techniques Against Space Interference Attempts) on behalf of the Space Command (CdE). Announced on September 17, TOUTATIS represents the first step in the low Earth orbit defense strategy, as part of Operation Ares (Action and Space Resilience). This operation has three main objectives: to enable the CdE to catalog all space objects in orbit (approximately 60,000), to identify potential malicious actions, and, ultimately, to counter them.The TOUTATIS demonstration, complementing the YODA project, aims to establish a comprehensive knowledge and response chain in low Earth orbit (LEO). It will rely on technologies stemming from innovation in the space sector. The project involves the satellites 'Splinter' and 'Lisa1,' designed by the start-up U-Space, and will benefit from MBDA's expertise in military engagements and satellite protection. In addition to YODA, Splinter, and Lisa1 are part of the EGIDE project (Geoderivative Engine for Intervention and Deterrence), also integrated into Operation Ares (Picture source: DGA) The Splinter satellite will feature high maneuverability and a set of subsystems allowing for autonomous approach and action. Lisa1, on the other hand, will serve as a 'watcher satellite.' Both satellites will carry out opposition or cooperation scenarios to verify the operational performance of the low Earth orbit action satellite and the space surveillance capabilities of the watcher satellite. The DGA emphasizes that TOUTATIS strictly adheres to international law, including the right to self-defense, in line with France's commitment to the peaceful and responsible use of outer space.In addition to YODA, Splinter and Lisa1 are part of the EGIDE project (Geoderivative Engine for Intervention and Deterrence), also integrated into Operation Ares. This operation relies on the GRAVES radar (Large Network Adapted to Space Surveillance), which is set to be replaced by 2030, as well as on a high-capacity computer. This computer will enable the CdE not only to analyze all surveillance data but also to predict the trajectories of referenced space objects.The development of these projects reflects France's intention to strengthen its defense capabilities in space, in response to the growing potential threats in low Earth orbit.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/french-armys-toutatis-project-targets-hostile-interference-in-space	2024-09-18T01:17:42-07:00

Explosive Pagers Reveal Major Security Breach Within Hezbollah	On September 17, 2024, Lebanon was shaken by a wave of nearly simultaneous explosions affecting hundreds of Hezbollah members, the Iran-linked Shiite militia. These explosions originated from pagers, which the organization used to avoid electronic surveillance and cyberattacks. According to several sources contacted by Reuters, the pagers had been intercepted by Israel after their purchase in Taiwan, allowing small explosive charges to be installed within them.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The pagers that exploded were Gold Apollo AR-924 type made in Taiwan. (Picture source: Gold Apollo) Hezbollah had adopted these pagers, also known as 'beepers,' for security reasons. These devices operate via radiomessaging, using the POCSAG radio transmission protocol, which provides a broader coverage—an important asset in Lebanon. The most commonly used model was the Rugged Pager AR924, produced by Taiwanese company Apollo Gold. This robust device offers a battery life of up to 85 days, thanks to its lithium battery. Despite these precautions, the pager explosions have exposed vulnerabilities within Hezbollah’s security apparatus.The explosions quickly sparked speculation. The Lebanese Ministry of Health advised pager holders to distance themselves from these devices immediately, and hospitals were placed on high alert to handle the influx of casualties. According to Lebanese security sources, Israel is suspected to be behind this incident. It is alleged that the pagers used by Hezbollah had been modified during production by the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency. Explosives were reportedly concealed in the devices and remotely activated by a code. This operation is believed to have been planned over several months, indicating a deep infiltration of Hezbollah’s security network.Reuters reported that the 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah originated from the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo. However, the company clarified that these pagers were not its direct products but were manufactured by a European firm called BAC, which holds a license to use its brand. Lebanese security sources claim that the Mossad inserted a small explosive circuit into the pagers, undetectable by standard inspection methods. Approximately 3,000 of these devices exploded simultaneously, causing serious injuries to their users. Lebanese security sources claim that the Mossad inserted a small explosive circuit into the pagers, undetectable by standard inspection methods (Picture source: X Channel Jason Brodsky) Hezbollah described this incident as 'the greatest security breach' it has faced in recent years. Lebanese authorities immediately accused Israel of being responsible for this 'criminal aggression,' which resulted in numerous casualties, including civilians. In a statement, Hezbollah vowed retaliation while reiterating its support for the Palestinian cause, particularly in Gaza.This operation has highlighted Israel's ability to infiltrate Hezbollah, marking one of the most significant counterintelligence failures for the Shiite militia in decades. Already high tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been further exacerbated, with regular exchanges of fire occurring along the Israeli-Lebanese border since the start of the Gaza conflict. However, experts believe these explosions do not necessarily signal an imminent Israeli ground offensive, but they do underline the extent of Israel's infiltration and intelligence capabilities.This incident underscores a new reality in modern cyber warfare, where everyday electronic devices with wireless connectivity can potentially become deadly weapons. It also highlights the vulnerabilities of hardware supply chains, a recurring issue in international security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/explosive-pagers-reveal-major-security-breach-within-hezbollah	2024-09-18T00:44:02-07:00

Rostec Increases BMP Engine Production by 50%	The High-Precision Systems holding of the Russian state-owned company Rostec has announced a 50% increase in the production of engines for infantry fighting vehicles (BMP) during the first seven months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This growth was made possible through a modernization program at the Barnaultransmash plant, carried out with the support of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation and Rostec.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BMP Engine Production in a Russian factory. (Picture source: Rostec) To achieve this increase in production, the company implemented new equipment and expanded its workforce by nearly 1.5 times. The program also allowed for enhanced social support for employees and a substantial 60% increase in the wage fund. 'Rostec produces a wide range of armored vehicles, including advanced infantry fighting vehicles such as the BMP-3 equipped with additional protection kits and the modernized BMP-2 with the Berezhok combat module. These vehicles have proven highly effective in combat situations. The modernization of our production facilities allows us to meet the growing demand from the armed forces and fulfill the requirements of the national defense order,' stated Rostec. As part of the production expansion, the company has introduced additional training and professional development courses for its personnel. New and young employees benefit from individualized career paths, while experienced specialists participate in rotation programs between the company's various divisions, thereby enhancing their skills and the quality of the products. The BMPs (Boyevaya Mashina Pekhoty, in Russian) are infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s and used by numerous armies worldwide, especially those in the former Eastern Bloc. They were designed to transport infantry troops onto the battlefield while providing direct fire support. The concept of the BMP is based on the idea of an armored vehicle capable of keeping pace with combat tanks, protecting its crew from light weapons and shell fragments, and delivering sufficient firepower to engage infantry and enemy light vehicles. The first model, the BMP-1, was introduced in the 1960s and was revolutionary for its time. It combined high mobility, armored protection, and powerful armament, including a 73 mm cannon and anti-tank missiles. It could transport a full squad of soldiers while offering them the ability to fire through openings in the vehicle's armor. The BMP-2, an improved version, was developed in the 1980s, featuring a turret equipped with a 30 mm cannon, enhancing its ability to engage a wider range of targets. Since then, the concept has been further developed into numerous models, including the BMP-3, equipped with even more powerful armament, notably a 100 mm cannon coupled with a 30 mm automatic cannon, significantly strengthening its battlefield capabilities. BMPs are designed to actively participate in combat alongside tanks, offering not only a secure means of transport for infantry but also crucial fire support. Their role has evolved over time, especially in modern conflicts where asymmetric threats and urban warfare have introduced new requirements for protection and mobility. Many countries, including Russia, continue to upgrade existing BMPs, reinforcing their armor, weapon systems, and mobility to adapt them to the current needs of the armed forces. 'In the current labor market, it is essential to retain professional expertise and develop young talent. We focus on creating comfortable workplaces, supporting employees' health and fitness, improving housing conditions, and providing opportunities for additional qualifications and specialized training. We also ensure that young employees have the chance to demonstrate their skills, supported by mentors and experts,' stated Tatyana Malyutina, Director of the Human Resources Department at JSC Barnaultransmash.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rostec-increases-bmp-engine-production-by-50	2024-09-17T10:13:05-07:00

US Army deploys rare Ukrainian T-72AG tank in Northern Strike 24 exercise	As reported by The Dead District on September 16, 2024, U.S. intelligence personnel from the 203rd Military Intelligence Battalion (Technical Intelligence) recently conducted a training exercise at Camp Grayling, Michigan, using a prototype of a Ukrainian T-72AG tank. This tank was employed as part of OPFOR (Opposing Force) training for U.S. troops, simulating adversary equipment and tactics. The exercise was part of Northern Strike 24, a multi-disciplinary event aimed at enhancing proficiency for large-scale combat operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The T-72AG prototype used in the U.S. training exercise at Camp Grayling lacks certain components found in some other variants, including radiation detection indicators, OTSHU-1-7 searchlights, and turret modulator systems. (Picture source: US DoD) The T-72AG prototype used in the U.S. training exercise at Camp Grayling differs from other upgraded models, such as the T-72AMG. It lacks certain components, including radiation detection indicators, OTSHU-1-7 searchlights, and turret modulator systems found in some other variants. The version at Camp Grayling retains the open-type commander's cupola, similar to the original T-72, rather than the upgraded turret of the T-80UD, which includes the 'Agat' sight and stabilization system. Developed as a cost-effective option for operators with limited budgets needing to improve their existing tank fleets, the T-72AG is a modernized version of the T-72M tank, which was widely exported and license-built by several countries. It was created by the Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau (KMDB) in Ukraine and first presented in 1997 at the IDEX exhibition in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Despite efforts to market the T-72AG, it did not receive any international orders. After failing to achieve commercial success, the T-72AG was integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces. It was deployed in the Donbass region in 2014 to support Ukrainian units during intense fighting. In February 2022, during the Russian assault on the Gostomel airfield, the tank was captured by Russian airborne forces. This capture was reported by various media outlets, highlighting its rarity within the Ukrainian military inventory. In 2024, the T-72AG was displayed at the Exhibition of Special Military Operation Trophies at Victory Park in Moscow. The T-72AG is a modernized version of the T-72M tank, which was widely exported and license-built by several countries. (Picture source: Russian social media) Weighing 45.5 tons, the T-72AG is heavier than the original T-72, which weighs 41.5 tons. It includes enhancements such as a new 6TD-series diesel engine, replacing the original engine, which had performance limitations in high-temperature conditions. The 6TD engine series, developed for the T-80UD and Oplot main battle tanks, comes in two versions: the 6TD-1, which provides 1,000 horsepower, and the 6TD-2, which offers 1,200 horsepower. These engines are designed to operate effectively in desert conditions at ambient temperatures of up to 55 degrees Celsius. Additional mobility enhancements include a transmission that increases reverse speed and allows for on-the-spot pivoting, enabling the tank to reach a maximum road speed of 65 km/h, or 75 km/h with a high-speed gearbox. The T-72AG retains the original 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore gun but can be upgraded to the Ukrainian KBA1 gun, which improves accuracy and reliability. The tank also features a remote-controlled 12.7 mm anti-aircraft machine gun mounted on the commander's cupola, allowing targets to be engaged without exposing the crew. The fire control system has been modernized, replacing the TPD-K1 sight with the 1G46 sight, stabilized on two axes, and incorporating a laser rangefinder and missile guidance capability. A ballistic computer with associated sensors further enhances firing accuracy, whether the tank is moving or stationary. After failing to achieve commercial success, the T-72AG was deployed by the Ukrainian armed forces in the Donbass region in 2014 to support Ukrainian units during intense fighting. (Picture source: Militarnyi) For night operations, the T-72AG can be fitted with the TPN-4E system or an optional thermal camera, enabling effective operation in total darkness, smoke, or fog. The tank's protection has been augmented with additional armor modules and 'Nozh' explosive reactive armor (ERA), which strengthens its resistance against shaped charges and armor-piercing projectiles. Additional modifications to the T-72AG include tactical mobility enhancements such as a satellite navigation system and an upgraded transmission designed to provide increased reverse speed and pivoting movement. The tank's protection is further improved with additional armor modules, reactive armor on the hull and turret, side screens with reactive armor on the front part of the hull, and a collective protection system designed to shield the crew from weapons of mass destruction. An optional 'Varta' optoelectronic countermeasure system may also be installed.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-deploys-rare-ukrainian-t-72ag-tank-in-northern-strike-24-exercise	2024-09-17T08:34:11-07:00	
Is North Korea Preparing to Launch Its First Advanced Airborne Early Warning Aircraft?	According to a report published by the IISS on September 16, 2024, satellite imagery suggests that North Korea is making progress in modifying a heavy transport aircraft, likely intended to become the country's first advanced Airborne Early Warning (AEW) platform. However, Pyongyang faces technical challenges in its pursuit to deploy a credible AEW aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The conversion work is being carried out on one of three Ilyushin Il-76 Candid aircraft delivered by Russia in the early 1990s, currently based at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. (Picture source: IISS) The conversion work is being carried out on one of three Ilyushin Il-76 Candid aircraft delivered by Russia in the early 1990s, currently based at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. Officially operated by the national airline, Air Koryo, these aircraft are used in parachute drills and can be temporarily camouflaged, indicating their potential availability for military use.In late 2023, one of the aircraft was moved to a separate maintenance area at the airport, surrounded by new fencing. This enhanced security, followed by the appearance of a covered structure on the fuselage, suggested a special modification of the aircraft. A plausible option is that the plane is being converted for an AEW role or, at the very least, serving as a testbed for an AEW radar. The size and positioning of the observed mounting points are consistent with other Il-76 AEW conversions, such as those conducted by Russia (A-50U Mainstay and A-100), China (KJ-2000), and Iraq (Adnan-2).Until recently, these mounting points were hidden in satellite imagery, keeping the project secret, even by North Korean standards. However, satellite images from September 8, 2024, revealed modifications, highlighting two converging vertical struts compatible with a radar dome installation.Additional imagery also showed ventral strakes added to the lower rear fuselage, visible after security screens were placed around this area in August. These strakes are a common feature on other Il-76 AEW conversions, intended to improve flight performance by counteracting the effects of the large radar dome.On September 3, the Il-76 was briefly moved outside the fenced area to a nearby taxiway, possibly to run engine tests for the first time this year. Open access panels on all four engines suggest maintenance checks were carried out. More significant is the appearance of a new tent-like structure within the fenced area, likely intended to house the radar dome. With a size of around 130 square meters, its height and location imply that the aircraft was moved to allow for the future installation of the radar dome. While these developments indicate that Pyongyang aims to establish an AEW system, the imminent physical integration of the radar dome would serve as near-definitive confirmation of these ambitions. An AEW aircraft with reasonable surveillance capabilities would be a valuable addition to North Korea's existing network of ground-based radars, which still largely rely on outdated Soviet systems despite some Chinese equipment and locally produced mobile air-defense radars.North Korea’s ground-based radars also face the challenge of mountainous terrain covering two-thirds of the peninsula. An AEW aircraft's 'look-down' capability would mitigate some of the difficulties posed by the terrain and ground-clutter, allowing for the tracking of low-flying aircraft and cruise missiles.Pyongyang’s ambition to deploy an AEW aircraft depends on access to a suitable long-range radar system. Existing ground-based systems are not compact enough to be adapted for an airborne role, posing a significant technical challenge. It remains unclear whether North Korea is developing such a system domestically or relying on external assistance, potentially linked to its renewed cooperation with Russia.Although the Il-76 airframe offers a solid basis for conversion, it could also present challenges for North Korea's relatively limited aviation industry. A design flaw could be catastrophic, as illustrated by Iraq’s attempt to convert an Il-76 to an AEW role in the late 1980s, which reportedly suffered in-flight structural failure, causing the radar dish to break off.Converting a single Il-76 would not provide permanent AEW coverage, and converting the remaining two aircraft would compromise North Korea's only heavy-lift transport capability. The extent to which this aircraft could function as a simple radar platform, without onboard radar data exploitation or airborne command and control, remains unknown. Effective real-time command and control requires air-to-air datalinks between the AEW platform and combat aircraft. It is uncertain if North Korea’s relatively modern MiG-29 Fulcrums were equipped for this at the time of delivery, or if it would be feasible to retrofit older generations of fighters that comprise most of North Korea’s fleet. North Korea may initially rely on airborne radar data being transmitted to ground stations.Much about North Korea’s Il-76 modification program remains uncertain.

This addition follows an initial contract in 2022 for two aircraft, with an option for two more, reflecting an ongoing enhancement of Swedish defense, emphasizing the growing importance of regional surveillance in Northern Europe and the Baltic states. These aircraft, designated S 106 in Sweden, will play a crucial role in modernizing the Swedish armed forces, significantly improving their ability to monitor and respond to potential threats. France is also currently nearing the final stages of acquiring the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft from Saab. This move is aimed at replacing France's aging fleet of E-3F Sentry AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) aircraft, which have been a crucial component of the French Air Force since 1991. The GlobalEye is chosen for its advanced capabilities, featuring the Erieye active electronically scanned array radar which provides a significantly extended range of operation over air, sea, and land domains. The completion of deliveries to the UAE and the expansion of the Swedish fleet demonstrate the strategic impact of the GlobalEye as a global surveillance asset, enhancing the national security of the user countries. This platform, capable of operating in peace, crisis, or conflict, represents an essential tool for defense and international security. The GlobalEye system is based on the Bombardier Global 6000 aircraft, known for its endurance, operational range, and ability to operate from shorter runways, making it ideal for regions like the Middle East, where geographic and operational conditions vary. The aircraft's endurance and sensor capabilities make it particularly effective for extensive area surveillance, crucial for the UAE given its strategic geographic positioning and regional security responsibilities. Additionally, the partnership with Saab includes not only the procurement of the aircraft but also a comprehensive support package involving maintenance, logistics, and training. This ensures that the GlobalEye systems remain operationally effective and are well-integrated into the UAE’s defense infrastructure. This arrangement also supports the development of local expertise and the long-term sustainability of the defense system.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/saab-delivers-fifth-globaleye-aew-c-aircraft-to-uae	2024-09-17T01:29:43-07:00	
Sweden to Lead NATO Troops in Northern Finland	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} Sweden has announced its intention to take on the role of framework nation in NATO’s enhanced forward presence in Finland. This decision, welcomed by Finland’s Minister of Defence, Antti Häkkänen, marks a new phase in strengthening defense relations between the Nordic countries. Finland joined NATO in 2023, followed by Sweden in 2024, amid heightened tensions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This initiative significantly enhances the defense relationship between Finland and Sweden, now both NATO allies (Picture source: UK MoD) The Nordic region, particularly areas bordering Russia, is becoming a focal point of defense strategy, as Russia’s Northern Fleet continues to rearm on the Kola Peninsula and the Leningrad Military District aims to establish new brigades in Karelia, near Finland’s border.On September 16, the prime ministers and defense ministers of Sweden and Finland met in Stockholm, where security was a key topic of discussion. During the meeting, Sweden confirmed its commitment to lead NATO’s upcoming presence in Finland. Although the exact location of the headquarters is yet to be determined, the Lapland region is considered a likely site for this new structure. The aim is not to permanently station NATO troops in northern Finland but to establish a command structure to prepare for potential troop deployment in case of conflict.This initiative significantly enhances the defense relationship between Finland and Sweden, now both NATO allies. Together, these countries contribute to strengthening NATO's collective deterrence and defense capabilities. Finnish Defence Minister Antti Häkkänen emphasized the importance of this new partnership for the Alliance: 'Finland and Sweden are now allies. Together, we strengthen NATO and make an important contribution to the development of NATO’s collective deterrence and defense.'In the context of this cooperation, the Finnish government recently allocated an additional €67 million to address needs arising from NATO membership. Moreover, Finland and Sweden emphasized in a joint declaration the necessity of securing communications and transport infrastructure in the northern regions connecting Norway, Sweden, and Finland to ensure supply, trade, and security. Although Norway is not part of this particular initiative, Sweden and Finland plan to promote military mobility within the European Union.The joint declaration specifies that interregional EU funding will be used to improve east-west communication links. The port of Narvik, located on the coast of the Norwegian Sea, holds special significance. It serves as the starting point for Europe’s northernmost cross-border railway, which connects Kiruna, Luleå, and Haparanda in northern Sweden, facilitating the transport of goods into northern Finland via the recently reopened railway line to Tornio.Meanwhile, regional cooperation in the Nordic areas is undergoing changes. The joint declaration by the two countries highlights the role of the Council of the Baltic Sea States. However, Barents cooperation, which aimed to facilitate the integration of Russia's northern regions into international exchanges, is notably absent. Finland's Foreign Minister, Elina Valtonen, hinted earlier this summer at a possible end to this multilateral cooperation, a development that now seems increasingly likely.In summary, this new step in cooperation between Sweden and Finland reflects the Nordic countries' commitment to enhancing their presence and coordination within NATO, in a geopolitical context that is increasingly tense in Northern Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/sweden-to-lead-nato-troops-in-northern-finland	2024-09-17T01:18:25-07:00	
US Navy signs deal with NASSCO for John Lewis-class Fleet replenishment oilers	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by the US DoD on September 13, 2024, the U.S. Navy has awarded a $6.75 billion block buy contract to General Dynamics NASSCO for the construction of up to eight John Lewis Class (T-AO 205) Fleet Replenishment oilers.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Navy's John lewis-class replenishment oiler USNS Robert F. Kennedy. (Picture source: US DoD) Recognizing the need to replace the aging Henry J. Kaiser-class oilers from the 1980s, the U.S. Navy initiated the T-AO 205 program. This program aims to enhance logistical support capabilities by commissioning a new class of oilers equipped with modern technology. In 2016, General Dynamics National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) was awarded the contract to design and construct the first ships of the class. The overall plan includes building up to 20 ships to meet the Navy's long-term logistical requirements. The John Lewis-class ships have a full load displacement of approximately 49,850 tons and measure 746 feet (227 meters) in length with a beam of 106 feet (32 meters). They are capable of speeds over 20 knots and are powered by a diesel-electric propulsion system, which offers improved fuel economy and reduced emissions compared to older models. Manned by civilian crews under the Military Sealift Command, these ships are integral to naval logistics. Equipped with a fuel capacity of up to 156,000 barrels, including jet fuel and marine diesel, they feature a consolidated cargo-handling system for efficient transfer of supplies. Multiple underway replenishment stations on both sides of the ship allow for simultaneous refueling and resupply operations. The double-hull design not only meets environmental regulations but also enhances safety by preventing oil spills. The primary mission of the John Lewis-class oilers is to provide logistical support during underway replenishment operations. By delivering fuel, lubricants, and dry cargo, these ships enable combat vessels to remain at sea for extended periods without the need to return to port. They are designed to refuel and resupply ships while both vessels are in motion, enhancing operational flexibility. Additionally, they can support allied vessels during combined operations, contributing to joint mission readiness and sustainability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-signs-deal-with-nassco-for-john-lewis-class-fleet-replenishment-oilers	2024-09-17T00:41:00-07:00	
Lockheed Martin Presents JASSM XR: An Extreme Range Cruise Missile	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} On September 16, 2024, during the Air, Space & Cyber Conference of the Air & Space Forces Association, Lockheed Martin unveiled the latest version of its AGM-158 JASSM cruise missile, known as the JASSM XR (eXtreme Range). This new missile is designed to maintain stealth and precision strike capabilities while offering a range superior to the current JASSM-ER.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The JASSM XR retains the same 1,000-pound (453.6 kg) warhead as the JASSM-ER and structural changes were made based on the JASSM-ER and LRASM models (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) Until now, three versions existed: the AGM-158A JASSM, the baseline air-to-surface version; the AGM-158B JASSM-ER, the extended-range air-to-surface version; and the AGM-158C LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile), an anti-ship variant deployable in air-to-sea or sea-to-sea operations via Mk 41 VLS vertical launch cells.The AGM-158 XR aims to push the boundaries of range even further. While technical details remain limited, Michael Rothstein, Vice President for Strategy and Requirements at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, stated, 'I would say the range is significantly different. It's not minor. It's not on the edges.' As a reminder, the U.S. Air Force reports that the JASSM-ER has a range exceeding 500 nautical miles, or more than 926 kilometers.Jon Hill, Vice President and General Manager of Air Dominance and Strike Weapons at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, explained that the JASSM XR is designed to be the next iteration of the JASSM-D and LRASM-C3, which are currently contracted with the Air Force and Navy. Hill emphasized that the XR leverages existing production lines and processes: 'We think of the XR as an extreme-range missile. What it really does is extend the existing JASSM and LRASM family to allow us to carry more fuel, which gives us the range we need and the warfighters require.'The JASSM XR retains the same 1,000-pound (453.6 kg) warhead as the JASSM-ER. Structural changes were made based on the JASSM-ER and LRASM models. The missile is longer, allowing it to carry more fuel, thereby increasing its range. Other potential enhancements may include the use of lighter alloys, improved aerodynamics, a redesigned structure, modified fins, or a more efficient propulsion system. Rothstein confirmed that some physical modifications were necessary to enhance range, including lengthening the structure to accommodate more fuel. Despite these changes, the goal was to reuse as much technology and components from current missile production as possible.Despite these modifications, the missile maintains its stealth and precision characteristics. The extended range allows launch crews to deploy the JASSM XR from a greater distance, enabling strikes on deeper targets while remaining out of reach of enemy air defense systems. However, the increase in total missile weight prevents certain combat aircraft, such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, from carrying it. In contrast, the F/A-18, likely in its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet version, is already compatible. The F-35 Lightning II is also expected to be compatible in the near future, along with the F-15 Eagle. While there is no specific information regarding strategic bombers, Lockheed Martin's presentation video frequently features the B-1B Lancer.Additionally, the B-52H Stratofortress’s ample carrying capacity should pose no issue, and the JASSM XR is likely to be integrated into the munitions bay of the B-2A Spirit and B-21 Raider stealth bombers of the U.S. Air Force.Lockheed Martin also sought to optimize development costs by utilizing existing JASSM and LRASM production lines and designs. The missile's modular nature hints at the possibility of navalization or anti-ship use. While the LRASM can be launched from the Mk 41 VLS cells on U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, it remains to be seen if the JASSM XR will also be integrated into these systems.Questions remain about the potential launch capability from transport aircraft. The JASSM and JASSM-ER can be loaded onto a standard pallet structure known as the Rapid Dragon. Once the aircraft’s bay opens, the pallet is ejected using a parachute, and the missiles initiate their engines during free fall. A heavier, larger missile might require adaptations to this system or the development of an 'XR' version of Rapid Dragon.The JASSM XR is not yet in service, with the first prototype flight planned for 2025 or 2026. No orders have been placed by the U.S. Air Force or Navy, and the entire development is funded by Lockheed Martin. Nonetheless, given its capabilities, this new missile could play a significant role in countering anti-access and area-denial systems, particularly those deployed by China in the South China Sea.During the #AFA2024 conference, Jon Hill explained that the AGM-158 XR is being proactively developed to meet future U.S. requirements, succeeding the AGM-158D JASSM-ER and AGM-158C LRASM. Details remain limited, apart from the confirmation of an elongated fuselage. The fact that the JASSM XR cannot be carried by the F-16, due to its weight exceeding the F-16's internal station capacity of 4,500 pounds, underscores the missile’s increased mass.According to Rothstein, some engineering changes were implemented, involving minor but clever internal structural modifications to achieve the missile's elongation. 'It's not just a matter of stretching,' he added, 'there are other structural changes that we will make to make this happen. But in the macro sense, these are not major modifications beyond the stretching.'Lockheed Martin plans to conduct a flight test with a prototype within the next 12 to 24 months, with initial operational capability anticipated in the coming years. The JASSM XR is the third proposed derivative of the JASSM to be named 'JASSM-XR.' The original proposal involved lengthening the fuselage from 4.2 to 6.3 meters, integrating an upgraded turbofan, and a larger warhead. If the current model retains the existing 450 kg WDU-42/B warhead, it could potentially achieve a range exceeding 2,000 km.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/lockheed-martin-presents-jassm-xr-an-extreme-range-cruise-missile	2024-09-17T00:31:57-07:00

US Navy SEAL Team 6 Special Forces Prepares to Support Taiwan Amid Escalating China Tensions	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to a report published on September 12, 2024, by the British newspaper Financial Times, SEAL Team 6, the clandestine U.S. Navy commando unit renowned for killing Osama bin Laden in 2011, has been training for missions to assist Taiwan in the event of an invasion by China. This revelation comes amid escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait and highlights the increasing involvement of the United States in the region's security dynamics. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link ADRIATIC SEA (March 12, 2024) U.S. East Coast-based Naval Special Warfare Operators (SEALs) conduct Visit, Board, Search and Seizure training with Croatian Special Operations Forces to increase their maritime capabilities during Trojan Footprint 24. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. In recent years, China has ramped up military exercises and incursions near Taiwan's airspace and territorial waters, raising international concerns about the possibility of an armed conflict. The Taiwanese government has been actively seeking support from allies to strengthen its defense preparedness. The United States maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, balancing its recognition of the People's Republic of China with commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The reported involvement of SEAL Team 6 suggests a potential shift toward a more proactive stance in supporting Taiwan's security. SEAL Team 6, officially known as the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), is one of the most elite units within the U.S. military. Specializing in counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and direct action missions, the team operates under a veil of secrecy. Established after the failed 1980 Iran hostage rescue attempt, SEAL Team 6 has since been at the forefront of numerous high-stakes operations, including the mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. The Navy SEALs—short for Sea, Air, and Land teams—are the U.S. Navy's primary special operations force. They are trained to operate in all environments and are experts in unconventional warfare, reconnaissance, and direct action missions. The selection process for becoming a SEAL is rigorous, involving intense physical and mental training to ensure only the most capable candidates join the ranks. SEAL Team 6 members are selected from existing SEAL teams based on exceptional performance and experience. The unit's operations are highly classified, and its members are trained in advanced tactics and technologies. Their expertise allows them to undertake the most challenging missions that are critical to national security. The involvement of SEAL Team 6 in training for Taiwan-related missions suggests a strategic shift in U.S. defense policy in the Indo-Pacific region. China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. The United States, while maintaining a policy of strategic ambiguity, is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The deployment of elite forces like SEAL Team 6 indicates a strengthening of this commitment. While officials from the U.S. Department of Defense have not publicly confirmed the deployment or specific training activities of SEAL Team 6 related to Taiwan, the news has already elicited reactions from international observers. Analysts warn that such actions could further strain U.S.-China relations and potentially destabilize the broader Indo-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-navy-seal-team-6-special-forces-prepares-to-support-taiwan-amid-escalating-china-tensions	2024-09-16T10:22:36-07:00

(Picture source: Generated by AI) The Indian government is seeking investment and technology transfers from global shipbuilding giants, aiming to establish the country as a prominent global player in ship construction and repair. Indian officials recently met with South Korean authorities to gauge interest, and similar outreach is planned for Japan. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to elevate India's shipbuilding industry, currently ranked 22nd in the world, with goals to break into the top 10 by 2030 and top 5 by 2047. The government has identified coastal states willing to provide land for shipbuilding clusters, with a focus on attracting companies like South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean Co. Ltd and Samsung Heavy Industries, as well as Japan’s Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. The drive for investment aligns with India’s 'Maruti moment' vision—an effort to replicate the industrial revolution that began with Japanese carmaker Suzuki’s entry into the Indian automobile market in the 1980s. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways aims to raise India’s share of global tonnage from less than 1% to 5%, providing an alternative to dominant shipbuilding nations like China, South Korea, and Japan. In support of this vision, India is finalizing a comprehensive shipbuilding mission, which will include policy incentives and infrastructure development to boost domestic capabilities. Plans also encompass ship recycling, with expansions proposed at locations such as Alang and the creation of new recycling centers in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. The country’s shipbuilding sector, once a global contender in the early 2000s, has struggled in recent years due to a decline in market share.

(Picture source: Indian government) The second test, conducted on September 13, 2024, took place at the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Chandipur and demonstrated the missile's ability to intercept a fast-moving aerial target simulating a sea-skimming threat. This successful test followed a similar one held the previous day, where the missile also engaged a low-altitude target. VL-SRSAM One of the features of the VL-SRSAM is its vertical launch capability. By being launched vertically, the missile achieves 360-degree coverage, allowing it to engage targets from any direction without the need to reposition the launcher. This vertical launching method also saves valuable deck space on naval ships, enabling the installation of additional missiles or other essential equipment. The missile is optimized for short-range engagements, capable of effectively targeting threats up to 40 kilometers away. Equipped with an advanced guidance system, the VL-SRSAM uses active radar homing for precise target tracking during the terminal phase and relies on inertial navigation for mid-course guidance. Strategically, the VL-SRSAM fills a critical gap in the Indian Navy's short-range air defense, replacing older systems with a more modern and capable solution. Its indigenous development reduces dependency on foreign technology and arms imports, aligning with the government's 'Make in India' initiative. With its advanced features and cost-effectiveness, the VL-SRSAM also has the potential to attract interest from other countries seeking to upgrade their naval defense systems. Technically, the missile measures approximately four meters in length and about 0.2 meters in diameter, weighing roughly 154 kilograms. It is propelled by a solid-fuel rocket motor and is armed with a high-explosive pre-fragmented warhead.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/drdo-and-indian-navy-successfully-conduct-back-to-back-tests-of-vlsrsam-missile-system	2024-09-16T06:07:50-07:00

(Picture source: TAI) Relations between Ankara and Washington were severely strained when Türkiye opted to acquire Russia's S-400 air defense system. In response, the United States blocked Türkiye in 2019 from accessing F-35 fighter jets, considered among the most advanced in the world. Ties improved in early 2024 when Türkiye ratified Sweden's bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a move opposed by Russia but supported by the U.S. and European nations following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.Despite efforts to strengthen ties with the West, President Erdoğan seeks to maintain a strong relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and to build alliances beyond Western nations, including with China. Türkiye is officially seeking to join the BRICS group of emerging economies, which would make it the first NATO member to do so.Erdoğan is scheduled to visit New York later this month to address the United Nations General Assembly and is expected to meet with U.S. officials and business leaders. As part of its plans to modernize its air force, Türkiye is also seeking to acquire GE Aerospace F110 engines for its Kaan fighter jet project and is urging Germany to permit the purchase of Eurofighter jets.Ankara is scaling back a $23 billion defense contract with the United States for the purchase of F-16 fighter jets and the upgrade of some existing aircraft. However, it aims for an offset agreement that would allow it to manufacture certain warplane parts locally.GE Aerospace, based in Cincinnati, is the world's largest manufacturer of aircraft engines. It has a joint venture with state-owned Turkish Aerospace called TUSAS Engine Industries Inc. (TEI). They plan to utilize TEI 'for maintenance, repair, and overhaul of F404 engines, in addition to assembly, inspection, and testing in Türkiye,' a GE Aerospace spokesperson told Bloomberg.Although the Hürjet is designed as a trainer aircraft, Türkiye also plans to produce armed versions of the plane, according to officials.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/tuerkiye-seeks-us-approval-to-purchase-ge-aerospace-engines-for-huerjet-fighter-development	2024-09-16T04:28:22-07:00	
Russian nuclear submarines complete 4,000-Mile under-Ice Arctic transit	{loadposition bannertop} {loadposition sidebarpub} According to information published by Tass on September 16, 2024, two Russian nuclear-powered submarines, Project 955A Borei-A Imperator Alexander III and Project 885M Yasen-M Krasnoyarsk, recently completed an under-ice transit in the Arctic, navigating through six Arctic seas under challenging ice conditions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Project 955A Borei-A submarine Imperator Alexander III. (Picture source: Tass) The Yasen-M (Project 885M) and Borei-A (Project 955A) classes are both pivotal to Russia’s naval modernization, but they serve markedly different operational roles, reflecting the distinct requirements of tactical and strategic warfare. The Yasen-M, a nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSGN), is equipped to carry a diverse payload of long-range cruise missiles, including the Kalibr and Oniks, and has been upgraded to incorporate the Zircon hypersonic missile. This configuration enables it to strike a variety of targets—land, sea, and even submarines—at considerable distances. It can carry between 24 and 40 missiles, with its UKSK VLS launch system designed for a broad array of mission profiles. These attack submarines possess 10 torpedo tubes (533mm), augmenting their close-quarters combat capability against other submarines and surface ships. A major focus of the Yasen-M is its stealth technology. Equipped with advanced sonar systems like the MGK-600 Irtysh-Amfora, the submarine features a spherical bow array that enhances detection capabilities while maintaining minimal noise levels. The hull is constructed primarily from low-magnetic steel, and its noise-reduction techniques, including a modern fourth-generation nuclear reactor, minimize acoustic signatures. Reports suggest the submarine can operate at around 20 to 28 knots in 'silent mode,' a feature that rivals some of the quietest submarines in the world, such as the U.S. Virginia-class. Moreover, the reactor on the Yasen-M is designed to run for 25-30 years without refueling. The Borei-A class is a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), designed for strategic nuclear deterrence. Unlike the Yasen-M's tactical focus, the Borei-A is built to provide Russia with a secure second-strike capability, ensuring retaliatory potential in the event of nuclear conflict. Each Borei-A carries 16 Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles (SLBMs), with each missile capable of carrying 6-10 warheads, providing a substantial nuclear payload that can be launched from remote underwater positions, safeguarding the submarine from immediate detection. The Borei-A’s design emphasizes stealth as well, but with a focus on reducing broad-spectrum noise through its pump-jet propulsion system. This feature, a first for Russian submarines, significantly lowers acoustic signatures, allowing it to operate more quietly than previous generations. This class is reputed to be five times quieter than the Akula-class and approximately twice as stealthy as the Virginia-class, although issues with its hydraulic pumps have reportedly affected its long-term noise reduction capabilities. Nonetheless, it is among the quietest SSBNs in the Russian arsenal, designed to evade detection by enemy sonar systems and maintain readiness in the event of a nuclear crisis.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-nuclear-submarines-complete-4-000-mile-under-ice-arctic-transit	2024-09-16T04:25:44-07:00

Qatar's acquisition of the RCH 155 artillery systems allows it to modernize its artillery capabilities with cutting-edge technology. Simultaneously, the transfer of PzH 2000 tracked self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine is expected to substantially enhance Ukraine's artillery strength due to the system's advanced features, such as high rate of fire, precision targeting, and long-range capabilities. The RCH 155 is a highly advanced artillery system developed by Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW). Mounted on a Boxer-wheeled armored vehicle, it offers increased mobility and automation compared to traditionally tracked howitzers. The system features a 155mm L52 gun and can fire precision-guided munitions at distances exceeding 40 kilometers (approximately 25 miles). The purchase reflects Qatar's commitment to modernizing its military forces with state-of-the-art equipment. The deal also strengthens defense ties between Qatar and Germany, potentially paving the way for future military technology and training collaborations. Before the Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers are handed over to Ukraine, they will undergo a comprehensive upgrade process in Germany. This refurbishment is expected to include technical overhauls, software updates, and modifications to meet the Ukrainian military's specific requirements. German defense contractors like KMW and Rheinmetall will likely oversee the process to ensure the equipment is delivered in optimal condition. The Panzerhaubitze 2000 has been a mainstay in modern artillery since its introduction in the late 1990s. Known for its rapid-fire capability and long-range precision, it has been utilized by several NATO countries. Qatar originally purchased 24 units to enhance its artillery forces. The decision to part with half of its inventory suggests a strategic trade-off to acquire more advanced systems like the RCH 155. Germany's role in both supplying Qatar with new artillery systems and upgrading the howitzers for Ukraine underscores its active involvement in international defense matters. This dual engagement reflects Germany's strategic interests and its stance on supporting Ukraine. Qatar has generally maintained a neutral stance regarding the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, often advocating for diplomatic solutions and peaceful dialogue. Qatar's foreign policy traditionally emphasizes mediation and conflict resolution. The nation has engaged in various diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and beyond but has not publicly aligned itself militarily in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Any significant shift in Qatar's stance, especially involving military support, would likely be accompanied by official statements and widespread media coverage. If confirmed, Qatar's decision to purchase RCH 155 artillery systems and supply Ukraine with half of its PzH 2000 howitzers represents a noteworthy development in international efforts to support Ukraine. The move not only aids Ukraine's military capabilities but also reflects the complex web of global alliances and defense strategies influencing the region's security landscape.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-qatar-to-supply-half-its-pzh-2000-howitzers-to-ukraine-after-buying-german-rch-155-8x8-howitzers	2024-09-16T04:16:07-07:00

(Picture source: US DoD) The Block IV Virginia-class submarines represent a key evolution in the U.S. Navy's fast-attack submarine fleet, balancing advanced capabilities with cost-saving innovations. These submarines, like others in the Virginia class, are designed for a wide range of missions, including anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, and launching land-attack cruise missiles. They are replacing older Los Angeles-class submarines as the backbone of U.S. naval operations. One of the primary improvements in Block IV submarines is a significant reduction in maintenance requirements. Unlike earlier blocks, Block IV submarines are designed for fewer and shorter maintenance periods over their service lives. This change allows them to conduct more deployments—up to 15, compared to 14 for previous versions—enhancing their operational availability by about 25%. This was achieved through better component durability and upgrades that target maintenance efficiency, reducing overall life-cycle costs. Block IV subs retain the advanced systems seen in previous variants, including the use of photonics masts instead of traditional periscopes and the integration of sophisticated sonar systems. These vessels are equipped with Mark 48 advanced torpedoes and Tomahawk missiles, with the ability to launch them through vertical payload tubes. They also have enhanced capabilities for special operations, with a lock-out chamber to deploy SEAL teams. The overall design of Block IV maintains the 377-foot hull length, with a displacement of 7,835 tons and speeds exceeding 25 knots. Powered by a nuclear reactor, they can remain submerged for extended periods without the need to resurface. These submarines are also optimized for operations in shallow waters. Their construction is split between two shipyards—General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries—under a cooperative arrangement that helps ensure continuous production. This industrial strategy not only helps maintain shipbuilding capacity but also guards against disruptions in case one facility becomes inoperable.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-commissions-uss-new-jersey-ssn-796-latest-virginia-class-submarine	2024-09-16T01:47:23-07:00

Hypersonic refers to aerial objects, such as aircraft, missiles, rockets, or spacecraft, that can exceed Mach 5, a speed of nearly 4,000 miles per hour (6,437 km/h). The Mach number indicates how many times the object's speed surpasses that of sound. The United States, Russia, and China are currently testing hypersonic technologies, raising concerns about a global arms race and the potential obsolescence of current defense systems. Although some 'hypersonic' weapons are deployable today, their actual applicability remains a topic of debate. In the context of the Ukraine conflict, Russian forces have used their own hypersonic missiles, such as the Kinzhal. This missile exists in both cruise missile and air-launched ballistic missile forms. Both versions have been used in some of the heaviest strikes conducted by Russian forces against Ukraine. According to Frank DeMauro, vice president of Weapon Systems at Northrop Grumman, this end-burning rocket motor test is significant because it offers extended range compared to conventional rocket motors. The collaboration between Raytheon and Northrop Grumman comes at a time when discussions about long-range missiles continue to dominate global debates, particularly as Ukraine seeks Western nations' approval to use such missiles against Russian military installations deep inside Russian territory. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently emphasized that lifting restrictions on the use of long-range weapons could be decisive in the conflict. 'If we are allowed to use these weapons, we should be able to employ them as needed to strike military targets,' he stated. He further added that removing restrictions without providing the necessary missiles would avoid making a real decision on using these specific weapons. Due to these constraints, Ukrainian forces have had to compensate for their lack of deep-strike capability by carrying out an incursion into Russia's Kursk region. This situation highlights the importance of long-range weapons in modern warfare and the challenges surrounding their use and deployment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/raytheon-and-northrop-grumman-test-new-long-range-solid-rocket-motor	2024-09-16T01:20:57-07:00

Milkor fully financed the project and is currently manufacturing the first batch of these advanced UAVs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Milkor 380 offers a high level of autonomy, although it remains under human supervision, with automatic take-off and landing capabilities (Picture source: Milkor) Milkor’s marketing and communications director, Daniel du Plessis, highlights the growing demand for UAVs. Recognizing this market potential, the company began building a UAV design and production team from the ground up. Over the last five years, the team has grown to 350 employees, with 80% being engineers. The challenge was to develop nearly every component of the Milkor 380 in-house, from its airframe and avionics to its communications systems. However, the engine and payloads, such as sensors or weapon systems, are sourced externally.The Milkor 380 offers a high level of autonomy, although it remains under human supervision, with automatic take-off and landing capabilities. It can operate within a 250-kilometer range via a ground-based control station but can be managed over much longer distances using satellite communications.

The aircraft’s speed can reach up to 250 kilometers per hour, with a cruising speed between 110 and 150 kilometers per hour. It can fly at altitudes of up to 30,000 feet, though its normal operating altitude is between 15,000 and 18,000 feet. The Milkor 380 can be equipped with weapons for combat roles, its endurance and range are reduced when configured in this way (Picture source: Milkor) Although the Milkor 380 can be equipped with weapons for combat roles, its endurance and range are reduced when configured in this way. Du Plessis also points out that, like other MALE UAVs, the Milkor 380 is vulnerable to modern shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles and is not intended for high-intensity combat zones. Instead, it is most effective in support roles during low-intensity conflicts, which are common in parts of Africa. In such scenarios, the armed version of the UAV can provide essential air cover for ground forces. The Milkor 380 will be showcased at the Africa Aerospace and Defence 2024 exhibition at Air Force Base Waterkloof, near Pretoria, where it has already generated substantial international interest, particularly from other African nations. According to Du Plessis, the UAV is designed to serve as a strategic national asset, demonstrating its importance to both South Africa’s defense capabilities and its standing in the global UAV market.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/milkor-keeps-south-africa-in-global-uav-race-with-milkor-380	2024-09-13T05:49:25-07:00

Exclusive: Russia Poised to Deploy Deadly BMPT-72 Terminator 2 Combat Vehicle in Ukraine	As reported by the Russian news website Vestnik-RM on September 12, 2024, the Russian army may deploy the latest generation of the BMPT-72 Terminator fire support vehicle on the battlefield in Ukraine. The BMPT used by Russian forces, commonly known as the BMPT Terminator model 2017, is an updated version of the BMPT-72 Terminator 2. Introduced into Russian service in the late 2010s, this model saw its first significant deployment for the invasion of Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BMPT-72 Terminator 2 is the latest generation of Russian-made fire support vehicle in the BMPT family. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The BMPT model 2017 shares the same chassis as the T-72 but includes various modernizations and enhancements over the earlier Terminator 2. It retains the core armament of two 30mm 2A42 autocannons, four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles, and secondary weaponry like a 7.62mm PKTM machine gun and automatic grenade launchers. However, the 2017 model benefits from improved fire control systems and better protection, making it more effective in modern combat environments. The deployment of the BMPT Terminator model 2017 in Ukraine is the vehicle's first significant combat test. Russian forces introduced the BMPT to bolster their tank units in complex combat situations, particularly in urban areas where tanks are vulnerable to ambushes, anti-tank guided missiles, and infantry armed with RPGs. The BMPT was seen as a vehicle that could bridge the gap between tank operations and infantry support, offering more protection and firepower to help secure Russian armored advances. In Ukraine, the BMPT was deployed alongside T-72 series and T-90M tanks, primarily in urban and forested areas where tank units faced heavy resistance from Ukrainian forces. The BMPT's combination of autocannons, anti-tank missiles, machine guns, and grenade launchers made it highly effective in neutralizing infantry positions, engaging light armored vehicles, and providing suppressive fire for advancing tank units. However, its actual performance in Ukraine has been met with mixed results. While the BMPT's firepower and armor were considered assets in specific engagements, there were reports that the vehicle was not used in large numbers or in an optimal role. One of the reasons for this is that the Russian military might not have fully integrated the BMPT into their combined arms strategy. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has shown that modern battlefield environments, especially in urban settings, are extremely lethal for armored vehicles, even with support vehicles like the BMPT present. There have also been challenges with Russian logistics and the high intensity of combat, which have limited the BMPT's widespread use. Some analysts suggest that while the BMPT performed well in specific roles, it did not dramatically change the overall effectiveness of Russian armored units in Ukraine. Nevertheless, its deployment highlighted the importance of dedicated armored support vehicles in modern warfare, especially in urban or asymmetric environments where traditional tanks are vulnerable to mobile infantry and advanced anti-tank weapons. The BMPT Model 2017 is the current version in service with the Russian army and deployed in Ukraine. (Picture source Army Recognition Group) The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 are both Russian armored vehicles designed to support tanks and infantry in challenging combat environments, but there are several differences between the two. The BMPT Terminator 1 is based on the T-90 tank chassis, while the BMPT-72 Terminator 2 uses the older T-72 chassis. This difference in platform allows the BMPT-72 to be more cost-effective for countries that have a surplus of T-72 tanks, enabling them to convert those older tanks into BMPTs. In terms of weight, the BMPT Terminator 1, due to its T-90 base, is heavier, weighing around 48 tons. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, being based on the T-72, is slightly lighter. The armament configurations of both models are largely the same, featuring a combination of 30mm cannons, anti-tank missile launchers, and machine guns, designed for anti-infantry and anti-armor roles. The key distinction is the modernization and production flexibility of the BMPT-72, which was designed to be a more affordable upgrade solution by leveraging the widely available T-72 chassis, while the original BMPT Terminator 1 was a more specialized system built from the newer T-90 platform. Both vehicles serve a similar purpose in the battlefield, but the BMPT-72 provides a more versatile and budget-friendly option for militaries with a large inventory of older tanks. The BMPT Terminator 1 and BMPT-72 Terminator 2 both have robust armor and powerful armament designed for urban warfare and supporting tanks, though there are differences between the two models. The Terminator 1, based on the T-90 chassis, benefits from the advanced armor of the T-90 tank, including Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor (ERA), which provides protection against modern anti-tank projectiles and RPGs. This makes the Terminator 1 highly resistant to a variety of battlefield threats. The BMPT-72 Terminator 2, built on the older T-72 chassis, also has strong armor but does not come with the same advanced protection as standard. However, the BMPT-72 can be equipped with modern ERA upgrades to enhance its survivability. In terms of armament, both vehicles are equipped with a formidable array of weapons designed to engage multiple types of targets, including infantry, light vehicles, and even aircraft. The BMPT Terminator 1 is armed with two 30mm 2A42 autocannons. These autocannons are capable of firing both armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds, making them versatile against various threats. Additionally, the Terminator 1 carries four 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which can penetrate heavy armor and engage tanks or bunkers from long distances. The BMPT Terminator 1 is the first version in the BMPT family.

Rafael CEO confirms deployment of Iron Beam laser weapon system by Israel in 2025	According to The Nziv Report on September 12, 2024, Yoav Turgeman, CEO of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, announced that its Iron Beam High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS) will become operational with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) next year. This 100kW system is intended to be a new component of Israel's air defense system, serving as the 'final line of defense' against drones, rockets, and mortars. It is expected to enter active service by late 2025.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Iron Beam laser system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. (Picture source: Rafael) According to Rafael, the Iron Beam system can focus a laser beam with up to 100 kilowatts of power on an aerial target, destroying it within seconds. Its effective range varies depending on factors such as laser power, weather conditions, and the type of target, and it is capable of addressing short- and medium-range threats up to 7 kilometers away. The Iron Beam system has undergone testing, including a series of tests conducted by the IDF in March 2022 that demonstrated its ability to intercept drones, mortars, and missiles. One of the key attributes of the Iron Beam is its lower cost per shot compared to conventional missile interceptors. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. The system also has an unlimited magazine, allowing for continuous use without the need for reloads, and does not produce debris from intercepted threats, reducing the risk of collateral damage. These features are relevant in the context of the ongoing conflict, where Israel has faced a shortage of Iron Dome ammunition. The Gaza war has reportedly cost the Israeli economy over $67.3 billion, according to Israeli economists. Turgeman also discussed the performance of Rafael’s Python 4 and Python 5 missiles, which have been used against drones and cruise missiles during recent Iranian attacks. He noted that the Python 4 missile, in service for four decades, continues to meet operational requirements. Rafael is also developing the 'Skysonic' system, which is intended to provide a hypersonic interception capability against hypersonic missile threats. Each interception using the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, which is lower than the $40,000 to $50,000 cost per interception associated with the Tamir missiles used by the Iron Dome system. (Picture source: Rafael) Rafael, which has been developing directed-energy systems for over 30 years, is working on enhancing the capabilities of the Iron Beam. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously. This development is primarily funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The Iron Beam, also known as 'Magen Or' or 'Shield of Light,' is a 100kW High Energy Laser Weapon System first unveiled at the Singapore Airshow in February 2014. It is designed to intercept a variety of aerial threats using a directed-energy approach. The Iron Beam system uses a fiber laser to destroy short-range rockets, artillery, and mortar bombs, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It operates by detecting and tracking airborne threats, either as a stand-alone system or as part of a broader air defense network. Iron Beam is one component of Israel's integrated missile defense system, which also includes Arrow 2, Arrow 3, David's Sling, and Iron Dome systems. It is intended to complement these layers by providing a directed-energy option for intercepting threats that may not be effectively managed by other interceptors. A Naval Iron Beam variant is also being developed for use on ships to protect against drone swarms and anti-ship missiles. This version, which retains the same external dimensions as the ground-based system, is expected to be operational within four to five years and is planned for deployment on Israeli Navy vessels such as the Reshef-class corvette. The Naval Iron Beam, which retains the same external dimensions as the ground-based system, is expected to be operational within four to five years and is planned for deployment on Israeli Navy vessels such as the Reshef-class corvette. (Picture source: Rafael) Further developments have included efforts to create a mobile version of the Iron Beam system. However, weight and power supply considerations have led to a focus on integrating it with existing stationary platforms. The system's ability to achieve high precision over extended distances suggests potential applications in both military and civilian contexts, particularly in defending against slow-flying drones and other aerial threats that are more vulnerable to laser-based attacks. In April 2022, experiments demonstrated the system's ability to intercept drones, rockets, mortar bombs, and antitank missiles. In response to operational needs, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced plans to deploy the Iron Beam to Israel’s southern border with the Gaza Strip to test its effectiveness in real-world conditions, including during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. The system is expected to be fully operational by the end of 2025, with plans to integrate it into the Iron Dome to allow for coordinated use of both missile interceptors and laser systems. The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. (Picture source: Rafael) The system's fiber laser has the potential to reach a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers and is capable of neutralizing targets within seconds once the laser beam makes contact. By 2023, advancements in the technology enabled the laser to achieve energy levels of 100 kW or more, with the beam's precision focused to the diameter of a coin at distances of up to 10 kilometers. Despite its potential, the use of high-energy lasers like the Iron Beam or the British DragonFly has challenges. Atmospheric conditions such as clouds or rain can affect the beam's ability to reach its target, and the laser must remain focused on a moving target for several seconds to deliver sufficient energy to destroy it. This requirement can limit its effectiveness in countering multiple threats simultaneously, such as a barrage of rockets. Additionally, some targets could be shielded with materials resistant to laser attacks, which could reduce the system’s effectiveness. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, Rafael is developing a version of the Iron Beam that could reach power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously.

Weighing just 153 grams, Trace remains below the FAA’s weight threshold, simplifying its deployment across various contexts without compromising operational safety. Equipped with gimbal-stabilized visible and thermal cameras featuring an impressive 24x zoom, the drone can deliver clear images in both indoor and outdoor environments, making it ideal for a wide range of surveillance applications. One of Trace's main innovations lies in its design focused on discreet operations. Thanks to its low noise signature, it becomes difficult to detect, a valuable feature for tactical reconnaissance operations. Easily portable in a pocket, it is intended for law enforcement, defense personnel, and infrastructure inspectors who require a compact yet powerful tool. The development of Trace benefited from the expertise of leading partners, including branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and various law enforcement agencies. This collaboration has precisely tailored the drone to the most rigorous operational conditions, after four years of intensive testing. The drone incorporates innovations such as the proprietary Poplar radio, which allows an operational range of up to 2 km, and a foldable airframe made of titanium and carbon fiber, providing robustness suitable for field missions. With a flight time of over 30 minutes, Trace sets a benchmark in its category. Security is paramount with the Trace Nano, which is entirely designed, sourced, and built in the USA. It features AES-256 encryption for all communications and data storage, adheres to DoD 'Blue' (pending) and NDAA compliance, and ensures data privacy with no remote data transmission capabilities. Communication is robust over a 2 km line-of-sight (LOS) range and 500 meters in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions with a 30dBi attenuation. It utilizes dual frequency bands—2.36 GHz military and 2.4 GHz ISM—with automatic channel hopping to maintain a stable connection. Compatible with multiple ground control systems (GCS), including QGC, ATAK, WMI, and RAC2, it integrates seamlessly into existing setups. The drone's portability is enhanced with a quick 30-second deploy time and compact stowage via folding arms. The field case is IP67 waterproof, withstanding up to 90 kg of crush force and drops from one meter. A 2-axis stabilized EO/IR gimbal enhances imaging capabilities, controlled from -90° to +70° in pitch. The high-resolution 48 MP EO camera features an f/1.8 autofocus lens, supported by a thermal imaging sensor for comprehensive situational awareness. It offers up to 25x digital zoom and can capture high-definition video in both 1080p and 4K resolutions, storing images as large as 8000 x 6000 pixels. According to Tobin Fisher, CEO of Vantage Robotics, 'After four years of continuous innovation and testing with our DoD and law enforcement partners, Trace stands out as the best ISR nano drone currently available on the market.'
