(Picture source: Saab via SVT Nyheter) According to available visuals, Saab's future fighter will retain key elements from the Gripen, including its engine, vehicle systems, and avionics, while introducing a stealthier airframe, a new digital backbone, advanced communication systems, and AI integrations. The future design will omit the canards featured on the current Gripen. A key part of Saab’s approach includes 'loyal wingman' drones—uncrewed aerial systems designed to operate alongside manned fighters. These drones could serve as decoys to absorb enemy fire or conduct surveillance and precision strikes in high-risk environments. Peter Nilsson, head of Saab’s Advanced Programs business unit, stated that certain platforms might be designed for expendability to fulfill these roles. Saab is also incorporating stealth technologies, including radar-absorbing materials and improved aerodynamic designs, to enhance low observability. Stealth has become a critical feature in air warfare, enabling aircraft to reduce radar detection. The proposals are part of Saab’s Future Combat Aircraft Concept (KFS) study, launched in mid-2023. The program prioritizes low observability, autonomy, and electronic warfare capabilities. Technology validation efforts have included wind tunnel testing and computer simulations. Saab presented its supersonic stealth drone concept at the 33rd International Congress of Aeronautical Sciences in September 2022, featuring internal weapons bays and low-drag aerodynamic design. The KFS program, running until 2030, focuses on demonstrators for both manned and unmanned systems. The program gained further momentum in March 2024 when Försvarets materielverk (FMV), Sweden’s Defence Materiel Administration, awarded Saab a contract for concept studies. These studies cover manned and unmanned platforms, technology demonstrators, and system-level developments. Saab is collaborating with the Swedish Armed Forces, the Total Defense Research Institute, and GKN Aerospace, with studies expected to conclude by the end of 2025. The work coincides with ongoing upgrades to the Gripen C/D fleet and the introduction of the Gripen E, which will enter service in Sweden and Brazil in 2025. Saab has stated that the Gripen E platform may serve as a testbed for emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence. Saab is testing AI integration under 'Project Beyond,' a collaboration with AI software company Helsing. The project includes embedding AI agents in beyond-visual-range combat scenarios directly into operational systems. According to Saab’s head of Gripen, Johan Segertoft, developments in AI and uncrewed systems could also improve manned fighter performance. Saab is exploring additional technologies, such as radar modules integrated within composite structures to enhance radar performance, and it is preparing to test its 3D-printed UAV 'Ruby' under the Rainforest accelerator program. Ruby, powered by a GE Aerospace J85 engine from a Saab 105 trainer, will be tested at the Vidsel range in northern Sweden for defense and civilian applications, including wildfire monitoring. Saab’s proposals aim to integrate manned and unmanned systems, stealth, and AI technologies, with tested platforms like the Gripen E supporting the development process. (Picture source: NATO Air Command) Geopolitical developments, including Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, have increased Sweden’s focus on air defense modernization. Sweden’s 2025–2030 defense strategy addresses these security concerns while aligning with NATO requirements. The strategy increases defense spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2028, allocating 170 billion SEK (€14.9 billion) for military defense and 35.7 billion SEK (€3.1 billion) for civil defense. Sweden has contributed €4.2 billion in military aid to Ukraine, highlighting the importance of stockpiling resources and enhancing logistical readiness for prolonged conflicts. Lessons from Ukraine’s war emphasize the need for technological adaptability, layered air defense, and long-range strike capabilities. Sweden has maintained an independent defense approach, while other Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, and Denmark) have procured US-made F-35 fighters. Sweden’s air defense strategy retains six Swedish Air Force squadrons equipped with JAS 39 Gripen aircraft, including both JAS 39E and older JAS 39C/D variants, to meet NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) requirements. Infrastructure upgrades are planned to improve airbase dispersal and mobilization, and pilot training programs will expand with international opportunities. Between 2025 and 2030, the fighter divisions will integrate long-range strike capabilities and unmanned aerial systems for reconnaissance and security. In December 2022, Sweden exited the UK-led Tempest program, now part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), due to misalignment with its priorities and timeline. Meanwhile, other European nations, including France, Germany, and Spain, are advancing the FCAS sixth-generation fighter program. Analysts such as Lars Peder Haga from the Norwegian Defense Academy point to the financial and technological challenges of independent fighter development. However, Sweden has previously developed advanced aircraft, such as the Viggen and Gripen. Peter Hultqvist, defense spokesperson for the Social Democrats, emphasized the importance of retaining Sweden’s domestic fighter development capability due to its industrial and strategic value. Addressing concerns about development costs, Peter Nilsson referenced the successful JAS 39 Gripen program from the 1980s, which faced similar financial skepticism. Saab’s approach involves sourcing approximately 85% of components internationally while retaining control over design and system integration as a cost-effective solution. The decision on Sweden’s future combat aircraft, expected by 2030, will determine the country’s airpower capabilities and defense industrial strategy. Saab’s proposals aim to integrate manned and unmanned systems, stealth, and AI technologies, with tested platforms like the Gripen E supporting the development process. Sweden’s options include domestic development, international collaboration, or procuring foreign-built systems, with implications for Saab’s workforce, which includes 6,000 engineers in Linköping. The outcome will influence Sweden’s long-term defense readiness and industrial landscape.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/saab-prepares-gripen-jet-successor-with-stealth-fighters-and-ai-powered-drones	2024-12-17T07:19:16-08:00

Black Sea The Black Sea remains a vital and contested maritime domain, with the navies of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia all navigating evolving challenges and roles in the region. Russia's Black Sea Fleet, once dominant, has faced severe disruptions. Ukrainian attacks, particularly with drones and long-range missiles, have significantly reduced Russia’s operational freedom. The loss of the Moskva cruiser and repeated strikes on Sevastopol have forced Russia to reposition much of its fleet to Novorossiysk and further into the Sea of Azov. While it retains submarines and missile-capable corvettes, Russia’s ability to project power in the Black Sea has been hampered, forcing it into a more defensive posture. The Ukrainian Navy, though diminished in conventional strength, has revolutionized naval warfare in the Black Sea. With innovative use of unmanned surface vessels and domestically produced Neptune missiles, Ukraine has inflicted disproportionate damage. This asymmetric strategy has not only targeted major Russian vessels but has also disrupted supply lines to Crimea, diminishing Russia's naval control. Turkey, as the most significant naval power in the Black Sea, carefully manages its position. Its navy, which operates advanced frigates, corvettes, and submarines, focuses on safeguarding Turkish interests while balancing its geopolitical relationships. Turkey’s strict enforcement of the Montreux Convention limits external naval intervention in the Black Sea, ensuring it remains a regional actor with considerable influence. Romania’s naval forces are modest but active. While relying on aging Type 22 frigates and smaller patrol vessels, Romania has increasingly focused on modernization programs to enhance its capabilities. This includes upgrading its fleet for better coastal defense and mine-clearance operations, vital for maintaining the safety of Black Sea shipping lanes. Georgia does not maintain a formal navy. Its Coast Guard remains responsible for maritime security, focusing on territorial water patrols and countering smuggling. Heavily reliant on external support, Georgia continues to upgrade its patrol capabilities through assistance programs.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/bulgarias-naval-modernization-second-patrol-vessel-successfully-launched	2024-12-17T01:43:55-08:00

(Picture source: Social Media) The VC TAM 2C-A2 project, considered a key element in modernizing the armored capabilities of the Argentine Army, is facing financial and logistical difficulties that are slowing its execution. One of the main challenges is the shortage of critical spare parts for the chassis of the selected tanks, which has hindered the completion of the planned units. This issue also extends to other essential supplies needed for the advancement of the program. According to sources consulted, concerns have been expressed regarding the lack of released financial guarantees for various suppliers. Several sectors have pointed out that difficulties related to these guarantees are causing additional delays and significant financial costs. This situation is also reflected in the shortage of spare parts and critical components, the delivery of which depends on contracts currently undergoing renegotiations with international suppliers, including key players such as the Israeli company Elbit Systems. Efforts are currently underway to amend the contract to include ammunition and spare parts, although the process is progressing slowly. Argentine faces several potential threats in its region, both military and economic. Among the major concerns is the ongoing dispute with the United Kingdom over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, a conflict that has persisted since the 1982 war and could still lead to tensions. Additionally, instability in neighboring countries, particularly in Venezuela and Bolivia, could have repercussions for regional security. The growing activities of transnational criminal groups, including drug trafficking and terrorism, also pose a threat to domestic stability. Finally, the strengthening of military capabilities by other South American nations, coupled with defense agreements with extra-regional powers like the United States or China, raises concerns about the strategic balance in the region. One of the most criticized aspects of the VC TAM 2C-A2 program is the frequency with which the systems are presented at ceremonial events. While these events aim to showcase progress and maintain visibility of the program, they disrupt modernization efforts due to the shortage of personnel assigned. As a result, this exacerbates the delays in the program and reduces the number of fully operational systems. The financial difficulties related to the release of guarantees have had a significant impact on both suppliers and the program itself. As highlighted in a previous article by Zona Militar, these debts are creating a bottleneck in the development of military capabilities and raising concerns about the financial management of the Argentine Armed Forces. Despite these challenges, the VC TAM 2C-A2 program remains a central component of the Argentine Army's modernization efforts. However, the lack of significant progress highlights the need for a reassessment to ensure the program’s continuity and adherence to reasonable timelines. Ceremonial events, such as the one scheduled for Friday, reinforce the narrative of progress in the public eye but also highlight the structural limitations of the program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/argentine-prepares-for-integration-of-first-10-vc-tam-2c-a2-main-battle-tanks	2024-12-17T01:24:49-08:00

15th Khordad Air Defense Systems: Iran’s Response to Growing US-Israel Strike Threats	According to information published by Russian sources on December 15, 2024, Iran has begun deploying its 15th Khordad air defense systems near critical nuclear facilities, a move aimed at countering escalating threats from the United States and Israel. The latest reports confirm the presence of these systems around the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear site in Natanz, a key location in Iran’s uranium enrichment efforts situated in Isfahan Province.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Iran fortifies its nuclear facilities with advanced 15th Khordad air defense systems, signaling preparedness against potential U.S. and Israeli strikes. (Picture source: Defa Press) The Natanz facility, one of Iran’s key nuclear sites, has long been under international scrutiny due to allegations by the U.S. and Israel that it plays a central role in Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Both nations claim that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities, a charge Tehran vehemently denies, asserting its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Despite these denials, Israel and the U.S. have reiterated their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, with Israel in particular warning of preemptive military action if diplomatic efforts fail. The 15th Khordad air defense system, introduced in 2019, represents a significant leap in Iran’s ability to defend its airspace. As a domestically designed and manufactured platform, it symbolizes Iran’s push for self-reliance in military technology, especially under the weight of international sanctions that limit its access to foreign arms. This advanced system is capable of detecting and engaging a wide range of aerial threats, including fighter jets, drones, and stealth aircraft. It can identify targets at a distance of up to 150 kilometers, track them within a 120-kilometer radius, and engage at ranges of up to 75 kilometers. For stealth targets, the system offers detection capabilities at 85 kilometers and interception at 45 kilometers. The 15th Khordad is also capable of simultaneously tracking and intercepting six targets, making it a formidable tool against coordinated aerial attacks. One of its standout features is its rapid deployment time, requiring less than five minutes to become operational, allowing Iranian forces to quickly respond to potential threats. The system is equipped with Sayyad-3 missiles, which are designed for medium- to long-range engagements. These missiles enhance the system’s capacity to neutralize advanced aerial threats, including those posed by modern fighter aircraft and high-altitude surveillance platforms. The system’s maximum operational altitude is 27 kilometers, enabling it to engage targets across a broad vertical range. The placement of the 15th Khordad systems near the Natanz nuclear facility signals Iran’s intent to shield its most sensitive sites from potential airstrikes. This move comes amid heightened tensions with Israel, which has a history of targeting Iranian-linked assets in Syria and is widely believed to have carried out sabotage operations against Iranian nuclear sites in the past. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasized that his country will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability, and Israeli military officials have reportedly developed operational plans for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. U.S. rhetoric has also been strong, with Washington maintaining that all options remain on the table to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program. However, the Biden administration has so far prioritized diplomatic efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. Despite these efforts, the lack of progress in negotiations has fueled speculation that military action by either Israel or the U.S. remains a possibility. The deployment of the 15th Khordad systems also reflects Iran’s broader strategy to counter increasing Israeli activity in the region. Over recent years, the Israeli Air Force has conducted numerous strikes in Syria, targeting Iranian-aligned forces and infrastructure. These operations, facilitated by the limited air defense capabilities in Syria, demonstrate Israel’s ability to project power across the region. Analysts suggest that these missions could serve as a precursor to strikes on Iran, as they test Israel’s operational readiness and tactics. Iran’s deployment of the 15th Khordad systems adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile Middle East. While Tehran views these measures as defensive, their strategic implications are likely to alarm its adversaries.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/15th-khordad-air-defense-systems-irans-response-to-growing-us-israel-strike-threats	2024-12-16T05:27:35-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Zorawar light tank is a new combat platform specifically designed for high-altitude operations. (Picture source: Indian Social Media) These trials took place in the Ladakh region, an area of strategic importance where India and China have longstanding territorial disputes. The Indian Army has identified a need for 354 of these 25-ton-class light tanks to enhance its combat capabilities in mountainous terrain. Entirely developed within India, the Zorawar represents a significant departure from the heavier armored platforms previously deployed by the nation’s ground forces, which have traditionally relied on main battle tanks originally intended for use on flat plains and deserts. According to the Hindustan Times, the Zorawar prototype was completed at L&amp;T’s facility in July, marking a critical developmental milestone achieved in just two years. The tank is expected to become fully operational by 2027, a move that will bolster India’s defense posture along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and better equip the Indian Army to counter the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA has already introduced modern light tanks into the region—platforms that offer high power-to-weight ratios, agility, and strong performance at altitude. Currently, the Indian Army has deployed dozens of Russian-designed T-72 and T-90 tanks to the Ladakh theater. While these tanks are combat-proven and formidable in many scenarios, their operational effectiveness is limited by the thin air, steep inclines, and rugged terrain of high-altitude areas. Designed originally for operations on level ground and in desert environments, the T-72s and T-90s do not possess the same adaptability when confronted with the harsh mountain conditions. The introduction of the Zorawar is intended to close these capability gaps. By optimizing the platform for high altitude performance, agility, and quick reaction times, India aims to field a light tank that can excel where heavier platforms struggle. Beyond just firepower and armor, the Zorawar’s design priorities include improved engine performance in low-oxygen environments, advanced suspension systems to handle uneven terrain, and state-of-the-art target acquisition sensors to ensure accuracy despite difficult visibility and weather conditions. This evolution in India’s armored forces could be instrumental in maintaining a credible defensive and, if necessary, offensive stance in one of the world’s most demanding operational theaters. As both India and China continue to reinforce their positions along disputed border areas, the introduction of a homegrown, high-altitude-capable tank like the Zorawar underscores India’s strategic emphasis on self-reliance, technological innovation, and readiness to operate effectively in extreme conditions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/india-conducts-high-altitude-trials-of-its-new-zorawar-light-tank	2024-12-16T02:29:01-08:00

Belarus Hosts Russian Nuclear Weapons and Prepares for Oreshnik Ballistic Missile Deployment	Amid heightened international tensions fueled by the conflict in Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his country is hosting dozens of Russian tactical nuclear weapons and is preparing to deploy the new Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile. Reported by AP News on December 10, 2024, this statement, made during discussions on strengthened security guarantees between Minsk and Moscow, highlights an increasingly strategic partnership between the two allies in their stance against the West. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belarus notably possesses Russian Iskander-M launchers and missiles capable of being equipped with nuclear warheads (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) This nuclear deployment aligns with a significant revision of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, which now explicitly includes Belarus under Moscow’s 'nuclear umbrella.' This marks a historical shift for Minsk, which relinquished its nuclear arsenal following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. At that time, Belarus transferred its nuclear weapons to Russia and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear state. However, recent events, including a 2022 constitutional referendum that removed Belarus’ nuclear-free status, have paved the way for this return to hosting nuclear capabilities. President Lukashenko stated that these weapons were transferred discreetly, avoiding detection by Western intelligence agencies. He emphasized their defensive role against potential threats, particularly from Belarus’ borders. This strategy relies on Iskander ballistic missiles, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, as well as fighter jets equipped with nuclear bombs. These systems enable rapid targeting of potential positions in Ukraine or NATO member states, enhancing the deterrence capabilities of the Russo-Belarusian alliance. In addition, Lukashenko revealed preparations are underway for the deployment of the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile in 2025. Capable of carrying multiple warheads and reaching speeds exceeding Mach 10, this system is designed to evade missile defense systems, offering Russia an unparalleled strategic advantage. Russian President Vladimir Putin has highlighted the conventional power of the Oreshnik, stating its destructive capability rivals that of nuclear strikes. While control of these weapons will remain with Moscow, Minsk will be involved in selecting targets, further integrating the military strategies of the two nations. The Oreshnik missile represents a notable development in Russia's strategic arsenal. With hypersonic capabilities and an estimated range of 1,000 to 5,500 kilometers, it can strike critical infrastructure across Europe and parts of Asia. Equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), it can deliver conventional or nuclear warheads to several targets simultaneously with precision. First used operationally in November 2024 during the conflict in Ukraine, the missile demonstrated its strategic potential in a strike against an industrial facility. Although the warheads used were inert, the kinetic energy generated by the hypersonic speed caused significant damage, showcasing its effectiveness as both a tactical weapon and a tool of strategic deterrence. Lukashenko also noted that Belarus has retained dozens of Soviet-era sites suitable for deploying such systems. These facilities, combined with local production of transport vehicles for ballistic missiles, underline Minsk’s commitment to strengthening its role within its strategic partnership with Moscow. This alliance, formalized through a recently signed mutual security treaty, aims to deter any external aggression, particularly from NATO. The deployment of these systems, however, raises international concerns about regional stability and the risk of military escalation. While Moscow and Minsk assert that the measures are purely defensive, they represent a substantial increase in strategic pressure on Eastern Europe. Additionally, the recent lowering of Russia’s threshold for nuclear weapon use amplifies fears of potential conflict involving weapons of mass destruction. The hosting of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus and the planned deployment of Oreshnik missiles mark a significant evolution in regional security dynamics. For Minsk, these developments strengthen its strategic position alongside Moscow but also pose questions about its long-term sovereignty and security. As Belarus becomes an integral part of Russia’s nuclear strategy, these actions underscore growing tensions among major powers, signaling considerable challenges for international stability and security. Belarus’ interest in hosting advanced missile systems such as the Oreshnik lies in its strategic value. By accommodating these advanced systems, Belarus enhances its military alliance with Russia, securing stronger defense guarantees amid growing tensions with NATO and Western nations. These weapons provide Minsk with a deterrent against potential foreign intervention and bolster its geopolitical leverage in international negotiations. For European nations and NATO, the deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus represents a significant escalation of threats near their eastern borders. These missiles, with their ability to carry nuclear warheads and strike at intermediate ranges, pose a risk to critical European infrastructure, altering the regional strategic balance. This development compels NATO to reassess its defense mechanisms and bolster its deterrent capabilities to counter this emerging threat. Furthermore, it could intensify an arms race in the region, increasing the potential for misunderstandings and unintended confrontations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/belarus-hosts-russian-nuclear-weapons-and-prepares-for-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-deployment	2024-12-16T00:38:23-08:00

According to senior Ukrainian officials, the missile was equipped with 'dummy' warheads that lacked explosives, prompting U.S. experts to describe the method as an 'expensive way to deliver not that much destruction.' Despite that, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that Oreshnik's warheads, even inert, can cause 'a lot of damage' because of the kinetic energy created by their hypersonic speed. The launch appears to have been conducted with a lofted trajectory. Eyewitness accounts described prolonged explosions lasting up to three hours. Deputy Press Secretary Singh sought to temper speculation about the missile’s potential impact, emphasizing that it would not constitute a decisive shift in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 'Should Russia choose to launch this type of missile, it’s not going to be a game changer on the battlefield,' Singh said. 'They’re trying to use every weapon in their arsenal to intimidate Ukraine. But Ukraine, with the United States and other partners around the world, continues to have our support as they fight every single day on the battlefield.' The United States and its allies have been steadfast in their military and economic support for Ukraine, supplying advanced weaponry, intelligence, and financial assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities. Despite Russia’s efforts to escalate tensions through demonstrations of military power, Singh reaffirmed the commitment of Ukraine’s international partners to ensure its resilience and sovereignty. The potential use of Oreshnik missiles poses significant threats to both Ukraine and Europe. For Ukraine, the missile’s high speed, precision, and ability to carry multiple warheads amplify the risks to critical infrastructure and civilian populations. Russia’s ability to conduct long-range strikes with near impunity challenges Ukraine’s air defense systems and could complicate ongoing counteroffensives. Beyond Ukraine, the missile’s range places much of Europe within reach, raising concerns about the broader security of NATO member states and the potential for escalations in the region. Additionally, the threat of Russia pairing hypersonic delivery systems with nuclear warheads heightens the strategic risk, forcing European nations to reassess their missile defense capabilities. In conclusion, while the Oreshnik missile’s tactical value on the battlefield may be limited, its potential as a strategic weapon of intimidation underscores the need for continued vigilance and cooperation among Ukraine’s allies. The missile serves as a reminder of the evolving nature of modern warfare and the importance of maintaining robust defenses against emerging threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-says-russia-plans-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-test-against-ukraine-soon	2024-12-15T02:53:31-08:00

Breaking News: British Army Deploys Laser Weapon from Wolfhound Armored Vehicle for First Time to Counter Drones	The British Army has successfully deployed a laser weapon system mounted on an armored vehicle, marking the first operational use of such technology in the field. The High Energy Laser (HEL) demonstrator, developed through a collaboration between Defence Equipment &amp; Support (DE&amp;S), the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and Raytheon UK, was successfully tested in October 2024 at Radnor Range in Wales. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The British Army has successfully deployed a laser weapon system mounted on an armored vehicle, marking the first operational use of such technology in the field. (Picture source: British DoD) This test, a key step in the development of directed energy weapons, saw the laser mounted on a Wolfhound vehicle, an armored troop-carrying platform used by the British Army. Soldiers from the 16th Royal Artillery Regiment tracked and destroyed a series of drones in flight, demonstrating the HEL system’s effectiveness against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in real-world conditions. The ability to engage and neutralize aerial threats using a directed energy weapon marks a turning point in the Army’s approach to countering fast-moving and mobile targets like drones. The test was made possible through collaboration between DSTL, DE&amp;S, and Raytheon UK. Together, they developed the system as part of the UK Ministry of Defence’s efforts to explore advanced, cost-effective, and scalable technological solutions to protect military assets against growing drone threats. This success is part of Project Swinton, a demonstrator for the Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) system, which showcases the viability of lasers as a future solution for countering uncrewed aerial systems (C-UAS). The rise of drones during the Ukrainian conflict has marked a turning point in modern warfare, with thousands of drones used by both sides for reconnaissance, attack, and intelligence missions. These devices, often small and inexpensive, have allowed Ukrainian forces to conduct targeted strikes on strategic objectives while bypassing traditional defense systems. At the same time, drones have proven effective tools for harassing and disrupting enemy lines, offering an excellent cost-to-effectiveness ratio compared to larger conventional weapons. In the face of this growing threat, it has become imperative for armies to have access to low-cost, efficient solutions to counter drones, including loitering munitions and surveillance UAVs. Technologies such as directed energy weapons, capable of destroying drones in flight with a much lower cost per shot compared to traditional munitions, have thus become essential for ensuring the protection of armed forces against this new form of asymmetric warfare. The LDEW system works by directing an intense beam of infrared light in the form of energy toward its target using advanced sensors and tracking systems, which maintain real-time accuracy and lock-on. For security reasons, it has not been revealed how long the beam must stay in contact with the target before it is destroyed. Stephen Waller, the Directed Energy Weapons Team Leader at DE&amp;S, noted, 'This is still an emerging technology, but the world has changed, and we are seeing more drones in the battlespace. This requires a more cost-effective solution to protect our troops.' Indeed, cheaper drone technologies are now available on the market thanks to advancements in the commercial sector. These drones can be used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, but as inexpensive loitering munitions, they present a significant cost gap compared to the larger armored vehicles they disable. This is particularly evident in Ukraine, where defense officials have confirmed that Ukrainian forces have deployed over 1.2 million drones in the last 11 months against invading Russian forces. By the end of 2024, they added, another 100,000 units are planned for delivery. In light of this reality, solutions like the LDEW system present a critical potential response to the growing drone threat. The successful test at Radnor Range is not only a technical victory but also a strong signal of the British Army’s intention to continue investing in advanced defense technologies. By integrating directed energy weapon systems into armored vehicles like the Wolfhound, the Army is preparing for the future of defense vehicles, where the emphasis will be placed on advanced weapons and active defense solutions. The trials at Radnor Range are part of a larger program aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of these technologies in real combat scenarios. The deployment of laser weapons could indeed revolutionize the way armies around the world respond to emerging aerial threats while reducing the costs and risks associated with traditional defense methods. The British Army, through partnerships such as those between DSTL, DE&amp;S, and Raytheon UK, continues to demonstrate its commitment to staying at the forefront of defense innovation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-british-army-deploys-laser-weapon-from-wolfhound-armored-vehicle-for-first-time-to-counter-drones	2024-12-13T02:45:15-08:00

Syria's Navy Neutralized: Israeli Forces Target Missile Boats in Mediterranean	According to information published by the Israeli MoD on December 10, 2024, the Israeli Navy launched a large-scale offensive yesterday targeting Syrian naval assets at the Port of Latakia and Minet el-Beida Bay in Northwestern Syria. The operation, described by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Katz as a 'decisive strike,' reportedly resulted in the complete destruction of the Syrian Navy's Mediterranean fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Israeli Navy strikes Syrian naval assets in Latakia and Minet el-Beida Bay, claiming total destruction of the Syrian Navy's Mediterranean fleet. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) Footage released by the Israeli Navy captures the intensity of the operation, which focused on neutralizing strategic assets of the Syrian Navy. Among the targets were six Osa I and six Osa II-class missile boats, vessels armed with potent sea-to-sea missile systems. These Soviet-designed fast attack crafts, renowned for their speed and firepower, have been a cornerstone of Syrian maritime defense for decades. However, their destruction represents a critical blow to Syria's naval capabilities in the region. The Israeli Navy employed precision-guided munitions, electronic warfare measures, and coordinated strikes to neutralize these vessels. The operation reportedly involved advanced missile systems, potentially launched from Israel's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes and Dolphin-class submarines. The Port of Latakia, Syria's principal seaport, and Minet el-Beida Bay, a strategic maritime location near the Turkish border, were key focal points of the offensive. Latakia has been a hub for Syrian naval operations and has seen increased activity due to its proximity to Russian military installations. The targeting of this port underscores Israel's intent to disrupt Syrian maritime operations and its broader strategic partnerships. Minet el-Beida Bay, though less prominent, holds strategic value due to its location and potential use as a covert operational base for Syrian forces. By striking these locations, Israel aims to limit any future resurgence of Syrian naval power in the Mediterranean. The offensive comes amid heightened tensions in the region, with ongoing conflicts and shifting alliances complicating the geopolitical landscape. The Syrian Navy's reliance on aging Soviet-era vessels, coupled with limited resources for modernization, had already placed it at a disadvantage compared to Israel's naval fleet. This operation further solidifies Israel's maritime dominance. Meanwhile, regional observers suggest the operation could have far-reaching implications for maritime security in the Eastern Mediterranean. The destruction of Syrian naval assets not only weakens Damascus but also sends a warning to other adversaries in the region. This operation aligns with Israel's long-standing policy of preemptive strikes against perceived threats. While previous actions have primarily targeted land-based missile sites and arms depots, this marks one of the most significant naval operations by Israel in recent years. As tensions remain high, the Eastern Mediterranean is likely to see increased militarization and potential for further confrontations. For Israel, the success of this operation reinforces its strategic deterrence, though the broader regional fallout remains uncertain. Israel’s readiness and ability to conduct such a comprehensive maritime operation underscore its focus on maintaining security and supremacy in the face of regional threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/syrias-navy-neutralized-israeli-forces-target-missile-boats-in-mediterranean	2024-12-12T02:19:34-08:00

Japan selects US-made T-6 Texan II as new trainer aircraft to replace locally-made Fuji T-7	Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on November 29, 2024, the selection of the Textron Aviation Defense Beechcraft T-6 Texan II turboprop aircraft, proposed by Kanematsu Corporation, as the next-generation primary trainer for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). This selection is part of the replacement program for the Fuji T-7 trainers, which have been in service since 2003 and are approaching the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The selection process commenced on August 21, 2024, when the MoD issued requests for proposals. Evaluations were conducted in two stages. The first stage assessed compliance with performance, ground training systems, logistical support, and operational requirements. Out of four proposals, only the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II and the PC-7MKX, proposed by Subaru Corporation, advanced to the second stage. The Turkish Hurkus, proposed by Daihyaku Shoji, did not meet critical requirements, while Shintoa Trading’s proposal was disqualified due to the absence of a required aircraft component. In the second stage, a scoring system was used to evaluate performance, cost, and operational factors. The T-6 Texan II achieved the highest score and was selected. The total program cost for the T-6, including six simulators and other ground training equipment, is estimated at JPY 133.65 billion ($882.09 million). Each aircraft is projected to cost JPY 1.21 billion ($7.99 million). The FY2025 budget includes an allocation of JPY 21.2 billion ($139.92 million) for two aircraft and related systems. Japan plans to procure 36 aircraft in total, all to be imported, with deliveries scheduled through FY2030 to align with the planned retirement of the Fuji T-7 fleet. The selection of the T-6 Texan II did not include trial flights, relying instead on document-based evaluations. This methodology, while less common, reflects the MoD’s focus on cost-effectiveness and operational compliance. The decision builds on Japan’s historical use of earlier T-6 variants, including the T-6D/F/G and SNJ-5/6, operated by the JASDF and Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) from 1955. These earlier variants were replaced by jet-powered trainers in the 1960s, though some are preserved in museums, and one remains operational at Shizuhama Air Base. The MoD’s selection of the T-6 Texan II is part of a broader modernization of Japan’s pilot training infrastructure. The program is designed to prepare pilots for advanced fighter aircraft while addressing operational requirements. It remains uncertain whether the T-6 could also replace other training platforms, such as the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s T-5 trainer or the Kawasaki T-4 advanced trainer. The T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Japan’s acquisition of the T-6 aligns with international trends toward standardization in training systems. Deliveries are set to begin in 2027, marking the first step in Japan’s phased approach to upgrading its training fleet. The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II is equipped with a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-68 turboprop engine generating 1,100 horsepower. Its specifications include a maximum speed of 586 km/h, a climb rate of 1,372 meters per minute, a service ceiling of 9,500 meters, and a range of 1,574 kilometers.

Greece Prioritizes M113 Modernization Over US Bradleys and French VBCIs	According to information published by the specialized website OnAlert on December 9, 2024, the Greek military has decided to modernize its fleet of M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) rather than acquire new vehicles like the American M2 Bradleys or the French VBCIs. This decision, driven by budgetary constraints and operational requirements, represents a significant move in Greece's efforts to upgrade its armored vehicle fleet while addressing its military needs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Army soldiers conducted a convoy operation to an objective during force-on-force training at Petrochori Range, Triantafyllides Camp, Greece, as part of Olympic Cooperation 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) For years, the Greek General Staff has sought to modernize its mechanized infantry, which has faced growing obsolescence in its equipment. The Kentauros Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) project, launched in the 2000s, was abandoned, leaving Greece without a viable replacement for its aging vehicles. In 2020, a proposal was made to acquire M2A2/M2A2OD Bradleys from the United States. Although approved in 2023 for the transfer of 300 units, the refurbishment costs of the vehicles proved prohibitive. Even an offer involving 62 Bradleys free of charge and 102 more under favorable financial terms was deemed unaffordable by Athens due to budgetary limitations. Simultaneously, France proposed a compelling alternative: the immediate delivery of 120 VBCIs, with an additional 250 units to be co-produced with Greek industry. However, this option was also considered too costly. A competing offer from Rheinmetall for its KF-41 Lynx failed to secure interest for similar reasons. Ultimately, the Greek military opted for a more economical solution by modernizing its M113 fleet. This program, a collaboration between the Israeli company Rafael and the Greek firm METKA, involves upgrading over 500 M113 vehicles. The modernization includes the installation of remote-controlled weapon stations with 30mm cannons, enhanced armor, a new, more powerful propulsion system, advanced communication systems, and modern optronic sensors. The upgrades will be conducted at METKA’s facility in Magnesia, with costs significantly lower than the alternatives proposed, making this option particularly attractive for Athens. However, M113s remain APCs with a weight of 12 tons, which is significantly lighter than modern IFVs like the Bradley and VBCI, which weigh nearly twice as much and offer superior firepower. The standard M113 armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun, suitable for defense against infantry and lightly armored threats. In contrast, the VBCI is equipped with a 25mm cannon mounted on a remote turret, while the Bradley boasts a 25mm M242 cannon and can be fitted with TOW anti-tank missiles, providing substantial offensive capabilities against heavily armored targets. Regarding protection, the M113 features aluminum armor designed to withstand small arms fire and shell fragments but remains vulnerable to modern anti-tank weapons. By contrast, the VBCI and Bradley provide more robust protection against ballistic threats and improvised explosive devices. Both IFVs also incorporate advanced detection and communication systems, enhancing their battlefield efficiency. While the M113 fulfills its primary role as a troop carrier, the VBCI and Bradley surpass it in firepower, protection, and operational versatility. This choice reflects a pragmatic approach by Greece to extend the lifespan of existing equipment while addressing immediate operational needs. Modernizing the M113 fleet offers a cost-effective alternative to acquiring modern IFVs, especially considering the purchase, maintenance, and training costs associated with new vehicles. Moreover, the program supports local industry through partnerships like that with METKA, contributing to the Greek defense economy. Modernizing the M113 allows Greece to respond swiftly to operational demands. While these vehicles do not match the capabilities of Bradleys or VBCIs, upgrades such as remote weapon stations, improved armor, and advanced communication systems enhance their battlefield utility. This approach also enables Greece to deploy a larger number of modernized vehicles, reinforcing its mechanized forces quantitatively, even if qualitatively they remain behind modern IFVs. Currently, the Greek military possesses approximately 2,900 M113 APCs, including various variants acquired over decades to meet operational requirements.

Analysis: With Fewer Forces Than Cold War British Army Could Collapse in 6 Months of Ukraine-Style War	Veterans Minister Al Carns, a former Royal Marine colonel, has issued a grave warning about the readiness of the British Armed Forces. He cautioned that in a conflict of the scale and intensity of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the British Army could be 'expended in six months to a year.' This stark assessment underscores significant limitations in the UK’s capacity to sustain prolonged, high-intensity military engagements, raising pressing questions about its ability to fulfill national defense obligations and meet NATO commitments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British soldiers during training exercises, highlighting efforts to maintain readiness as the Army faces historic reductions in troop numbers and challenges in sustaining prolonged high-intensity conflicts. (Picture source: British MoD) Data released earlier this year by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) lends weight to these concerns. British troop numbers have plummeted to their lowest levels since the early 1800s, with a 38% decline in recruits over the past two decades. Total personnel in the armed forces has dropped from 207,000 in 2000 to just 131,000 in 2024. The British Army now fields approximately 73,000 regular soldiers—the smallest force in its modern history—while the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force stand at 29,000 and 33,000 personnel, respectively. This dramatic erosion contrasts sharply with the Cold War, when the UK maintained robust military forces designed to counter large-scale threats such as the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the British Army was one of NATO’s strongest and most capable forces. Though smaller than the U.S. military, the UK played a pivotal role in the alliance’s defense strategy, particularly in Europe. Its reputation rested on a combination of highly trained personnel, modern equipment, and strategic positioning, bolstered by its independent nuclear deterrent. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), stationed in West Germany, exemplified this strength, consisting of four armored divisions equipped with over 800 Chieftain and Challenger 1 tanks, advanced artillery, and air defense systems like the Rapier missile. The UK’s global reach further enhanced its military power. The Royal Navy operated over 130 combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and a formidable submarine fleet. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force fielded more than 850 aircraft, including Tornado, Harrier, and Jaguar fighters, alongside robust reconnaissance and transport capabilities. Today, this once-formidable capability has been significantly diminished. The British Army now operates only 227 Challenger 2 tanks, with upgrades to Challenger 3 underway. Artillery inventories have been severely reduced, and the British Army’s ability to sustain high-volume, long-range firepower in prolonged engagements falls short of modern requirements. The Royal Navy, once boasting 130 vessels, now operates just 73, including two Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but with only 19 frigates and destroyers to escort them. Similarly, the Royal Air Force’s fleet has declined to around 500 aircraft, even as advanced platforms like the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II have entered service. The war in Ukraine vividly illustrates the resources and resilience required for sustained, high-intensity conflict. Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia has depended on continuous supplies of tanks, artillery, drones, and ammunition, much of it provided by NATO allies. If the UK faced a similar-scale conflict, the British Armed Forces would likely struggle to sustain operations beyond a few months. Insufficient ammunition stockpiles, aging equipment, and gaps in critical systems such as air defense are significant vulnerabilities. British ammunition reserves, in particular, would be quickly exhausted, given the consumption rates observed in Ukraine, where thousands of artillery rounds are fired daily. Logistical endurance remains a critical challenge. The lack of robust air defense systems capable of countering drones and precision missile strikes further exposes vulnerabilities in prolonged engagements. These deficiencies underscore the UK's challenges as it seeks to modernize its forces and rebuild its capacity. Efforts to address these issues are underway. The Future Soldier initiative aims to restructure the British Army into smaller, agile Brigade Combat Teams with enhanced digital capabilities. Procurement projects, including upgrades to Challenger 3 tanks, the acquisition of Archer self-propelled howitzers, and investments in counter-drone technologies, represent steps in the right direction. However, the pace of modernization has been slow, and the gap between current capabilities and the demands of high-intensity warfare remains substantial. Financial constraints further complicate these efforts. The UK’s defense budget for the 2023/24 fiscal year was £53.9 billion, with planned increases to £56.9 billion in 2024/25 and £59.8 billion in 2025/26. This represents an annual real-terms growth rate of 2.3%. While former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030—potentially delivering an additional £75 billion—specific plans to achieve this target remain unclear. Current allocations may be insufficient to address existing capability gaps and modernization needs. The warnings from Veterans Minister Al Carns, coupled with British MoD data and lessons from the Ukraine war, highlight the urgent need for a reassessment of the UK’s defense priorities. The sharp decline in personnel, equipment, and logistical endurance underscores a critical challenge in maintaining a credible deterrent. Heavy weaponry, robust air defenses, and sustained logistical support are essential areas for investment if the British Armed Forces are to remain effective in modern warfare. Without decisive action and adequate funding, the UK risks further erosion of its military capabilities and its standing as a global military power.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-with-fewer-forces-than-cold-war-british-army-could-collapse-in-6-months-of-ukraine-style-war	2024-12-10T09:38:27-08:00

Peru has a long history of acquiring combat aircraft, influenced by its geopolitical and economic environment. The last major purchase was in the 1980s, when the country became the first export customer of the Mirage 2000, a multirole fighter developed by Dassault Aviation. This acquisition, aimed at modernizing the Peruvian Air Force (FAP) amid regional tensions, cemented Dassault’s reputation as a key supplier to Peru. Since then, the Mirage 2000 has remained the backbone of Peru’s air capabilities, but these aircraft are now approaching the end of their operational lifespan. For reference, Peru acquired 12 Mirage 2000s in the 1980s, divided into 10 Mirage 2000P versions for combat missions and 2 Mirage 2000DP versions for training. These aircraft remain a central element of the Peruvian Air Force, though their growing obsolescence necessitates modernization or replacement. Additionally, Peru is seeking to replace its aging Soviet-origin aircraft with more modern South Korean models. This initiative aims to enhance the operational capabilities of the Peruvian Air Force (FAP) while diversifying its sources of military procurement. Among the options considered is the KF-21 Boramae, a next-generation fighter developed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI). This choice is driven by the KF-21’s advanced performance and the technology transfer opportunities offered by South Korea, a partnership that could foster local production and strengthen Peru’s industrial capabilities. Peru is also exploring the KF-1 Halcón, another aircraft developed by KAI. This lightweight fighter was designed to meet the needs of emerging nations, combining competitive performance with reduced acquisition and operational costs. The KF-1 could complement or replace the MiG-29s currently in service, providing a more budget-friendly solution for the FAP. Seman Perú SAC, a local company, is already preparing to produce parts for this model, demonstrating South Korea’s commitment to integrating Peru’s industry into its defense projects. In the long term, the KF-1 could play a key role in Peru’s fleet modernization strategy, coexisting with a frontline fighter like the KF-21 Boramae. Historically, the FAP has operated aircraft such as 21 MiG-29s and 18 Sukhoi Su-25s, acquired in the 1990s. While effective in their time, these aircraft now face increasing challenges in maintenance and parts availability. Replacing them with South Korean jets represents a strategic advance, enabling Peru to reduce dependence on Russian military equipment and strengthen national defense against contemporary threats. Furthermore, Peru-South Korea military cooperation is not new. In 2010, South Korea boosted the FAP’s capabilities by donating eight Cessna A-37B Dragonfly light attack aircraft. These historical ties provide a solid foundation for future agreements, including potential acquisitions of the KF-21 and KF-1 Halcón. These projects are part of a broader strategy to modernize Peru’s defense forces while promoting international technological partnerships and local development. In recent years, Peru has intensified its efforts to modernize its land and naval capabilities, adopting a clear strategy to enhance national defense and diversify international partnerships. In November 2024, the Peruvian Army signed a major agreement with Hyundai Rotem to acquire K2 Black Panther tanks and K808 armored vehicles, replacing decades-old T-55 tanks. While the exact cost of the deal was not disclosed, it includes technology transfer and the possibility of local production, thereby boosting the national defense industry. These new assets will improve the mobility, protection, and firepower of Peru’s ground forces, addressing urgent modernization needs. The Peruvian Navy has also undertaken ambitious initiatives to strengthen its capabilities. In November 2024, an agreement was signed with Hyundai Heavy Industries for the design and construction of a new submarine to modernize its underwater fleet. This strategic project aims to enhance maritime deterrence and power projection, essential for securing the country’s territorial waters and maritime resources. Concurrently, significant investments are being made in naval infrastructure: $2.67 million has been allocated to modernize the SIMA Callao shipyard, while $3.85 million will be invested to enhance the operational capabilities of the Callao Naval Air Base.

China Develops a Near-Light-Speed Radar System to Counter Submarine Stealth	Chinese scientists have developed a 'ghost' radar capable of emitting electromagnetic waves at speeds close to the speed of light, enabling submarine detection. This innovation is based on the advanced use of the Doppler effect and high-energy microwave synthesis, as detailed in a study published on November 28, 2024, in the Chinese academic journal Modern Radar. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chinese Academy of Sciences designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky that generates continuously moving extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic capable of penetrating seawater and effectively detecting submarines several hundred meters below the surface. (Picture source: China Military) The team, led by Li Daojing of the National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky. This constantly moving source continuously generates extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves capable of penetrating seawater to detect submarines several hundred meters below the surface. These ELF signals, with wavelengths exceeding 100 meters, allow for effective submarine detection due to their interaction with the aquatic environment. The researchers describe this technology as capable of transforming underwater detection. When ELF signals at 100 Hz interact with a nuclear submarine, its radar cross-section (RCS) can reach up to 88 square meters, enabling identification using standard magnetic detectors. Compact detectors mounted on drones could achieve gradient detection across wide areas, providing extensive and precise coverage. Traditionally, ELF signals required massive antennas, such as the ELF facility in central China, which spans over 100 km. Li Daojing's team has significantly reduced the size of these structures. Their new transmitter, measuring only 100 meters in length, is compact enough to be installed on Chinese naval ships. The high-frequency, high-power microwaves emitted by these antennas converge in the sky to form a virtual radio source. As one source dissipates, another is instantly generated, creating a continuous flow of ELF signals. This technique employs a network structure to simulate high-speed motion using Doppler signals in space. It reduces signal frequency while widening pulse width. The Doppler effect—where wave frequency changes based on relative motion between the source and observer—is a fundamental principle of this development. The perceived frequency increases as the source and observer approach each other and decreases as they move apart. Beyond submarine detection, the technology has potential applications for communication between surface ships and submarines, with an estimated range of 6,000 kilometers. Following successful ground-based trials, the team plans to reduce the transmitter's size to about 30 meters, making it more adaptable for various uses. This development was achieved with contributions from institutions such as the China Electronics Technology Group and Northwestern Polytechnical University, both key players in advanced military technologies for the People’s Liberation Army. The research highlights the integration of scientific innovation with strategic application to enhance underwater detection and communication capabilities. The innovation aligns with China's strategic priorities amid Sino-American rivalries, particularly regarding Taiwan and regional maritime security. While still in development, the technology could bolster China's ability to monitor and control its maritime zones, potentially affecting the strategic balance with the United States and its allies. By improving submarine detection, China aims to safeguard its territorial interests and assert its presence in the South China Sea, a region of heightened tensions surrounding Taiwan. This technological progress could reshape maritime security dynamics and influence submarine operations by external forces, reinforcing China's regional claims.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-develops-a-near-light-speed-radar-system-to-counter-submarine-stealth	2024-12-10T05:30:54-08:00

Taiwan ramps up Wanjian cruise missile production to strengthen the country’s naval and air capabilities	As reported by the Liberty Times on December 7, 2024, Taiwan has completed the mass production of its domestically developed Wanjian air-to-ground cruise missile, providing new capabilities for preemptive strikes on key Chinese military positions. Over 150 units of the Wanjian-1 bomb, with a range of 200 kilometers, have been produced, and the development of an extended-range version, the Wanjian-2 with a range of 400 kilometers, is now being carried out under the Ministry of National Defense's annual budget for further testing and small-batch production.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. (Picture source: Twitter/Taepodong) The development of Taiwan's Wanjian missile, also known as the Wan Chien or the 'Ten Thousand Swords Bomb,' began in the early 2000s as a response to the growing threat posed by China's military advancements. Initiated under the codename 'Project Divine Axe' by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the missile was designed to neutralize strategic targets such as airstrips, radar installations, and troop concentrations on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Drawing inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the Storm Shadow, its development incorporated advanced features like GPS and inertial navigation guidance, as well as a turbofan engine for extended range. The missile first underwent testing in the mid-2000s, achieved combat readiness in 2010, entered service in 2011, and entered mass production in 2015 after system integration with Taiwan’s AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter jets. Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. Live-fire exercises by F-CK-1 units in Tainan and Taichung demonstrated its effectiveness, targeting simulated installations on the southeastern coast of China, including strikes targeting facilities in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces from positions near the midline of the Taiwan Strait. It supports Taiwan’s defensive strategy by enabling precision strikes on key installations beyond the reach of short-range defenses. The Wanjian bomb is integrated with the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, with each aircraft capable of carrying one missile under each wing. The missile is guided by GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain recognition (TERCOM) systems for mid-flight adjustments, along with terminal guidance technologies such as image infrared (IIR) and digital scene matching area correlation (DSMAC). The missile’s design features a square body, foldable wings for compact storage and aerodynamic performance, an X-shaped rudder for directional control, and a turbofan engine that allows subsonic speeds up to Mach 0.8. It carries a 350-kilogram warhead containing submunitions equipped with delayed fuzes. These submunitions are engineered to penetrate surfaces and detonate underground, maximizing damage to hardened targets. The development of the Wanjian-2, also known as the Extended-Range Wanjian Bomb, is now being carried out to realize precision strikes at ranges up to 400 km. Also designed for the F-CK-1 fighter, it features a cluster munition warhead capable of targeting runways, radars, and troop concentrations. The missile utilizes GPS and inertial navigation with advanced terminal guidance for enhanced accuracy. Its design includes foldable wings, an X-tail configuration, and a turbofan engine for subsonic flight. It seems that small-scale production of the Wanjian-2 variant is set to continue under Taiwan's annual defense budget to bolster long-range strike capabilities. This extended-range version will enhance strike capabilities by allowing deeper penetration into adversary-controlled areas. However, it remains in the development phase under the Ministry of National Defense’s regular budget allocations. The Wanjian draws inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the British Storm Shadow. (Picture source: NCSIST) Despite its capabilities, the Wanjian missile's reliance on a non-stealthy design and subsonic speed makes it vulnerable to modern air defense systems, particularly during low-altitude flight paths needed for accurate targeting of runways or other fixed installations. The missile's effectiveness is further constrained by the limited range and survivability of its carrier platform, the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter, which risks interception before launch in contested airspace. Additionally, dependence on civilian GPS navigation rather than military-grade systems reduces its accuracy under electronic countermeasure conditions. These factors could collectively undermine the Wanjian's operational potential in high-threat environments. In addition to its existing applications, the feasibility of adapting the Wanjian bomb for use on helicopters was proposed by Kuomintang legislators in 2019. The proposal emphasized the need to overcome the dependency on operational runways during a conflict, addressing the expected asymmetry in air force readiness caused by immediate damage to airfields. However, a feasibility assessment by the Air Force concluded that adapting the Wanjian bomb for helicopter deployment is both technically challenging and impractical. The assessment cited the size and weight of the missile, the limited payload capacity of helicopters, and the need for U.S. approval for modifications to American-made rotorcraft as significant obstacles. While the suggestion aimed to reduce dependency on runways, the Air Force stated that the Wanjian bomb’s current integration with AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo aircraft remains the optimal approach. In recent years, Taiwan has been enhancing its cruise missile capabilities through the development and deployment of several systems. For instance, the Ching Tien (擎天) supersonic cruise missile, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, has entered mass production and is being deployed by the Air Force, enabling it to reach targets north of Beijing. The Hsiung Sheng, an extended-range variant of the Hsiung Feng IIE land-attack cruise missile, is planned for deployment in 2024, offering a range of up to 1,200 kilometers to target critical sites such as the People's Liberation Army's Eastern and Southern Theater Command bases. With the production of the Wanjian missile system, these missiles are part of Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid regional security concerns. Taiwan is responding to increased military pressure from China by enhancing its defense capabilities through various measures. The United States has approved arms sales to Taiwan, including a $2 billion package featuring the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Taiwan has increased its defense budget by 7.7% for 2025, with allocations for new fighter jets and missile production. Domestically, Taiwan launched its first indigenously built submarine, the Haikun, to strengthen naval deterrence. The US Department of Defense is also working with Taiwan on deploying drone swarms aimed at deterring potential Chinese actions. These measures reflect Taiwan’s efforts to address regional security tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/taiwan-ramps-up-wanjian-cruise-missile-production-to-strengthen-the-countrys-naval-and-air-capabilities	2024-12-10T02:15:20-08:00	
Breaking News: Taiwan Launches Combat Readiness Exercises Following China's Deployment of 90 Warships	China's recent deployment of approximately 90 naval and coast guard vessels near Taiwan represents a large escalation in regional tensions, prompting a robust response from Taiwan. On December 9, 2024, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense announced the launch of combat readiness exercises to counter this unprecedented show of force, the largest in recent months. The deployment spans waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas, surpassing previous military activities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan has raised its alert level following the sighting of over 90 Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the region. However, the defense ministry has not officially classified the movements as drills. (Picture source: Taiwanese Media TV screenshot) The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has also established an emergency response center to monitor the situation closely and address all 'gray zone' incursions—non-traditional military operations designed to exert pressure without open conflict. This escalation coincides with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's recent visit to Guam, a move Beijing views as provocative due to its opposition to official interactions between Taiwan and the United States. China's actions align with its broader strategy to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, potentially through military force. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has undergone rapid modernization and expansion, significantly enhancing its power projection capabilities. Beijing's possible plans for a naval assault include several scenarios. One potential strategy is a large-scale amphibious invasion, requiring substantial lift capacity and coordination to transport troops and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. However, China's current amphibious fleet may fall short of the requirements for a full-scale invasion, potentially necessitating the use of civilian vessels. While increasing transport capacity, these vessels are more vulnerable to Taiwan’s asymmetric defenses, such as missile-armed fast attack boats and stealthy corvettes. Another strategy could involve imposing a maritime blockade to sever Taiwan's critical supply lines, aiming to force political concessions without direct confrontation. Taiwan's heavy reliance on maritime trade makes it particularly susceptible to such a strategy. Additionally, China might continue to employ gray zone tactics, such as deploying maritime militias and conducting frequent incursions into Taiwanese waters and airspace, designed to test Taiwan’s responses and exert sustained pressure without triggering outright conflict. Taiwan's Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is a critical component of its defense strategy, tasked with countering these potential threats. As of 2024, the ROCN comprises approximately 40,000 personnel and a diverse fleet. The navy operates four Kee Lung-class guided-missile destroyers, which are former U.S. Navy vessels serving as the backbone of Taiwan's surface combatants. It also operates 22 frigates, including eight Cheng Kung-class frigates (based on the U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry-class) and six Kang Ding-class frigates, offering versatile capabilities for maritime defense. Two Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvettes have been commissioned, designed for high-speed operations and equipped with advanced anti-ship missiles. The ROCN maintains four submarines, including two Hai Lung-class and two older Hai Shih-class vessels, focused on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Taiwan has launched an ambitious program to construct seven new diesel-electric submarines over the next decade, significantly bolstering its undersea capabilities. Additionally, the navy operates eight amphibious ships, including tank landing ships and a recently commissioned Yushan-class amphibious transport dock, as well as various support vessels for logistics and replenishment. Recent efforts to develop asymmetric warfare capabilities focus on smaller, stealthier vessels equipped with precision-guided weaponry to offset the PLAN's numerical superiority.The Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC), Taiwan's elite amphibious warfare unit, plays a critical role in the defense of the island nation. With a strength of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 personnel, the ROCMC is trained for specialized missions, including amphibious assaults, coastal defense, and the protection of Taiwan's offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. Equipped with a diverse array of weapons and platforms, the Marine Corps fields modern assault rifles, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers for ground operations. For amphibious missions, they rely on vehicles like the AAV-7A1 amphibious assault vehicles, capable of transporting troops from ships to shore under combat conditions. The ROCMC also trains extensively in urban warfare, jungle operations, and joint exercises with other branches of Taiwan's military to ensure interoperability. These forces are prepared to respond swiftly to invasions or incursions, emphasizing the defense of Taiwan's sovereignty and the recovery of occupied territory in a conflict scenario. China's naval forces have seen rapid growth, making the PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy - Chinese Navy) the world's largest navy, with over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface combatants. The PLAN’s modern arsenal includes advanced warships such as the Type 055 destroyers and the aircraft carrier CNS Fujian, reflecting China’s ambition to project power and assert its maritime claims. China’s shipbuilding capacity, which is over 230 times greater than that of the United States, has enabled this rapid expansion. The current developments mark a critical juncture in cross-strait relations, with China's substantial military presence near Taiwan heightening regional tensions. Taiwan's proactive defense measures and calls for international support reflect its determination to safeguard its sovereignty amidst growing external pressures. The evolving naval capabilities of both Taiwan and China will play a pivotal role in shaping the future security dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-taiwan-launches-combat-readiness-exercises-following-chinas-deployment-of-90-warships	2024-12-10T02:03:37-08:00	
Russia May Exchange MiG-29 and Su-27 Fighter Jets for North Korean Troops Deployed in Ukraine	Russia and North Korea have reportedly reached a strategic agreement marking a significant step in their military cooperation. This deal aligns with Moscow’s strategy to strengthen its alliances amidst Western sanctions, while Pyongyang sees a rare opportunity to modernize its outdated air force. According to information disclosed by Admiral Samuel Paparo at the Reagan National Defense Forum on December 7, 2024, North Korea would receive Russian MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets. In return, North Korea is believed to have sent approximately 12,000 soldiers to support Russian military operations in Ukraine. These troops, though not directly involved in combat, are reportedly deployed in conflict zones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This agreement offers North Korea a critical upgrade from its outdated second-generation aircraft fleet to more advanced MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) The delivery of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets is part of Russia’s broader strategy to leverage its allies to counter international pressures. While the exact number of aircraft to be transferred remains unclear, their inclusion in North Korea’s fleet would significantly bolster Pyongyang’s military capabilities. However, these jets are technically inferior to fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. This agreement comes as North Korea’s air force, historically reliant on Soviet and Chinese support, struggles with decades of stagnation and international sanctions. Its current fleet is largely composed of Soviet-era aircraft from the 1980s, many of which are no longer operational. The MiG-29, developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich, is a twin-engine, fourth-generation fighter designed for air superiority. It is equipped with a Phazotron N019 radar capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' operations. The jet’s armament includes a 30mm cannon and air-to-air missiles such as the medium-range R-27 and short-range R-73. Renowned for its exceptional maneuverability, the MiG-29 features advanced aerodynamics and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, reaching speeds of Mach 2.3 and operating at altitudes up to 17,000 meters. The Su-27, designed by Sukhoi, is a long-range air superiority fighter equipped with a Phazotron N001 Myech radar, also capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' targeting. It is armed with a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 30mm cannon and up to ten hardpoints for air-to-air missiles like the R-73 and R-27. Known for its agility, the Su-27 incorporates advanced fly-by-wire controls and can execute complex maneuvers such as the 'Cobra.' It achieves speeds of Mach 2.35 and operates at altitudes up to 18,500 meters. For North Korea, this agreement addresses a major strategic gap. Its air force currently includes over 400 combat aircraft, but a significant portion belongs to the second generation, such as the Chinese-made J-5 and J-6, copies of the Soviet MiG-17 and MiG-19. Adding MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters from the 1980s would represent a considerable technological upgrade. These jets, equipped with relatively modern radars and weapon systems for their era, would enhance Pyongyang’s defensive capabilities against advanced South Korean forces. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The deal also underscores Pyongyang’s broader interest in advanced military technologies. In addition to fighter jets, North Korea may seek Russian expertise in ballistic missile re-entry vehicles, modern submarines, and air defense systems. This cooperation could help North Korea counter South Korea’s 'three-axis' doctrine, which focuses on neutralizing North Korean threats through preemptive, defensive, and offensive measures. This exchange occurs amid heightened regional tensions between the two Koreas. In June 2024, North Korean soldiers crossed into South Korea before retreating under warning shots from South Korean forces. More recently, in October 2024, North Korea destroyed sections of roads symbolizing reunification efforts and bolstered defensive structures along the border. These incidents highlight escalating tensions, marked by border clashes and military threats. Integrating MiG-29 and Su-27 jets into North Korea’s air force could improve its air defense and air superiority capabilities. However, these aircraft remain outclassed by fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. Additionally, the operational effectiveness of these jets will depend on pilot training and maintenance, areas where North Korea faces significant challenges. While this agreement strengthens North Korea’s air fleet quantitatively, it is unlikely to shift the aerial power balance significantly in the Korean Peninsula. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China. Recently, Iran received Su-35 jets and Mi-28 helicopters, while China has benefited from increased Russian technological support in sensitive areas like submarines and missiles. These partnerships reflect Russia’s growing reliance on allies to sustain its military capabilities under international sanctions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-may-exchange-mig-29-and-su-27-fighter-jets-for-north-korean-troops-deployed-in-ukraine	2024-12-10T01:55:42-08:00

In the event of a military conflict between NATO and Russia, the Arkhangelsk submarine, as part of the modernized Yasen-M class, could play a pivotal role in shifting the balance of power in the maritime domain and beyond. Its advanced capabilities make it an asset capable of addressing several strategic and tactical objectives: The Arkhangelsk is equipped with Kalibr-PL cruise missiles, capable of striking NATO targets at long distances, including critical infrastructure, command centers, and military bases. This capability serves as a strong deterrent, as the threat of precision strikes can dissuade adversaries from escalating conflict. Additionally, its ability to launch Oniks supersonic missiles provides a credible countermeasure to NATO surface fleets, including aircraft carrier strike groups. Operating in key maritime regions such as the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, or the Arctic, the Arkhangelsk could enforce sea denial strategies, restricting NATO's freedom of movement. Its stealth capabilities enable it to approach high-value targets undetected, posing a constant threat to NATO naval operations. By deploying near NATO maritime chokepoints, the submarine could effectively challenge or block naval reinforcements. With its advanced sensors, weaponry, and stealth design, the Arkhangelsk would likely be a formidable opponent in undersea warfare. It could hunt NATO submarines, including those tasked with deploying ballistic or cruise missiles, thus undermining NATO’s strategic deterrent capabilities. The submarine’s ability to operate covertly in the Atlantic could allow it to disrupt NATO's vital maritime supply routes between North America and Europe. Striking supply convoys and transport vessels would complicate NATO’s logistical efforts, potentially delaying reinforcements and resupply operations. The Kalibr-PL missiles on board the 'Arkhangelsk' are capable of precision strikes on land-based targets. In a conflict, the submarine could launch coordinated missile barrages against NATO military installations, communication hubs, or missile defense sites, potentially neutralizing critical components of NATO’s operational network. Given its Arctic-capable design, the 'Arkhangelsk' could support operations in the increasingly contested Arctic region. Control over this region is crucial for both Russia and NATO, as it holds strategic sea lanes and natural resources. The submarine could patrol under the Arctic ice, undetected, projecting power and securing Russian claims in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-to-receive-newest-nuclear-submarine-arkhangelsk-with-kalibr-missiles-in-summer-2025	2024-12-10T01:32:35-08:00	
US Army Explores PrSM Inc. 5 Missile for Autonomous Launchers Exceeding 1000 km	The US Army is advancing its technological capabilities in long-range precision strikes with plans to develop a fifth iteration of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), designed to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers. During a December 3, 2024 event hosted by the Association of the US Army, two senior military officials shared insights into this project, which could significantly enhance the Army's strike range capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Major General Winston Brook, commander of the Fires Center of Excellence, presented a slide that identified the PrSM Increment 5 as a prospective future capability. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, explained that preliminary work on this fifth version of the PrSM has commenced, with a formal science and technology development initiative scheduled for fiscal year 2026. According to Brig. Gen. Crooks, the primary goal of Increment 5 is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous platform, departing from traditional systems like the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS. This innovation involves creating a launcher without a cab, allowing for potentially larger and longer-range munitions. 'If you’re familiar with an MLRS pod, it’s about 13 feet long. With an autonomous system, you might be able to use something longer,' Crooks noted, suggesting the possibility of achieving ranges currently deemed unrealistic. Although the program has received initial funding for science and technology research, Crooks clarified that there is no definitive timeline for formal competition or development. This highlights the program's exploratory nature, with its future depending on results from these early stages. For several years, the Army has been developing earlier versions of the PrSM to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and ensure compatibility with current launch systems like HIMARS and the M270A2 MLRS. Currently, Increment 1 missiles, produced by Lockheed Martin, are being fielded and are capable of striking targets at distances of at least 500 kilometers. Subsequent increments include Increment 2, which features a multimode seeker known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and Increment 3, which is designed to incorporate enhanced lethality payloads. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team are working on competing designs for Increment 4, which aims to double the range of earlier versions, surpassing 1,000 kilometers. The development of Increment 5 represents a pivotal step toward integrating autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, the initiative underscores the Army’s commitment to extending the boundaries of precision long-range strikes. If successful, the PrSM Increment 5 could offer substantial strategic advantages in future military scenarios. Though the PrSM Increment 5 remains conceptual, it reflects the Army's clear ambition to modernize its arsenal through innovative technology. The program's trajectory will depend on the progress achieved in the coming years, with potential implications for the future of warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-explores-prsm-inc-5-missile-for-autonomous-launchers-exceeding-1000-km	2024-12-10T01:16:48-08:00

This new order builds on Qatar’s 2017 purchase of 24 Typhoons and complements its diverse fleet, which also includes French Rafales and American F-15QAs. The integration of the Typhoons into the joint No. 12 Squadron, operated by the Qatari Air Force and the British Royal Air Force, underscores their strategic role in strengthening bilateral military collaborations. Qatar has significantly enhanced its military air fleet over the past decade by adopting a strategy of supply diversification to ensure its security and operational independence. In 2017, Doha signed a €5.6 billion contract for the acquisition of 24 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters from the Eurofighter consortium (BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo), reinforced by an additional order for 12 units announced in December 2024, valued at an estimated £2.8 billion. These aircraft are integrated into the joint No. 12 Squadron with the British Royal Air Force, symbolizing strengthened military cooperation between Qatar and the United Kingdom. In December 2024, during the state visit of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to the United Kingdom, the two nations strengthened their defense partnership by signing agreements to extend their collaboration on joint squadrons of Typhoon and Hawk aircraft. On this occasion, two Typhoon fighters from the joint No. 12 Squadron escorted the Emir’s aircraft as it entered British airspace, illustrating their operational synergy. This visit highlights the deepening military ties between the United Kingdom and Qatar, based on their historical relationship and shared commitment to regional security. The Typhoon offers Qatar’s armed forces a modern and versatile combat platform capable of meeting diverse operational needs. With its advanced avionics, high-speed performance (Mach 2), and exceptional maneuverability, it is perfectly suited for air-to-air combat and ground attack missions. Equipped with the AESA Captor-E radar and a wide array of precision-guided munitions, including Meteor and Brimstone missiles, the Typhoon enhances Qatar’s air superiority and strike capabilities. Additionally, its integration into the joint No. 12 Squadron between the United Kingdom and Qatar provides valuable training, NATO-standard interoperability, and a strategic partnership with a key ally, further strengthening Qatar’s defensive posture and regional influence. In parallel, Qatar has also invested in French Rafale fighters, signing an initial contract for 24 aircraft in 2015, followed by an additional order for 12 units in 2017, bringing the total cost to approximately €6.3 billion. These Rafales are expected to be upgraded to the F4 standard, adding enhanced capabilities such as advanced connectivity systems and next-generation armaments. Finally, Qatar purchased 36 American F-15QA fighters under a $12 billion contract signed in 2017. These acquisitions reflect a pragmatic strategy, balancing strategic alliances and military enhancement, with a fleet combining the strengths of major aviation powers. While the announcement surprised France, where negotiations for additional Rafales and other military equipment were ongoing, it illustrates Qatar’s delicate balance between maintaining operational readiness and developing strong relationships with major defense suppliers. This agreement is particularly significant as the Typhoon had not received recent export orders before Qatar’s renewed interest, positioning the United Kingdom as a key strategic partner for Doha in a competitive regional landscape. This development also reflects changes in Qatar’s defense procurement strategy, including its exploration of joint infantry mechanisms with the United Kingdom, potentially centered on ARTEC’s Boxer armored vehicle. By diversifying its defense assets and partnerships, this Typhoon agreement highlights Qatar’s commitment to a robust and versatile military posture aligned with NATO standards and adapted to an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Qatar’s decision not to opt for additional Rafales, despite the aircraft’s excellent performance, can be attributed to several strategic and political reasons. Firstly, Qatar already has 36 Rafales in its fleet, which may limit the immediate appeal of a new order, especially with existing aircraft undergoing upgrades to the F4 standard. In contrast, the Typhoon provides an opportunity to further diversify operational capabilities and strategic partnerships, strengthening the already solid military cooperation with the United Kingdom, particularly through the joint No. 12 Squadron. Additionally, the purchase of new Typhoons can be seen as a political decision aimed at balancing relationships with multiple major defense suppliers, avoiding over-reliance on France, which has already supplied Rafales and various military equipment. Furthermore, support for the British industry, facing challenges with the Typhoon in the international market, may have influenced the decision. This strategic choice also allows Qatar to leverage the specific advantages of the Typhoon, such as its enhanced air superiority through the Captor-E radar and Meteor missile, complementing the capabilities already offered by the Rafale. In summary, this decision seems driven more by diplomatic and strategic considerations than by any technical shortcomings of the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon operated by Qatar is a high-tech multirole fighter equipped with the most advanced technologies. It features the AESA Captor-E radar for superior target detection and tracking, along with the advanced Defensive Aids Subsystem (DASS) for enhanced survivability and modern avionics that ensure high operational versatility.

Breaking News: Dutch F-35 Fighter Jets Conduct First Interceptions of Russian Spy Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	Dutch Air Force F-35 fighter jets stationed in Estonia have successfully conducted their first operational interceptions over the Baltic Sea, showcasing the Netherlands’ commitment to NATO’s collective defense. On Friday, December 6, two Dutch F-35s were scrambled twice under the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) protocol to intercept and monitor Russian aircraft operating near NATO airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During an interception mission, a Dutch Air Force F-35A Lightning II escorts a Russian SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea, demonstrating NATO's vigilance in safeguarding its airspace. (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) During the first interception, the Dutch F-35 fighter jets identified a Russian Antonov AN-73/74 'Coaler' transport aircraft and a Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance jet. The SU-24MR specializes in electronic intelligence gathering, highlighting the persistent surveillance activities conducted by Russian forces near NATO territory. Later in the day, the QRA was activated again, with the F-35s intercepting an Ilyushin IL-20 'Coot A,' an advanced surveillance aircraft equipped for electronic monitoring. The Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' is a specialized variant of the SU-24, a supersonic, all-weather tactical bomber developed by the Soviet Union. The SU-24MR is configured specifically for reconnaissance missions, equipped with advanced sensors and electronic intelligence-gathering systems. Although the Russian planes remained in international airspace, the Dutch F-35s closely monitored and escorted them to the edge of NATO’s area of responsibility. These interceptions demonstrate NATO’s operational readiness and ability to secure its airspace amid increased tensions in the Baltic region. The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Estonia is part of NATO’s Air Policing mission, which aims to protect the airspace of its eastern members. Since December 1, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) has operated four F-35A Lightning II fighters from Ämari Air Base. This deployment underscores the Netherlands’ dedication to NATO and the security of its allies in Eastern Europe. The F-35 program has been a cornerstone of the Netherlands’ air defense modernization strategy. The acquisition process began in the early 2000s when the Netherlands joined the Joint Strike Fighter program as a Level 2 partner, contributing significantly to the aircraft’s development. The first operational F-35A arrived in the Netherlands in October 2019 at Leeuwarden Air Base. By December 2021, the RNLAF declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its fleet, signaling readiness for limited combat operations. Initially, the Netherlands planned to acquire 85 F-35As to replace its aging F-16 fleet, but budget constraints later reduced the order. As of 2022, the Ministry of Defence expanded its plans, increasing the total to 52 aircraft. The first operational deployment of Dutch F-35s occurred in April 2022 when four jets were stationed in Bulgaria to support NATO’s enhanced Air Policing mission. The F-35A’s advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and electronic warfare capabilities have made it an essential component of NATO operations. Its introduction has significantly enhanced the RNLAF’s ability to detect, monitor, and respond to threats, particularly in high-tension areas like the Baltic. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans praised the rapid response of Dutch forces during the recent interceptions. 'This is why our people are there: to protect our collective airspace against Russian threats. As was once again evident on Friday, Russian forces are active in various ways near NATO airspace. Our allies in the Baltic states are pleased with our efforts. I am proud of our people who were able to immediately demonstrate their value to our security,' he said. The Baltic region remains a hotspot for military activity, with frequent incursions by Russian aircraft testing NATO’s readiness. These incidents underscore the importance of the QRA protocol, which allows NATO fighter jets to scramble within minutes to intercept and identify potential threats. The successful interception mission by Dutch F-35s highlights NATO’s resolve to protect its members and affirms the Netherlands’ role as a critical player in the alliance’s defense strategy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-dutch-f-35-fighter-jets-conduct-first-interceptions-of-russian-spy-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2024-12-09T06:59:02-08:00	
Peru Modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean 4x4 K808 IFVs and K2 Tanks to Replace Soviet-Era Vehicles	On December 9, 2024, in Lima, the Peruvian Army unveiled the K808 'White Tiger' armored personnel carrier during the celebrations of the Battle of Ayacucho and Army Day. In May 2024, Hyundai Rotem and STX were selected to supply 30 K808 'Baekho' wheeled armored vehicles to Peru under a contract valued at $60 million. This order marks the first export of South Korean armored vehicles to Latin America. Initially planned for 30 units, the contract could expand to a total of 120 vehicles depending on the future needs of the Peruvian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Peruvian Army modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean K808 'White Tiger' IFVs. (Picture source: Peru MoD) On November 16, 2024, also in Lima, Hyundai Rotem signed a second memorandum of understanding with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian Army’s weapons and ammunition factory, for the supply of K2 'Black Panther' main battle tanks. Although financial details and the exact number of tanks have not been officially disclosed, sources suggest that Peru plans to acquire approximately 100 K2 tanks to replace its aging fleet of T-55 tanks. This initiative is part of a broader modernization program for the Peruvian Armed Forces, aimed at strengthening their operational capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment. On December 9, 2024, three K808 'White Tiger' vehicles paraded, proudly displaying the Peruvian and South Korean flags, symbolizing South Korea's growing importance to the Peruvian Armed Forces and Peru’s commitment to modernizing its aging fleet. The fleet, still largely composed of Soviet-era vehicles such as the T-55 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), demonstrates the need for modernization. The BMP-1, developed in the 1960s, is equipped with a 73mm cannon and anti-tank missile launcher but is outdated in terms of armor and weaponry by current standards. This reliance on aging equipment underscores the necessity for Peru to upgrade its armored fleet to meet the demands of modern battlefields and provide better protection and operational effectiveness for its troops. Peru has shown an increasing willingness to diversify and modernize its armed forces by turning to Western partners. This trend was reinforced in September 2024 when the government included funding for 24 new fighter jets in the 2025 budget. Among the options considered, the French Rafale emerged as a favorite, outpacing competitors like the American F-16 and Swedish Gripen. In November 2024, this shift continued with the Peruvian Congress authorizing the entry of 600 U.S. military personnel to assist with security preparations for the 2024 APEC meetings, further strengthening military ties with the United States. This shift represents a notable departure from Peru’s historical reliance on Russian military equipment. In the 2010s, the country had considered acquiring T-90 tanks to replace its aging T-55s. However, in 2023, significant challenges in obtaining spare parts for its MiG-29 fleet highlighted the limitations of cooperation with Russia. While relations with Moscow persist, decisions made between 2023 and 2024 demonstrate Peru’s growing commitment to strengthening partnerships with Western nations to meet the demands of modernizing its armed forces and aligning with contemporary military standards. Discussions about the South Korean agreements began several years ago, supported by consistent diplomatic efforts. In 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sent a letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, celebrating 60 years of bilateral relations and emphasizing the potential for increased defense cooperation. Between 2023 and 2024, Peruvian military delegations visited South Korea to witness demonstrations of the K808’s capabilities in scenarios simulating mountainous operations and counterterrorism missions. The K808, also known as 'Baekho' (White Tiger), was designed in 2003 and has proven its reliability in the South Korean Army, with over 500 units delivered. Capable of overcoming 40cm obstacles, crossing 1.5-meter trenches, and navigating waterways with its jet propulsion system, it is well-suited to Peru's challenging geography. Its central tire inflation system (CTIS) and advanced mobility make it a strategic asset for the Peruvian Armed Forces. This contract is part of a broader modernization program for Peru's armored fleet, which is still heavily reliant on outdated main battle tanks such as the T-55 and AMX-13 from the 1950s. With this initial order, the long-term outlook is promising. STX and Hyundai Rotem are already in discussions for additional orders and expanded technical collaboration with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian state arms manufacturer. This partnership, which could span several years, enhances South Korea’s strategic presence in the Latin American defense market. A Hyundai Rotem representative reaffirmed the company’s commitment to leveraging its technological expertise to ensure the success of this collaboration and support Peru’s defense objectives in the years ahead. The partnership between Hyundai Rotem and FAME S.A.C. aims to establish a lasting collaboration, paving the way for future contracts and supporting Peru’s defense modernization efforts. This agreement also solidifies South Korea’s position as a competitive player in the Latin American defense market, aligning with its global strategy for growth in the defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-modernizes-armored-fleet-with-south-korean-4x4-k808-ifvs-and-k2-tanks-to-replace-soviet-era-vehicles	2024-12-09T06:51:39-08:00	
Royal Malaysian Navy starts Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 construction in Türkiye	On December 4, 2024, the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) officially commenced the construction of its Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) at Istanbul Shipyard in Türkiye. Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. This corvette is already operational in the navies of Türkiye and Pakistan, with additional ships currently under construction for the Ukrainian Navy. The Ada-class design supports multi-role operations, including anti-surface warfare (ASuW), anti-air warfare (AAW), asymmetric warfare (ASYW), and electronic warfare (EW).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. (Picture source: STM) Other options, including South Korea's HDC-2000 design by Hyundai Heavy Industries and Italy's FCX15 design by Fincantieri, were considered for the LMSB2 program. However, the Turkish Ada-class corvette design was ultimately selected for its operational performance, compatibility with Malaysia’s requirements, and its ability to integrate future naval subsystems from over 50 Turkish defense companies. STM, the project's main contractor, is responsible for all phases, including design, project management, material procurement, assembly, testing, and integrated logistics support (ILS). This marks Malaysia's first defense acquisition through a government-to-government memorandum of understanding (G2G) with another country. STM’s previous experience with Ada-class corvettes for Türkiye, Pakistan, and Ukraine likely influenced this decision. The Ada-class corvette was originally developed under Türkiye’s MILGEM program to meet requirements for anti-submarine warfare, patrol, and maritime surveillance. It features stealth technology, a low radar cross-section, and distributed sensors and weapons systems. The LMSB2 configuration integrates these capabilities while incorporating modifications to meet RMN’s operational needs. The LMSB2 project is a significant component of RMN’s efforts to enhance maritime capabilities, providing flexible operational capacity and effective security for Malaysia’s extensive maritime domain. The ships will feature a lot of systems from Turkish defense companies. Aselsan will supply the 3D surveillance radar, fire control radar, electronic support measures (ESM), and chaff decoy systems. Havelsan will provide the combat management and gun fire control systems. Surface-to-surface missiles (SSMs) will include Roketsan’s Atmaca, while the ships will also be equipped with two quad-packed vertical launch systems (VLS) for 16 Haegung surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) from South Korea’s Lig NEX1. Armament will include a 76mm main gun, a 30mm secondary gun, and decoy launcher systems. Other equipment includes navigation systems, electronic plotting tables, and communication systems. Each Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) vessel will measure 99.56 meters in length, have a displacement of approximately 2,500 tons, and accommodate 111 personnel. They will use a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion system with four diesel engines, providing a top speed of 26 knots, a cruising speed of 14 knots, and an operational range exceeding 4,000 nautical miles. The vessels will have an endurance of 14 days and feature a helipad and hangar for a 10-ton helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicles. Construction and outfitting are expected to conclude by the end of 2027, with delivery to RMN anticipated shortly thereafter. This project aligns with Malaysia’s naval modernization program, guided by the '15 to 5' Transformation Programme, which aims to consolidate RMN’s fleet from 15 classes to five core classes for improved operational and cost efficiency. Key acquisitions include Maharaja Lela-class frigates, Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels, Littoral Mission Ships (LMS), Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), and Scorpène-class submarines. The Maharaja Lela-class program advanced with the launch of KD Maharaja Lela in June 2024. RMN recently updated its transformation plan to address current maritime security challenges and regional threats. Malaysia's extensive maritime zones, including the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, and the Sulu Sea, are critical to its national security and economic prosperity. These waters, rich in natural resources, also serve as vital trade routes but face challenges such as territorial disputes, illegal fishing, smuggling, and piracy. RMN has identified a growing mismatch between its naval capabilities and the demands of effectively securing these areas. Many RMN vessels date back to the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in increased maintenance issues and reduced readiness. To address this, RMN plans to acquire 18 LMS to bolster patrol and surveillance across its maritime zones. These ships will support diverse missions, including anti-surface warfare, mine warfare, hydrography, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. In the South China Sea, Malaysia asserts its rights over its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and conducts oil and gas exploration through Petronas, despite objections from China. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has confirmed that these operations will continue alongside diplomatic discussions with China. RMN monitors the region and reports the situation as secure, according to Admiral Datuk Zulhelmy Ithnain. In the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia collaborates with regional partners through initiatives like the Malacca Straits Patrol to counter piracy and smuggling. In the Sulu Sea, Malaysia conducts joint patrols with Indonesia and the Philippines to combat transnational crimes such as piracy and kidnapping. These efforts combine diplomacy, security measures, and regional cooperation to manage Malaysia’s maritime zones effectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-malaysian-navy-starts-littoral-mission-ship-batch-2-construction-in-tuerkiye	2024-12-09T05:44:59-08:00

These systems, like the NGJ-MB, aim to improve the electronic superiority of armed forces by disrupting enemy detection and communication systems, thereby contributing to the protection and effectiveness of modern military operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/next-gen-raytheon-ngj-mb-system-empowers-us-ea-18-growlers-fighter-jet-with-superior-radar-jamming	2024-12-09T03:02:12-08:00	
South Korea deploys Skylight laser weapon to protect Seoul capital from North Korean drones	As reported by Mason on December 8, 2024, South Korea has initiated the deployment of the Laser-Based Anti-Aircraft Weapon Block-I, a stationary 20kW-class fiber laser system capable of neutralizing drones within a range of 2–3 kilometers, to frontline units and selected urban locations, including Seoul. Globally, laser systems like the British Dragonfire and Israeli Iron Beam remain under development, but South Korea is the first to announce large-scale production and deployment of such a system to complement its existing air defense layers against North Korean drones. However, deployment to the broader metropolitan area may face delays.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Laser-Based Anti-Aircraft Weapon Block-I, also known as Skylight or Cheongwang, is a stationary 20kW-class fiber laser weapon designed to neutralize small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at an estimated firing cost of $1.45 per shot. (Picture source: DAPA) Developed since 2019 by Hanwha Aerospace in collaboration with the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), the Laser-Based Anti-Aircraft Weapon Block-I, also known as Skylight or Cheongwang (天光), is a stationary 20kW-class fiber laser weapon designed to neutralize small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and multicopters within a range of 2–3 kilometers at an estimated firing cost of KRW 2,000 ($1.45) per shot. Production began in July 2024 under a KRW 100 billion ($72.5 million) contract signed in June, supervised by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). During live-fire tests in April 2023, the system achieved a 100% success rate against its intended targets. While effective against short-range threats such as drones and multicopters, Skylight is not designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) or high-output swarm drone attacks. Future iterations of the Skylight system aim to expand its capabilities. The Block-II variant will be mobile, based on the K239 Multiple Rocket Launcher System chassis, offering increased range and power. The Block-III is envisioned to intercept larger threats, such as ballistic missiles and aircraft, through naval and aerial configurations with outputs exceeding 100kW. These upgrades are expected to strengthen South Korea’s layered air defense system. In addition to Skylight, South Korea is deploying the Intelligent 40mm Automated Air Defense System. Also developed under DAPA’s rapid development program, this system features dual-barreled 40mm cannons that may use munitions compatible with the K21 Infantry Fighting Vehicle. It is based on the export version of the towed 40mm CIWS gun developed for India. While the turret’s specific configuration—such as the use of the K40 or 40CTC—has not been confirmed, mobile versions are under development using the K239 chassis. This system targets low-altitude threats and complements Skylight within South Korea's six-layered air defense architecture. Together, they form the lower tiers alongside LAMD-I and LAMD-II systems, while M-SAM and L-SAM systems address medium- and high-altitude threats. This multi-tiered structure counters a wide range of aerial challenges. The Skylight operates silently and without visible light, reducing the risk of collateral damage such as falling debris. It integrates with radar systems to enhance targeting precision. However, its performance can be reduced in adverse weather, and interception times for swarm drone attacks are longer. Complementary systems, such as High-Pulse Microwave (HPM) weapons, are being explored to address these limitations. Laser weapon systems, also known as directed-energy weapons, are emerging as a key area of defense innovation, as they provide key advantages for air defense, including precision targeting, rapid response capabilities, and cost-efficiency. Their ability to engage threats at the speed of light allows for immediate neutralization of drones, missiles, and artillery shells, enhancing operational effectiveness without reliance on conventional munitions. Precision targeting reduces the risk of collateral damage compared to traditional systems. Laser systems rely on power sources rather than ammunition, enabling sustained use as long as energy is available, which reduces logistical burdens and operational costs. These features make laser technology a practical option for modern military applications. to counter various threats. For instance, the United States has focused on systems like Lockheed Martin’s 500kW-class laser weapon, representing a significant power increase, and Raytheon’s High-Energy Laser Weapon Systems, designed to intercept rockets, artillery, mortars, and drones. Israel’s Iron Beam is designed to counter short-range rockets, artillery, and mortars. In the United Kingdom, the DragonFire system, introduced in 2017, underwent high-power trials in 2022 and is expected to be integrated aboard Royal Navy ships by 2027. China has demonstrated systems such as the Silent Hunter, a vehicle-mounted laser for low-altitude targets, and the LW-30, showcased as a short-range anti-UAV system. Russia’s laser arsenal includes the Peresvet, operational since 2018, and the newer Zadira, reportedly used for battlefield applications. South Korea’s Block-I focuses on drone neutralization at low operational costs. France’s HELMA-P has been tested for anti-drone operations aboard naval platforms, while Germany is advancing naval laser weapons for UAV and missile defense. Additional efforts include India’s exploration of laser systems for border defense, Turkey’s ARMOL for anti-drone operations, and Japan’s development of laser air defense technologies. Global trends indicate increasing interest in these innovations despite challenges such as power supply, cooling, and weather impacts. South Korea has initiated the deployment of laser weapons to frontline units and urban areas, including Seoul, primarily to counter the escalating threat of North Korean drones. In December 2022, five North Korean drones entered South Korean airspace, with one reaching Seoul, highlighting gaps in air defense. In response, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) initiated deployment of the 'Block-I' laser system, developed by Hanwha Aerospace. This system can disable drones by targeting their engines or electronics within 10–20 seconds, with an operational cost of approximately 2,000 won ($1.45) per shot. The deployment aims to enhance South Korea's defense capabilities, particularly in densely populated areas like Seoul, against potential provocations from the North.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-deploys-skylight-laser-weapon-to-protect-seoul-capital-and-frontline-areas-from-north-korean-drones	2024-12-09T02:36:02-08:00

(Picture source: Russian social network) According to Sergey Lagodyuk, the Deputy Chief of the Belarusian General Staff, the Oreshnik system's deployment is a response to NATO's increasing military presence in Eastern Europe, particularly the planned stationing of U.S. and German missiles. Moscow and Minsk perceive these actions as an escalation of Western military encroachment, prompting them to bolster their defense posture. The Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile system is a relatively new and advanced addition to Russia's strategic missile arsenal. While full technical specifications are not fully disclosed, the system is expected to possess several key capabilities that make it a significant threat. First, it is an intermediate-range missile capable of striking targets between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, covering much of Europe and NATO's infrastructure. This range allows it to potentially target military installations, airfields, supply chains, and key government facilities across Europe, including NATO bases in the region. The missile system is designed for precision strikes, with capabilities akin to other advanced Russian missiles, such as the Iskander and Kalibr systems, but with a much longer reach. This increased accuracy makes the Oreshnik effective against high-value targets such as command centers, radar sites, and air defense installations. Additionally, the system is expected to be deployed on mobile launch platforms, which makes it more difficult to track and counteract by enemy forces. The mobility of the system allows it to be relocated quickly, reducing the likelihood of a successful preemptive strike by adversaries. The Oreshnik is also expected to have dual-warhead capabilities, meaning it can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. This flexibility adds a strategic dimension to its deployment, offering Russia and Belarus a powerful tool for both tactical and strategic deterrence. It could be employed for conventional warfare scenarios or, in the event of heightened tensions, as a nuclear deterrent, thereby increasing its significance in Russia's military strategy. Moreover, it is believed that the Oreshnik missile system will be integrated with Russia's existing defense network, which includes advanced air defense missile systems like the S-400 and S-500, enhancing the system’s coordination and effectiveness within the broader Russian military framework. The deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus presents a significant escalation in the ongoing security challenges facing both Ukraine and Europe. For Ukraine, the proximity of Belarus means the Oreshnik system would be capable of targeting critical military positions, supply lines, and infrastructure deep within Ukrainian territory. This is especially concerning given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where Russia and Belarus are already highly involved. The deployment of such a system further solidifies the strategic alliance between Moscow and Minsk, increasing the threat to Ukraine’s defense capabilities. The system's presence also raises the specter of further Russian provocations, as it provides a powerful tool for deep-strike capabilities against Ukraine. The Oreshnik missile represents a new threat for Europe, with its intermediate range capable of striking key NATO military sites across the continent. The decision to deploy this missile system will likely be seen as a direct challenge to NATO, particularly as the United States and Germany move forward with their own plans to deploy intermediate-range missiles in the region. This growing missile presence on both sides could lead to heightened tensions and a renewed arms race in Europe. NATO’s immediate response may involve bolstering its missile defense systems and enhancing its military deterrence measures to counter the Russian threat. Another critical concern raised by the Oreshnik missile’s deployment is its nuclear capability. As the system can be equipped with both conventional and nuclear warheads, it could increase the likelihood of nuclear escalation in the event of conflict. This threat is particularly pertinent given the proximity of Belarus to NATO member states, which would place European countries and the U.S. within potential striking distance of the missile. Belarus, as a staunch ally of Russia, may become a key forward base for Russia’s nuclear deterrence strategy, further raising concerns over the stability of European security. The presence of such a weapon in Belarus could also lead to calls for NATO to adjust its nuclear posture, potentially leading to a new arms race between Russia and the West. The deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus is a strategic maneuver that will significantly impact the military dynamics in Europe and the broader geopolitical landscape. The growing missile capabilities of Russia and Belarus pose an increasing threat not just to Ukraine, but to the entire European security architecture. In response, NATO and its allies may be forced to take stronger measures to counter these new capabilities, further complicating an already tense security environment. As the Oreshnik missile system is slated to be deployed in 2025, this development will likely become a central issue in European defense policy, driving both military preparedness and diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-new-threat-to-europe-and-ukraine-with-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-deployment-in-belarus-by-2025	2024-12-08T02:50:50-08:00

In this raid, Israel used fewer than 100 munitions to take out more than 20 military sites, emphasizing the high efficiency of the operation. This operational precision stood in stark contrast to other air campaigns, such as Russia’s strikes in Ukraine, where inefficiency and missed targets have been commonplace. The F-35’s stealth and precision capabilities were crucial in executing a mission where each strike needed to count. No aircraft got within 100 miles of the target in the first wave, yet nearly the entirety of Iran's air-defense system was dismantled. This highlights the F-35’s stand-off strike capability, where weapons can be deployed from a safe distance without compromising the safety of the aircraft or pilots. Beyond its combat and strike capabilities, the F-35’s advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems were pivotal in degrading Iran’s air-defense networks. These EW systems allow the F-35 to disrupt enemy radar, communication, and targeting systems, effectively blinding or misleading adversary defenses. As Admiral Radakin noted, the strike took down 'nearly the entirety of Iran’s air-defense system,' likely facilitated by the F-35’s ability to disrupt and neutralize these defenses before they could respond effectively. Iran’s acquisition of S-300 systems from Russia posed a significant threat to any aircraft attempting to strike Iranian targets. However, Israel’s F-35s used their superior electronic warfare capabilities to target and degrade these systems, making it possible to carry out the mission with minimal risk to the aircraft. The success of this operation also speaks to the multi-role versatility of the F-35. While primarily an air-to-air and air-to-ground combat aircraft, the F-35 also serves as a platform for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). During the strike on Iran, Israeli F-35s likely performed a variety of roles, from gathering intelligence to ensuring that each target was hit with precision and efficiency. The aircraft's ability to switch between strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare roles is a key reason for its operational effectiveness in high-stakes missions like this. The F-35’s ability to carry out surgical strikes on critical infrastructure while maintaining air superiority and disrupting enemy defenses makes it the ideal platform for modern military operations, especially in hostile environments where the enemy possesses advanced air-defense capabilities. The recent Israeli operation against Iranian targets has once again demonstrated the unparalleled combat capabilities of the F-35. With its combination of stealth, precision strike systems, advanced munitions, and superior electronic warfare capabilities, the F-35 has redefined the standards for modern air combat. Israel’s use of this advanced fighter jet highlights its significant technological edge and ability to project power with minimal risk and maximum precision. As Israel continues to expand its fleet of F-35Is, the aircraft will undoubtedly play a central role in future operations, setting a new benchmark in modern military aviation. The F-35’s performance in this operation serves as a clear demonstration of how advanced technologies—stealth, precision, and electronic warfare—are transforming military air operations and ensuring that air forces can meet the complex challenges of the modern battlefield with unprecedented effectiveness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-demonstrates-unmatched-combat-capabilities-in-israeli-strike-against-iran	2024-12-06T08:51:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukraine Intel Reveals Russia Can Produce 25 Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles Annually	On December 4, 2024, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine provided an important update regarding Russia's missile production capabilities, particularly focusing on the RS-26 Rubezh, the country’s intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia can now produce up to 25 units of RS-26 Rubezh each year, including its new Oreshnik variant. This new development highlights the growing production capacity of Russia's missile forces and their focus on strengthening their medium-range missile arsenals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Test fire at Kapustin Yar: Russia's RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik variants undergo critical testing at the Astrakhan region missile launch site, enhancing Russia's strategic missile capabilities. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The RS-26 Rubezh, at the heart of Russia's modern missile capabilities, represents a strategic shift in Moscow's approach to missile warfare. Its production plays a significant role in Russia’s efforts to counter NATO's missile defense systems. The Oreshnik, a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh, has been shrouded in controversy, particularly following its use in an attack on Ukraine's Dnipro River on November 21, 2024. The RS-26 Rubezh is a crucial missile for Russia’s defense strategy. Classified as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the RS-26 is designed to carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and has a range of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 km (2,175 to 2,485 miles). This puts it within the category of medium to long-range missile systems capable of striking targets across Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Russia has invested heavily in producing the RS-26 Rubezh and its variants. The missile is manufactured at high output and can produce up to 25 units per year, a significant increase from earlier periods. This production surge follows the technical experience gained from Russia's previous RS-24 Yars ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile) program, which has informed the development of the RS-26’s advanced features, including hypersonic speed and maneuverability designed to defeat modern missile defense systems. The controversy surrounding Russia’s missile capabilities deepened after an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on November 21, 2024. During the attack, Russian forces used what they claimed to be a 'new medium-range system' that President Vladimir Putin referred to as the Oreshnik. At the time, Ukrainian officials initially identified the missile used in the strike as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), but Putin contradicted this, announcing that the missile was a new addition to Russia’s missile arsenal, designed specifically for medium-range strikes. In contrast, American officials labeled the missile as 'experimental,' suggesting that while it may have been deployed operationally, the Oreshnik was still in an advanced testing phase. According to U.S. officials, the missile appears to be a non-nuclear, hypersonic ballistic missile, a designation that aligns with previous reports of its high-speed and maneuvering capabilities. These features make the missile extremely difficult to intercept, as it travels at speeds greater than Mach 5 (over six times the speed of sound) and can follow unpredictable flight paths to bypass missile defense systems. Despite these claims of a new missile type, the Oreshnik is widely regarded as a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh—with enhancements aimed at improving its hypersonic capabilities and range. The missile's inclusion in Russia’s operational arsenal is seen as part of a broader strategy to bolster its missile forces, specifically in response to NATO’s missile defense systems in Europe. Both the RS-26 Rubezh and its Oreshnik variant undergo testing at Russia’s key missile testing sites. These include Kapustin Yar, located in the Astrakhan region, which has long been a central hub for developing and testing Russia’s missile systems, including the RS-26 and its variants. Additionally, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk region plays a critical role in missile testing. Though better known for space launches, Plesetsk is integral to Russia’s missile development and operational readiness. The international community has responded with heightened concern over the deployment of the Oreshnik missile. The United States, in particular, has expressed its reservations, labeling the missile 'experimental' and underscoring the potential escalation of tensions. The missile’s hypersonic nature and non-nuclear profile make it a versatile tool for Russia’s military, capable of striking with precision while circumventing most conventional missile defense systems, including THAAD and Aegis. The attack on Dnipro has further fueled worries that Russia may be advancing its missile technology with a focus on bypassing traditional defense mechanisms. With its ability to target high-value military and infrastructure assets over a long distance, the RS-26 Oreshnik represents a serious threat in a region already facing significant instability. For NATO and the West, the growing production of intermediate-range ballistic missiles like the RS-26 Rubezh, and the operational readiness of the Oreshnik, highlight the urgent need to adapt and modernize missile defense capabilities to respond to Russia's evolving missile threats. Russia’s ability to ramp up production of the RS-26 Rubezh, including its Oreshnik variant, signals a major shift in the strategic landscape. With up to 25 units of the RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik expected to roll out annually, Russia is significantly enhancing its missile arsenal, increasing its ability to project power over long distances. As the Oreshnik variant enters the operational phase, the growing concern about its hypersonic and maneuverability features will continue to shape global security dynamics. The missile’s potential to bypass missile defense systems, along with its strategic and tactical flexibility, makes it a formidable asset in Russia’s military planning. For the West, this development calls for reevaluating defense strategies and missile deterrence capabilities as Russia’s missile forces continue to evolve rapidly. The geopolitical implications of this missile advancement will likely influence future arms control talks and shape the future trajectory of global missile defense systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-ukraine-intel-reveals-russia-can-produce-25-medium-range-ballistic-missiles-annually	2024-12-06T08:12:52-08:00

The deal includes 184 missiles, four of which are designated as fly-to-buy for testing, and 30 Lightweight Command Launch Units (LWCLUs). This acquisition is set to complement Tunisia’s existing anti-tank capabilities, which currently rely on systems such as the Milan and TOW missile platforms and vehicle-mounted launchers like the M901 ITV TOW. The introduction of the Javelin system is expected to significantly enhance Tunisia's ability to counter armored threats and bolster its overall infantry effectiveness.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Javelin anti-tank missile system is a modern addition to Tunisia’s arsenal, offering capabilities that significantly surpass its current inventory. (Picture source: US DoD) Tunisia’s current anti-tank arsenal includes man-portable missile systems and older platforms, such as the Milan, that have been in service for decades. These systems are supplemented by vehicle-mounted TOW launchers, which provide additional firepower against both armored vehicles and fortifications. While effective, these systems are aging and have limited operational flexibility compared to newer technologies like the Javelin. The Javelin's fire-and-forget capabilities and extended range provide a modernized edge, aligning with Tunisia’s broader efforts to modernize its defense forces. Tunisia is navigating a multifaceted geopolitical landscape, with internal political challenges and regional instability shaping its defense priorities. The consolidation of power by President Kais Saied in 2021 led to strained relations with Western allies due to perceived democratic backsliding. Nevertheless, Tunisia has maintained critical partnerships, including those with the United States, which designated it as a major non-NATO ally in 2015. Additionally, Tunisia's defense modernization is shaped by its strategic need to counter threats from neighboring Libya, where ongoing instability continues to pose risks to national security. In terms of its foreign policy, Tunisia is striking a balance between traditional alliances and new partnerships. While maintaining ties with the European Union, particularly on migration and economic issues, Tunisia has expanded cooperation with countries like China, seeking to diversify its security and economic alliances. This dual-track strategy aims to enhance sovereignty and reduce reliance on any single bloc, reflecting Tunisia’s adaptation to evolving global dynamics. The Javelin missile system is a modern addition to Tunisia’s arsenal, offering capabilities that significantly surpass its current inventory. Designed as a man-portable fire-and-forget anti-tank system, the Javelin uses advanced infrared homing to engage targets effectively from distances of up to 4,000 meters. Its tandem-charge warhead is capable of defeating modern armor, including vehicles equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA), by employing a precursor charge to neutralize the ERA before the primary warhead penetrates the base armor. The Javelin’s lightweight design and advanced LWCLU enhance operational flexibility, allowing for deployment in various environments with minimal setup time. Its fire-and-forget capability ensures greater safety for operators, as they can relocate immediately after launch. These features make the Javelin particularly suited to Tunisia’s evolving defense needs, providing its forces with a modern and versatile tool to address a wide range of armored and fortified threats. This acquisition underscores Tunisia’s commitment to advancing its military capabilities in alignment with regional security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-supports-tunisias-military-modernization-through-strategic-javelin-anti-tank-missile-deal	2024-12-06T05:51:25-08:00	
Japan Increases Defense Ties with Coastal Radars and Patrol Vessels Supplies Under OSA Program	On December 2, 2024, a Japanese government source revealed that Japan would supply specific defense equipment to the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Djibouti under its Official Security Assistance (OSA) program. This program, launched in April 2023, aims to strengthen the defense capacities of nations that share Tokyo's strategic values. For the 2024 fiscal year ending in March, the government allocated a budget of 5 billion yen ($33 million) to support these four priority countries. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mitsubishi J/FPS-3 Coastal Surveillance Radar (Picture source: Mitsubishi) In 2024, Japan decided to allocate a significant portion of this aid to the Philippines, which faces escalating Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. Tokyo plans to provide advanced maritime surveillance radar systems to Manila to enhance detection and control capabilities in this strategic area. These systems will complement the J/FPS-3 coastal surveillance radar developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, delivered in 2023, which significantly improved the security of the Philippines' territorial waters. Amid recurring confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels, these new radars aim to ensure better preparedness and a swift response to incursions. Mongolia, due to its strategic location between China and Russia, is expected to receive systems including Primary Surveillance Radars (PSR) produced by NEC Corporation, capable of detecting aircraft without transponders, and Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSR), which identify equipped aircraft and provide precise data on their altitude and trajectory. These systems will enable Mongolia to enhance its airspace monitoring capabilities and guard against potential intrusions. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Djibouti could receive Shikishima-class patrol vessels, built by Japan Marine United Corporation (JMU), or equivalent models designed to ensure maritime security and protect strategic trade routes. These vessels aim to counter illegal maritime activities in Indonesian waters and strengthen security in Djibouti's vital maritime corridor. Since its launch in April 2023, the OSA program reflects a strategic shift in Japan's international security policy. This proactive initiative aims to bolster the defense capacities of its partners in the face of growing threats, particularly China's military expansion. Through this targeted assistance, Tokyo reaffirms its commitment to promoting a free and stable Indo-Pacific while consolidating regional alliances in an increasingly tense geopolitical context. Japan's arms policy, long defined by a strict pacifist stance, is rooted in Article 9 of its 1947 Constitution adopted after World War II. This article prohibits Japan from using war as a means of resolving international conflicts and restricts its military capabilities to strictly territorial defense. For decades, this approach translated into stringent restrictions on arms exports and an exclusively defensive role for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). However, the evolving regional security environment has gradually pushed Tokyo to reassess this policy. Faced with China's growing military power, North Korea's nuclear threats, and the rising strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, several key changes have marked this transition. In 1967, the 'Three Principles on Arms Exports' established a strict ban on selling arms to communist countries, nations under UN embargo, or those involved in armed conflicts. These restrictions began to ease in 2014 when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe adopted the 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment,' allowing limited exports to countries sharing Japan's democratic values. A major turning point occurred in 2015 with the adoption of the collective security law, allowing the SDF to intervene to defend allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked. This change broadened the strictly defensive framework of Japan's military action. In 2023, Tokyo launched the OSA program, designed to provide non-lethal defense equipment to allied countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, or Mongolia. This program aims to strengthen the defense capacities of partner nations while stabilizing the region amid China's military expansion. In parallel, Japan significantly increased its military budget, reaching 2% of its GDP in 2024, in line with commitments outlined in its 2022 updated national defense strategy. This record budget marks a paradigm shift for a country that traditionally capped its military spending at around 1% of its GDP. These transformations reflect Japan's intention to play a more active role in regional and international security while asserting its commitment to ensuring a free and stable Indo-Pacific. This strategic shift marks a break from its historical pacifist stance while remaining aligned with contemporary geopolitical challenges. Outside the OSA framework, Japan has also supplied defense equipment to several countries through bilateral cooperation or specific loans. In 2016, the Philippines received TC-90 training aircraft, initially leased and later transferred permanently in 2018, to bolster maritime surveillance in the contested waters of the South China Sea. In 2020, Japan delivered patrol vessels to Vietnam via a low-interest loan, followed by a 2021 agreement to expand the export of maritime surveillance systems. In 2022, Japan concluded an agreement with Thailand for technology transfers in the defense sector, though specific systems have not been disclosed. Regarding Ukraine, while Japan has not supplied lethal military equipment, it delivered civilian drones, bulletproof vests, and other non-lethal support equipment in 2022 and 2023, underscoring its commitment to supporting Kyiv within the constraints of Japan's constitutional restrictions. These initiatives demonstrate Tokyo's intent to contribute to international security while adapting to the specific needs of its strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/japan-increases-defense-ties-with-coastal-radars-and-patrol-vessels-supplies-under-osa-program	2024-12-06T05:44:38-08:00	
First capture of intact Podlet-K1 radar by Syrian rebels could threaten Russia's air defense effectiveness	As reported by Clash Report on December 4, 2024, Syrian rebels have achieved the first recorded capture of an intact Russian 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, taken during an offensive near Hama at the headquarters of the Assad regime's 25th Special Forces Division. The system, valued at approximately $5 million and integral to the S-300PMU-2 and S-400 air defense networks, could pose a significant threat to Russian air defense effectiveness if its technology is analyzed by adversaries.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. (Picture source: Clash Report) Similar systems lost in Ukraine, such as those destroyed in Kherson and Crimea, were not seized intact. While operational use by the rebels is unlikely due to technical complexity, the most effective way to exploit its capabilities would be through detailed analysis, which could reveal vulnerabilities in Russian air defense systems, an eventuality which raises concerns among Russian analysts about its potential transfer to entities like NATO or Ukraine. Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. This information could advance the development of countermeasures, refine electronic warfare tactics, and highlight weaknesses in Russian air defense systems. The Podlet-K1's ability to detect low-altitude cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and R-360 Neptune, underscores its strategic importance. The capture occurred during a broader offensive by opposition forces in Hama province, following their takeover of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. This offensive, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), marked the first opposition control of Aleppo since 2016. After capturing several military installations, including the 87th Brigade base and a tank school, HTS forces advanced toward Hama. Although they temporarily breached the city's defenses, counterattacks by pro-Assad forces, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias, forced the rebels to retreat. The offensive resulted in significant equipment losses for both sides. Rebels reportedly seized 31 Russian-made tanks, including T-72 and T-90 models, 20 BMP armored personnel carriers, and 12 122mm artillery pieces. Additionally, they captured a Pantsir-S1, a Strela-10, and an S-125 air defense system. These acquisitions have enabled expanded drone and missile attacks on regime targets. However, intense fighting led to the destruction of other equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, though specific figures remain unverified. Among the abandoned systems was a ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures, left by the regime’s 4th Armored Division on the Khanasir-Ithrya road. This system, one of two upgraded in the Adra workshop, was filmed after its abandonment. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, rebels captured eight L-39 Albatros light training and attack jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The MiG-23, powered by a Tumansky R-29B turbojet engine, can reach speeds of up to 2,500 km/h and is designed for interception and air-to-ground missions. While these aircraft represent strategic assets, their operational potential is constrained by maintenance needs, a lack of skilled pilots, and vulnerability to airstrikes. Ground tests were attempted, but technical issues and attacks on captured bases hindered further use. The Podlet-K1 system can detect aerial targets at ranges of 10 to 300 kilometers and altitudes up to 10 kilometers, tracking up to 200 targets simultaneously. Its modular design comprises three components mounted on a KamAZ-6350 8x8 chassis: an antenna post, a mobile command post, and a power generator. It employs a phased-array S-band radar and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) technology, enabling operations against low-flying and high-speed targets. The system's deployment and pack-up can be completed within approximately 20 minutes. The capture of the Podlet-K1 radar system has drawn comparisons to a 2020 operation in Libya, where U.S. forces, in cooperation with Türkiye, extracted a Russian Pantsir-S1 system. Speculation suggests the radar could be transferred to Türkiye, given its use of Russian S-400 systems. Alternatively, Russian airstrikes might target the radar to prevent its analysis, similar to actions taken in Ukraine following the loss of a Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UAV. Despite logistical challenges, the radar’s intact condition could facilitate technical study and aid in developing countermeasures against similar systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/first-capture-of-intact-podlet-k1-radar-by-syrian-rebels-could-threaten-russias-air-defense-effectiveness	2024-12-06T05:08:14-08:00

Australia Establishes a Coastal Defense System to Enhance Strategic Capabilities	On December 6, 2024, the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, announced the development of a new coastal defense and long-range strike system for the Australian Army. This initiative aligns with the priorities outlined in the 2024 National Defense Strategy, which emphasizes securing Australia’s northern approaches amid evolving geopolitical complexities. This marks a significant step for the Australian Defense Force (ADF), introducing coastal strike capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Naval Strike Missile (NSM), developed by Kongsberg, is a stealth cruise missile for anti-ship and land-attack missions, designed to be mounted on the mobile and adaptable StrikeMaster vehicle for coastal operations (Picture source: Kongsberg) The program considers two advanced technological options. The first is the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), launched from the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). Known for its mobility and capability, HIMARS can deliver strikes over 500 kilometers with the latest PrSM. The second option is the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), developed by Kongsberg, a stealth cruise missile designed for anti-ship and land-attack missions. The NSM, mounted on the StrikeMaster vehicle, offers a mobile and adaptable solution for coastal operations. A competitive evaluation is scheduled for 2025 to determine the most suitable technology for Australia’s strategic needs. This structured approach builds on an earlier decision, approved in August 2023, to expedite the acquisition of 42 HIMARS launchers and associated precision munitions. These systems will be deployed within two new specialized regiments based at the Edinburgh Defence Precinct in South Australia, a key defense hub. The government has allocated AUD 28–35 billion over the next decade to support this program.

Australia to test StrikeMaster coastal defense system with NSM missiles mounted on Bushmaster vehicles	According to ABC News on December 4, 2024, the Australian Army is advancing plans to integrate the StrikeMaster, a domestically developed missile-launching system mounted on the Bushmaster vehicle, into its long-range strike capabilities. The StrikeMaster is equipped with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a precision-guided weapon capable of striking targets at ranges exceeding 250 kilometers. It is designed to engage both land-based and maritime targets. Initially unveiled in 2022, the system was developed through a partnership between Kongsberg and Thales and is intended to provide 'area denial' capabilities in northern Australia as part of the country's updated defense strategy.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The StrikeMaster is equipped with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a precision-guided weapon capable of striking targets at ranges exceeding 250 kilometers. (Picture source: Thales) Under Project LAND 8113 Phase Two, the Federal Government has initiated a tender process to compare the StrikeMaster with the American-made M142 HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System). The HIMARS can deploy the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which has a range exceeding 400 kilometers. The government has highlighted the StrikeMaster as a less expensive and locally produced alternative, emphasizing its potential to strengthen domestic production capabilities. Despite its prioritization by the Albanese government, there has been internal resistance within the Army regarding the system's adoption. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM), developed by Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace in Norway, entered service in 2012 as the successor to the Penguin missile. It is constructed with materials designed to reduce radar visibility and features a titanium-cased warhead for precise targeting. Originally integrated into Norway’s Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates and Skjold-class corvettes, the NSM has also been adopted by Poland’s Coastal Missile Division, the United States, and Australia. The missile’s flexibility has enabled its use across a variety of platforms, including naval vessels and land-based systems. The NSM’s operational range exceeds 250 kilometers, and it employs GPS guidance, terrain-following technology, and an imaging infrared seeker for autonomous target identification and engagement. The missile is designed to fly at low altitudes to avoid detection and countermeasures. In Poland, the Coastal Missile Division deploys the NSM using mobile launchers supported by radar and command vehicles, enabling a networked defense system. The missile has also been adapted for land operations, as demonstrated by the U.S. Marine Corps' Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS), which employs unmanned vehicles for increased flexibility and range. The integration of naval missile systems onto land vehicles enhances coastal defense by enabling land-based forces to engage maritime targets. This capability allows rapid repositioning along coastlines, complicating adversary planning and operations. Using existing platforms to deploy naval missile technology reduces development costs while maintaining operational effectiveness. The NMESIS, for instance, successfully demonstrated this concept during a 2021 exercise, striking a target ship from a ground-based launcher. Similarly, the Australian Army is exploring the StrikeMaster system as a mobile coastal defense solution using the NSM, providing strike capabilities over 250 kilometers. Australia’s interest in long-range precision strike systems aligns with the 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR), which calls for a response to changing security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region, including the expansion of China’s military activities. The DSR recommends strengthening the Australian Defence Force (ADF) by acquiring more advanced strike systems across ground, air, and maritime domains to address vulnerabilities in conventional defenses.

Breaking News: US Successfully Tests MACH-TB Hypersonic Flight to Accelerate Weapons Development	On December 5, 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announced the successful execution of a key flight test for the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed (MACH-TB), which took place in November 2024. The test, conducted by the Department of Defense’s Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, marks a significant milestone in the U.S. pursuit of hypersonic technologies. The MACH-TB is designed to advance the testing and development of hypersonic systems, providing crucial insights into the performance of cutting-edge weapons that could dramatically enhance U.S. military capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Testing the future of warfare: The MACH-TB hypersonic flight test accelerates the development of advanced weapons capabilities for the U.S. military. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The MACH-TB is a next-generation hypersonic flight test vehicle developed to accelerate the testing process for hypersonic systems across multiple branches of the U.S. military and other federal agencies. Its primary purpose is to provide a reliable, commercially launched platform capable of simulating and testing hypersonic conditions in real-world flight scenarios. By employing commercial launch services, the DoD aims to reduce the costs and time associated with testing hypersonic components while simultaneously increasing the testing frequency. Mr. George Rumford, Director of the TRMC, emphasized the value of this approach: 'Leveraging commercial launch services allows our Nation to test components early and frequently, accelerating hypersonic development affordably.' This approach not only helps expedite testing but also enables rapid feedback on the performance of hypersonic technologies, making it a critical enabler for developing advanced capabilities for U.S. forces. Hypersonic weapons are defined as those that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. These weapons are particularly notable because of their ability to maneuver while traveling at extreme speeds, making them highly difficult to track or intercept with current missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability creates significant strategic advantages for any military force capable of deploying them. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare is undeniable, as they offer a range of benefits. First, their speed and precision enable hypersonic weapons to strike targets at extreme distances in a fraction of the time compared to conventional missiles, potentially rendering existing defense systems obsolete. Second, unlike ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic weapons are capable of maneuvering in flight, further complicating interception efforts. Finally, their ability to penetrate heavily defended airspace provides a significant deterrent and strategic advantage during combat situations. The development of hypersonic technologies is, therefore, seen as a crucial part of the evolving global arms race, as nations seek to gain a technological edge on the battlefield. While the United States has made significant strides in hypersonic weapons development, it is far from alone in pursuing this advanced technology. China and Russia have emerged as key competitors, each heavily investing in hypersonic systems to bolster their own military capabilities. China has made rapid progress in developing hypersonic glide vehicles, such as the DF-17, which is capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. The Chinese military has also been investing in advanced launch platforms and testing mechanisms, with a focus on increasing the speed and range of their hypersonic systems. Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has aggressively pursued hypersonic weapons as part of its military modernization program. The country has already deployed hypersonic missiles like the Avangard, which is reportedly capable of reaching speeds up to Mach 27. Additionally, Russia has developed the Zircon missile, a sea-launched hypersonic weapon intended to target both naval and land-based targets at extreme speeds. Both China and Russia have demonstrated their capabilities through successful test flights, creating a sense of urgency in the U.S. military to advance its own hypersonic development programs. In addition to China and Russia, countries such as India, France, and Australia are also pursuing hypersonic technologies, each working to integrate these systems into their defense strategies. For the U.S. military and its allies, hypersonic weapons represent a paradigm shift in the way warfare could be conducted. The strategic advantages they offer are clear. Hypersonic weapons allow for near-instantaneous strikes, significantly shortening the response time to emerging threats and providing a new tool for rapid deployment of military force. They also can penetrate traditional missile defense systems. Systems like the U.S.-developed Aegis or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) are optimized for intercepting slower ballistic missiles, but hypersonic weapons, due to their high speed and unpredictable flight paths, present a much more difficult challenge for these systems to defend against. Additionally, hypersonic systems can be adapted to various platforms, from ground-based launchers to submarines and aircraft, allowing military forces to deploy these weapons in a variety of operational scenarios. Given their speed and range, hypersonic weapons could be used in a variety of theaters, from deterring regional conflicts to countering more sophisticated threats posed by adversaries with advanced air-defense systems. Therefore, the U.S. military's focus on hypersonics is not just about keeping pace with China and Russia but also about ensuring that it retains a technological edge that will be decisive in future conflicts. The MACH-TB test represents one critical step in this ongoing race to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, which will be a core element of the U.S. military’s arsenal in the years to come. The success of the MACH-TB flight test is a major achievement in the U.S. Department of Defense's quest to accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies. By leveraging commercial launch services, the DoD is setting the stage for more frequent and cost-effective testing, ultimately leading to faster deployment of these advanced weapons. With global competitors like China and Russia intensifying their own hypersonic development programs, the need for the U.S. to lead in this domain has never been more pressing. Hypersonic weapons are poised to revolutionize military strategies worldwide, and initiatives like MACH-TB are essential for ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-us-successfully-tests-mach-tb-hypersonic-flight-to-accelerate-weapons-development	2024-12-06T01:29:30-08:00

The vessel’s construction involved three shipyards and over 1,000 personnel during the assembly and outfitting phases. Delivery, initially expected by 2022, was delayed to December 2024. Once commissioned, Trieste will replace the Giuseppe Garibaldi and serve as part of Italy's amphibious task group, supporting multiple operational roles. At 245 meters in length and 33,000 tons displacement, the Trieste, a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) built by Fincantieri, will be the largest Italian naval vessel since World War II. The ship is equipped with a CODLOG propulsion system, combining two Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines, two MAN diesel engines, and two electric motors. This system allows a maximum speed of 25 knots and a range of 7,000 nautical miles at 16 knots. Its dual-island design separates navigation and flight operations management. The ship is configured to support F-35B aircraft and various helicopters, with a 230-meter-long flight deck featuring nine landing spots and two elevators with a 42-ton capacity each. Below deck, it includes a hangar and a garage providing over 4,500 square meters of space for vehicles, along with a floodable well deck for amphibious operations. The well deck can accommodate four LCMs, one LCAC, or other amphibious vehicles. The Trieste is armed with three 76mm guns, three remote-controlled 25mm turrets, and provisions for Sylver vertical launch systems capable of deploying Aster missiles. It also features advanced electronic warfare systems and multifunction radars. Designed for multipurpose operations, the ship can carry up to 1,064 personnel, including 450 crew members and 600 embarked troops. Its onboard facilities include a hospital with 27 beds, operating rooms, and radiology and dental services, with options for containerized medical expansions. The Trieste will replace the Giuseppe Garibaldi and serve as a versatile platform for amphibious and air operations, humanitarian assistance, and joint-command roles. The Trieste differs from the Giuseppe Garibaldi and Cavour aircraft carriers primarily in its design focus and operational roles. The Garibaldi was a smaller vessel at 180.2 meters with a displacement of 14,150 tons, specialized in anti-submarine warfare and air defense, operating Harrier jets and helicopters. The Cavour, slightly smaller than the Trieste at 244 meters and 27,100 tons displacement, is dedicated to air operations as an aircraft carrier. In contrast, the Trieste, at 245 meters and 33,000 tons displacement, is a multipurpose amphibious assault ship with a floodable well deck for landing craft, expanded facilities for troop transport, and significant medical capabilities. Unlike the primarily aviation-oriented Cavour and Garibaldi, the Trieste integrates amphibious, humanitarian, and joint-command operations. This vessel is part of a broader series of modernizations to strengthen the capabilities of the Italian Navy and address current maritime security challenges. The Defence Multi-Year Planning Document (DPP) for 2024–2026 prioritizes countering new threats and renewing platforms across underwater, surface, and airborne domains. The program includes constructing four next-generation offshore patrol vessels, with the first delivery planned for 2027 and options for two additional ships. Additionally, the Navy has commissioned two FREMM EVO multipurpose frigates, featuring anti-drone systems, through a €1.5 billion contract with Orizzonte Sistemi Navali. Submarine capabilities are also being enhanced through the U212 Near Future Submarine (NFS) program, aiming for new deliveries by 2027–2029. The acquisition of additional F-35B aircraft for both the Navy and Air Force is included, aiming to expand the joint fleet to 115 aircraft. Operationally, the Trieste's role extends beyond military functions. It is designed to operate with NATO forces and act as an alternate platform for vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft operations when the Cavour aircraft carrier is unavailable. Therefore, it supports Italy’s goals of performing roles beyond territorial defense, such as addressing piracy and managing humanitarian emergencies. Recent activities include deploying the Cavour aircraft carrier to the Indo-Pacific and participating in Australia's Exercise Pitch Black, emphasizing collaboration with allied forces. The Navy also engages in security operations, exemplified by neutralizing a Houthi drone threat in the Red Sea and safeguarding international shipping routes. These developments underline the Navy's modernization efforts and its role in securing maritime interests in domestic and global contexts. The LHD Trieste will provide the Italian Navy with new capabilities, including a floodable well deck to deploy advanced landing craft, an expanded aviation deck capable of operating F-35B fighter jets and helicopters, and a modular hospital with facilities for treating critically injured patients. It is designed for amphibious operations, force projection, joint and inter-allied command, and logistical support. The ship also features advanced propulsion systems for improved range and endurance, along with electronic warfare and radar systems to enhance situational awareness and defense. These features position the Trieste to address both military and disaster response needs in current operational contexts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/italian-navy-to-commission-trieste-helicopter-carrier-as-new-flagship-for-amphibious-task-group	2024-12-05T02:41:14-08:00	
Syrian Rebels capture Syrian Army's most modern T-90A tanks in major offensive	As reported by Tendar on December 4, 2024, Syrian opposition forces have captured several T-90 and T-90A tanks, among the most modern combat vehicles supplied by Russia to the Syrian Army. These tanks, equipped with sophisticated firepower, protection systems, and mobility features, could significantly enhance the rebels’ combat capabilities. Their acquisition occurs amid an escalating conflict, where the Syrian Army is increasingly abandoning intact, modern Russian-supplied equipment during retreats, particularly following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Of the 30 T-90 and T-90A main battle tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been abandoned by the Syrian Army and captured by opposition forces. (Picture source: Twitter/Tendar and T-90K) During a recent offensive in Syria, opposition forces, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), captured significant quantities of Russian military equipment left behind by retreating Syrian government forces. To date, this included between six and eight T-90 and T-90A tanks, a Russian-made 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, a Buk-M2 air defense system, and one of two ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' vehicles equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system was also seized. Additionally, older systems such as T-72M and T-55 tanks, BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher, two BREM recovery vehicles (BREM-1 or BREM-2), and a 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer were captured. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, opposition forces seized eight L-39 Albatros light jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The range of equipment captured highlights the extent of material losses suffered by the Syrian Army. Among the captured equipment, the T-90 and T-90A tanks are particularly significant. Of the 30 T-90 tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been captured during this new offensive. Earlier incidents also reveal a consistent pattern of equipment loss. In 2016, a T-90A was captured by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham during clashes near Aleppo, marking the first documented instance of this tank falling into opposition hands. That unit has since been observed in various operations. Another T-90 was captured in 2020 during a government retreat. These incidents underscore vulnerabilities in securing advanced equipment during Syrian Army withdrawals. The latest captures occurred amid an offensive following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. This marked the first time opposition forces had taken control of Aleppo since 2016. The offensive, led by HTS, progressed into Hama province after capturing key installations such as the 87th Brigade base and a tank school. Despite breaching Hama’s defenses, opposition forces were eventually pushed back by counterattacks from Syrian government troops, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias. The captured T-90A tank provides Syrian rebels with notable combat capabilities due to its modern design and equipment. It is armed with a 125mm 2A46M-5 smoothbore gun, capable of engaging targets at distances up to 5 kilometers with precision, including while the tank is in motion. The tank supports the use of guided missiles and various ammunition types, including armor-piercing and high-explosive shells. Its fire control system, equipped with ESSA TPV thermal imaging and night vision devices, enhances target detection and engagement in low-visibility conditions, offering operational utility in nighttime or urban environments. The T-90A's armor includes Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, which is designed to reduce the effectiveness of anti-tank projectiles and missiles. The Shtora-1 active protection system is integrated to counter guided missile threats. Its 1,000-horsepower V-92S2 diesel engine supports mobility and maneuverability across diverse terrains. The compact design facilitates repositioning during combat. These features collectively enhance the tank's functional value for the rebels in scenarios where older or less capable armor is commonly encountered. The Syrian Army continues to face challenges in safeguarding its equipment during strategic retreats. The rapid advance of HTS and allied forces, combined with logistical constraints, has resulted in the abandonment of high-value assets. The Syrian military’s reliance on Russian-supplied systems, which are not fully integrated into its operational framework, further complicates its ability to manage withdrawals. Additionally, Russia’s focus on its own military commitments, including operations in Ukraine, has limited its capacity to provide immediate support to Syrian forces. These factors have contributed to repeated equipment losses, significantly impacting the Syrian Army’s overall operational capability. On the other hand, Syrian opposition forces have shown mixed capacities in effectively using captured tanks, including advanced models like the T-90A, against the Syrian Army. These capabilities are influenced by various factors, such as technical expertise, availability of spare parts, and tactical integration. Groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) have historically captured tanks during engagements, including T-55, T-72, and more advanced T-90A models. The T-90A, equipped with advanced thermal imaging, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, and a powerful 125mm smoothbore gun, poses significant challenges for opposition forces to maintain and operate due to its sophisticated systems. Nevertheless, there have been instances where such tanks were employed effectively, including a confirmed case in 2017 where HTS militants used a captured T-90A against government forces. Recent offensives, particularly in northwestern Syria, have also resulted in the capture of additional tanks abandoned by retreating Syrian Army units near Aleppo and Idlib. However, opposition forces often struggle with sustaining these platforms due to limited access to skilled operators, logistical challenges, and an inability to repair complex damage. The integration of captured equipment is further hampered by fragmentation among opposition groups, varying levels of military training, and reliance on external support for anti-armor operations. Despite these limitations, the use of captured tanks provides a significant psychological and tactical boost, enabling rebels to counter Syrian Army advances when deployed strategically.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/syrian-opposition-captures-syrian-armys-most-modern-t-90a-tanks-in-major-offensive	2024-12-05T02:22:38-08:00

This exercise demonstrates Russia’s commitment to enhancing its military capabilities and highlights the increasing role of hypersonic missiles in modern warfare. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian MiG-31I fighter jet armed with a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) participating in military exercises over the eastern Mediterranean. (Picture source: Russia Zvezdanews) The Kinzhal missile, which translates to 'Dagger' in Russian, is an air-launched hypersonic weapon designed to deliver unparalleled speed, precision, and power. Capable of traveling at speeds up to Mach 10 and performing evasive maneuvers during flight, the Kinzhal is a formidable weapon against both static and mobile targets. With a reported range of approximately 2,000 kilometers, it has the ability to strike critical assets such as aircraft carriers, command centers, and strategic infrastructure with minimal warning. The deployment of this missile on MiG-31I aircraft enhances Russia’s ability to project power across key regions, including the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The MiG-31I is a specialized variant of the MiG-31 interceptor, adapted to carry hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal. Compared to the original MiG-31, which was designed primarily for high-altitude interception of enemy aircraft, the MiG-31I has been optimized for carrying and launching large payloads, including hypersonic weapons. While retaining the original’s exceptional speed—capable of reaching Mach 2.8—the MiG-31I also benefits from enhanced avionics and missile integration systems tailored to the operational demands of hypersonic missile deployment. This transformation significantly expands the aircraft's combat capabilities, making it not only a high-speed interceptor but also a strategic strike platform. The operational integration of the MiG-31I and Kinzhal missiles is a continuation of Russia’s hypersonic strategy. In October 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that MiG-31 fighter jets equipped with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles would begin patrolling the Black Sea. This announcement underscored Moscow’s intent to establish a robust hypersonic deterrent in a region of heightened geopolitical tension, signaling Russia's readiness to counter perceived threats and assert its influence over contested areas. The Russian armed forces also operate another air-launched hypersonic missile system in limited service: the GZUR (Hypersonic Guided Airborne Missile). While less publicized than the Kinzhal, the GZUR is designed for tactical roles and can be deployed from multi-role fighter jets, expanding the operational flexibility of Russia’s hypersonic arsenal. Together, these two systems—the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and the GZUR—form the backbone of Russia’s air-launched hypersonic capabilities, ensuring both strategic and tactical coverage in modern warfare. Hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal and GZUR are revolutionizing modern warfare by challenging existing defense systems and reshaping strategic paradigms. The extreme speeds of hypersonic weapons drastically reduce the reaction time available to adversaries, making them difficult to intercept with conventional missile defense systems. Their ability to maneuver mid-flight further complicates defensive measures, effectively rendering many current systems obsolete. The proliferation of hypersonic weapons has also intensified the global arms race. As Russia advances its capabilities, other nations, including the United States and China, are accelerating the development of their own hypersonic systems. This technological race not only raises the stakes in global power competition but also introduces new risks, including the potential for miscalculation or unintended escalation in conflict zones. The deployment of hypersonic missiles in active theaters, such as the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, also poses emerging threats. The dual-use capability of hypersonic weapons, which can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, adds ambiguity to their deployment. This uncertainty increases the risk of misinterpretation, particularly in high-stakes confrontations, potentially triggering disproportionate responses. Furthermore, the spread of hypersonic technology raises concerns about its potential acquisition by non-state actors, amplifying the threat to global security. Russia’s demonstration of its hypersonic capabilities in the Mediterranean is a clear message to both regional and global adversaries. By integrating advanced weapon systems like the Kinzhal and GZUR into its strategic arsenal and pairing them with high-performance aircraft like the MiG-31I, Moscow is not only solidifying its position as a leader in hypersonic technology but also reshaping the future of warfare. As these weapons continue to evolve, their role in military strategy is poised to grow, heralding a new era where speed, precision, and unpredictability define the battlefield.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-russian-mig-31i-fighter-jet-with-hypersonic-missile-in-military-exercise-demonstrating-new-threats	2024-12-05T01:26:23-08:00

As part of its latest military aid package to Ukraine, the United States will provide three land mine systems designed to enhance Ukraine’s ability to secure critical terrain and impede enemy movement. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ADAM 155mm (Area Denial Artillery Munition) is a precision-guided artillery shell designed to deploy anti-personnel mines over a wide area, creating rapid minefields for area denial. (Picture source: US RDECOM) These land mine systems include the M692/M731 Area Denial Artillery Munition (ADAM), the M131 Modular Pack Mine System (MOPMS), and the M136 Volcano mine-laying system. Each of these remotely delivered or manually deployed technologies offers unique capabilities: the ADAM delivers a rapid minefield using 155mm artillery, the MOPMS is a flexible, portable system for infantry use, and the Volcano is a vehicle-mounted dispenser capable of laying large-scale minefields over vast areas. Together, these systems will give Ukraine a powerful toolkit to fortify its defenses and slow the advance of Russian forces.1. M692/M731 ADAM: 155mm Area Denial Munition The M692/M731 ADAM is a 155mm artillery shell designed to deploy anti-personnel mines quickly across a broad area. This system, part of the U.S. Army's 'Family of Scatterable Mines' (FASCAM), was developed during the 1980s to enhance battlefield control by creating instant minefields. Each artillery round fired from a Howitzer delivers 36 mines, which are equipped with self-destruct features to minimize long-term risks to civilians. These mines either deactivate or self-destruct after a pre-determined period—typically 4 to 48 hours—ensuring that they do not pose a persistent threat once hostilities have subsided. Tripwires activate the mines in the ADAM system and feature a spherical warhead designed to create deadly shrapnel patterns. Upon activation, the warhead is launched to a height of 1 to 2 meters and detonates, releasing approximately 600 fragments that can incapacitate or kill enemy personnel within a wide radius. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance, addressing ongoing humanitarian concerns related to land mines.

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) 2. M131 MOPMS: Modular Pack Mine System The M131 Modular Pack Mine System (MOPMS) is a portable and flexible mine-laying system designed for rapid deployment by infantry or engineer units. It is primarily used for creating both anti-personnel and anti-vehicle minefields in various tactical scenarios. The system consists of modular packs, each containing a set of mines and components necessary for deployment. These packs are lightweight, typically weighing between 13 to 18 kg (30 to 40 pounds), allowing soldiers to carry and place them in the desired locations easily. MOPMS can deploy multiple types of mines, including M14 anti-personnel mines and M16 anti-tank mines. The mines can be configured to detonate either upon impact or after a set delay, providing tactical flexibility. The impact-triggered mines are designed to activate when a vehicle or personnel come into contact with them, while the timed mines can be set to explode after a specified delay, allowing troops to control the exact timing of the detonation. This feature enables military forces to adapt the minefield to the specific needs of the battlefield, such as blocking enemy movement, securing routes, or defending key positions. One of the key features of the MOPMS is that the mines it deploys are self-neutralizing. This means they either self-destruct or deactivate after a set period, which reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance harming civilians or friendly forces after the conflict. This self-destruct feature is an essential part of the system, addressing humanitarian concerns related to landmines in post-conflict zones. The system’s modular design also allows for flexibility in how it is deployed. Infantry units can manually place the mine packs in various configurations depending on the operational needs of the moment. Whether laying a minefield in dense forests, urban environments, or along critical choke points like roads or bridges, the MOPMS offers versatility in minefield creation. Furthermore, the system is compatible with military vehicles, enabling quicker deployment during larger operations. A U.S. Army vehicle-mounted M136 Volcano mine dispenser rapidly deploys a wide-area minefield, creating an effective barrier to block enemy movement. The system ejects mine canisters containing anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, dispersing them across a large area to deny access to critical routes and infrastructure. (Picture source U.S. DoD) 3. M136 Volcano: Vehicle-Mounted Mine Dispenser The M136 Volcano is a highly effective, vehicle-mounted mine-laying system designed to rapidly deploy anti-personnel and anti-tank mines across large areas. It is commonly mounted on various military vehicles, such as armored personnel carriers, engineering vehicles, and trucks, providing flexibility in deployment across different operational environments. The Volcano system uses M87 mine canisters, which hold up to six mines each. Depending on the configuration of the vehicle, the system can carry up to 24 canisters, allowing it to deploy a significant number of mines in a very short time. Once activated, the Volcano system rapidly disperses the mines in a predetermined pattern over a wide area, usually between 30 to 60 meters from the vehicle. This wide dispersion helps create a dense minefield that can block or disrupt enemy movement. The mines deployed by the Volcano include M14 anti-personnel mines and M15 anti-tank mines, both of which are designed to deny access to key areas, such as roads, fields, and critical infrastructure like bridges or supply routes. A critical feature of the Volcano system is its ability to set self-destruct or self-neutralizing functions for the mines. Each mine is equipped with a timer, ensuring that it either self-deactivates or self-destructs after a certain period—typically ranging from a few hours to several days—minimizing the risk of unexploded ordnance. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces long-term hazards to civilians or friendly forces once the immediate military need has passed. The system can be deployed from both ground and air platforms. While most commonly mounted on vehicles, it can also be delivered via helicopters, giving military commanders the flexibility to deploy minefields in a variety of terrains and scenarios. The Volcano can lay a minefield in just a few minutes, making it a highly efficient tool for creating instant area denial during combat operations. Tactically, the Volcano system is particularly valuable for halting enemy advances, especially in high-traffic areas like roads or chokepoints. The dense minefields it creates can slow down or halt both enemy infantry and armored vehicles, allowing friendly forces to secure key positions or gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, its rapid deployment and large mine-laying capacity make it a force multiplier for armored or mechanized units operating in concert with engineers. The provision of these mine-laying systems provides Ukraine with a broad range of options to disrupt and delay Russian forces. The ability to deploy mines remotely—either via artillery, vehicle, or infantry—gives Ukrainian forces flexibility in controlling and denying key terrain. These mine systems will be especially valuable in slowing Russian advances, protecting key infrastructure such as bridges and supply routes, and securing defensive positions. The U.S. has also ensured that these systems are 'non-persistent,' meaning that the mines will self-neutralize or self-destruct after a short time, reducing the risks to civilians after the mines' operational use. For Ukrainian commanders, the new systems significantly enhance their battlefield capabilities. The ADAM system provides rapid mine deployment over a large area, while the MOPMS and Volcano systems allow for more tactical, localized minefields. Together, these tools will help Ukraine to delay, disrupt, and inflict casualties on Russian forces, providing a force-multiplying effect on the battlefield. The addition of the ADAM, MOPMS, and Volcano mine-laying systems to Ukraine’s arsenal represents a strategic enhancement to its defensive capabilities. By providing both rapid, artillery-based and manual mine-laying solutions, the United States is enabling Ukraine to create powerful, flexible minefields that will impede enemy movements and protect vital positions. With these systems, Ukraine gains an important advantage in the ongoing conflict, ensuring that it can better control its territory and slow the advance of Russian forces while minimizing long-term humanitarian risks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-what-are-the-three-us-land-mine-systems-adam-mopms-and-volcano-for-ukraine	2024-12-03T08:57:56-08:00	
Focus: What is Lockheed Martin’s Secret X-59 Experimental Supersonic Aircraft?	This article explains the Lockheed Martin X-59, an experimental supersonic aircraft developed with NASA to address the disruptive sonic boom. Designed to make commercial supersonic travel over land possible, the X-59’s innovative technologies could also revolutionize military aviation, offering advanced stealth and high-speed capabilities. We'll examine the aircraft’s aerodynamic design, challenges, and potential to transform civilian and military aviation.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On January 12, 2024, NASA and Lockheed Martin publicly unveiled the X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft at a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The key to the X-59’s success lies in its unique aerodynamic design. Built by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works® division, the X-59 features an elongated fuselage and a specially designed long, pointed nose, which are critical to reducing the shockwaves that produce the sonic boom. These shockwaves are often heard as a loud, disruptive boom when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, especially near the ground. The X-59, however, aims to reshape those shockwaves into a softer, less noticeable 'thump', making the noise barely perceptible to the human ear. At the core of the X-59’s quiet supersonic flight technology is its ability to minimize the intensity of shockwaves that occur during the aircraft's supersonic passage. The aircraft achieves this through its unique design that ensures smooth airflow and minimizes disruptions that create noise. Its long, slender fuselage and forward-swept wings ensure that the aircraft flies efficiently at high speeds while reducing the loudness of any sonic disturbances. This quieter supersonic flight could open the door to a new era of high-speed air travel, making it possible for travelers to fly from New York to London in about three hours, halving the time of current commercial flights. On January 12, 2024, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works® marked a significant milestone in the X-59 program with a rollout ceremony held in Palmdale, California. This event celebrated not only the completion of the aircraft but also the culmination of years of research, development, and collaboration between Lockheed Martin and NASA. During the ceremony, John Clark, Vice President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works®, expressed his excitement about the project, stating, 'We’re thrilled to take on this challenge alongside NASA, whose quiet supersonic technology mission will have lasting, transformational impacts for people around the world. This project is just one example of the broader ingenuity of our industry as we continually strive to push the envelope of what’s possible.' The X-59 is a unique technology demonstrator aircraft, designed to generate a quieter, less disruptive sonic boom that would make supersonic travel over land feasible once again. The data collected from X-59 flight tests will be pivotal in shaping new aviation regulations for supersonic noise, which have traditionally been a barrier to commercial supersonic flight over populated areas. This data is expected to influence FAA and international regulators, potentially leading to the lifting of the ban on commercial supersonic flights over land, a restriction that has been in place since the retirement of the Concorde in 2003. While the primary focus of the X-59 is on commercial supersonic travel, its cutting-edge technology and aerodynamic innovations could have significant future applications in both the military and combat aviation sectors. The aircraft’s quiet supersonic flight capabilities may serve as a foundation for developing stealthier high-speed military aircraft. The X-59's low-noise supersonic flight is achieved by minimizing the shockwaves that lead to sonic booms, an approach that could be adapted to enhance the stealth capabilities of future military aircraft. A quieter supersonic jet would be harder to detect by enemy sensors, especially in high-speed combat scenarios where detection and evasion are critical. The ability to fly at supersonic speeds with reduced acoustic signatures would provide military aircraft with a distinct advantage, particularly in strike missions or reconnaissance over adversary territory. Moreover, the X-59's aerodynamic design, including its advanced wing and fuselage configuration, could significantly influence the development of next-generation fighter jets and bomber aircraft, where speed, agility, and stealth are paramount. The X-59's design's maneuverability and high-speed performance could provide valuable insights into optimizing future military aircraft for rapid, high-speed missions. The X-59’s advanced flight control systems, which ensure stability during high-speed flight, may also offer enhancements for future unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), contributing to more precise and efficient drone strikes or surveillance operations in hostile environments. Despite its remarkable promise, the X-59 faces the challenge of establishing new global aviation regulations allowing supersonic flight to resume over land. The current regulatory framework, established in the 1970s and reinforced by the Concorde’s retirement, bans commercial supersonic flights over land due to the disruptive impact of sonic booms. By generating a quieter, less intrusive sonic thump, the X-59 could prove that commercial supersonic flight is no longer an environmental burden, potentially leading to new international standards for acceptable supersonic noise levels. If successful, the X-59 could help set the foundation for the development of commercial supersonic airliners capable of providing faster-than-sound travel without disturbing people on the ground. It would also be a critical step in revolutionizing air travel by enabling airlines to offer shorter flight times, drastically reducing travel times between distant cities. The X-59 is a groundbreaking initiative in the field of supersonic aviation, and its successful development could bring about profound changes in the aviation industry. By overcoming the sonic boom challenge, Lockheed Martin and NASA are opening up new possibilities for supersonic air travel — ones that are faster, quieter, and more efficient than ever before. Beyond its civilian applications, the X-59’s innovative technologies could have major implications for military aviation, offering stealth and high-speed capabilities that could redefine modern combat strategies. As the X-59 moves into its flight test phase, it stands as a symbol of the future — a future where supersonic flight is not only a reality but one that is quiet, efficient, and transformational for both commercial and military aviation alike. With the world eagerly awaiting the X-59's test flights, this aircraft is setting the stage for the next generation of high-speed air travel and combat aviation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-is-lockheed-martins-secret-x-59-experimental-supersonic-aircraft	2024-12-03T08:29:45-08:00
