Greece and Türkiye Draw Inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome to Develop Their Own Air Defense Systems	Amid ongoing strategic competition, Greece and Türkiye, despite being NATO allies, are intensifying efforts to develop advanced air defense systems, as reported by Forbes. While their approaches differ significantly, both nations share a key similarity: they draw substantial inspiration from Israel’s battle-tested defense technologies. Greece seeks to collaborate with Israel to either acquire or co-develop systems modeled after the Iron Dome, while Türkiye is pursuing an autonomous approach with its 'Steel Dome' project, emphasizing self-reliance against perceived threats.

Athens is exploring two main options: co-developing a customized system with Tel Aviv or procuring established Israeli technologies like the Iron Dome or David’s Sling. According to Reuters, this collaboration could involve an estimated €2 billion investment, reflecting Greece’s commitment to modernizing its military. The move aligns with recent acquisitions by other European nations, such as Germany and Finland, of similar Israeli systems. Israeli defense systems have become a global benchmark. The Iron Dome, designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery, has proven highly effective in high-density attacks. Complementing it, the David’s Sling intercepts medium-range ballistic threats, while the Arrow 3 targets high-altitude projectiles in the exo-atmosphere. These multi-layered capabilities are particularly appealing to Greece, whose existing military infrastructure could benefit from enhanced protection against evolving threats. Greece already maintains strong defense ties with Israel. In 2022, it deployed an anti-drone network based on Israeli technology, adapted to its specific needs. This system protects strategic sites, including islands in the Aegean Sea, an area frequently subject to Turkish military overflights. Expanding this cooperation could provide Greece with capabilities similar to the Iron Dome while bolstering its defense posture amid regional tensions. Türkiye, by contrast, is pursuing a different strategy. It is developing air defense systems independently, as its relations with Israel remain strained due to political tensions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Despite this, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced plans to create a system equivalent to the Iron Dome, branded as the 'Steel Dome.' This ambition reflects Türkiye’s effort to demonstrate its technological capacity without external assistance. Ankara is leveraging its domestic defense industry to build a multi-layered air defense system. Its low-altitude Korkut and Sungur systems are replacing U.S.-made Stinger missiles, while the Hisar O provides medium-altitude coverage. At the top of this network is the Siper, which can reportedly intercept threats at a range of up to 100 km. However, Türkiye’s acquisition of Russian S-400 systems in 2019 remains unresolved due to sanctions and NATO compatibility concerns, leaving them unintegrated into its broader defense network. The longstanding rivalry between Greece and Türkiye, rooted in historical disputes over the Aegean Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Cyprus, continues to fuel their respective military ambitions. These tensions, frequently marked by displays of force, justify both nations’ heavy investments in advanced defensive systems. Israel’s role as a global leader in air defense extends beyond this regional dynamic. European countries are increasingly adopting Israeli technologies to bolster their own capabilities. Germany recently acquired the Arrow 3 system, while Finland, a new NATO member, opted for the David’s Sling. Central European nations, including Hungary and Slovakia, have also integrated components of the Iron Dome into their arsenals. This trend underscores Europe’s growing focus on reliable defense solutions to address contemporary threats, both state and non-state in origin. The strategic implications of these developments are significant. Greece’s partnership with Israel strengthens its alignment with Western allies and enhances its deterrence against Türkiye’s military activities, particularly around contested Aegean islands. Meanwhile, Türkiye’s 'Steel Dome' project aims to address its perceived threats while projecting regional autonomy. These advancements also impact NATO, which must balance the conflicting interests of these two member states. Additionally, such initiatives may prompt other regional actors, like Cyprus or Egypt, to invest in their own defense capabilities, further militarizing an already volatile area. Although Israeli systems serve as a model, their influence on Greek and Turkish strategies is not absolute. Greece’s collaboration with Israel is part of a broader effort to diversify its alliances, which include closer ties with the United States and the European Union. These relationships play a significant role in shaping its military procurement decisions. Similarly, Türkiye’s 'Steel Dome' reflects a pursuit of technological sovereignty, even if the concept draws from Israel’s success. Furthermore, strained Israeli-Turkish relations have driven Ankara to rely on domestic industries and alternative partners like Russia and China, diluting Israel’s direct impact on its strategic developments. The contrasting approaches of Greece and Türkiye illustrate their enduring rivalry and mutual recognition of the need for advanced air defense systems. Greece’s collaborative efforts with Israel align with its broader strategic partnerships, while Türkiye’s focus on self-reliance underscores its ambition to achieve autonomy. These divergent paths reflect not only political choices but also distinct strategies for addressing contemporary security challenges. Against the backdrop of rising global tensions, these developments highlight how historical rivalries continue to shape military priorities in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-and-tuerkiye-draw-inspiration-from-israels-iron-dome-to-develop-their-own-air-defense-systems	2024-11-26T02:53:37-08:00	
Greece to transfer S-300 and Tor-M1 air defense systems to Armenia instead of Ukraine in strategic shift	According to Enikos.gr on November 25, 2024, Greece is proceeding with the transfer of several Russian-made air defense systems, including the S-300 PMU-1, Tor-M1, and Osa-AK, to Armenia instead of Ukraine as part of its broader strategy to replace aging equipment with Western and Israeli technologies. This decision aligns with the Greek Armed Forces' plan to de-Russify its arsenal and address challenges related to maintaining Russian systems, which have been exacerbated by sanctions on Russia and associated supply chain disruptions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link As NATO and the EU now prioritize providing Ukraine with Western-standard systems, Greece has therefore opted to redirect its Russian-origin systems to Armenia, where they can be more effectively integrated and maintained. (Picture source: CyprusMail) According to information from the Greek General Staff of National Defense (GEETHA), the transfer of these systems to Armenia is part of a cooperative effort involving France, which will also provide Armenia with additional weapons. This initiative reflects strategic considerations, including Greece’s historical ties with Armenia, shared religious affiliations, and mutual interests in countering Turkish support for Azerbaijan. The proximity of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its implications for regional stability also factored into this decision. The systems being transferred include Greece's S-300 PMU1 system, acquired following the Cyprus Missile Crisis and stationed in Crete. The system comprises one regiment with four systems, eight fire units, 32 launchers, and 175 missiles. The S-300, with a range of 200 kilometers and the ability to track up to 100 targets, was first used operationally in Greece during the 2013 White Eagle exercise, 15 years after its acquisition. Despite prior discussions about sending the S-300 to Ukraine in exchange for a PAC-3 Patriot missile system, concerns over potential gaps in Greek air defense led to the cancellation of those plans. Armenia, which has experience operating Russian-made systems, is considered well-equipped to integrate the S-300 and other transferred systems into its existing defenses. The country’s prior collaboration with Russia included training for the operation of S-300 systems, and Armenian forces have used these systems as part of a joint air defense framework under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Spare parts and maintenance for these systems, previously sourced from Armenia by Greece, have played a critical role in this transfer decision. To replace the outgoing Russian systems, Greece is investing in new Israeli air defense systems, including David’s Sling, Barak MX, and Spyder. These systems offer coverage ranges from 20 to 300 kilometers and are part of a larger project to establish an 'Iron Dome' over the Aegean islands. This initiative, costing approximately €2 billion, is expected to be operational by the end of 2026, providing a timeline for when the transferred systems might leave Greek service. Armenia, which has experience operating Russian-made systems, is considered well-equipped to integrate the Soviet-era Osa-AK and other transferred air defense systems into its existing defenses. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The cooperation with Armenia extends beyond equipment transfers. The number of Armenian students in Greek military academies has doubled, and joint exercises have become more frequent. A recent exercise, 'Olympic Cooperation 24,' conducted at the Petrohori range in Xanthi, involved live-fire scenarios with Greek tanks, French armored vehicles, and simulated drone operations. Such collaborations are intended to enhance Armenia's military preparedness, particularly in light of Azerbaijan's use of drones in previous conflicts. Greece has experience replacing military assets following international transfers. An earlier initiative involved sending 40 BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine in exchange for 40 German Marder vehicles. While initial plans included 120 replacements, domestic political concerns reduced the scope. Greece is also in advanced negotiations with the United States for the acquisition of 164 Bradley armored vehicles, with a projected cost of €4 million per vehicle after reconstruction. The decision to transfer these systems to Armenia rather than Ukraine reflects changing dynamics in military supply preferences. NATO and the EU now prioritize providing Ukraine with Western-standard systems that align with existing supply chains. Greece has therefore opted to redirect its Russian-origin systems to Armenia, where they can be more effectively integrated and maintained. This transfer is part of Greece's broader effort to modernize its defense capabilities while aligning more closely with NATO and EU standards. The collaboration with France and Armenia aims to strengthen regional partnerships and address shifting security challenges in the Eastern Mediterranean and South Caucasus. By replacing Russian systems with Israeli technology and reinforcing Armenia's defenses, Greece seeks to maintain a strategic balance in a region marked by competing interests and ongoing tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-to-transfer-s-300-and-tor-m1-air-defense-systems-to-armenia-instead-of-ukraine-in-strategic-shift	2024-11-26T02:23:56-08:00

Cyprus Presents a Plan in Collaboration with US for NATO Membership	The Republic of Cyprus, under the leadership of President Nikos Christodoulidis, is advancing a plan for gradual integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This initiative, developed both politically and strategically, was recently formalized during a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, as reported by Kathimerini. The Cypriot plan, received positively in Washington, signals a shift in the island's geopolitical positioning and an effort to deepen its engagement within the Euro-Atlantic framework. However, this ambition presents both strategic opportunities and significant political challenges. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link From November 12 to 14, 2024, operational artillery fire on maritime targets was conducted by the artillery units of the Cyprus National Guard at the Kiti firing range (Picture source: Cyprus MoD) The plan outlined by President Christodoulidis focuses on three key priorities: establishing institutionalized relations with NATO, gaining access to U.S. defense equipment, and modernizing Cyprus’ military capabilities to meet NATO standards. Achieving these goals will require substantial political progress, including resolving the longstanding Cyprus issue and improving EU-Turkey relations. These steps are essential to overcoming structural barriers currently hindering Cyprus' path to full NATO membership. Cyprus aims to enhance its security through NATO’s collective defense mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which ensures mutual defense in the event of an attack. Access to advanced military equipment and training programs would allow Cyprus to upgrade its armed forces and improve interoperability with NATO allies, strengthening its overall defense posture. Regionally, NATO membership would elevate Cyprus’ geopolitical significance in the Eastern Mediterranean, reinforcing its role in regional stability. This integration could also promote broader cooperation with neighboring countries while further embedding Cyprus in Euro-Atlantic institutions. The plan aligns with existing strategic partnerships involving Israel and Greece, supported by the United States, to address multifaceted challenges in the region. Despite its potential benefits, the proposal faces numerous challenges. The unresolved Cyprus conflict, dividing the island between the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus since 1974, poses a major obstacle. Turkey, a key NATO member, has historically blocked Cypriot participation in Euro-Atlantic institutions, and any move toward NATO membership could heighten tensions. Additionally, Cyprus must address internal resistance stemming from its historical policy of neutrality. Since gaining independence in 1960, Cyprus has pursued a non-aligned stance, including participation in the Non-Aligned Movement. Joining NATO would require a significant political shift and consensus within the country, alongside a redefinition of its strategic priorities. The prospect of increased foreign military presence also raises questions about national sovereignty. With two British military bases already operating on the island, further expansion of allied forces could provoke domestic opposition, particularly among segments of the Cypriot population. Nonetheless, the Cypriot plan represents a pivotal step in the country’s strategic realignment and its aspirations to play a more active role in regional and international security. By pursuing closer institutional ties with NATO and deepening collaboration with the United States, Cyprus seeks to address pressing geopolitical challenges in the Eastern Mediterranean while solidifying its position within the broader Euro-Atlantic security architecture. Though complex and long-term in nature, this initiative underscores Cyprus’ vision for the future: becoming a vital player in the evolving strategic dynamics of its region through robust partnerships and shared commitments to stability and security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/cyprus-presents-a-plan-in-collaboration-with-us-for-nato-membership	2024-11-25T07:50:16-08:00

These technological advancements, combined with NATO's collective strength, position the Challenger 3 as a critical asset in countering modern armored threats. With its new armament, enhanced survivability, and superior maneuverability, the Challenger 3 MBT positions the U.K.’s armored forces to face the challenges of modern warfare and ensures Britain’s relevance on the battlefield for decades to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/new-british-army-challenger-3-tank-surpasses-russias-t-90m-t-80bvm-and-t-72b3-deployed-in-ukraine-war	2024-11-24T10:25:51-08:00	
Analysis: Unspecified 155mm Shells in US Aid Suggest Delivery of ADAM Anti-Personnel Mines to Ukraine	The United States has confirmed the delivery of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine as part of a $275 million military aid package announced on November 20, 2024. While the package did not explicitly mention anti-personnel mines, it included an unspecified quantity of 155mm artillery shells. Based on previous deliveries, this has led to speculation that the package could include Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), a type of 155mm shell designed to scatter anti-personnel mines across targeted areas. ADAMs are used to impede enemy troop movements and bolster defensive capabilities, adding a strategic layer to Ukraine’s resistance against Russian forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link PowerPoint slide showcasing ADAM Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions technology from a US Army ARDEC presentation. (Picture source: US Army RDECOM) The U.S. has also been supplying Ukraine with Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAM) projectiles, the anti-tank counterpart to ADAMs. RAAMs (Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions) are designed to disperse nine anti-tank mines upon firing, which can self-destruct after a set time period, effectively creating temporary minefields to slow or block advancing armored units. Pentagon statistics indicate that, alongside over three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds, more than 70,000 RAAM projectiles have already been sent to Ukraine. The M692 and M731 are two variants of the 155mm Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), designed to disperse 36 anti-personnel mines over targeted areas. These munitions use a timed release mechanism, ejecting their payload from the rear of the shell mid-flight, enabling precise placement of temporary minefields. The mines are equipped with anti-disturbance triggers, deterring attempts to clear them, and feature a programmed self-destruct mechanism, ensuring they deactivate after a specific period to reduce post-conflict hazards. The key difference between the M692 and M731 lies in their active durations. The M692 is designed for short-term engagements, with mines that deactivate within 4 to 48 hours, making it ideal for rapidly shifting battlefield conditions. The M731, in contrast, deploys mines that remain active for up to 15 days, making it suitable for prolonged defensive operations or to hinder enemy reinforcements over extended periods. Both variants deploy M74 anti-personnel mines, ensuring high effectiveness against enemy infantry while reducing risks to civilians through their self-deactivation feature. Tactically, ADAMs provide commanders with a flexible tool for battlefield control, allowing for the creation of barriers or chokepoints without direct troop involvement. These munitions are effective for delaying enemy advances, securing flanks, or covering retreats. When used alongside anti-tank systems like the Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAMS), ADAMs contribute to a layered defense strategy that targets both infantry and armored units, forcing adversaries into predictable movement patterns that can be exploited by friendly forces. The potential inclusion of ADAMs follows a pattern in U.S. military support for Ukraine. The U.S. has already supplied Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAM) projectiles, the anti-tank counterpart to ADAMs, which disperse anti-tank mines in a similar manner. According to the Pentagon, more than 70,000 RAAM projectiles have been delivered to Ukraine alongside over three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds. The addition of ADAMs would represent a further evolution in Ukraine’s capability to employ artillery-delivered munitions in both defensive and offensive operations. Defense analysts have noted that the unspecified 155mm artillery shells listed in the aid package are consistent with the U.S.'s history of providing advanced munitions tailored to Ukraine’s battlefield needs. The ongoing shift in Russian tactics, including concentrated ground assaults and infantry advances, makes systems like ADAMs highly relevant. These munitions can be deployed to block or channel enemy troops, buying time for Ukrainian forces to regroup or counterattack. While ADAMs provide significant strategic benefits, their use also carries potential humanitarian implications. The U.S. has emphasized that any mines provided to Ukraine are to be used strictly within its territory and away from civilian areas. Additionally, the self-deactivating nature of ADAM mines is intended to mitigate risks to non-combatants, addressing some concerns raised by international human rights organizations. Although not officially confirmed, the possibility of ADAMs being part of the latest aid package underlines the U.S.'s commitment to equipping Ukraine with the tools necessary to defend its sovereignty. As the situation on the ground evolves, the focus remains on leveraging advanced munitions to counter the persistent threat posed by Russian forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-unspecified-155mm-shells-in-us-aid-suggest-delivery-of-adam-anti-personnel-mines-to-ukraine	2024-11-24T05:11:32-08:00	
France Confirms Full Commitment to Support Ukraine Including Use of SCALP Missiles Against Russia	During an interview with the BBC, the United Kingdom's national broadcaster and one of the world’s most respected news organizations, on November 23, 2024, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot affirmed that France recognizes no 'red lines' when it comes to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. Barrot stressed that Ukraine is within its rights to use French-supplied SCALP long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia as part of its self-defense. However, he refrained from confirming whether these French weapons had already been utilized in such operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A French SCALP long-range cruise missile mounted on a Ukrainian Su-24 strike aircraft symbolizes France's commitment to bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities in its conflict against Russian aggression.(Picture source: Ukraine MoD) The SCALP missile, known internationally as the Storm Shadow, is a highly advanced, long-range cruise missile developed by France and the United Kingdom. It has a range of over 250 kilometers and is equipped with precision-guided technology, allowing it to strike high-value targets with minimal collateral damage. Designed to evade enemy air defense systems, the SCALP missile is an invaluable asset for operations against heavily fortified or remote locations. It is fired from aircraft, and its stealth capabilities enable it to penetrate deep into enemy territory, making it a critical component of Ukraine's ability to disrupt Russian logistics and command centers. Since the beginning of the war in February 2022, Ukraine has received unprecedented military support from Western allies. This assistance has evolved from initial deliveries of small arms, ammunition, and humanitarian aid to the provision of advanced weaponry and training. Key contributions have included U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems, Patriot air-defense batteries, and artillery systems such as the French Caesar howitzers. Tanks, including the German Leopard 2 and British Challenger 2, have bolstered Ukraine's ground forces, while modern drones and counter-drone systems have enhanced its aerial capabilities. Additionally, NATO countries have provided training, logistical support, and intelligence-sharing to strengthen Ukraine’s resistance and its ability to conduct complex operations. Barrot’s comments come in the wake of the first confirmed strikes using U.S. and U.K. SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles on Russian soil, highlighting a turning point in the conflict. His remarks follow similar indications from French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this year, who suggested that French missiles could be used against Russian targets under the logic of self-defense. Barrot’s unequivocal stance now solidifies France’s position, reinforcing the message that arbitrary limitations will not constrain Western support for Ukraine. During his visit to London, where he held talks with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Barrot emphasized the importance of sustained and unrestricted aid for Ukraine. 'Western allies should not set and express red lines,' he declared, underlining the need for unity and determination among NATO members. This rhetoric aligns with France’s broader strategy of ensuring Ukraine has the resources necessary to counter Russian advances, while simultaneously preparing for a potentially prolonged conflict. The dramatic escalation of events on the ground underscores the significance of Barrot’s statement. Recent reports indicate that U.S. and U.K. SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles were used for the first time to target Russian military sites. Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly deployed a new type of missile, and President Vladimir Putin has warned of the risk of global conflict. These developments underscore the high stakes of maintaining robust Western support for Ukraine. France’s contributions are part of a broader NATO effort to sustain Ukraine’s resistance. Western nations are increasingly focused on long-term financial and military aid packages, with one source highlighting the need for a comprehensive 'war chest' to support Ukraine through 2025 and beyond. European countries are also considering intensified measures, such as seizing Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s defense. Additionally, intelligence suggests that Ukraine has been conducting effective drone operations, targeting Russian ammunition depots far behind enemy lines. In mid-September, drones reportedly destroyed four depots stocked with Russian and North Korean-supplied munitions, representing one of the most significant blows to Russia’s logistical network during the war. While it remains unclear whether these drones were provided by the U.K., France, or other allies, the strikes illustrate the growing sophistication of Ukraine’s capabilities, supported by Western technology and expertise. France’s unwavering support since the onset of the war has been instrumental in Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russian aggression. By removing so-called 'red lines' and providing advanced weaponry like the SCALP missile, France demonstrates its commitment to ensuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This approach, echoed by other Western nations, sends a clear message that the alliance is resolute in its determination to counter Russian aggression and support Ukraine for as long as it takes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-confirms-full-commitment-to-support-ukraine-including-use-of-scalp-missiles-against-russia	2024-11-24T04:11:49-08:00

This adaptability and reliability make NASAMS a preferred choice for many NATO and allied nations, including the United States and Norway, which have already delivered systems to Ukraine. The United States has provided two NASAMS batteries to Ukraine since 2022 and continues to commit additional units to bolster Ukraine's air defenses. With Canada now joining these efforts, the arrival of the NASAMS system in Ukraine represents a significant enhancement to its air defense capabilities amid escalating Russian air raids. NASAMS has become a preferred choice among NATO and allied countries for its reliability and effectiveness. The system has already been donated to Ukraine by other nations, including the United States and Norway, with the U.S. leading the effort by providing two NASAMS batteries in 2022 and committing to additional units as part of its military aid packages. Canada’s latest contribution builds on its ongoing support for Ukraine, which includes over 300 air defense missiles from Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) stockpiles, armored vehicles, artillery, drone cameras, and winter gear. These efforts are complemented by Operation UNIFIER, Canada’s training mission for Ukrainian forces, and logistical support from the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in transporting military aid from Canada and allied nations. As Ukraine continues to face intensified air raids from Russia, the NASAMS system is expected to enhance the country’s integrated air defense network significantly. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair emphasized Canada’s unwavering support, stating that Canada stands united with Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty and against Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable aggression. The addition of NASAMS to Ukraine’s arsenal is not only a testament to Canada’s solidarity but also part of a broader international effort to provide Ukraine with cutting-edge military technology to defend its sovereignty and protect its people.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/canada-donated-nasams-air-defense-missile-system-now-operational-in-ukraine	2024-11-23T02:04:27-08:00	
Breaking News: Russia Confirms Use of New Oreshnik Hypersonic Ballistic Missile in Ukraine Conflict	Citing a report by Russian media outlet Sputnik, on November 22, 2024, President Vladimir Putin stated that the new Russian-made Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile system had already been employed to target Ukraine, signaling its transition from development to active deployment. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A depiction of the potential impact of the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile, illustrating its devastating power and precision. Capable of carrying multiple independently targetable warheads, the missile’s Mach 10 speed and advanced technology make it a formidable challenge for modern missile defense systems. (Picture source: Russian Social Network VK) The announcement marks a significant milestone in modern military technology and follows a reported missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro just a day earlier, allegedly involving an RS-26 'Rubezh' ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile). While these claims remain unverified, the unveiling of Oreshnik underscores the central role of advanced missile systems in Russia’s current military doctrine, showcasing its focus on next-generation strategic and tactical weaponry. President Putin emphasized that Oreshnik is a wholly new development, not a modification of existing technology, and represents a culmination of work by Russia’s leading scientists. Capable of reaching speeds of Mach 10—ten times the speed of sound—Oreshnik is claimed to be virtually immune to current missile defense systems. Putin also highlighted its destructive potential, stating that, when used in a massive coordinated attack, its effectiveness rivals that of a strategic nuclear weapon. The system is reportedly capable of carrying multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to strike several distinct targets simultaneously with either conventional or nuclear warheads. A hypersonic ballistic missile like Oreshnik combines elements of both ballistic and hypersonic flight. Traditional ballistic missiles follow a high-arc trajectory and rely on sheer speed and altitude to evade interception. Hypersonic missiles, on the other hand, travel at sustained speeds exceeding Mach 5 and often employ advanced maneuvering capabilities to outpace and evade defense systems. Oreshnik appears to merge these features, achieving hypersonic speeds while maintaining ballistic properties, making it an especially challenging weapon for existing missile defenses to counter. The inclusion of MIRV technology further enhances the system's threat profile. MIRVs allow a single missile to carry multiple warheads, each capable of independent targeting upon re-entry into the atmosphere. This capability not only increases the efficiency of a single missile launch but also complicates interception efforts. A missile equipped with MIRVs can overwhelm missile defense systems by presenting multiple incoming warheads, effectively saturating defensive capabilities. With a reported range of approximately 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), Oreshnik is designed for versatility, suitable for both regional and long-range missions. Russian military sources have confirmed that it can deliver six to eight warheads per missile, underscoring its strategic value. According to Anatoly Matviychuk, a Russian military expert, the missile is likely already in service, given the scale of Russia's missile stockpiles and the decision to move forward with mass production. Putin also revealed that additional systems of similar design are currently being developed, with several prototypes being tested. These new systems aim to expand Russia's hypersonic missile arsenal, including medium- and shorter-range platforms, ensuring the country maintains its edge in this rapidly evolving domain of military technology. The Oreshnik system’s announcement comes amid reports of an intensifying conflict in Eastern Europe, with missile technology playing a growing role. The alleged strike on Dnipro by the RS-26 'Rubezh' raises concerns about deploying such advanced systems in active conflict zones. If confirmed, the use of these weapons would mark a significant escalation, emphasizing the need for renewed international dialogue on arms control. The global implications of the Oreshnik missile are profound. Its claimed ability to evade interception while delivering devastating payloads poses a challenge to nations reliant on advanced missile defense systems. The inclusion of MIRVs adds an additional layer of complexity, making it a key component in Russia’s strategic deterrence arsenal. As tensions continue to rise, the deployment of hypersonic weapons like Oreshnik underscores the urgent need for international efforts to address the emerging challenges of hypersonic and MIRV-equipped ballistic technologies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-russia-confirms-use-of-oreshnik-hypersonic-ballistic-missile-in-ukraine-conflict	2024-11-22T10:11:30-08:00

US Navy seeks industry input for development of Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile SLCM-N	According to information published by the US government on November 15, 2024, the US Navy has issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the development of a Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N). The program is designed to create a modular and survivable cruise missile system that provides a proportional response and ensures critical adversary targets remain at risk. This initiative aims to field an operational system by FY 2034, with prototype demonstrations expected within the next three years.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy advances its nuclear deterrence strategy with the development of the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N), aiming for rapid prototyping and operational deployment by FY 2034. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The SLCM-N will be deployed aboard Virginia-class attack submarines and built around an 'All Up Round' (AUR) concept. This encompasses an expendable booster, a nuclear-capable cruise missile, and a launch canister, enabling underwater launches from Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) or Virginia Payload Modules (VPM). The Navy’s approach emphasizes leveraging mature technologies and a modular open systems design to reduce development timelines and control costs while maintaining the flexibility for future upgrades. The United States first introduced nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles in the mid-1980s with the deployment of the TLAM-N, a nuclear variant of the Tomahawk Land-Attack Missile. These missiles were stationed on both surface ships and attack submarines, offering a range of approximately 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles). In 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced the withdrawal of all sea-based tactical nuclear weapons, leading to the removal of TLAM-N missiles by mid-1992. The Navy retained the option to redeploy them on attack submarines if necessary. However, in 2010, the Obama Administration recommended retiring the TLAM-N system, deeming it redundant given other available nuclear capabilities. The retirement was completed in 2013. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) under the Trump Administration proposed developing a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, now known as SLCM-N. This initiative aimed to provide a 'non-strategic regional presence' and address the need for 'flexible and low-yield options' in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The SLCM-N was intended to strengthen deterrence against regional adversaries and reassure U.S. allies. In its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request, the Biden Administration allocated funds for research and development of the SLCM-N. However, the 2022 NPR recommended canceling the program, suggesting that existing capabilities were sufficient to meet deterrence requirements. Despite this, Congress continued to provide funding for the SLCM-N and its warhead. The Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated the executive branch to ensure the initial operational capability of the SLCM-N. Subsequently, the Administration has taken steps to implement the program. Proponents of the SLCM-N argue that it offers a flexible and survivable nuclear option, capable of being deployed in various regions without the need for forward-basing nuclear assets on allied territories.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-seeks-industry-input-for-development-of-nuclear-armed-sea-launched-cruise-missile-slcm-n	2024-11-22T05:46:13-08:00

French Navy's Jacques Chevallier Replenishment Ship Officially Enters Active Service	According to information published by the French MoD on November 21, 2024, Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, Chief of Staff of the French Navy, officially declared the Force Replenishment Ship (BRF) Jacques Chevallier operational. Based in Toulon, the vessel is now fully ready for deployment at the order of the Chief of Defense Staff.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BRF Jacques Chevallier is now in active service, contributing to the French Navy's operational support and readiness. (Picture source: French MoD) The Jacques Chevallier is the first in a series of four BRFs designed to modernize and enhance the French Navy's logistical capabilities. It will be joined by its sister ship, the Jacques Stosskopf, in 2026, which was launched in August 2024, followed by two additional vessels in 2028 and 2033. These ships will progressively replace the older Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR). The BRFs are central to the extensive capacity renewal efforts outlined in France's previous Military Programming Law (LPM) and further reinforced under the 2024–2030 LPM. As part of the FlotLog program, these ships ensure the fleet's operational readiness and endurance during long-term deployments. They play a critical role in supporting the fleet’s operational effectiveness by delivering essential supplies, including fuel, munitions, provisions, and technical support. These capabilities enable the BRFs to sustain the carrier strike group centered around the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle or other units involved in strategic deterrence missions. Since its delivery by the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA) on July 18, 2023, the Jacques Chevallier has demonstrated exceptional performance in diverse environments. It has spent 193 days away from its home port, including 153 days at sea, taking part in inter-service training and high-intensity exercises with allied navies. A highlight of its early operations was its participation in the AKILA mission, integrated into the carrier strike group during Mediterranean deployments. The ship has proven its operational flexibility, successfully performing complex resupply missions. Notably, on June 24, 2024, it conducted a sophisticated ammunition replenishment maneuver in coordination with a Multi-Mission Frigate (FREMM). Replenishment ships are the backbone of any blue-water navy, enabling sustained operations far from home ports. They provide essential support in terms of fuel, munitions, spare parts, and provisions, ensuring that frontline combat units, such as aircraft carriers, frigates, and submarines, can remain at sea for extended periods. For the French Navy, which aspires to maintain its position as a global maritime power, replenishment ships are critical. The Navy's capacity to deploy its carrier strike group, centered on the Charles de Gaulle, hinges on a robust and reliable logistical support system. These ships are equally vital for France’s strategic deterrence, as they support submarines and surface ships involved in the country’s nuclear deterrence missions. However, for years, France's fleet of replenishment ships has been insufficient, outdated, and overstretched, limiting the Navy's ability to operate effectively in multiple theaters simultaneously. France's existing Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR), introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, have struggled to meet the demands of a modern blue-water navy. The Somme, Marne, and Var—the three remaining BCRs—are nearing the end of their operational lives. These ships lack the fuel and cargo capacity to support modern naval operations, particularly for high-intensity deployments involving the carrier strike group or multinational coalitions. The limited number of replenishment ships has forced the Navy to prioritize missions, often at the expense of flexibility. The BCRs have been tasked with supporting operations in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and occasionally the Indo-Pacific, stretching their capabilities and availability. This overstretch has led to increased maintenance needs and reduced readiness. The French Navy has faced significant delays in renewing its replenishment fleet. While the need for modern replenishment ships was identified over a decade ago, financial constraints and shifting defense priorities delayed the launch of the FlotLog program.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navys-jacques-chevallier-replenishment-ship-officially-enters-active-service	2024-11-22T04:42:18-08:00

The E-130J, previously referred to as the E-XX, is poised to replace the venerable E-6B Mercury, becoming the backbone of the Navy’s Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) mission.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lockheed Martin unveils the first C-130J-30 Super Hercules for the U.S. Navy's E-130J program, set to redefine strategic airborne communications for the TACAMO mission. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program is a transformative step in modernizing its airborne strategic communications, replacing the aging fleet of E-6B Mercury aircraft. The E-6B, built on the Boeing 707 airframe, has been a cornerstone of the Navy's 'Take Charge and Move Out' (TACAMO) mission since the 1980s. This mission ensures resilient and secure communication links between national command authorities and strategic ballistic missile submarines. However, with the closure of the Boeing 707 production line and increasing maintenance costs, the Navy has faced growing challenges in sustaining the E-6B fleet. The E-130J program addresses these issues by leveraging the modern and reliable Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Super Hercules as its foundation. This airframe was selected after rigorous evaluations under the Navy’s E-XX program, with the decision driven by the C-130J’s proven operational history, manufacturing sustainability, and ability to meet the demanding TACAMO mission requirements. The C-130J’s enhanced payload capacity, extended range, and advanced avionics systems make it an ideal platform for long-duration, mission-critical operations. In October 2024, the U.S. Navy officially designated this new platform as the E-130J. Lockheed Martin began assembling the first E-130J aircraft at its Marietta, Georgia facility shortly thereafter. The program's timeline aims for initial delivery by 2026, with additional units to follow in subsequent years. The Navy plans to procure between eight and twelve E-130J aircraft to fully replace the E-6B fleet, ensuring continuity of operations and enhanced performance. The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program, built on the C-130J-30 Super Hercules airframe, aligns with a global trend among nations to enhance strategic airborne command and control platforms, particularly for missions critical to national defense and continuity of government operations. While the United States is transitioning to this medium-sized, highly adaptable platform, other countries have opted for varying strategies based on their unique requirements, technological bases, and military doctrines. Russia’s primary airborne command and control aircraft are the Ilyushin Il-80 (NATO reporting name: Maxdome) and its smaller counterpart, the Il-82. These aircraft function as 'doomsday planes,' ensuring continuity of operations during nuclear or large-scale conflicts. Based on the Il-86 passenger aircraft platform, the Il-80 is heavily modified with advanced Very Low Frequency (VLF) communication systems to maintain secure communication with Russia’s nuclear forces, similar to the TACAMO role of the U.S. E-130J. The Il-80 is equipped with nuclear blast-resistant shielding, no external windows (other than the cockpit), and advanced onboard command systems capable of coordinating military forces in a crisis. Its larger size compared to the C-130J-30 offers greater payload capacity for extensive onboard communication suites and command equipment. However, this bulkier design limits operational versatility and requires substantial runway infrastructure, in contrast to the E-130J’s ability to operate from shorter, less-developed airstrips. China has adopted its domestically produced Y-20 Kunpeng strategic transport aircraft as the basis for a new generation of airborne command and control platforms. These modified Y-20s focus on integrating advanced communication systems that enable strategic coordination between the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) branches, particularly in operations requiring nuclear deterrence or rapid-response military mobilization. The Y-20 platform provides China with a dual-use capability, functioning both as a strategic transport and as an airborne command post. While the Y-20’s larger payload capacity and longer range provide advantages for hosting extensive command systems, its size may limit deployment flexibility, especially in contested regions where runway availability is constrained. India’s Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&amp;CS), primarily based on the Embraer ERJ 145 platform, represents a different approach. While primarily designed for surveillance and reconnaissance, these aircraft are also equipped with command and control capabilities, allowing them to serve dual purposes in strategic missions. India has also developed the DRDO AEW&amp;CS, an indigenous system designed to complement its Embraer-based fleet, with expanded roles for strategic communication. The AEW&amp;CS platforms offer cost-effective solutions compared to the larger aircraft used by the U.S., Russia, or China, but their smaller size and limited range reduce their utility for extended strategic missions such as TACAMO.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/lockheed-martin-prepares-1st-c-130j-30-super-hercules-aircraft-for-us-navy-strategic-mission	2024-11-22T01:32:33-08:00

Houthis Target Turkish-Owned Ship Allegedly Tied to Israel Trade	According to information published by Tasnim on November 19, 2024, the Anadolu S, managed by Istanbul-based Oras Shipping, avoided damage from two missile strikes while navigating near Yemen’s Mocha port and later southeast of Aden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Anadolu S sails through the tense waters of the Red Sea, narrowly avoiding missile strikes amidst escalating geopolitical tensions fueled by allegations of trade with Israel.. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, accusing the vessel’s owners of breaching their declared trade ban with Israel. This incident forms part of a broader Houthi initiative targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, launched after the group imposed a blockade on companies trading with Israel in May 2024. The Anadolu S is operated by Oras Shipping, a company owned by Salih Zeki Çakır, a close associate of Yıldırım and an influential figure in Turkish shipping. Çakır’s ventures, reportedly linked to trade with Israel, have drawn scrutiny amid public anti-Israel rhetoric from Turkey’s government. Türkiye-Israel relations Turkey and Israel have shared a complex and fluctuating relationship since Turkey became the first Muslim-majority nation to recognize Israel in 1949. Over the decades, their interactions have oscillated between cooperation and tension, deeply influenced by regional conflicts and domestic political dynamics. In the latter half of the 20th century, Turkey and Israel developed significant military and economic ties. Israel provided substantial military assistance to Turkey, including the modernization of Turkish F-4 Phantom and Northrop F-5 aircraft and the upgrade of Turkey’s main battle tank, the Israeli-made Sabra. Naval and aerial cooperation also strengthened bilateral ties, with mutual training and operational coordination in shared exercises. The relationship began to strain in the late 2000s, particularly after the 2008–09 Gaza War. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan openly criticized Israel's actions in Gaza, leading to increased tension. Relations hit a low point after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. The incident prompted Turkey to downgrade diplomatic ties and suspend military cooperation with Israel. Efforts to mend relations began in 2013, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the flotilla incident, paving the way for reconciliation. By 2022, diplomatic ties were fully restored with the reappointment of ambassadors, marking a renewed focus on regional stability and economic collaboration. However, recent conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon have reignited tensions. Turkish President Erdoğan has sharply criticized Israel’s military actions. This has led to a series of measures from Turkey, including the suspension of trade relations in mid-2024 and the denial of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane access to Turkish airspace during a diplomatic trip. Most significantly, in November 2024, President Erdoğan announced that Turkey had severed all relations with Israel, signaling a potential long-term rupture in their diplomatic and economic engagement.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/houthis-target-turkish-owned-ship-allegedly-tied-to-israel-trade	2024-11-21T07:53:32-08:00

US Admiral Raises Doubts Over North Korea’s Nuclear Strike Capabilities	On November 19, 2024, Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, stated that North Korea’s numerous tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) have yet to demonstrate the capability to successfully deliver a nuclear warhead to the U.S. mainland. He made this observation during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This photo, taken on November 18, 2022, shows North Korea's new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the 'Hwasong Gun 17,' before its launch at Pyongyang International Airport (Picture source: KCNA) North Korea recently conducted a test flight of its Hwasong-19 missile, the largest ICBM developed by the regime to date. According to Admiral Paparo, the test indicated the missile’s ability to reach the entire continental United States. However, when questioned about North Korea's capability to pair a nuclear warhead with an ICBM capable of enduring the stresses of launch, flight, and atmospheric reentry, Paparo clarified that such a capability has not yet been observed. He added that continued testing is evident in efforts to achieve this goal. Under Kim Jong Un’s leadership, North Korea has accelerated its missile and nuclear weapons development programs while adopting increasingly hostile rhetoric toward South Korea. Simultaneously, the regime has emerged as a strategic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. Following the latest missile test, the state-run Korean Central News Agency described the Hwasong-19 as the 'ultimate version' of an ICBM intended for deployment by North Korea’s strategic forces. Admiral Paparo’s remarks align with earlier assessments by U.S. officials, offering a cautious view of the threat posed by Pyongyang’s missile advancements. In 2022, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan highlighted uncertainties regarding North Korea’s ability to successfully pair a nuclear warhead with an ICBM, fire it, and strike a precise target in the United States. Nonetheless, such uncertainties do not negate the broader threats posed by North Korea to U.S. interests. Over decades, Pyongyang has amassed an extensive arsenal of millions of artillery shells and thousands of rockets positioned north of the border with South Korea, where nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed. Furthermore, North Korea has demonstrated its ability to launch missiles over Japan, a key U.S. ally in the region. Kim Jong Un continues to pledge enhancements to North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, citing the need to counter threats posed by the security alliance among the United States and its regional allies. This week, North Korean state media reported Kim’s accusations against the U.S., Japan, and South Korea for destabilizing the Korean Peninsula and the broader region. Kim referred to the alliance as an 'Asian version of NATO' and asserted that these nations would bear responsibility for undermining peace and stability. North Korea has made significant strides in ICBM development. In July 2017, it conducted its first test of the Hwasong-14, followed in November 2017 by the Hwasong-15. These missiles, with estimated ranges of approximately 10,400 km and 8,500–13,000 km respectively, place the entire U.S. mainland within potential reach. In October 2024, Pyongyang tested the Hwasong-19, its largest ICBM to date. The missile reached a record altitude of 7,000 km and flew for 87 minutes, demonstrating a range sufficient to cover the U.S. mainland. However, analysts have raised concerns about the practicality of this missile in a conflict scenario due to its significant size, which could limit its mobility and make it more vulnerable to preemptive strikes. Despite these advancements, questions persist about North Korea’s ability to effectively integrate a nuclear warhead with an ICBM capable of withstanding the rigorous conditions of launch, flight, and atmospheric reentry. While progress is evident, U.S. officials have noted that a full demonstration of this capability has yet to occur.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-admiral-raises-doubts-over-north-koreas-nuclear-strike-capabilities	2024-11-21T05:38:54-08:00

Exclusive: French Army Tests British Jetpack Flying Soldier Concept Following Trials by British Special Forces	During the National Infantry Days in Canjuers, Var, the French Army unveiled a new experiment highlighting its interest in cutting-edge technology: the 'flying soldier' concept. This initiative, part of an ongoing effort to enhance the operational capabilities of troops, underscores the importance of new mobility solutions on the battlefield. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Army unveiled a new experiment highlighting its interest in cutting-edge technology. (Picture source: French MoD) The project is not entirely new. In 2019, the Flyboard Air had already garnered attention. Its military potential led the Defense Innovation Agency (AID) to grant a subsidy of €1.3 million to adapt this device to operational constraints. Concurrently, the French Aerospace Lab (ONERA) was involved in its development. Equipped with six engines, four of which deliver 250 horsepower each, the Flyboard Air can reach an altitude of 10,000 feet, thanks to advanced algorithms. In 2021, Florence Parly, then Minister of the Armed Forces, announced that the special forces would experiment with a flying platform derived from this system. The Special Operations Command (COS) viewed this device as an opportunity for infiltration and exfiltration missions. However, enthusiasm for the project waned after an accident during a demonstration over Lake Biscarrosse in 2022. In 2019, the British Royal Marines tested a jetpack developed by Gravity Industries, introducing a new approach to maritime boarding operations. This system is based on an exoskeleton equipped with five micro-gas turbines—two mounted on each arm and one on the back—generating a total thrust of 144 kilograms and combined power exceeding 1,000 horsepower. This configuration enables flight speeds of over 80 km/h and a maximum altitude of 3,000 meters, although operational flights are usually conducted at lower altitudes for safety and efficiency. The Gravity Industries jetpack was designed to provide rapid and flexible mobility, particularly in maritime environments where boarding moving ships poses significant challenges. During tests, an operator launched from a fast boat flew over the sea, and landed on a target ship’s deck within seconds, showcasing the system's ability to reduce infiltration time and minimize exposure to threats. However, integrating this technology into the armed forces raises questions about ergonomics and combat operability. The jetpack, weighing approximately 27 kilograms without fuel, can limit a soldier's range of motion and complicate the use of standard weaponry. Additionally, the limited flight duration—typically between three and four minutes depending on conditions and payload—requires precise mission planning to avoid situations where the operator could run out of fuel in hostile areas. Despite these challenges, the Royal Marines' tests demonstrated the jetpack’s potential for specific operations requiring speed and surprise. Observing these developments, the French Army is evaluating the adaptation of such technologies to meet its own operational needs, while considering the ergonomic and tactical constraints inherent in their use on the ground. The French Army justified these tests by emphasizing the importance of identifying real needs and determining how to leverage these technologies to enhance combat effectiveness. Light brigade regiments, in particular, seek to bolster their mobility and offensive capabilities, especially in challenging environments such as mountainous and airborne zones. The French Army Chief of Staff, General Pierre Schill, highlighted the key issue of these innovations: their utility for field units and their scalability across the entire army. While some solutions may be suitable for special forces, adopting them on a broader scale remains a significant challenge.The integration of a jetpack into the French infantry enhances operational capabilities by providing unparalleled mobility and flexibility on the battlefield. This technology would enable rapid deployment across challenging terrains such as mountains or urban environments, bypassing natural and man-made obstacles with ease. In high-stakes missions, jetpacks could facilitate swift infiltration and exfiltration, reducing the time soldiers spend exposed to enemy fire. While challenges remain regarding endurance and weapon operability, the potential for these devices to augment the speed, agility, and tactical options of French infantry units underscores their strategic value in modern warfare. This experimentation reflects the French Army’s commitment to innovation in addressing the challenges of modern conflicts. Despite existing technical and operational obstacles, the 'flying soldier' concept demonstrates a forward-looking vision, where technology and operational performance converge to strengthen the capabilities of the French armed forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/french-army-follows-british-royal-marines-in-testing-jetpack-and-flying-soldier-concept	2024-11-21T01:30:43-08:00

China reinforces artillery capabilities with new Dongfeng EQ2050 rocket launcher variant	As reported by the Telegram account China Army on November 19, 2024, Dongfeng EQ2050 armored vehicles in service with the PLA Western Command have been observed equipped with a rotating 16-barrel rocket launcher. Recent reports suggest that China is testing the integration of various combat modules and rocket launcher systems on existing vehicles. This operational approach emphasizes mobility and maneuverability, enabling rapid deployment: vehicles arrive, fire, and promptly vacate the position.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This new MLRS could enable the remote deployment of smoke munitions to obscure troop movements or provide cover during air raids, as well as launching incendiary munitions to target personnel or equipment. (Picture source: Telegram/China Army) This multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) appears related to an earlier version observed in 2020. During a live-fire artillery exercise conducted by the 77th Group Army at an altitude of 4,500 meters, a 16-tube rocket launcher was mounted on a Mengshi chassis. The launcher was identified as part of the chemical defense units. The Mengshi chassis, introduced in 2008, has a top speed of 130 kilometers per hour, a range exceeding 600 kilometers, and the ability to climb 60% grades. While widely used across the PLA, it is being phased out in some roles due to relatively weak armor. The launcher platform includes a stabilizing jack at the rear to ensure firing stability. The 16-tube rocket launcher consists of two rows of fixed directional tubes mounted on a turntable with electric elevation and steering mechanisms. It supports both manual and remote aiming, as evidenced by videos showing soldiers using a manual sight and an LCD screen for targeting. The platform utilizes the Dongfeng Mengshi chassis and is primarily linked to chemical defense operations, deploying explosive, incendiary, and smoke munitions. The system's design is based on the FHJ01 62mm individual rocket launcher, first developed in 1983 and introduced into service in 1985. The FHJ01 features a double-tube design and is equipped with optical sights for engaging targets within 500 meters. It can fire three types of rockets: the FYD02 smoke bomb, the FRS02 incendiary bomb, and the 84-type incendiary bomb. The FYD02 creates a 25-meter-wide smoke screen lasting over 30 seconds, interfering with infrared targeting and causing physical irritation. The FRS02 contains a flammable agent with a burn radius exceeding 8 meters, while the 84-type delivers phosphorus-based effects over an 80-square-meter area. These rockets share similar structures, including safety fuses and folding tail fins. The Mengshi-based launcher extends the range and accuracy of these munitions beyond the original FHJ01’s 800-meter range. Modifications include lengthened directional tubes and enhanced rocket engines, improving precision. A 2012 military newspaper article highlighted tests of vehicle-mounted chemical defense rockets, which aimed to improve mobility and response times. The platform was designed to integrate legacy handheld rockets into a vehicle-mounted system. Advancements have also been made in ammunition technology. Researchers developed a combustion agent to address incomplete fuel combustion at low temperatures and introduced an electronic time fuze. This fuze calculates detonation timing automatically, enhancing accuracy and operational flexibility. Operational footage shows the rocket launcher being deployed during exercises, including those conducted by the Tibet Military Region. One video revealed a technical issue where a roof hatch was not properly secured during firing, resulting in misalignment. However, the rockets’ safety mechanisms prevented further complications. The platform enables the remote deployment of smoke munitions to obscure troop movements or provide cover during air raids. It can also launch incendiary munitions to target personnel or equipment. However, the system’s range and rocket caliber remain limited. Adjustments to these parameters could enhance its utility in future operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-reinforces-artillery-capabilities-with-new-dongfeng-eq2050-rocket-launcher-variant	2024-11-20T07:10:22-08:00

Analysis | Did China copy the US SR-71 Blackbird with the new Yunxing supersonic aircraft?	As reported by the South China Morning Post on October 28, 2024, a Chinese aerospace company, Space Transportation, has reported progress in developing its supersonic passenger aircraft, the Yunxing. The aircraft is designed to transport passengers from Beijing to New York in two hours, cruising at speeds of Mach 4—double the speed of the Concorde, which retired in 2003. However, the Yunxing's design bears a striking resemblance to the SR-71 Blackbird, the renowned American reconnaissance aircraft retired in 1998, raising questions about its intended use and suitability for commercial operations, even for sub-orbital spaceflight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Like the SR-71 Blackbird, the Yunxing's structure is composed of lightweight, high-strength composite materials, designed to withstand extreme conditions, such as aerodynamic heating that can raise surface temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. (Picture source: Lingkong Tianxing Technology) The Yunxing's structure is composed of lightweight, high-strength composite materials, designed to withstand extreme conditions, such as aerodynamic heating that can raise surface temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its high lift-to-drag ratio is intended to ensure efficient performance even at high altitudes, contributing to its commercial and operational potential. Unlike traditional horizontal takeoff and landing aircraft, the Yunxing employs vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. This feature, combined with its ability to ascend to altitudes exceeding 20,000 meters, enables it to bypass traditional runway constraints and potentially operate from smaller, urban airport facilities. The company has depicted this process through animations showing the aircraft being launched by booster rockets, gliding at high speeds, and decelerating through a combination of subsonic flight and liquid rocket engines before landing vertically. Founded in 2018, Space Transportation, also known as Lingkong Tianxing Technology, operates from multiple locations across China, including Beijing, Xi'an, and Anhui, with a testing facility in Xinjiang. The company collaborates with universities and research institutions and has contributed to projects like the 'Feitian-1' hypersonic vehicle in 2022. While primarily focused on supersonic passenger aircraft, Space Transportation is also developing suborbital space tourism platforms and hypersonic vehicles for military and research purposes. Analysts speculate that its passenger-oriented projects might serve as a cover for potential military applications, such as high-altitude reconnaissance platforms or vehicles for anti-satellite weaponry. These theories are supported by the advanced aerospace technologies integrated into the project, combining aerodynamic efficiency, thermal protection, and precise control systems. Until now, there was no publicly available information indicating that China has developed or is developing a direct replica of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft known for its high-speed and high-altitude capabilities. However, China has been advancing its own high-speed reconnaissance and surveillance technologies. The People's Liberation Army Air Force has introduced the WZ-8, an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of high-altitude, high-speed reconnaissance missions. Launched from an H-6 bomber, the WZ-8 is reported to achieve speeds exceeding Mach 3, comparable to the SR-71's performance. China has also been investing in hypersonic technology, involving speeds greater than the speed of sound, another point of convergence with the development of the SR-71 Blackbird. The development of hypersonic glide vehicles and missiles suggests a focus on advancing capabilities in high-speed flight, potentially applicable to future reconnaissance platforms. Notable developments include the DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, capable of speeds between Mach 5 and Mach 10, and performing evasive maneuvers during flight. The DF-ZF likely became operational around October 2019. In November 2024, during the China Airshow in Zhuhai, China unveiled the GDF-600 hypersonic glide vehicle, developed by the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy. The GDF-600 can reach speeds up to Mach 7 and is designed to carry various payloads, including submunitions, drones, and unmanned aerial systems. The Yunxing's sleek design, with its pointed nose and twin-engine configuration, evokes a close resemblance to the SR-71's streamlined structure, optimized for high-speed performance and minimal radar signature. (Picture source: Lingkong Tianxing Technology) Additionally, China has been enhancing its anti-satellite capabilities through the use of kinetic kill vehicles (KKVs), which are designed to destroy targets through direct collision, relying on kinetic energy rather than explosive warheads. In 2007, China conducted an anti-satellite test by launching a ballistic missile carrying a kinetic kill vehicle that destroyed the defunct Fengyun-1C weather satellite at an altitude of 865 kilometers. This demonstrated China's capability to eliminate satellites in low Earth orbit using kinetic energy. China has also developed the HQ-19 anti-ballistic missile interceptor, equipped with a dual-purpose exoatmospheric kinetic kill vehicle warhead, designed to engage both ballistic missile warheads and satellites. There is therefore nothing to stop China from developing a new, more discreet and faster means of launching a KKV in the event of war, which could further enhance the strategic value of the Yunxing. In the United States, Lockheed Martin continues to work on the SR-72, the anticipated hypersonic successor to the SR-71 Blackbird. On July 29, 2024, reports indicated that Lockheed Martin’s classified program, likely related to the SR-72 hypersonic aircraft, encountered a budget overrun of $45 million in the second quarter of 2024. Total losses associated with this unnamed classified program have now reached approximately $335 million since 2022, reflecting financial challenges during the project's development. These budget overruns suggest that Lockheed Martin is making substantial investments in the SR-72 project, potentially advancing it toward operational status. The company has acknowledged uncertainties involved in such programs, emphasizing variability in cost and time estimates, along with technical challenges typical of advanced aerospace projects. Evidence of the SR-72's progression includes the expansion of Lockheed’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, where advanced manufacturing techniques like 3D printing of composite structures are employed. The workforce at Lockheed’s Palmdale facility has expanded significantly, with over 5,500 employees reported as of September 2023, more than doubling since 2018. The SR-72 is expected to be powered by a turbine-based combined cycle engine, integrating a traditional turbine engine with a scramjet. This configuration allows it to transition from subsonic to hypersonic speeds, potentially reaching Mach 6—twice the speed of the SR-71. Designed to serve as both an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance asset and a strike platform, the SR-72 could provide the U.S. military with enhanced capabilities in both reconnaissance and strike operations, with an expected service entry by 2030. The officially-civilian Lockheed Martin’s X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology experimental aircraft has also reached a development milestone with its first engine run at the Skunk Works facility. Announced by NASA on November 6, 2024, the X-59 aims to reduce the noise impact of supersonic flight over land, potentially informing future regulations for commercial supersonic travel. The aircraft is designed to produce a quieter sonic effect, described as a 'thump,' even at supersonic speeds. Testing of the X-59 may provide data and engineering insights relevant to the SR-72's development, particularly in areas like high-speed aerodynamics, structural integrity at high speeds, and managing thermal and acoustic effects associated with hypersonic flight. The SR-71 Blackbird was developed as a black project by Lockheed's Skunk Works division in the 1960s, based on the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft.

By October 2024, the Italian detachment had logged over 500 flight hours and conducted 20 Alpha Scrambles (alert launches under QRA missions), underscoring its significant contribution to NATO airspace security in the Baltic region. The successful air-to-ground exercises carried out by Italian Eurofighters as part of the Baltic Air Policing mission underline NATO’s increasing focus on strengthening integrated force capabilities. These exercises not only improve tactical interoperability with allies but also demonstrate the Italian Typhoon’s ability to meet a wide range of operational requirements. As the mission progresses, the Aeronautica Militare continues to play a key role in securing NATO airspace and contributing to collective defense in Eastern Europe. This milestone reinforces Italy's commitment to NATO and its operational readiness to face emerging security challenges. The Eurofighter Typhoon originated in the 1980s, a period when European air forces faced the need to modernize their aging fleets of fighter aircraft. At the time, operational aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, F-104 Starfighter, Mirage III, and Tornado F3 ADV were becoming obsolete and unable to meet the demands of modern conflicts. Designed during the Cold War, these aircraft could no longer guarantee air superiority or perform multi-role missions effectively. To address this need, five European nations—Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and France—launched a joint program in 1983, called the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). The goal was to develop an advanced fighter capable of bolstering collective defense capabilities while sharing costs and fostering industrial cooperation across Europe. However, disagreements soon emerged among the partners. France, in particular, sought an aircraft tailored to its specific national needs, including naval missions. In 1985, France withdrew from the project to develop the Dassault Rafale, while the other four nations continued with the design of the aircraft based on common specifications. The development of the Eurofighter Typhoon was structured around specific needs for each nation. Germany aimed to replace its F-4 Phantom II, the United Kingdom intended to retire its Tornado F3 ADV, and Italy and Spain sought to modernize their fleets of F-104 Starfighters and Mirage III. After a decade of negotiations and technical work, the four countries signed a production contract in 1998 for an initial total of 620 aircraft, proportionally distributed. The aircraft's manufacturing was entrusted to a consortium of industries, including BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo, ensuring an equitable distribution of tasks among the partners. Deliveries of the Eurofighter Typhoon began in 2003. This advanced aircraft quickly became a cornerstone of European air forces, undertaking missions in air defense, deterrence, and allied support. Today, it stands as a testament to successful European technological collaboration despite the challenges encountered during its development.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/italian-typhoons-conduct-first-air-to-ground-training-in-lithuania-as-part-of-baltic-air-policing	2024-11-20T06:30:28-08:00

Before docking, HMS Queen Elizabeth collaborated with the German Navy and Army helicopters, including NH90 and Navy Lynx Mk88, conducting deck landing operations on the carrier’s vast flight deck. Comments During a hypothetical conflict with Russia, the carrier's primary purpose would be to project power, provide air superiority, and secure critical sea lanes vital for sustaining NATO's logistical and operational frameworks. Its F-35B Lightning II aircraft could conduct precision strikes on Russian military targets, perform reconnaissance, and provide close air support to NATO ground forces in Germany and Eastern Europe. Positioning the carrier in the North Sea would offer a safer operational environment, allowing it to launch sustained air operations while remaining outside the immediate range of Russia's A2/AD capabilities, such as Kaliningrad's S-400 systems and Iskander missiles. However, deploying it into the Baltic Sea would provide more direct support to Germany and frontline NATO states, though at the cost of heightened exposure to Russian missile and naval threats. As part of a carrier strike group, the HMS Queen Elizabeth would enhance NATO’s maritime dominance, leveraging its escorts—destroyers, frigates, and submarines—to counter Russian naval movements and secure strategic maritime corridors. However, this deployment would not be without risks. The carrier’s proximity to Russian territory could make it a high-value target for missile strikes and hybrid warfare tactics, such as cyberattacks aimed at disrupting its operations. Extended missions would also strain logistical networks, requiring access to well-secured ports in northern Germany or allied states for resupply and maintenance.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uk-germany-military-ties-deepened-as-aircraft-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth-visits-hamburg	2024-11-20T04:14:49-08:00

Additionally, this purchase does not include industrial, economic, or technological compensation (offset) clauses, unlike previous Brazilian military acquisitions such as the F-39 Gripen fighter and H-36 Caracal helicopter projects. Maintenance capabilities for Sikorsky helicopters in Brazil have been a longstanding issue. The manufacturer does not operate a dedicated maintenance center in the country, instead relying on logistics support contracts and authorized workshops. This differs from competitors like Airbus and Leonardo, which have more comprehensive local support facilities. The acquisition follows a history of Black Hawk operations in Brazil. The first four UH-60L Black Hawks were delivered to the Brazilian Army in 1997 for peacekeeping missions. Additional deliveries included six configured for special forces and search-and-rescue in 2008, followed by ten more in 2009, with deliveries continuing through 2011. The new helicopters will be distributed across Army Aviation Battalions in Taubaté, Campo Grande, and Manaus, replacing older aircraft to support a range of missions. Earlier in 2024, a delegation led by Army General Flávio Marcus Lancia Barbosa visited the U.S. Army Materiel Command, Sikorsky, and the Brazilian Army Commission in Washington to finalize details of the acquisition. The delegation coordinated with U.S. agencies to ensure the terms of the Government-to-Government (G2G) purchase met operational needs. Furthermore, this acquisition reflects the Brazilian Army’s ongoing modernization of its aviation fleet, with the delivery of the UH-60M helicopters aiming to enhance operational capabilities across its units. The helicopters are expected to provide continuity in roles previously fulfilled by the UH-60L and AS532UE fleets, including troop transport, medical evacuation, and support for special operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/brazil-to-start-receiving-new-us-uh-60m-black-hawk-helicopters-in-2025	2024-11-18T03:31:26-08:00

Unlike its predecessors, which use ski-jump ramps for aircraft launches, the Fujian features electromagnetic catapult systems (EMALS). These systems enable heavier and more fuel-laden aircraft like the J-35 to launch with greater efficiency, enhancing their range, payload, and operational flexibility. The deployment of the J-35 is a direct response to China’s growing strategic challenges in the Indo-Pacific. As tensions rise over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, the PLAN’s ability to project power and defend its claims becomes increasingly important. The J-35 positions China to counter regional adversaries and rival powers, particularly the United States. The U.S. Navy’s F-35C, a carrier-based fifth-generation fighter, has long been regarded as the gold standard for naval aviation. By introducing the J-35, China aims to bridge the technological gap and demonstrate its ability to compete on equal footing. Moreover, the J-35 could influence the balance of power in regional security arrangements. For instance, nations aligned with the U.S., such as Japan and South Korea, may be compelled to enhance their naval capabilities in response to China’s advancements. This dynamic is likely to intensify the ongoing arms race in the region. While the J-35 represents a major technological achievement, its integration into the PLAN is not without challenges. The fighter’s performance and reliability in real-world carrier operations remain untested. Another challenge is ensuring the seamless coordination of the J-35 with other elements of the PLAN’s carrier strike groups. This includes integrating the fighter’s advanced capabilities with China’s emerging naval network, which encompasses airborne early warning aircraft, drones, and surface ships. The J-35’s deployment signals a broader shift in China’s military strategy. By fielding a carrier-based stealth fighter, China is asserting its intent to challenge U.S. dominance in the Indo-Pacific and establish itself as a global maritime power. This move is likely to provoke reactions from regional players and could reshape alliances and security dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/j-35-stealth-fighter-to-enhance-chinese-aircraft-carrier-power	2024-11-15T04:15:43-08:00

French MPs call for AWACS aircraft to be replaced by 2025	According to information published by Opex360 on November 11, 2024, a recent parliamentary report has highlighted the urgent need to accelerate the replacement of the E-3F AWACS aircraft operated by the French Air Force.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Urgent Call for Modernization: A new report highlights the need for France to replace its aging E-3F AWACS fleet by 2035. (Picture source: French MoD) The report points out that prolonging the service life of the current E-3F fleet until 2035 could be counterproductive. Not only would it strain operational readiness, but it would also significantly increase maintenance costs. The report, therefore, recommends a 2025 timeline for launching a replacement program as part of the next annual adjustment of the military budget. AWACS The French E-3F AWACS, a heavily modified Boeing 707, features Northrop Grumman’s AN/APY-1/2 radar system within its rotating rotodome, which offers 360-degree coverage. This radar can detect airborne threats up to 400 kilometers (250 miles) away and maritime targets up to 600 kilometers (370 miles) depending on altitude and radar settings. Operating in the S-band, the radar provides three-dimensional data on range, bearing, and altitude, allowing precise threat tracking. For onboard systems, the E-3F integrates sophisticated data links including Link 16, which enables secure, high-speed data sharing with NATO and allied forces. This connectivity supports its role in network-centric warfare, enabling it to serve as a command hub that relays information in real-time across air and ground forces. Its radar dome, or rotodome, is 9.1 meters (30 feet) in diameter and rotates once every ten seconds, which is crucial for the radar’s continuous scanning capability. The rotodome uses pulse-Doppler technology to distinguish fast-moving aircraft from slower-moving ground clutter. Comments France currently operates four E-3F Sentry AWACS aircraft, which have been pivotal in providing all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications. However, these platforms are becoming increasingly outdated, facing challenges in maintenance and operational efficiency. The need for enhanced capabilities to address evolving threats has prompted the consideration of more advanced replacements. In early 2024, reports emerged indicating that France is considering the acquisition of the Saab GlobalEye system to replace its E-3F fleet. The GlobalEye, developed by Swedish defense manufacturer Saab, is a multi-role AEW&amp;C platform based on the Bombardier Global 6000 business jet. It integrates advanced radar and sensor technologies, offering extended surveillance range and multi-domain operational capabilities. This system has already been adopted by countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Sweden. While the GlobalEye is a strong contender, other platforms are also under consideration. The Boeing E-7A Wedgetail, for instance, has been selected by several NATO allies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, as a replacement for their aging AWACS fleets. The E-7A offers advanced radar capabilities and has been recognized for its operational effectiveness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/french-mps-call-for-awacs-aircraft-to-be-replaced-by-2025	2024-11-14T06:33:30-08:00

Since its launch in 2016, this multinational exercise aims to test and strengthen the interoperability of allied forces over a broad geographic area, from the Arctic to the Black Sea. It reflects NATO’s commitment to ensuring robust collective defense in strategic regions adapted to diverse terrain conditions. The exercise brings together over 1,800 U.S. troops and 3,700 allied and partner forces from 28 countries. The maneuvers include live fire exercises and coordination drills to enhance joint capabilities across an extensive geographic front. This collective effort improves the readiness and interoperability of NATO forces, underscoring the importance of a rapid and cohesive defense in the current geopolitical climate, where stability in the Euro-Atlantic region remains a strategic priority for allied forces. The maneuvers include live fire and support mission simulations, enabling allied units to refine joint tactics and procedures. Training alongside the U.S. Army in Europe and Africa (USArmyEURAF), allied forces gain enhanced preparation and a rapid response capability, essential for addressing potential crises. Dynamic Front aims to mitigate the challenges posed by the diversity of military equipment within European and NATO forces. This variety, stemming from the acquisition and development choices specific to each nation, poses several operational challenges that can hinder allied effectiveness. First, this equipment diversity limits interoperability. NATO forces use different communication systems, weapon calibers, and protocols, complicating effective coordination in the field. A unit equipped with a certain type of equipment may face technical incompatibilities when operating alongside allied units, impeding the cohesion of joint efforts. Moreover, logistical management and maintenance become more complex and costly. Supply chains must be extended to provide specific spare parts for various types of equipment, increasing intervention times and costs. This logistical complexity can impact rapid deployment and the Alliance's responsiveness. Additionally, the diversity in equipment necessitates specific training for each type of equipment. Each piece requires distinct technical skills and operating protocols, requiring specialized training for operators and maintenance personnel, which reduces troop flexibility and complicates joint operations. The Dynamic Front exercise enables NATO to overcome these challenges by creating common procedures and doctrines, thereby enhancing coordination among allied forces despite material diversity. By developing interoperable communication systems and conducting joint training, forces can optimize their real-time communication and information-sharing capabilities. Furthermore, the exercise promotes best practice exchange, allowing military personnel to learn to maximize their own equipment while understanding the capabilities and limitations of their allies’ systems. Thus, while material diversity represents a significant challenge, exercises like Dynamic Front are essential for strengthening NATO forces' cohesion and operational effectiveness. This commitment underscores the importance of collective preparedness to meet current security demands in the Euro-Atlantic region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/nato-launches-dynamic-front-25-in-finland-focusing-on-multinational-artillery-brigade-coordination	2024-11-14T04:01:15-08:00

Exclusive: China develops J-15D electronic warfare jet to counter US Navy’s EA-18G Growler	At the Zhuhai Airshow 2024, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) presented its new J-15D electronic warfare (EW) fighter jet, marking the aircraft’s first public appearance. Developed by Shenyang, the J-15D is part of the PLAN’s efforts to expand its carrier-based electronic warfare capabilities, joining the recently introduced J-15T multirole fighter in the fleet. According to the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, the J-15D is designed for electronic warfare operations, in a role similar to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler, which specializes in standoff, escort, and self-protection jamming.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images from the Zhuhai airshow show the J-15D equipped with two underwing EW pods and two additional pods on ventral hardpoints, potentially allowing for high-, mid-, and low-band jamming. (Picture source: Weibo/Feng Jian) Images from the airshow show the J-15D equipped with two underwing EW pods and two additional pods on ventral hardpoints, potentially allowing for high-, mid-, and low-band jamming. These systems appear distinct from those on the Chinese Air Force's J-16D EW aircraft. The J-15D also features wingtip tactical jamming receiver pods, which are not found on the J-16D. In training exercises on November 9, 2024, in Zhuhai, the J-15D participated in formation flights with the J-15T and performed maneuvers with the Z-20J shipborne helicopter and the Z-8C transport helicopter, including reverse area landings and buddy refueling operations. The airshow also featured PLAN Marine Corps members and the first group of female carrier-borne pilots. Analysts have noted the J-15D's role within the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)'s carrier air wing as a specialized twin-seat aircraft designed for electronic jamming and disruption. Based on the J-15S twin-seat model, the J-15D has been modified for EW missions, with the removal of the OLS-27 infrared search and tracking device, the 30mm cannon, and the pitot tube from the nose, and the replacement of the radar with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The J-15D first flew in April 2021, and its public debut suggests potential operational deployment. The J-15D’s gray naval paint scheme implies limited initial deliveries for trial use, with reports indicating some units may have been delivered to the PLAN as early as 2019. Observers suggest that the J-15D might be integrated into carrier-based squadrons similar to the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler squadrons, dedicated to electronic warfare support roles for combat aircraft groups. A mainland military blogger noted that the J-15D’s advanced systems will require specialized training and logistics support beyond that needed for other aircraft. The U.S. Navy’s experience with the EA-18G, initially envisioned for both combat and EW roles but later restricted to EW, underscores the specialized nature of such platforms. As part of a new generation of carrier aircraft aligned with China’s CATOBAR (catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery) Fujian aircraft carrier, which is currently in sea trials, the J-15D could serve as a platform for further advancements in PLAN carrier aviation. It shares design lineage with the J-15A model currently deployed on China’s Liaoning and Shandong carriers, derived from the Soviet/Russian Su-33. The J-15D is expected to operate alongside the J-15T fighter in theater-wide operations, with unconfirmed reports suggesting it may be capable of carrying anti-radiation missiles for enemy air defense suppression. The introduction of the J-15D, along with the J-15T, represents a significant expansion of China’s carrier air wing. Future developments are expected to include carrier-based versions of the J-35 and KJ-600 airborne early warning aircraft, both of which are in development and testing. Integrating these new platforms aligns with PLAN’s efforts to modernize its naval aviation force, enhancing China’s ability to perform complex operations and strategic power projection with its next-generation CATOBAR-capable carriers. China also operates several other EW aircraft, including the J-16D, an EW variant of the J-16 multirole fighter equipped with jamming and electronic countermeasure systems, which has participated in training alongside the J-20 stealth fighter. The Y-9LG, derived from the Y-9 transport aircraft, serves as a long-range EW platform and was recently showcased in joint military exercises with Thailand, emphasizing its roles in electronic intelligence and jamming.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/china-develops-j-15d-electronic-warfare-jet-to-counter-us-navys-ea-18g-growler	2024-11-14T03:39:45-08:00	
Poland and US Inaugurate New NATO Missile Defense Base Previously Criticized by Russia	On October 13, 2024, American and Polish officials inaugurated a NATO Aegis Ashore missile defense base in Poland, marking a significant step forward in security for both the region and NATO as a whole, amid the ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine. Located in Redzikowo in northern Poland, the base was originally conceived under the George W. Bush administration to counter potential ballistic threats from Iran. For Poland, however, this installation primarily serves as a strategic shield against Russia—a priority that has intensified following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Equipped with the advanced Aegis Ashore system from the U.S. Navy, the base is designed to detect, track, and intercept ballistic missiles in flight, enhancing NATO's airspace security in Europe. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Redzikowo now becomes the second ground-based installation in Europe to feature the Aegis Ashore system, complementing the site in Deveselu, Romania, which has been operational since 2016 (Picture source: NATO) The Aegis Ashore system, central to Redzikowo's defense capabilities, relies on the AN/SPY-1 radar, a multifunctional radar with electronic scanning that can simultaneously detect and track numerous airborne and surface targets, providing continuous 360-degree surveillance. The SM-3 interceptors are anti-ballistic missiles specifically designed to destroy enemy missiles in their mid-flight phase, intercepting them while still in the exo-atmospheric layer. These interceptors use direct-impact technology to collide with the target at high speed, effectively neutralizing potential threats. Together, these elements provide Redzikowo with a robust defense against ballistic missile threats, reinforcing the security of Poland and NATO overall. Polish leaders, along with the U.S. ambassador and senior officials, have described the inauguration as a historic moment, viewing it as an increased U.S. commitment to European security. Polish President Andrzej Duda, present at Redzikowo, emphasized that the base demonstrates Poland’s departure from the Russian sphere of influence, declaring that 'the entire world will clearly see that this is no longer within Russia’s sphere of interest.' Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz further described the base as a 'remarkable' milestone for the security of Poland, the United States, and NATO, also noting the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that underscore the importance of modern air defense systems. Redzikowo now becomes the second ground-based installation in Europe to feature the Aegis Ashore system, complementing the site in Deveselu, Romania, which has been operational since 2016. This missile shield is part of a broader defense network that includes U.S. Navy destroyers stationed in Rota, Spain, also equipped with similar Aegis defense capabilities, as well as an advanced radar in Kurecik, Turkey. Together, these installations enhance NATO's capacity to intercept short- to medium-range ballistic missiles, providing an additional layer of protection for European populations, territories, and allied forces. On the Russian side, this new installation has not been well received. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denounced the facility, asserting that it challenges Russia’s security. He accused the United States of using the 'ephemeral' threat from Iran as a cover for its true purpose, suggesting that the base actually aims to contain Russia militarily. According to Moscow, advancing American military infrastructure closer to Russian borders is an attempt to curb its strategic capabilities, prompting Russia to consider 'parity' measures to restore balance. Despite NATO’s assurances that this is a purely defensive installation, military sources indicated that the system in Poland is currently calibrated to counter missiles from the Middle East. To intercept Russian missiles, a reconfiguration of the radar would be required—a complex operation that would also entail a defense policy revision. Polish Defense Minister Kosiniak-Kamysz has expressed interest in expanding the shield’s operational scope, a subject that will be discussed with NATO and the United States to better address current security needs in Eastern Europe. In this context, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is scheduled to meet with President Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw to further strengthen security cooperation among member states. Ultimately, the Redzikowo base stands as a powerful symbol of military cooperation between Poland and the United States—a partnership Poland considers essential to its national defense amid recent political uncertainties. It not only bolsters Poland’s security but also contributes to the broader security of Europe, adding a strategic layer of deterrence amid ongoing tensions with Russia and underscoring NATO’s commitment to regional stability.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-and-us-inaugurate-new-nato-missile-defense-base-previously-criticized-by-russia	2024-11-14T03:09:37-08:00

Lockheed Martin Develops New Rocket Launcher to Modernize US Army Artillery Capabilities	During the US Army’s Human-Machine Integration Summit IV, held at Texas A&amp;M University, Lockheed Martin recently introduced a mobile launcher concept. This new launcher, capable of carrying up to 24 227mm guided artillery rockets, is designed for integration on a 10×10 Marine Corps LVSR truck, potentially supporting various munitions. Among the compatible systems could be surface-to-air interceptors, ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles, and PrSM missiles. If implemented, this launcher may provide both offensive and defensive capabilities through a mobile logistics platform.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lockheed Martin displayed the launcher on a Marine Corps MKR18 LVSR truck, structurally similar to the Army’s M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS), both produced by Oshkosh Defense. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin via The War Zone) The prototype displayed uses the Marine Corps MKR18 LVSR truck, a vehicle similar in structure to the Army’s M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS), with both vehicles produced by Oshkosh Defense. There are suggestions of a potential connection to the earlier Palletized Field Artillery Launcher (PFAL) program, aimed at enhancing logistical vehicles with artillery functions. The launcher’s expanded capacity, potentially carrying up to 24 rockets, quadruples the payload of current HIMARS systems. This modular design could support munitions from the MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM), such as GMLRS, ATACMS, and PrSM missiles. Initial configurations may allow for six GMLRS rockets, two PrSMs, or one ATACMS per module, with potential expansion to PrSM variants, including those with ranges up to 1,000 kilometers and options for anti-ship targeting. The U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC) has ongoing modernization projects that could align with this launcher’s capabilities. Among these are the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) initiative, targeting a range increase from the existing 30 kilometers to over 70 kilometers, and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), operational since 2023, intended as a replacement for the ATACMS. The PrSM program may evolve to include the capability for engaging moving targets. AFC is also working on the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), which aims to engage distant, high-value targets. Another AFC project, the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher (AML), involves an unmanned HIMARS variant designed to improve operational flexibility while minimizing personnel exposure. The launcher’s configuration allows for potential integration of various interceptors, indicating a dual capability for both artillery and air defense. Compatible interceptors may include those from the PAC-3 family, AIM-9X, and Tamir interceptors used in Iron Dome systems. The LVSR platform has previously demonstrated capacity for large payloads, such as serving as a launcher for DARPA’s OpFires hypersonic missile project. If integrated as projected, this launcher would connect with the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), facilitating coordination with radar and sensor networks to provide a comprehensive defense against aerial and missile threats. However, its larger structure might reduce mobility in comparison to the HIMARS system, which is optimized for deployment via C-130 transport. The U.S. Army Futures Command is actively focused on advancing MLRS capabilities to enhance range, precision, and adaptability. The ERCA system aims to extend artillery reach beyond 70 kilometers, a significant increase from current systems’ ranges. The PrSM, compatible with both the M270 MLRS and M142 HIMARS, is designed to double the missile capacity per launcher while providing improved accuracy. With operational capability achieved in 2023, the PrSM may be adapted in the future for engaging moving targets. The LRHW program, a collaborative project across military branches, is focused on developing a ground-launched hypersonic missile system for engaging high-value targets over extended ranges. Finally, the AML initiative involves developing unmanned, remote-controlled HIMARS variants to improve operational flexibility and reduce personnel risks in artillery missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/lockheed-martin-develops-new-rocket-launcher-to-modernize-us-army-artillery-capabilities	2024-11-14T01:39:54-08:00	
First Combat Deployment of US F-35C Fighters in Strategic Strikes Against Houthis in Yemen	Amid rising tensions in the Middle East, the United States mobilized its air power for targeted strikes against military infrastructure controlled by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. On the night of November 10–11, 2024, combat aircraft, including F-35Cs from the U.S. Marine Corps deployed aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, participated in an operation led by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). This mission marked the first combat engagement of F-35Cs in an active theater. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35C Lightning II from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 joined the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2022 to deploy as part of Carrier Strike Group 3 (Picture source: US DoD) The F-35C Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole fighter designed for carrier-based operations. It features advanced stealth technology for low radar visibility and is powered by the F135-PW-100 engine, enabling it to reach speeds of up to Mach 1.6. With a wingspan of 13.1 meters and a length of 15.7 meters, it can carry up to 8,160 kg of payload, including AIM-120C/D and AIM-9X air-to-air missiles, GBU-31 JDAM and GBU-12 LGB guided bombs, as well as AGM-154 JSOWs. Equipped with the AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the F-35C provides advanced detection and tracking capabilities. Its AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare suite offers protection against electronic threats, while the AN/AAQ-40 electro-optical targeting system (EOTS) ensures precise targeting. These systems, along with sophisticated sensor fusion, grant the F-35C unparalleled situational awareness, enhancing its lethality and survivability in combat. The targets included weapons storage facilities in Houthi-controlled areas, where advanced conventional arms used to target both military and civilian vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden were reportedly stored. According to Pentagon spokesperson General Pat Ryder, these strikes directly responded to Houthi attacks on American, commercial, and allied vessels. Ryder stated that the U.S. would maintain pressure on the Houthis to prevent future attacks. This operation involved multiple aircraft, including the F-35C, F/A-18F Super Hornet, and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare plane, all deployed from the USS Abraham Lincoln. While the strikes were initially attributed to the Navy, it was later confirmed that the F-35Cs involved were part of the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314), the 'Black Knights,' the first F-35C squadron to be deployed aboard the Lincoln. The deployment of the F-35C in combat represents a significant milestone for this stealth aircraft variant, which was first operational in 2019 and had its initial deployment in 2021. Until this mission, the F-35C had not seen active combat, unlike the earlier F-35B and F-35A versions, which were deployed in 2018 and 2019 for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively. In response, the Houthis launched an extensive attack on November 11. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance were targeted by eight kamikaze drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and three anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were successfully intercepted without damage or casualties. The military capabilities of the Houthis, bolstered by Iranian weapons and technology transfers, continue to raise international concern. A recent U.N. report highlighted that Iranian support has enabled the Houthis to become a formidable military force with capabilities far beyond those of a typical armed group. It is also suggested that Russia may be providing intelligence and anti-ship missiles to the Houthis. These American strikes and recent interceptions underscore the complex security landscape in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The United States has strengthened its military posture to secure these critical maritime routes amid increasingly sophisticated threats. The deployment of F-35Cs in this conflict reflects a strategic evolution in U.S. military presence in the region and demonstrates its ability to counter diverse threats posed by Iran-backed Houthi forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/first-combat-deployment-of-us-f-35c-fighters-in-strategic-strikes-against-houthis-in-yemen	2024-11-14T01:37:09-08:00	
Northrop Grumman Secures Major Funding Boost for US-Japan Glide Phase Interceptor Project	On November 13, 2024, the United States Department of Defense announced a significant funding increase for American Defense Company Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation’s work on the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program, an advanced defense initiative designed to counter hypersonic missile threats. Northrop Grumman, based in Chandler, Arizona, has been awarded five additional one-year firm-fixed-price options under its current Research &amp; Development Prototype Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) is a cutting-edge missile defense system designed to intercept hypersonic threats during their high-speed glide phase, enhancing defense capabilities against advanced missiles. (Picture source: Northrop Grumann) The Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) is an advanced missile defense system specifically designed to counter hypersonic missiles during their 'glide phase' of flight. Hypersonic missiles, which can travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5, have a unique flight path that includes a boost phase, where they ascend to their intended altitude, followed by a glide phase, where they travel at high speeds and low altitudes, maneuvering unpredictably toward their target. Traditional missile defense systems often struggle to intercept such missiles due to their speed and maneuverability, particularly during the glide phase when they can adjust their trajectory to avoid interception. The GPI aims to address this by offering a precise defense capability during this phase, leveraging advanced guidance and propulsion systems to intercept and neutralize hypersonic threats before reaching their targets. For military forces, the development of the GPI offers a transformative addition to missile defense capabilities, filling a critical gap in intercepting fast, agile hypersonic missiles. By targeting threats in the glide phase, the GPI provides military forces with a new layer of defense that protects strategic assets, infrastructure, and civilian areas from next-generation missile attacks. Additionally, integrating the GPI with existing systems like the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system allows for seamless deployment on naval vessels, offering a mobile, flexible, and scalable defense solution. This capability not only strengthens defensive postures against adversaries equipped with hypersonic technology but also reinforces deterrence, reducing the likelihood that such advanced weapons could penetrate allied defenses. In modern warfare, the GPI represents a strategic leap forward, enhancing the resilience and adaptability of military forces in high-stakes, high-speed threat environments. This contract modification boosts the funding for Northrop Grumman’s GPI development from $291.8 million to $832.8 million—a $540.9 million increase aimed at accelerating work on this critical project. The expansion aligns with an MDA press release that confirms the continuation of Northrop Grumman’s work under the OTA agreement. Additionally, $24.6 million in Fiscal Year 2025 research, development, testing, and evaluation funds have been allocated for the project, which is expected to extend through November 2029. The GPI initiative is a pioneering U.S.-Japan collaboration aimed at countering the unique challenges posed by hypersonic missiles during their glide phase when they maneuver at extreme speeds and low altitudes. This partnership, formalized in May 2024, designates the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) as the program’s lead, with Japan contributing essential technologies, including advanced rocket motors and propulsion systems. In September 2024, Northrop Grumman was selected as the primary contractor for the GPI project, entrusting the company with refining the interceptor’s design to ensure its effectiveness against hypersonic threats. The GPI interceptor is designed to integrate with the U.S. Navy’s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system, utilizing the widely deployed Vertical Launch System (VLS). This compatibility with Aegis allows the interceptor to be deployed on U.S. Navy ships, significantly enhancing the fleet’s defensive capabilities against hypersonic threats without requiring extensive modifications. As a result, the GPI program is set to provide a scalable, sea-based solution to the pressing challenge of intercepting advanced hypersonic weapons. Hypersonic missiles, which can exceed Mach 5 speeds and evade traditional missile defenses through rapid maneuverability, represent a major strategic threat. The GPI aims to deliver an interception capability currently lacking in most global defense systems by intercepting such threats during their glide phase. The system’s development is both a technological advancement and a strategic imperative, as both the U.S. and Japan are committed to bolstering security in the Indo-Pacific region amid rapidly evolving missile technology. The increase in funding for Northrop Grumman underscores the United States’ commitment to advancing its missile defense capabilities in close partnership with Japan. This collaboration represents a vital step in countering modern missile threats, strengthening allied defense postures, and ensuring stability in a dynamic global security environment. Once operational, the GPI program could become a critical element in regional defense, enhancing readiness against new-age missile threats and exemplifying allied cooperation in cutting-edge defense innovation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/northrop-grumman-secures-major-funding-boost-for-us-japan-glide-phase-interceptor-project	2024-11-14T01:12:34-08:00

In the context of the battlefield, NRBC threats—covering nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical dangers—pose significant and complex challenges to military operations. These threats require a comprehensive approach to ensure the safety and effectiveness of military personnel under high-risk conditions. Nuclear and radiological threats involve both the devastating explosive power of nuclear devices and the contamination hazards associated with dispersed radioactive materials, creating long-term risks to health and environment. Such hazards can severely impact military logistics and limit troop movement in affected areas, as the long-lasting contamination zones disrupt both operational strategy and area security. Biological threats, by contrast, use infectious agents to disable or kill through disease outbreaks, often with a stealthy onset that complicates early detection. These pathogens can spread quickly, endangering troops and civilians alike, necessitating rapid medical response and quarantine measures. Chemical threats, using toxins to cause immediate physical harm, challenge forces to act under restrictive conditions where protective suits, masks, and decontamination protocols are essential but often burdensome. Protective measures, while effective, can slow operations and increase fatigue, requiring well-practiced protocols and resilience from personnel. Modern militaries thus invest heavily in detection systems, training, and simulation exercises to help soldiers operate effectively under NRBC threat conditions. From advanced sensors to simulate real-time exposure in exercises, these preparations ensure that forces can detect, protect against, and respond to NRBC hazards efficiently, sustaining both operational capability and personnel safety on the battlefield.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/teledyne-flir-defense-wins-us-army-contract-to-upgrade-nbcrv-sensor-suite-for-cbrn-threat-detection	2024-11-14T00:54:06-08:00

Türkiye Continues to Strengthen Its Air Force with Acquisition of 40 F-16 Viper Fighters	Türkiye’s Defense Minister, Yaşar Güler, has confirmed the signing of a contract to purchase 40 F-16 'Viper' fighter jets from the United States, marking a new milestone in defense relations between Türkiye and its American allies. This contract, announced in an interview by TV100, on November 12, 2024, follows several years of discussions and changes in Türkiye’s acquisition plans, which were initially disrupted when Türkiye was excluded from the F-35 program due to its purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-16 'Viper' fighter jets from the United State. (Picture source: US DoD) Following its exclusion from the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program in 2019, Türkiye initially demanded $1.4 billion in compensation. However, in 2021, Türkiye reoriented its strategy, seeking authorization to acquire 40 F-16 Vipers along with 79 modernization kits for its fleet of older-generation F-16s. This proposal encountered resistance within the U.S. Congress, although it received support from the Biden administration, which viewed the sale as leverage to encourage Türkiye to facilitate Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) had given its approval for this potential sale, which included not only the F-16Vs but also AIM-9X Block II missiles, AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles, and GBU-39/B bombs, with an estimated value of $23 billion. However, Türkiye adjusted its plans and, in addition to the F-16 order, expressed its intention to procure 40 Eurofighter Typhoon EF-2000s, with support from the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, despite initial opposition from Germany. German authorities ultimately lifted their objections, paving the way for a potential order of the Typhoons. Yaşar Güler, speaking in an interview with TV100, stated, 'Currently, our relations with our American friends are very positive. The contracts for the acquisition of 40 F-16 Vipers are signed. We will also acquire 40 Eurofighter Typhoons.' However, he did not specify the total contract amount or the delivery schedule for these new aircraft. Meanwhile, Türkiye continues to develop its fifth-generation fighter, the Kaan, which made its maiden flight last February. However, without new fighter acquisitions, the modernization of Türkiye’s air force could face challenges amidst regional threats, especially as Iran encounters similar issues. For its part, Greece, a historical rival of Türkiye, has already taken steps to bolster its capabilities by ordering Rafale jets and upgrading part of its F-16 fleet to the 'Viper' standard. The F-16 Block 70/72 'Viper' is equipped with advanced technology, including an APG-83 SABR active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an advanced mission computer, a 'Center Pedestal Display' for terrain following, and enhanced connectivity via Link 16, making it particularly suitable for modern operations.

Belgium Discusses Arming MQ-9B SkyGuardian Drones in Defense Committee	The debate over arming military drones has resurfaced in Belgium, with discussions held on November 13, 2024, during a Defense Committee meeting considering the possibility of equipping the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones with offensive capabilities. Currently, these drones are used exclusively for observation missions, but advocates for their armament argue that it could significantly enhance Belgium’s defense capabilities in an increasingly volatile international landscape. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In June 2024, the Belgian army announced that the first six Belgian crews had completed their initial training at General Atomics in North Dakota, with additional training scheduled (Picture source: Belgian Army) At the center of these discussions are the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, which Belgium acquired in 2018 at a total cost of 160 million euros, purchasing two units. Developed by General Atomics, the MQ-9B is a next-generation remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) designed for medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) missions. With a wingspan of 79 feet (24 meters), the drone can fly over the horizon for 40+ hours in all weather conditions, while safely integrating into civil airspace. Equipped with the Lynx Multi-mode Radar, advanced electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors, and automatic takeoff and landing features, the SkyGuardian provides robust surveillance capabilities. The SkyGuardian’s design allows it to carry up to 2,155 kg in payload across nine external hardpoints and an internal bay, suitable for integrating various sensors and precision-guided munitions. It reaches a maximum speed of 210 KTAS and boasts a range exceeding 6,000 nautical miles. Compliant with NATO standards (STANAG 4671) and civil airspace regulations, the MQ-9B includes a detect and avoid system, de-ice/anti-ice capabilities, and an airframe built to endure up to 40,000 hours of operation, making it versatile for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions—and potentially offensive operations if armed. The ongoing discussions emphasize the utility of armed drones in recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, where such systems have shown rapid and effective response capabilities on the battlefield, reducing risks to soldiers. Proponents argue that arming drones could offer Belgium a strategic advantage, modernizing its defense posture and aligning it more closely with the practices of NATO allies. The topic of arming the SkyGuardians has been debated in Belgium since their acquisition in 2018, with various discussions over the years exploring both tactical benefits and ethical implications. In 2021, a strategic committee highlighted the advantages that armed drones could bring to Belgian defense forces, but concerns around ethical and political issues kept them restricted to surveillance missions. In early 2024, a proposal to arm the drones was presented but faced opposition due to ethical and legal considerations, leading to its temporary withdrawal. Later, as discussions continued, an alternative parliamentary majority showed interest in advancing the measure, but ultimately, caution prevailed, and the decision was deferred to the current executive's ongoing evaluations. Following recent elections, a working group within the Belgian Defense Committee has resumed the examination of armed drones as part of broader considerations around 'autonomous weapons.' If approved, arming Belgium’s drones could offer significant strategic advantages. Operationally, this shift would provide precision strike capabilities, reducing reliance on fighter jets, which are costly and logistically challenging to deploy. Armed drones could also deliver close air support to ground forces, boosting their security and operational reach. Additionally, with their long-endurance capabilities, these drones would allow continuous monitoring of sensitive areas, ready to respond immediately to identified threats. Aligning Belgium’s drone capabilities with NATO allies would strengthen interoperability, enhancing coherence in joint military operations, particularly in scenarios that require precision strikes to secure intervention zones.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/belgium-discusses-arming-mq-9b-skyguardian-drones-in-defense-committee	2024-11-14T00:26:46-08:00	
Towards Armed Drones for Belgian Army? N-VA Revives Debate in Defense Committee	The debate over arming military drones has resurfaced in Belgium. On November 13, 2024, during a Defense Committee meeting, the N-VA introduced a resolution aimed at equipping the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, acquired by the Belgian army, with offensive capabilities. These drones are used exclusively for observation missions, but the N-VA advocates arming them to bolster Belgium’s defense effectiveness in an increasingly unstable international landscape. This proposal marks a significant moment in the national discussion on drone use, dividing those who view this technology as a modernization tool for the armed forces and those concerned about its ethical and political implications. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In June 2024, the Belgian army announced that the first six Belgian crews had completed their initial training at General Atomics in North Dakota, with additional training scheduled (Picture source: Belgian Army) At the heart of this debate are the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, acquired by Belgium in 2018 for a total of 160 million euros, with two units purchased. Developed by General Atomics, these MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) drones are highly capable, and designed for long-duration surveillance missions. The SkyGuardian can carry a payload of up to 2,155 kg, making it suitable for carrying various types of weaponry, such as missiles and precision bombs. Despite this capability, Belgian drones remain unarmed, limited solely to intelligence-gathering operations. The resolution, introduced by Peter Buysrogge and supported by other N-VA members on November 13, explicitly calls on the government to 'break the taboo' on arming the SkyGuardian drones and to move 'without delay' toward offensive armament. The N-VA argues that recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, underscore the effectiveness of armed drones for rapid, effective responses on the ground, minimizing risks to soldiers. Supporters see drone armament as a strategic shift that would modernize Belgium’s military capability, better positioning it to face contemporary threats and aligning it with NATO allies. The question of arming the SkyGuardians is not new in Belgium. From the time of their acquisition in 2018, the issue has sparked debate within the De Croo government (Vivaldi coalition), with some considering it a step towards a more aggressive military stance. In 2021, a strategic committee led by Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder recommended arming the SkyGuardians, highlighting the tactical benefits for Belgian forces. However, this recommendation was dismissed due to ethical and political concerns, and the drones remained limited to surveillance missions. At the beginning of 2024, a proposal to arm the drones was put forward by Jasper Pillen (Open VLD) and later amended by Tim Vandenput, but it was blocked by opposition from Ecolo-Groen, whose members raised ethical and legal concerns about armed drone use. This blockage led to the proposal’s withdrawal from the Defense Committee’s agenda in May. Later that year, an alternative majority in Parliament—composed of the N-VA, MR, Open VLD, CD&amp;V, Les Engagés, and Vlaams Belang—considered pushing the measure through before the June elections. Ultimately, caution prevailed, and the decision was deferred to negotiations under the new executive. The 'Arizona' coalition formed after the elections has reignited the debate with a specialized working group on 'autonomous weapons,' which includes armed drones. Arming Belgium’s drones would offer multiple strategic advantages, extending beyond mere military modernization. Operationally, this move would enable precise and rapid strike capabilities, reducing Belgium’s reliance on fighter jets, which are costly and challenging to mobilize in certain situations. Armed drones could provide close air support to ground troops, significantly enhancing their security and operational effectiveness. Additionally, the long endurance of these drones would allow continuous surveillance over sensitive areas, with the capacity to intervene immediately in response to identified threats. This evolution would also bring Belgium in line with NATO allies, fostering greater interoperability and coherence in joint military operations, especially in contexts where precision strikes are required to secure intervention zones.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/towards-armed-drones-for-belgian-army-n-va-revives-debate-in-defense-committee	2024-11-14T00:26:46-08:00

However, the deck's limited width restricts safe drone landings at sea, suggesting further modifications may be necessary for optimal future missions. This operation confirmed the short take-off and rapid deployment capabilities of the drone from the Dokdo, which has a 100-meter-long flight deck. The exercise established stable communication between the vessel and Pohang’s Naval Air Command, where the drone ultimately landed. Conducted in collaboration with industry partners, this test also aims to establish a strengthened maritime operational concept, incorporating autonomous systems for complex undersea and aerial missions. The South Korean Navy plans to expand the role of autonomous drones to reinforce its operational capabilities at sea as part of a comprehensive maritime combat system tailored to meet today’s security challenges. The impact of this technological advancement extends beyond the South Korean Navy. The global rise of drone technology has prompted navies worldwide to reevaluate their vessel designs and operational capabilities. In response, countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have repurposed existing ships as drone carriers or developed new vessels to support autonomous systems. This trend reflects a shift toward technology-focused naval warfare, where drones enable reconnaissance, anti-submarine, and strike missions in remote areas without dependence on land bases. For South Korea, the Navy intends to further develop maritime drone missions, including surface target detection and undersea threat identification, enhancing defense capabilities to address current geostrategic challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/gray-eagle-stol-drone-completes-first-successful-flight-from-south-korean-amphibious-ship-roks-dokdo	2024-11-13T07:51:45-08:00	
French Aircraft Carrier Charles de Gaulle Refines Self-Defense with Anti-Drone Exercise	According to information published by the French MoD on November 12, 2024, in a recent high-intensity anti-drone defense exercise, the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle collaborated with the 31F Flotilla to refine critical skills in combating unmanned aerial threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Navy's aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. (Picture source: NATO) Countering drone threats from an aircraft carrier involves a layered defense strategy, integrating advanced detection, interception, and neutralization capabilities to address a broad range of unmanned aerial threats. Carriers rely heavily on sophisticated radar and sensor networks, such as AN/SPY-6 or AESA radars, capable of detecting small, fast-moving drones at considerable distances. To enhance accuracy, these radar systems work alongside infrared and electro-optical sensors, providing comprehensive tracking even in challenging environmental conditions. Artificial intelligence further augments this capability by analyzing flight patterns, categorizing drones by threat level, and enabling the defense team to prioritize their responses effectively. Electronic warfare (EW) plays a pivotal role in countering drones, with systems like the AN/SLQ-32 or SEWIP being instrumental in jamming communication links or disrupting GPS signals. Such jamming tactics are particularly effective against drone swarms that aim to overwhelm carrier defenses. In addition, EW systems can employ spoofing techniques, confusing a drone’s navigation system by altering its GPS or control signals, which often leads to the drone crashing or veering off course. Carriers are also equipped with kinetic and non-kinetic interceptors to neutralize drones that breach outer detection layers. Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS), such as Phalanx or SeaRAM, provide robust short-range defenses, using rapid-fire projectiles or missiles to engage small, low-flying drones. In parallel, directed energy weapons (DEWs), such as lasers or high-power microwaves, offer scalable responses, incinerating or disabling drones at close range with precision. Anti-air missiles, like the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile or ESSM, are deployed against larger drones that could carry explosives or reconnaissance equipment, providing a longer-range engagement option. Defensive drone systems add an additional layer of response, allowing carriers to deploy their own UAVs to intercept and neutralize hostile drones before they reach the fleet. Defensive drones are often used in swarm-on-swarm tactics to counter incoming drone swarms. These swarms of defensive drones coordinate their actions to intercept hostile UAVs effectively, using either kinetic force or electronic jamming. The success of counter-drone operations depends on an integrated command and control (C2) system that centralizes communication between detection, EW, and weapon systems. This networked C2 system ensures rapid coordination, allowing operators to manage multiple threats in real-time. Carriers also communicate securely with their escorting vessels, creating a unified defense that maximizes the chance of intercepting hostile drones. Regular training and simulation exercises simulate a variety of drone threats, such as swarm attacks and complex flight maneuvers, ensuring that crews are prepared for a range of possible scenarios. Overall, a multi-layered defense, combining early detection, electronic warfare, kinetic interceptors, and networked command systems, is critical for carriers to protect themselves against the evolving challenges of drone warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-refines-self-defense-with-anti-drone-exercise	2024-11-13T06:59:42-08:00

It boasts an average speed of around 200 m/s, peaking at 250 m/s, making it a rapid yet moderately maneuverable interceptor. The missile’s specifications include an interception range of 0.5 to 15 kilometers and a maximum altitude of 1,500 meters, making it well-suited for effectively countering drone attacks within a defined area. An intriguing aspect of the project is the choice of guidance method, which remains unspecified at this stage. However, it is possible that the missile may utilize reflected laser beam guidance, a technology already used in Polish anti-tank missile systems such as the JACK-S and Pirat complexes. This type of guidance would help keep costs down while ensuring sufficient accuracy for drone interception. WITU’s initiative aligns with a broader goal of developing an economical and accessible system capable of meeting the growing demand for anti-drone defense. The designers emphasize that this missile is particularly suited for countering swarm attacks, an essential capability as drone swarm tactics continue to evolve. To realize this project, WITU is currently seeking an industrial partner to assist in finalizing and mass-producing the missile, prioritizing the needs of the Polish armed forces. This project reflects a trend seen in recent years, where low-cost combat drones and interceptor missiles have become strategic assets in modern military arsenals. In 2021, the Ukrainian design bureau 'LUCH' launched a project for the RK-10 anti-aircraft missile complex, specifically tailored for combating Shahed-type drones. Poland could thus benefit from a similar solution, optimized for its own strategic needs. The development of a cost-effective anti-drone interceptor by the Wojskowy Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia (WITU) addresses the growing need to counter attack drones, such as those of the Shahed class, which are widely used in modern conflicts. These drones, often deployed in swarms, present significant challenges to traditional defense systems. A low-cost interceptor would allow for efficient neutralization of these threats, avoiding the need to deploy more expensive missiles against relatively low-cost targets. This approach is essential for maintaining sustainable air defense in the face of saturation attacks, where the cost-effectiveness of countermeasures becomes a critical factor. Moreover, the specific design of this interceptor, with a range of 0.5 to 15 km and a maximum altitude of 1,500 meters, makes it particularly suited for neutralizing drones operating at low and medium altitudes. Its lightweight and maneuverable nature facilitates rapid and flexible deployment, offering a tailored response to emerging threats. Integrating laser-guided technology, already proven in other Polish systems, could ensure increased accuracy while keeping costs manageable. In this way, the interceptor provides a strategic advantage for the Polish armed forces, enhancing their capability to effectively protect national territory from hostile drone incursions. To address the growing threat posed by Shahed-class drones used in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Poland is seeking to develop a defense solution. This project meets a strategic need for an economical defense against these aerial threats, which, due to their numbers and low cost, often overwhelm conventional defense systems. With a range of 15 kilometers and potentially laser-based guidance, this missile could offer a sustainable and affordable solution for the Polish armed forces. Poland could also consider supporting Ukraine in protecting its airspace by providing such missiles, even as its Chief of General Staff recently announced that Poland will not shoot down Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-develops-interceptor-missile-to-counter-russian-used-shahed-class-drones	2024-11-13T05:54:53-08:00

Although Ankara initially considered upgrading its F-16s or acquiring fifth-generation F-35s, Türkiye’s participation in the F-35 program was suspended in 2019 due to diplomatic tensions with the United States related to Ankara’s acquisition of the Russian S-400 air defense system. In this context, the Eurofighter Typhoon emerged as a credible alternative, backed by European partners such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, who seek to strengthen strategic ties with Ankara. Other aircraft were briefly considered, but none offered the same balance of operational performance and political cooperation. The acquisition of Eurofighter Typhoons takes place in a complex geostrategic context, marked by increased tensions with Greece, Türkiye’s historic neighbor and rival. This choice can be seen as a direct response to the modernization of the Greek fleet, which has recently integrated French Rafales and is considering the acquisition of American F-35s. These developments enhance Greece's air capabilities, potentially altering the balance of power in the region. Additionally, the Eurofighter offers Türkiye a strategic alternative to diversify its defense supply sources and reduce its reliance on American systems. In parallel, Türkiye has also initiated the development of its own fifth-generation fighter jet, the TAI KAAN, aiming for increased long-term autonomy in its air defense. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a multi-role combat aircraft developed by a consortium of European aerospace companies, including Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo. Designed for a wide range of air operations, the Typhoon features a delta wing and canard configuration, providing significant maneuverability. The aircraft is intended to meet both current and future operational needs, with continuous upgrades keeping it updated with combat aviation technology. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 23,500 kg and a maximum speed of Mach 2.0. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 afterburning turbofan engines, each providing 60 kN (13,000 lbf) of thrust dry and 90 kN (20,000 lbf) with an afterburner, the Eurofighter Typhoon can reach a maximum speed of 2,125 km/h or Mach 2.35 at high altitude and 1,530 km/h or Mach 1.25 at sea level. It has a supercruise capability at Mach 1.5, a maximum range of 2,900 kilometers, and a service ceiling of 19,812 meters (65,000 feet). The Typhoon's armament includes a 27 mm Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon with 150 rounds and 13 hardpoints (8 under-wing and 5 under-fuselage) capable of carrying over 9,000 kg of payload. In air-to-air combat, the Eurofighter Typhoon can climb at a rate of 315 meters per second (62,000 feet per minute). It is equipped with advanced radar and targeting systems, including the Captor-E AESA radar, capable of tracking up to 20 targets simultaneously and engaging them with precision. Its armament includes air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, MBDA Meteor, IRIS-T, AIM-132 ASRAAM, and AIM-9 Sidewinder for beyond-visual-range (BVR) engagement. The Eurofighter Typhoon also performs well in air-to-ground missions. It can carry precision-guided munitions, including Paveway IV laser-guided bombs, Storm Shadow cruise missiles, Brimstone anti-tank missiles, Taurus air-to-surface missiles, and AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles. Its targeting pod, the LITENING III, allows for accurate identification and engagement of ground targets under various weather conditions. This capability supports roles such as close air support, interdiction, and strategic strike missions. Furthermore, the Typhoon can also carry anti-ship missiles such as the Marte ER and the Joint Strike Missile (JSM). The technical comparison between the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Eurofighter Typhoon highlights two different approaches in the design and capabilities of multirole fighters, each offering specific advantages in terms of performance, technology, and suitable missions. The F-16, developed by General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin), is a fourth-generation fighter widely adopted since the 1980s for its versatility, maneuverability, and relatively low operating costs. Its single-engine design makes it light and particularly agile, making it an effective aircraft for ground attack and air superiority missions. In contrast, the Eurofighter Typhoon, designed by a European consortium (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain), is an advanced fourth-generation fighter with a twin-engine design, providing greater power and acceleration suitable for high-altitude air superiority missions. The Eurofighter is equipped with advanced electronic systems, particularly its Captor-E AESA radar (Active Electronically Scanned Array), which offers increased detection range, better coverage, and the ability to track multiple targets simultaneously. The F-16, though upgradeable, lags in this regard, initially lacking AESA technology (only available in modernized versions). The Eurofighter also has better electronic warfare and defense capabilities, allowing it to operate in more hostile environments and against more sophisticated aerial threats. The F-16 remains a versatile, economical, and effective fighter for traditional missions, including ground attack and air defense, but its lack of stealth and advanced detection systems makes it less suited to modern high-intensity warfare environments. The Eurofighter, designed for air superiority missions, excels in long-range engagements and can perform air-to-ground missions, although it is primarily optimized for air defense environments where the ability to detect and engage distant targets is crucial. In summary, the F-16 and the Eurofighter meet different needs: the more economical and maneuverable F-16 is suited for versatile, cost-effective operations, while the Eurofighter Typhoon, with its advanced systems and ability to operate in hostile environments, is a preferred choice for high-intensity air superiority missions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/germany-authorizes-sale-of-40-eurofighter-typhoon-fighter-jets-to-tuerkiye	2024-11-13T01:10:30-08:00

Taiwan Eyes F-35 and Patriot Missiles to Show Defense Resolve to Trump in Face of China	As tensions intensify across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan is evaluating a substantial arms procurement from the United States, aiming to solidify its defense capabilities and affirm its commitment to self-defense. According to reports from the Financial Times, Taiwan is considering a $15 billion investment that would include the acquisition of 60 F-35 fighter jets, 400 Patriot missiles, four E-2D Hawkeye early warning aircraft, ten second-hand warships, and the Aegis combat system. This proposed purchase, aside from enhancing Taiwan’s defense, is intended to signal to the U.S., specifically to the incoming Trump administration, Taiwan's willingness to independently fortify its defenses amid growing Chinese military assertiveness. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan is particularly interested in the F-35B model, which can perform short takeoffs and vertical landings (Picture source: US DoD) The Lockheed Martin F-35 is central to Taiwan's potential purchase, seen as a significant deterrent against Chinese aggression. A fifth-generation stealth fighter, the F-35 is highly capable of air superiority and strike missions, featuring advanced stealth technology, supersonic speed, and superior maneuverability. The aircraft is equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, featuring the AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), all of which enhance situational awareness and targeting precision. Armament options encompass a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, AIM-9X Sidewinder, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The F-35's radar systems, particularly the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, provide advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including radar warning, targeting support, and jamming functions. Among the three F-35 variants, Taiwan is particularly interested in the F-35B model, which can perform short takeoffs and vertical landings (STOVL). The STOVL capability is crucial in Taiwan’s context, as it would enable operations from short runways or emergency airstrips if major airbases were compromised by Chinese missile strikes. However, while the F-35 represents an advanced technological edge, experts are questioning its viability as the best strategic option for Taiwan, primarily due to the high costs involved and the risk of delayed delivery, potentially extending beyond 2027. This timeline is significant as experts estimate a potential Chinese military action around that year, increasing the urgency for Taiwan to evaluate its options carefully. Alongside the F-35, Taiwan has prioritized upgrading its missile defense systems, particularly the Patriot missiles. The MIM-104 Patriot system, developed by Raytheon, is a mobile surface-to-air missile system that plays a crucial role in air and missile defense for several countries. It is designed to detect, track, and engage various aerial threats, including tactical ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. It uses components such as the AN/MPQ-53 or AN/MPQ-65 radar sets and sophisticated guidance systems. The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) variant is especially relevant for Taiwan, providing extended range and improved accuracy, and Taiwan has actively sought to bolster its Patriot system in recent years. A recent U.S. proposal in December 2022 offered Taiwan up to 100 advanced Patriot missiles, valued at $882 million, further underlining Taiwan's commitment to strengthening its missile defense capabilities in response to potential threats. Despite Taiwan’s intent to modernize its forces, some defense analysts argue that other systems might offer more immediate strategic value at a lower cost. For instance, Taiwan has shown interest in acquiring decommissioned American warships, such as Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers and Perry-class frigates. These naval platforms could serve as effective access-denial (A2/AD) assets in the event of an invasion, providing Taiwan with the capability to disrupt and delay a potential Chinese assault. This kind of deterrent strategy is particularly suited to the unique geographic and military constraints Taiwan faces in the Taiwan Strait. Additionally, other assets, like HIMARS artillery and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, which were included in prior U.S. arms sales, align closely with Taiwan's defensive needs and offer an effective means of resisting amphibious incursions and protecting its coastline. Under the Trump administration's first term, several large arms packages to Taiwan were approved, totaling over $21 billion, including F-16 Viper fighter jets, M1 Abrams tanks, HIMARS rocket systems, and Harpoon missiles. However, Trump's pragmatic stance on international relations—exemplified by his comments suggesting that Taiwan should 'pay the U.S.' for its security, likening the relationship to an insurance policy—has raised concerns in Taiwan about the stability and commitment of U.S. support. Despite these arms deals, doubts persist regarding the likelihood of a direct U.S. military intervention in defense of Taiwan, particularly given Trump's comments and recent global shifts in U.S. defense policy. Compounding these strategic uncertainties, Taiwan’s role in global semiconductor production, especially through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), adds another layer of complexity. As the world leader in advanced chip production, TSMC occupies a critical position in the global supply chain, particularly for the United States and its allies, as well as for China. This economic leverage makes Taiwan a focal point in the ongoing U.S.-China rivalry, as Beijing could use Taiwan's semiconductor sector as a pressure point to influence international responses to a Taiwan conflict. Taiwan's strategic interest in F-35 fighter jets and additional Patriot missile batteries signals a clear commitment to enhancing its defense posture, but uncertainties remain about the efficacy of these acquisitions in meeting Taiwan’s immediate defense needs. Delivery timelines and high costs may limit the F-35's impact in the short term, suggesting that investments in access-denial systems and naval defenses could more effectively serve Taiwan’s security interests. Ultimately, Taiwan’s strategic choices are shaped by a complex interplay of regional tensions, economic considerations, and the evolving U.S.-China dynamic, underscoring the island’s need for a nuanced and adaptable defense strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/taiwan-eyes-f-35-and-patriot-missiles-to-show-defense-resolve-to-trump-in-face-of-china	2024-11-13T00:06:56-08:00
