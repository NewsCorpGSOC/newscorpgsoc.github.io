This achievement highlights the British fleet’s growing efficiency in countering uncrewed systems, a threat increasingly prevalent in modern conflict zones, notably in the Red Sea. The Martlet, a lightweight, multi-role missile guided by laser, was initially designed to neutralize surface threats, including fast boats and other small, maneuverable targets. However, Royal Navy experts quickly identified its potential in air-to-air scenarios, confirmed by the recent trials. The Wildcat, primarily assigned to Royal Navy frigates, destroyers, and aircraft carriers, thus advances in its strike capabilities, enhancing its versatility for search and rescue operations, troop transport, and anti-smuggling missions at sea. For these trials, the Royal Navy employed the Banshee drone, launched by ramp, as a training target for the Wildcat. After acquiring and tracking the drone, the helicopter crew launched the Martlet missile, which intercepted and destroyed the target within seconds, reducing it to a fireball. Wildcat pilot Lieutenant Dave Guest underscored the importance of this capability, which enables the helicopter to respond to aerial threats independently, without requiring additional support. He described the Martlet as a 'highly effective and cost-efficient' weapon, ideally suited for this role. Commander James Woods, leader of the 815th Naval Air Squadron, described this exercise as a 'fantastic development' for the Wildcat HMA.2, emphasizing a significant advance in the Royal Navy’s maritime strike capacity. The Wildcat’s newly enhanced capability bolsters maritime security in sensitive areas and expands options for neutralizing drones, especially Banshee-type targets frequently encountered in operational theaters such as the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, where rebel groups increasingly employ drones. For these trials, the Royal Navy employed the Banshee drone, launched by ramp, as a training target for the Wildcat (Picture source: British MoD) In the exercise, the Wildcat was outfitted with five Martlet missiles, though the helicopter can carry up to 20. Alternatively, a load of 10 Martlets combined with two Sea Venom anti-ship missiles is possible, offering increased flexibility for missions requiring dual air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities. The Seaspray 7400E surveillance radar and the Wescam MX-15Di optical unit supported target acquisition and missile guidance, ensuring optimal targeting accuracy. Beyond the Royal Navy, other military forces are exploring the use of helicopters for drone interception missions. For example, Israel employs AH-64 helicopters to counter drones launched by Hezbollah. Ukraine, in turn, has deployed Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters, both transport and combat variants, to intercept drones using onboard cannons and machine guns, reflecting the growing interest in this form of aerial defense. Currently, the Martlet missile has yet to reach full operational capability within the Royal Navy, with a target date set for 2025. However, ongoing trials aim to seamlessly integrate this versatile weapon with existing systems to address modern threats, particularly those posed by small drones. With a range of up to 10 km, the Martlet represents a valuable advancement for the British fleet. The increasing use of drones in contemporary conflicts, such as in Ukraine and Yemen, has driven armed forces to develop innovative solutions to counter these threats.

Focus | What to know about China’s new J-35A stealth fighter as a potential US F-35 competitor	On November 5, 2024, Colonel Niu Wenbo of the Air Force Equipment Department confirmed that China’s latest medium-sized stealth multi-purpose fighter, the J-35A, will be showcased at the 15th China Air Show, scheduled for November 12–17, 2024. Following the press conference, an official photo of the J-35A was released, marking its first public unveiling and signaling its readiness for operational service within the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link With the addition of the J-35A to the J-20, China becomes the second country, after the United States, to possess two operational stealth fighter models simultaneously. (Picture source: Weibo/CCTV News) The development of the J-35A traces back to the J-31/FC-31 Gyrfalcon, a project initiated by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) as a self-funded, export-oriented model. The J-31 prototype first appeared in 2012, generating considerable interest. Over time, the J-31 underwent multiple design changes, including forward-swept intake ramps, DSI bumps, and oblique vertical stabilizers, aiming to create a competitive fighter for the global market. Initially targeted for export, the model eventually attracted attention from the PLA, particularly the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which evaluated a carrier-capable version under the designation J-35. The naval variant completed its maiden flight on October 29, 2021, featuring modifications like a launch bar and folding wings for carrier operations. Significant changes between the earlier FC-31 demonstrator and the J-35A, a land-based variant of the J-35 naval fighter, include a new radome without a pitot tube, an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), updated nose and main landing gear bay doors, a modified Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI), and a redesigned canopy. The airframe now includes a gun pod, a wide-area heads-up display, and a Luneburg lens to assist with radar signature management. Observations indicate that the fighter’s twin vertical stabilizers and twin-engine configuration include a serrated nozzle, which could be powered by either the WS-13 or the RD-33-derived WS-21 engines, both of which offer similar performance levels. Alongside the domestic J-35A variant, an export version, the J-35E, has been developed. However, the carrier-based J-35 variant currently lacks an international market, as few nations possess the extensive resources required for naval operations. The naval J-35 version could provide carrier-based capabilities, though this would be feasible mainly for nations with catapult launch systems, thus narrowing its potential market. Military analyst Li Li, quoted by China Central Television News, states that the J-35A’s induction marks an expansion in the PLAAF’s stealth capabilities, positioning it alongside the J-20. This step could align PLAAF’s capabilities with the U.S. Air Force, which operates the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. Within the PLAAF, the J-35A joins an informal fleet lineup known as the 'Four Musketeers,' comprising the J-10C, J-16, J-20, and the new J-35A. Notably, this reveal coincides with the 75th-anniversary celebrations of the PLAAF, during which the air force will feature 36 different types of equipment through flight demonstrations and static displays. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. Images depict the J-35A positioned in a shelter typically used by the PLAAF, emphasizing its role as a land-based model. However, the new J-35A could potentially serve as a main carrier aircraft in a naval variant, which would align with China’s expanding capabilities in both aerial and maritime domains. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. (Picture source: US DoD and CCTV News) Reports over the years have noted speculation that the J-31’s development, which led to the J-35A, may have drawn on data from the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program, which led to the F-35, though these claims remain unverified. Some Russian aviation experts have asserted that the J-31 is a domestic design, independent of existing Western aircraft. The design's evolution, including stealth capabilities and multi-role features, indicates a continued focus by China on producing advanced fifth-generation fighters. The F-35 and J-35A display clear visual distinctions that suggest differences in design priorities and potential roles. The F-35 has a rounded, gently sloped nose, while the J-35A's nose is sharper with a more defined chine line. This difference is also evident in the canopy shape: the F-35 features a single-piece, bubble-style canopy with a smooth curve, whereas the J-35A’s canopy is slightly more angular and has a flatter profile. In terms of engine exhaust nozzles, the F-35 uses a polygonal design intended to enhance certain performance characteristics, while the J-35A, typically seen with a rounder exhaust, reflects a different approach in nozzle configuration. The intake designs also vary, with the F-35 featuring larger, straight-sided intakes positioned close to the fuselage, and the J-35A’s narrower intakes angled slightly outward, giving it a distinctive shape. The wing shapes and positions add further contrast between the two aircraft. The F-35’s trapezoidal wings integrate with the fuselage in one configuration, while the J-35A’s trapezoidal wings are larger and have a different placement, possibly reflecting considerations for carrier-based operations. The tail fin design diverges as well: the F-35’s vertical stabilizers are shorter and blend closely into the fuselage, while the J-35A’s stabilizers are taller and angled outward, resembling other designs in China's stealth aircraft lineup, such as the J-20. Finally, the landing gear differs in structure and placement. The F-35 has thicker landing gear, positioned in alignment with its structural design, while the J-35A’s landing gear may be adapted for carrier operations, following certain design conventions observed in other Chinese aircraft. These distinctions suggest each aircraft's design reflects specific operational requirements and design philosophies, with the F-35 and J-35A each incorporating elements that align with their respective priorities and roles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-to-know-about-chinas-new-j-35a-stealth-fighter-as-a-potential-us-f-35-competitor	2024-11-05T02:45:23-08:00

This move would be part of a broader Israeli defense strategy aimed at leveraging captured enemy equipment to enhance tactical flexibility and reduce acquisition costs for advanced armament.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During a Golani Brigade operation in the Western Sector of Lebanon, Israeli forces uncovered weaponry, a tunnel system, and underground bunkers that were used by the terror organization Hezbollah. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) The use of captured enemy equipment by the Israeli armed forces is not a new tactic. Since the country’s founding, Israel has seized and integrated various types of enemy material, dating back to conflicts such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1967 Six-Day War. Captured Arab armor and artillery were commonly refurbished and used to supplement Israel’s limited military resources. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, for example, Israel captured Soviet-origin T-54 and T-55 tanks from Syrian and Egyptian forces. These tanks were later refurbished and repurposed, providing Israel with additional armor strength during critical periods of regional conflict. Similarly, in the 1980s, Israel repurposed Soviet-made weaponry captured from various adversaries, particularly during the Lebanon conflict. Captured equipment is often studied intensively to understand its capabilities and limitations, enabling the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to develop effective countermeasures and, if feasible, repurpose this hardware for their own operational needs. The Kornet and Almas anti-tank missiles, seized in recent operations against Hezbollah, represent potent assets in Israel’s anti-tank arsenal. Initially developed by Russia, the Kornet (ATGM 9M133) is a laser-guided anti-tank missile system known for its range, armor-penetrating capability, and precision. With a maximum effective range of up to 5,500 meters, the Kornet can penetrate up to 1,200 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) with its tandem-warhead design, making it a serious threat to modern armored vehicles and even fortified positions. Hezbollah’s use of the Kornet missile in previous conflicts with Israel demonstrated its ability to penetrate even Israel’s Merkava main battle tanks, a lesson the IDF has not forgotten. The Iranian-made Almas missile, another advanced anti-tank weapon, has similar capabilities to the Kornet, boasting high penetration power and a range that allows for significant standoff engagement. Reports indicate that the Almas missile was designed as an indigenous Iranian effort to replicate and even surpass some of the Kornet's capabilities, with a range of up to 8 kilometers in its most recent configurations. The acquisition of these missiles allows the IDF to significantly enhance its ground unit capabilities without procuring similar systems externally. If the IDF formalizes the creation of anti-tank units armed with Kornet and Almas missiles, it could represent a strategic shift in how Israel conducts anti-armor operations. These missiles would allow Israeli forces to engage armored threats at greater distances and in diverse terrains, an asset particularly useful in the hilly and urbanized areas where conflicts with Hezbollah frequently take place. Establishing these units would enable Israel to maximize the efficiency of seized weapons, making them a cost-effective means of bolstering national defense. Moreover, deploying such units could potentially reduce Israel's dependence on more expensive, domestically produced anti-tank systems, such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems' Spike family of missiles. Integrating Kornet and Almas missiles would also provide a tactical advantage in scenarios where these systems are already familiar to enemy forces but are now used against them by IDF personnel. The IDF’s consideration of using captured Kornet and Almas missiles aligns with a long-standing practice of repurposing enemy weapons, which allows Israel to turn adversarial capabilities against their original owners effectively. With tensions high in the region, particularly with Hezbollah in Lebanon, this development underscores the IDF’s commitment to adapting its resources and strategies to emerging threats. By potentially fielding anti-tank units using seized equipment, Israel not only strengthens its own defenses but also leverages an innovative approach that could serve as a model for other nations facing similar strategic challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-israeli-army-explores-formation-of-anti-tank-units-with-seized-hezbollah-kornet-and-almas-missiles	2024-11-04T06:50:46-08:00

French German Railgun Reaches Hypersonic Speeds A New Era of Defense	According to information published by Opex360 on November 3, 2024, the French Navy is set to unveil its new electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at speeds reaching Mach 8.7. This innovation, led by the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) under the Defense Innovation Agency (AID) represents a groundbreaking shift in naval weaponry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unveiling the Future of Naval Artillery: The electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at Mach 8.7, promises unprecedented speed, range, and precision in maritime defense. (Picture source: ISL) Other nations, however, have continued exploring the EMRG’s potential. China, for instance, reportedly tested a railgun from its amphibious assault ship Haiyang Shan, though these claims remain unverified. Japan has also joined the race, with its Ministry of Defense’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA) achieving a first successful test in October 2023, firing a 40 mm projectile at Mach 6.5 with a 5-megajoule railgun. Europe, recognizing the strategic advantages of EMRG technology, has pursued joint projects to bolster its defense capabilities. The European Union tasked the ISL with coordinating the PILUM project (Projectiles for Increased Long-range Effects Using Electromagnetic Railgun), which successfully demonstrated the potential for long-range, high-precision projectile launches over several hundred kilometers. The project’s success led to the establishment of the THEMA (Technology for Electro-Magnetic Artillery) program in June 2023, funded by a €15 million grant from the European Defense Fund (EDF). In a recent move to accelerate development, Japan entered a partnership with France and Germany, signing a Terms of Reference (TOR) agreement. This partnership paves the way for collaboration between Japan’s ATLA and the ISL, aiming to advance electromagnetic weapons technology across borders. The French General Directorate for Armament (DGA) has initiated an ambitious program to develop an electromagnetic railgun for the French Navy, known as the RAILGUN project. This project aims to strengthen the Navy's capabilities against evolving maritime threats, particularly hypersonic and saturation attacks. Leveraging electromagnetic energy to propel projectiles at extreme velocities, the railgun is designed for high precision over extended distances, with a reported range exceeding 200 kilometers. This impressive range, coupled with the railgun’s reduced projectile flight times, provides distinct advantages in defensive operations, especially in intercepting fast-moving aerial threats. As detailed by AID (Agence de l'Innovation de Défense), the RAILGUN system is set to bring notable advancements to French naval warfare. Positioned on a vessel's bow, the system would maximize anti-air efficacy by decreasing engagement times and allowing for rapid, high-velocity impacts that increase the likelihood of neutralizing incoming threats. Additionally, since railgun technology eliminates the need for conventional explosive propellants, it can reduce space requirements for ammunition storage on board, enabling vessels to carry more rounds and potentially reduce resupply needs. ISL, for its part, confirmed that the railgun presented at Euronaval can accelerate projectiles to 3,000 meters per second – equivalent to 10,800 km/h or Mach 8.7. Given that speeds above Mach 5 qualify as hypersonic, this weapon stands as a formidable advancement in naval defense technology. The mechanics of an electromagnetic railgun involve creating a magnetic field between two conductive rails through a high-intensity electric current. This field accelerates the projectile, itself a conductor, via the Lorentz force. However, achieving such extreme velocities presents significant challenges. The materials used must withstand intense mechanical stress, and the system requires an immense energy source capable of instantaneous release. As the French Navy moves forward with the RAILGUN project, the electromagnetic railgun could revolutionize naval artillery, setting a new standard in range, speed, and firepower.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-german-railgun-reaches-hypersonic-speeds-a-new-era-of-defense	2024-11-04T05:49:42-08:00

(Picture source: North Korean Press agency KCNA) The Hwasong-19’s ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile) development highlights North Korea's strategic focus on solid-fuel technology, which provides operational advantages over older liquid-fuel systems. Solid-fuel ICBMs can be launched with minimal preparation, enabling rapid deployment and reducing vulnerability to preemptive strikes. These attributes, combined with its purported extended range, position the Hwasong-19 as a pivotal asset in North Korea's military strategy aimed at deterring perceived threats, particularly from the United States and its allies​. Kim Jong-un personally supervised the launch, which North Korean media labeled as a 'strategic demonstration.' The missile was launched on a high-angle, lofted trajectory to maximize safety and minimize the risk of escalation by ensuring it did not fly over neighboring territories. Analysts estimate that if launched on a standard trajectory, the Hwasong-19 could cover distances exceeding 13,000 kilometers, enough to target the U.S. mainland. North Korea’s continued development and testing of solid-fuel ICBMs indicate an accelerated effort to achieve reliable, long-range strike capabilities amidst heightened regional tensions​. The launch has intensified regional security concerns, prompting swift reactions from neighboring countries and international stakeholders. Both the United States and South Korea condemned the test, underscoring it as a violation of United Nations resolutions that prohibit North Korea from testing ballistic missile technology. The test represents North Korea’s latest step in bolstering its missile arsenal and enhancing its strategic deterrent, as it showcases an increasingly sophisticated approach to missile mobility, reliability, and rapid deployment capabilities. In recent years, North Korea has steadily advanced its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities, transitioning from early liquid-fuel systems to cutting-edge solid-fuel technology. This evolution, marked by successive tests and incremental improvements, underscores a shift in North Korea’s nuclear and strategic missile posture. The Hwasong-19 launch on October 31, 2024, is part of this trend, showcasing Pyongyang's enhanced missile range, readiness, and operational flexibility, which align with its stated goals of countering perceived U.S. and allied threats. Historically, North Korea’s earlier liquid-fuel ICBMs, such as the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, demonstrated its long-range strike potential. However, these systems were slower to deploy and required extensive preparation time, making them susceptible to detection and preemptive strikes. The recent development of solid-fuel ICBMs like the Hwasong-18, tested multiple times in 2023, and now the Hwasong-19, signals a notable leap in North Korea’s missile capabilities. Solid-fuel missiles are faster to launch, more mobile, and easier to conceal, allowing North Korea greater operational agility. These advancements enable a 'launch-on-demand' capability that significantly reduces the time needed for ICBM launch preparation, thus enhancing North Korea's strategic deterrence​. The progression from the Hwasong-18 to the Hwasong-19 reflects North Korea's rapid technological strides in missile systems. The Hwasong-18, first tested in early 2023, demonstrated an estimated range of 15,000 km, enough to cover the entire continental United States if launched on a standard trajectory. The Hwasong-19, reportedly an evolution of the Hwasong-18, may incorporate similar or extended range capabilities, placing nearly all North America within reach depending on its payload configuration. Such improvements suggest a potential for multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). This technology would enable a single missile to strike various targets, further complicating missile defense efforts in the region​. Regionally, North Korea’s advancements have amplified security concerns among neighboring countries and the United States. Both South Korea and Japan have bolstered their missile defense systems and conducted joint exercises with the U.S. in response to North Korea’s increasingly sophisticated ICBMs. This recent test also follows increased cooperation between North Korea and Russia, signaling potential technological or strategic exchanges that could accelerate further advancements in North Korean missile technology. These developments underscore an evolving nuclear landscape in East Asia, where North Korea's shift to highly survivable, road-mobile, solid-fuel ICBMs enhances its deterrence posture and increases the risks and complexities of regional security dynamics. With each successful test, North Korea inches closer to a fully operational, flexible, and deployable ICBM force capable of presenting a continuous strategic threat to U.S. territories and allies across the Pacific. As North Korea advances its missile program, the Hwasong-19 test underscores a shift in its nuclear posture, marked by an increased readiness to deploy advanced missile systems in a more flexible and survivable form, raising the stakes in the ongoing geopolitical dynamics in East Asia.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-test-fires-most-powerful-icbm-missile-hwasong-19-capable-of-reaching-us-territory	2024-11-01T03:26:20-07:00

This move aims to sustain combat-ready assets amid tightening budget constraints.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US Navy's first Arleigh-Burke class destroyer USS Arleigh Burke. (Picture source: US DoD) Following a comprehensive, ship-by-ship assessment, the Department of the Navy concluded that these destroyers possess sufficient hull integrity, combat capabilities, and technical resilience to operate past their anticipated service termination. This service extension will collectively add 48 years of service to the Navy's surface fleet, spanning from 2028 through 2035. Funding for the program has been proposed within the fiscal year 2026 budget, reflecting a forward-looking shift in the Navy’s shipbuilding strategy. Secretary Del Toro highlighted that the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers play a 'vital role' in global power projection and are essential to the Navy’s strategic deterrence in contested regions. Adm. Franchetti expressed that the decision reflects the Navy’s focus on prioritizing investments to maintain a strong Battle Force Inventory and meet the strategic imperatives of both peacetime and conflict scenarios. In her view, this decision ensures the United States can continue to project power and protect its interests globally, especially amid fiscal challenges. Comments The U.S. Navy’s decision to extend the service life of 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers is indicative of broader financial challenges affecting its fleet readiness and modernization. This strategy of prolonging existing ships' lifespans over investing in new vessels reveals a budgetary restraint that has raised concerns, especially amid heightened global security tensions. While extending these vessels offers a short-term fix to maintain a robust fleet presence, it underscores a potential compromise in the Navy’s ability to keep pace with technological advancements and fleet expansion needs. The current fiscal approach limits the Navy's shipbuilding budget, impacting programs critical for fleet growth. For example, shipbuilding projects are already experiencing underfunding, with cuts affecting the production of key vessels, such as the Virginia-class submarines and Constellation-class frigates. This budgetary constraint not only slows the introduction of advanced vessels but could also erode long-term fleet capacity and readiness. By focusing on immediate, cost-saving measures like service extensions, the Navy may fall behind on investments in next-generation capabilities that are essential for countering threats in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Additionally, the push to maintain older ships might hinder innovation, particularly in the context of U.S.-China competition. The Navy's modernization budget prioritizes essential research and technology development, but reduced funding in areas like Science and Technology Research (cut by 30% this year) risks stifling growth in critical domains such as cybersecurity, information warfare, and next-gen shipbuilding. In an era where technological dominance plays a pivotal role in strategic deterrence, these reductions raise questions about the sustainability of the Navy's long-term defense posture. Experts caution that it could weaken the Navy’s future operational effectiveness and innovation pipeline, leaving it potentially underprepared against rapidly advancing global powers like China and Russia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/in-response-to-china-us-navy-extends-arleigh-burke-class-destroyers-lifespan	2024-10-31T08:09:32-07:00

South Korea Warns of Looming North Korean Nuclear Test Before US Election	On October 30, 2024, South Korea’s Ministry of Defense informed lawmakers that North Korea appears ready for a seventh nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, potentially timed with the U.S. presidential election on November 5. Intelligence obtained during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggye-ri site, with specific equipment and launch units in place, likely for an ICBM launch designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target (Picture source: KCNA) The session, conducted by representatives of South Korean military intelligence, also revealed signs of North Korean troops mobilized in Russia. Some units are reported to have joined the frontlines in the Kursk region, where Russian forces face Ukrainian counteroffensives. This deployment, observers note, underscores the strengthened strategic alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict, a factor North Korea appears to be leveraging to intensify its military activities. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been ramping up displays of power in recent months, accelerating missile tests and revealing a secret military-grade uranium production facility in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely a 12-axle model recently shown in state media, for an ICBM launch potentially reaching U.S. territory. This move aligns with warnings from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that Pyongyang may orchestrate significant military provocations around U.S. elections to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target. While previous North Korean ICBM tests were conducted at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid neighboring territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advancement in North Korea’s missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea’s capability to target distant locations, including the U.S. mainland. The escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programs under reduced international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from South Korean authorities leave little doubt regarding Kim Jong Un’s intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with powers outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has pursued nuclear capabilities to bolster its deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric armament strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in nuclear warhead miniaturization and ICBM development, such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of targeting the U.S., thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea strategically positions itself, the U.S. and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. The possibility of a nuclear test and an ICBM launch around the U.S. election period introduces an air of uncertainty, underscoring the importance of maintaining international vigilance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-warns-of-looming-north-korean-nuclear-test-before-us-election	2024-10-30T03:23:55-07:00	
US future Liberty Lifter seaplane to revolutionize sea logistics with 22,000 kg cargo capacity	On October 29, 2024, Aurora Flight Sciences, a subsidiary of Boeing, released a new video demonstrating the Liberty Lifter seaplane concept, part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program.

Tow tank testing has been completed at the Stevens Institute of Technology and Virginia Tech to validate hydrodynamic models and seakeeping performance, while propeller performance characterization has been conducted in preparation for wind tunnel tests scheduled for early 2025. A cockpit simulation lab is also under construction for testing pilot interaction with advanced control systems for flying in ground effect over high sea states. The project is now in Phase 1B, which includes ongoing design refinement and testing, leading up to a preliminary design review. The next phase, Phase 2, will involve further development and a critical design review, with Phase 3 planned for 2026. Phase 3 includes manufacturing the demonstrator aircraft, followed by flight testing, which is projected to start in 2028. The Liberty Lifter project was initiated by DARPA in mid-2022 to explore the potential of a seaplane that uses ground effect to transport large loads while operating independently of runways. Unlike earlier ekranoplan designs, the Liberty Lifter is expected to perform in moderate to rough sea conditions and fly at altitudes up to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). In February 2023, DARPA awarded contracts to two companies for competing designs. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems partnered with Maritime Applied Physics Corporation, while Aurora Flight Sciences teamed with Leidos subsidiary Gibbs &amp; Cox. Aurora's design features a monohull with a high-wing configuration and relies on eight turbine engines, a concept similar to Boeing's earlier Pelican proposal. Initial contracts awarded in 2023 provided funding for the development of both teams' designs, with Aurora receiving around $5.6 million. DARPA exercised further funding options in mid-2023, providing Aurora with an additional $19.5 million to continue its design work. The final designs for Phase 1 were expected by mid-2024, and in May 2024, DARPA selected Aurora's design to move forward with an $8.3 million contract modification. The demonstrator aircraft, scaled to the size of a C-130 Hercules, is expected to have a wingspan of 213 feet and be capable of lifting 50,000 pounds of cargo. If successful, this design will be scaled up to match the cargo capacity of a C-17, carrying 180,000 pounds (81,647 kilograms). The Liberty Lifter is designed to operate less than 100 feet (30 meters) above sea level in ground effect, enabling efficient long-distance travel with a range of 6,500 nautical miles (12,000 kilometers). It is also designed to meet the U.S. Department of Defense's heavy-lift requirements, capable of carrying a load equivalent to two U.S. Marine Corps Amphibious Combat Vehicles or six 20-foot (6-meter) storage containers. Aurora's design, selected over that of General Atomics, is now moving toward the next phase of development, with a flying prototype expected by 2027 or early 2028.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-future-liberty-lifter-seaplane-to-revolutionize-sea-logistics-with-22-000-kg-cargo-capacity	2024-10-30T03:21:55-07:00

The Trophy Active Protection System enhances defense against anti-tank threats. The Trophy Active Protection System (APS), developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is a vehicle-mounted defense system designed to protect against various anti-tank threats, including rockets and guided missiles. Operational in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since 2011, it uses multiple radar panels to detect incoming projectiles and neutralizes them by firing countermeasures, intercepting the threat before it reaches the vehicle. This system has been integrated into key Israeli platforms, such as the Merkava tank and Namer APC, and has attracted significant interest from other countries, including the U.S., which has equipped the M1 Abrams with Trophy, and Germany, which has fitted it to the Leopard 2. Despite successful interception, passive armor remains necessary, as fragments of neutralized projectiles may still impact the tank. Each launcher provides more than 180 degrees of coverage, ensuring 360-degree protection. The system operates autonomously, with the tank commander controlling only whether it is active or not. The Trophy's combat-proven capabilities have demonstrated a high interception rate, especially during operations involving the Israeli Defense Forces. It has also been successfully tested by European armies. In addition to protection, the system provides situational awareness through its Fire Source Location (FSL) capability, allowing vehicles to locate and respond to enemy fire effectively. As of 2023, the system has been fielded on more than 1,000 vehicles worldwide, underscoring its role as a critical component in modern armored warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-equips-leopard-2a7a1-tank-with-trophy-aps-to-enhance-protection-against-missiles	2024-10-30T03:09:57-07:00

Military doctors conducted emergency procedures and life-support drills. Piracy Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters has seen fluctuating trends in 2024, marked by a resurgence of high-severity incidents. Despite a global decrease in piracy rates, piracy remains persistent in this region, largely due to geopolitical instability and economic incentives for Somali pirate groups. Notably, Somali pirates have recently resumed hijackings, employing fishing vessels as 'mother ships' to launch skiff-based attacks on passing merchant ships, especially those less protected by armed security or defensive measures. Pirate tactics in the Gulf of Aden often include kidnapping crews for ransom, with recent months witnessing heightened violence against captured individuals. While many attacks are thwarted by security teams and vessel hardening measures, pirates continue to exploit vessels lacking rigorous defenses. Reports highlight cases where pirates intercept vessels using false distress calls or approach vessels under the guise of local fishermen, increasing the risk of misunderstandings and violence. The ongoing regional conflict, particularly involving Houthi attacks and Iranian-backed groups, has also destabilized the Gulf of Aden, further threatening commercial shipping. The recent uptick in anti-ship missile and drone attacks, some targeting vessels linked to Western interests, underscores the rising regional complexity. Consequently, international naval task forces such as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s Operation Aspides have expanded their protective scope to secure critical shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinese-navy-conducts-advanced-anti-piracy-drills-in-gulf-of-aden	2024-10-30T02:54:08-07:00

However, in-depth analyses are needed to assess the video’s authenticity, especially by examining shadows and lighting that appear consistent. The difficulty of replicating these effects in natural conditions raises the possibility of alteration, although there is no conclusive evidence to affirm that the video is fabricated. The emergence of this footage echoes recent reports from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) documents that reveal the existence of Israeli stealth drones with reconnaissance and attack capabilities. According to these documents, which U.S. authorities have not disputed, Israel possesses a fleet of stealth drones capable of long-range operations, potentially for missions in Iran. Although technical specifications and capabilities of this model, supposedly named RA-01, have not been confirmed, its deployment at Ramon Airbase in the Negev Desert is suggested in the documents. This location reportedly includes specific facilities to house unique aircraft, potentially intended for stealth drones. Satellite images reveal fenced areas at the base with semi-circular hangars and access routes to the runways, developed over the last decade. The construction of these facilities could be associated with infrastructure needs to house and deploy strategic platforms like the RA-01. While Israel has a longstanding tradition in stealth technology development, this drone would represent a significant asset in its surveillance and discreet strike capabilities, especially given its geopolitical stance toward Iran. Observers suggest that the RA-01 may also have been involved in recent operations, including strikes on Iranian infrastructure. However, the lack of tangible evidence and the opacity surrounding the aircraft leave room for the possibility of a disinformation strategy, potentially amplified by the leaked classified documents that may contain strategic exaggerations. In the context of heightened surveillance and operations in contested airspaces, the RA-01 could play a pivotal role in enabling Israel to conduct discreet intelligence-gathering and targeted strikes. Its stealth and extended range would provide Israel with new tactical options for high-value strategic missions. In a region marked by enduring tensions, possession of such a drone would offer Israel significant operational flexibility, allowing it to monitor sensitive areas and prepare potential strikes without immediate risk of detection.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/possible-appearance-of-israeli-ra-01-drone-over-lebanon-after-intelligence-leak	2024-10-30T01:18:22-07:00

Inside Israel’s Precision Strikes and Hezbollah’s Missile Arsenal in Lebanon Conflict	The US Congress has published a document on the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah in October 25, 2024, which escalated after Hamas-led attacks on Israel in October 2023. Key aspects of this conflict highlight the advanced military material and capabilities at play, with significant losses on both sides. Israel has focused its efforts on undermining Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, while Hezbollah’s material resources, including advanced missiles and drones, underscore the group's resilient military stance despite substantial setbacks.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link IDF soldiers discovered a cache of weapons, including grenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, combat vests, Kornet missiles, and other arms, inside a mosque located within a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon. (Picture source: Israel Defense Forces) Israel’s campaign has demonstrated formidable air power, relying heavily on precision-guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and advanced electronic warfare capabilities. The Israeli Air Force, with its fleet of F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters, has executed deep-penetration missions into Lebanese and Syrian territories, targeting Hezbollah's command centers and high-ranking leadership. Israel’s networked command and control systems facilitate coordinated strikes that are highly precise and capable of minimizing collateral damage, thus reinforcing its tactical upper hand. These air operations are supplemented by ground forces equipped with guided missiles and precision artillery, making Israeli forces exceptionally lethal in limited cross-border incursions. Israel's electronic warfare units have also disrupted Hezbollah's communications and tracking capabilities, a critical part of their strategy to undermine the group's command structure. Coupled with sophisticated intelligence operations, Israel’s ability to penetrate Hezbollah's defenses has been effective, targeting major figures within the organization, including the group's long-standing leader, Hassan Nasrallah. This intelligence-driven approach not only weakened Hezbollah’s operational structure but also underscored Israel’s mastery in cyber and signals intelligence, allowing it to predict and intercept Hezbollah’s strategic moves. Despite these losses, Hezbollah retains significant military material and resources, sourced primarily through its longstanding alliance with Iran. Precision-guided missiles, drones, and anti-tank weapons form the backbone of Hezbollah’s arsenal, enabling it to mount a sustained resistance and keep up the pressure on Israeli targets. Iran’s advanced weaponry, including Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles, provides Hezbollah with extended reach, posing a direct threat to Israel's population centers.

Pentagon Faces Shortage of Air-Defense Missiles Amid Rising Demand	The United States is experiencing a reduction in its stockpile of air-defense missiles, raising concerns about the Pentagon's readiness to respond to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, as well as potential conflicts in the Pacific. These concerns, highlighted in a recent The Wall Street Journal article on October 29, 2024, focus on interceptors that are essential for countering missile and drone threats in the region. Demand for these munitions has surged as U.S. allies, notably Israel, confront escalating attacks orchestrated by Iran and affiliated militias. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An SM-3 Block 1B interceptor is launched from the USS Lake Erie during an MDA test (Picture source: US DoD) Since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, the United States has deployed over 100 Standard Missiles—interceptors typically launched from ships, crucial for countering Iranian threats and Houthi attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea. This rapid consumption, further accelerated by recent Israeli strikes against Iran, has heightened concerns about the U.S.'s ability to meet growing demands for these munitions, particularly should a conflict arise in the Pacific. The term Standard Missile in this context refers to a series of air-defense missiles developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies) for the U.S. Navy, including models such as the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), and Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). These ship-launched missiles are critical for countering a variety of threats, from ballistic missiles to cruise missiles and aircraft, and are integrated into naval defense systems to protect U.S. forces and allies like Israel. The SM-2 primarily serves medium-range anti-aircraft defense, while the SM-3 and SM-6 add extended capabilities for intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles. The SM-2 is designed for medium-range air defense, capable of intercepting aircraft and cruise missiles within a range of approximately 170 kilometers at speeds of up to Mach 3. The SM-3, with greater range, is intended to neutralize ballistic missiles during their exo-atmospheric phase with a kinetic warhead, reaching targets up to 500 kilometers away. The SM-6 combines both anti-aircraft and anti-missile functions with a range of around 240 kilometers, excelling at intercepting low-altitude cruise missiles and high-speed aerial threats with multi-mode guidance. Pentagon officials, while keeping stockpile data classified to prevent strategic leverage by Iran and its allies, have acknowledged heightened pressure on resources. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh indicated that the Department of Defense is adjusting its posture to protect U.S. forces and support Israel, while maintaining focus on readiness and stockpiles. The high rate of interceptor use by the Pentagon raises challenges for responding to unexpected demands in both the Middle East and Europe. Additional concerns involve the responsiveness of the defense industry, which is often constrained by the need to expand production lines, facilities, and qualified personnel. Elias Yousif, Deputy Director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, noted that the U.S. has not developed a defense industrial base suited to prolonged attritional conflict, which complicates the current situation. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has advocated for increased production of Standard Missiles, though he acknowledged the challenges associated with producing such sophisticated munitions. The Pentagon is exploring alternative solutions, including soliciting new companies to help boost production of air-defense missiles. Despite recent stockpile increases, the launch rate observed in recent months has exceeded production capacity, according to defense analysts and officials. RTX, the manufacturer of Standard Missiles, produces a few hundred annually, though these munitions are also supplied to over 14 U.S. allies, limiting availability for the Pentagon. RTX spokesperson Chris Johnson stated that the company closely collaborates with the Department of Defense to meet production needs. Since the onset of the Hamas-Israel conflict last year, U.S. ships have launched over $1.8 billion in interceptors to protect Israel and ships passing through the Red Sea from Iranian threats. On average, two interceptors are launched per incoming missile to ensure accuracy, resulting in high costs to counter less sophisticated targets, such as Houthi drones. A congressional official noted that while costly, these munitions take months to replace. Last month, the U.S. deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to Israel, allowing the use of other types of interceptors in addition to Standard Missiles. The Pentagon also repositioned Patriot missile defense systems in the region, though their availability remains limited due to commitments in Ukraine. While the Pentagon aims to maintain current Standard Missile production levels, it may reduce production of older variants to fund newer models. The pace of interceptor use in the Middle East, however, could jeopardize U.S. readiness for a Pacific conflict. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery emphasized that the current use of Standard Missiles risks compromising the Navy’s preparedness for Pacific operations, underscoring the strategic impact of prolonged Middle Eastern engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/pentagon-faces-shortage-of-air-defense-missiles-amid-rising-demand	2024-10-29T07:07:52-07:00	
France's Navy enters Taiwan Strait Following US and Canadian Warships	According to information published by Yahoo on October 29, 2024, following the United States and Canada, France has now sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait amid heightened cross-strait tensions. This move by France comes shortly after China’s recent military exercises in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Navy's Floreal class frigate during exercise with Japanese Mogami-class frigate JS Noshiro. (Picture source: JMSDF) On October 20, the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins and the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver passed through the strait. According to The Mirror Media, the French Navy’s Floréal-class frigate Prairial (F731) sailed through the strait, moving from south to north. This transit aligns with the vessel’s recent regional activity, following its goodwill visit to Cebu from October 22 to 25. French military presence within the first island chain is quite frequent. Earlier this year, between April and May, the French Navy’s frigate Vendémiaire (F734) and Bretagne (D655) also conducted visits to the Philippines. Recent typhoon activity, including Typhoon Typhoon Saola and Typhoon Kanun, likely influenced Prairial’s timing to ensure safe and controlled navigation. France’s approach differs from the United States, as the French Navy typically refrains from issuing overt political statements during such transits. While the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) often dispatches ships to shadow foreign vessels in the region, it generally refrains from public commentary unless prompted by any perceived provocations. French Navy France’s stance on Taiwan and China is centered on maintaining freedom of navigation and supporting a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing non-confrontational yet assertive actions. As the only EU country with territories in the Indo-Pacific, France considers itself an Indo-Pacific power with obligations to uphold international laws in areas like the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. This commitment is driven by concerns over China's aggressive actions, such as military drills and territorial claims that disregard international rulings. In practice, the French Navy has regularly conducted freedom of navigation operations, sending vessels like the destroyer Lorraine to the South China Sea and the frigate Prairial through the Taiwan Strait. These moves are positioned as stabilizing efforts rather than provocations. French lawmakers have openly criticized China's actions, noting that Beijing's moves threaten not only regional stability but also global trade security, reinforcing France's resolve to maintain peace and security in the strait through strategic partnerships and multilateral dialogues​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/frances-navy-enters-taiwan-strait-following-us-and-canadian-warships	2024-10-29T06:51:08-07:00

Germany to Develop Next-Gen Taurus Neo Cruise Missile after Ukraine War Lessons	On October 27, 2024, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced an ambitious project to develop an advanced version of the Taurus cruise missile. This project, which involves acquiring 600 units of the new model called the Taurus Neo, comes as Ukraine increasingly calls on Berlin to provide long-range weapons to counter Russian attacks on its territory. The decision to develop the Taurus Neo marks a significant step in modernizing Germany's military capabilities and strengthening its strategic position in a tense geopolitical context. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link MBDA Taurus EX Air-Launched Cruise Missile (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Taurus Neo project aims to enhance the capabilities of the existing Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile. According to parliamentary sources, the planned developments will include increased range, improved accuracy, and enhanced explosive power. The project's total cost is estimated at approximately €2.1 billion for acquiring 600 missiles, with initial deliveries expected from 2029. To launch the development, an initial funding of €350 million is required starting in 2025, while most of the budget will be allocated after 2029. The technical improvements of the Taurus Neo are expected to include a range exceeding 500 km, enabling it to reach more distant targets with greater accuracy. The guidance system will be modernized, integrating advanced inertial navigation and GPS correction technologies to improve precision on hard-to-reach targets. The missile is also expected to be equipped with a more powerful warhead, designed to penetrate heavily reinforced structures, such as bunkers or underground shelters. Additionally, the Taurus Neo may incorporate technologies to bypass missile defense systems, thus enhancing its ability to evade radars and penetrate enemy air defenses. The decision to launch the Taurus Neo project comes in a context where the war in Ukraine has heightened security concerns in Europe. Since the beginning of the conflict, Russia has intensified its use of cruise missiles to target strategic and civilian infrastructure, underscoring Ukraine's need for similar retaliatory capabilities. In response, the United Kingdom and France have already provided Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, which Ukrainian forces have adapted for use on Soviet-made aircraft. These missiles, equipped with sophisticated guidance systems combining GPS, inertial navigation, and infrared imaging (IIR), are mainly used to strike heavily defended targets like ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical hubs behind Russian lines. The Taurus KEPD 350, with its 500 km range and enhanced penetration capabilities, would offer Ukraine additional capabilities to target critical infrastructure and strategic points in Russia, particularly in Crimea. Unlike the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG missiles, the Taurus is equipped with a dual-stage warhead specifically designed to destroy heavily fortified and deeply buried targets. Currently, the German armed forces have about 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, primarily used from Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, it is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming retirement of the Tornado raises questions about the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. The Eurofighter appears to be the most likely option, while integration on the F-35A, recently ordered by Germany, seems unlikely without a complete redesign of the missile to fit the internal bay of the American stealth fighter. In the longer term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo within the framework of the SCAF (Future Combat Air System) program, a next-generation fighter project developed in collaboration with France, Spain, and Belgium. The SCAF is expected to play a central role in modernizing European air capabilities in the coming decades. The development of the Taurus Neo could have considerable implications for European defense. As a long-range precision weapon, this missile could strengthen Germany's deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic options for the continent's collective defense. The modernization of the German armed forces is part of a broader effort to respond to new security threats exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and rising tensions with Russia. However, funding for the Taurus Neo project remains a major challenge for the German government. The 2025 budget will need to include the €350 million necessary to launch the development, and expenses in subsequent years could be affected by current budget constraints. Nonetheless, the support expressed by the government coalition suggests a favorable outcome for the project, despite potential debates in Parliament on the appropriateness of prioritizing such expenditures in a challenging economic context. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project comes just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at rapidly developing new, more advanced long-range strike weapons than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK's membership in the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), an initiative led by France and involving Germany, Poland, and Italy. ELSA aims to develop a missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 km by the 2030s. Although the integration of the Taurus Neo into these programs remains uncertain, the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe reflects an increasing awareness of the need to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities in the face of emerging threats. The Taurus Neo project could therefore fit into a broader dynamic aimed at bolstering collective security on the European continent while positioning Germany as a key player in the development of new defense technologies. The development of advanced cruise missiles, such as the Taurus KEPD 350, represents a critical strategic asset for Western armed forces, particularly in the context of modern conflicts where precision and long-range strike capabilities are crucial. For Ukraine, the use of missiles provided by its allies, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, has demonstrated the effectiveness of these weapons in striking deep behind enemy lines at strategic targets. These missiles allow for the neutralization of critical military infrastructure, such as ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical nodes, thereby disrupting adversary operations and weakening their support capabilities for frontline forces. The Taurus, with its extended 500 km range and reinforced penetration capability, would offer Ukraine increased ability to target strategic sites in Crimea or Russia, expanding the range and impact of Ukrainian operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-to-develop-next-gen-taurus-neo-cruise-missile-after-ukraine-war-lessons	2024-10-29T04:15:55-07:00

Diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco have been strained since Algeria cut ties in 2021, citing Morocco’s support for separatist movements in Kabylie and its backing of Western Sahara claims. Morocco, meanwhile, has received international backing for its autonomy plan for Western Sahara, further intensifying the rivalry. Both countries have engaged in an arms race, boosting their military capabilities while maintaining a tense but non-violent standoff. The militarization on both sides continues, although a full-scale conflict remains unlikely. In this context, the Iskander system plays a significant role in Algeria's military planning, particularly due to its capacity to target strategic locations in Morocco. The system’s longer range, compared to Morocco’s M142 HIMARS system, allows it to reach targets such as command centers and air defenses. Morocco's HIMARS system, which has a range of up to 300 kilometers using ATACMS missiles, is designed for rapid fire support and precision strikes on fortified positions and troop concentrations. While the HIMARS offers greater battlefield mobility, the Iskander system’s longer range and hypersonic capabilities provide Algeria with a broader set of strategic options. Algeria's defense budget has grown significantly in recent years, reaching $18.3 billion in 2023, largely due to increased revenues from gas exports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This funding has supported the procurement of military equipment, primarily from Russia and China, including the Iskander system. The growing military rivalry with Morocco has also been reflected in Algerian domestic politics, where anti-Moroccan rhetoric is frequently used in election campaigns to gain popular support. Despite occasional calls for dialogue, tensions between Algeria and Morocco remain high, and the ongoing arms buildup indicates that a resolution is unlikely in the near future. The Iskander system’s appearance in the upcoming military parade further signals Algeria’s intent to maintain and demonstrate its military capabilities in response to regional security concerns. As both countries continue to acquire advanced military technology, the potential for future conflict, while not imminent, remains a significant issue. Algeria’s acquisition of the Russian Iskander and Morocco’s procurement of the American HIMARS in 2023 highlights the continuing arms race in North Africa. The Iskander system, with its longer range and ability to strike strategic targets, complements Algeria's defense strategy, while Morocco’s HIMARS provides tactical flexibility on the battlefield. The presence of the Iskander system in Algeria's military forces underscores the ongoing competition for military superiority in the region, as both countries seek to reinforce their positions without engaging in direct conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/algeria-reveals-acquisition-of-russian-iskander-e-ballistic-missile-system	2024-10-29T02:30:19-07:00

South Korea Moves Up Deployment of Its Iron Dome in Response to North Korean Threats	South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced on October 29, 2024, that it has approved a plan to advance the deployment schedule of the country's Low Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system by two years, setting its operational timeframe between 2029 and 2033. This decision, disclosed during a National Defense Ministry committee meeting, reflects South Korea’s response to rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula as North Korea intensifies its provocations, compelling Seoul to enhance protection against potential attacks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA (Picture source: Rafael) The LAMD system, launched in 2022 with development expected to continue through 2033, is designed to strengthen South Korea's air defense capabilities against artillery fire and missile threats from the North. Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA. This system comprises radar, an engagement control center, launchers, and interceptor missiles to mitigate the impact of long-range artillery strikes from North Korea. DAPA has also approved the second phase of upgrades to its Patriot defense system, including the acquisition of the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system. This advanced system employs more agile and precise hit-to-kill interceptors rather than fragmentation warheads, as in previous versions. The PAC-3 system supports up to sixteen missiles per launcher compared to four with PAC-2, offering increased range and improved radar and tracking capabilities. These defense systems will operate alongside existing assets, including Patriot systems and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system provided by the United States, which targets missiles in their terminal phase upon reentry. THAAD’s initial deployment in South Korea in 2017 prompted objections from China due to the system’s powerful radar, capable of monitoring regional military activities. In response, China imposed economic and cultural sanctions, including restrictions on group travel to South Korea, leading former President Moon Jae-in to pledge not to increase THAAD deployments on South Korean soil. Tensions have escalated further with recent provocations from North Korea, including debris-laden balloons launched towards Seoul as retaliation against propaganda balloons sent by South Korean activists. Seoul, located just 55 kilometers from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and vulnerable to artillery strikes, remains particularly concerned about the thousands of artillery systems stationed by North Korea near the border. In parallel, South Korea is progressing with the development of its Long-range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) system, designed to intercept missiles at altitudes of 50 to 60 kilometers. This component of the Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system integrates with the PAC-3 and Cheongung II, enabling a multi-layered defense against North Korean missile threats. In addition to air defense initiatives, the South Korean government has approved a significant update to the K2 Black Panther main battle tank project. To reduce reliance on foreign equipment, the next 150 K2 tanks for the South Korean army will be outfitted with domestically developed transmissions by SNT Dynamics, alongside locally manufactured engines. This transmission system will also be exported to Turkey for use in the Altay battle tanks. Since the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea has strengthened its position as a major supplier of military equipment, particularly to European nations where defense demand has significantly increased. By consolidating its capabilities and enhancing self-reliance in defense, South Korea aims to establish itself as a prominent player on the international military stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-moves-up-deployment-of-its-iron-dome-in-response-to-north-korean-threats	2024-10-29T02:16:55-07:00	
SWATT Training: Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group Advances Warfighting Capabilities	According to information published by the US DoD on October 23, 2024, the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRF CSG) is actively participating in the Surface Warfare Advanced Tactical Training (SWATT), an intense at-sea training program designed to enhance warfighting capabilities and tactical proficiency across multiple domains.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crew members on the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the largest aircraft carrier in the world, perform flight operations while navigating the Atlantic Ocean. (Picture source: DVIDS) Overseen by the Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), SWATT is a critical phase in preparing units for deployment, allowing for integration and real-time tactical development. The Gerald R. Ford CSG consists of a formidable array of assets, including the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81), USS Mitscher (DDG 57), USS Mahan (DDG 72), USS Bainbridge (DDG 96), and USS Forrest Sherman (DDG 98). These vessels are supported by the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8, which adds a critical aerial dimension to the group's operations. SWATT provides a diverse range of training scenarios, bringing together individual, team, and unit-level exercises designed to sharpen the warfighting capabilities of each component. It also includes integrated in-port, live virtual construct, and at-sea training evolutions, which build on the tactical knowledge and proficiency of each participant. The goal is to deliver multi-domain combatants ready for full-spectrum combat operations. Led by SMWDC, SWATT is the premier advanced tactical training exercise tailored for the surface fleet, pushing units to achieve new levels of tactical precision and adaptability.

General Atomics hints at Gambit UAS Autonomous Combat Airpower from aircraft carriers	General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc (GA-ASI) gave a glimpse into the future of naval aviation in a tweet published on October 28, 2024, which generated a lot of interest, hinting at a potentially game-changing capability: autonomous combat air power launched directly from an aircraft carrier.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales and the . (Picture source: General Atomics GA-ASI) To be operational from an aircraft carrier, the Gambit UAS would need compatibility with launch and recovery processes specific to such vessels. Traditional carrier aircraft require catapults and arresting gear, suggesting that Gambit might either integrate with these systems or leverage STOL (Short Takeoff and Landing) or VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) capabilities to launch and recover independently. This flexibility would be advantageous, especially in diverse mission contexts where rapid deployment and retrieval are crucial. The Gambit UAS, as an autonomous system, would require sophisticated AI integration for combat effectiveness. This involves real-time threat assessment, targeting, and evasive maneuvering. A robust suite of sensors, including radar, electro-optical, and infrared, would enable it to prioritize targets autonomously. Advanced onboard AI would further enable the UAS to make tactical decisions without human input, adapting to dynamic combat environments by adjusting its mission parameters as conditions change. Swarming technology would likely enhance Gambit’s role, allowing it to operate in coordination with other drones or manned aircraft in complex combat scenarios, facilitating both offensive and defensive maneuvers. Stealth and survivability are critical in contested airspace. The Gambit’s design would likely incorporate low observable features, such as radar-absorbing materials and angular shaping to reduce its radar cross-section. Its heat signature would need to be minimized as well, reducing the likelihood of infrared detection. The platform could further enhance survivability by carrying electronic countermeasures (ECM) to interfere with radar-guided threats, along with flares, chaff, and high-maneuverability systems to evade hostile attacks. For maximum mission versatility, the Gambit would benefit from modular payload bays, allowing it to adapt to a range of operations, from ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) to direct air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. A flexible payload configuration would support quick reconfiguration, making it possible to switch between reconnaissance and combat roles based on mission requirements. Additionally, a focus on endurance—potentially through hybrid propulsion—would extend Gambit’s range and operational period, allowing for longer missions and reducing the frequency of resupply or refueling. GA-ASI’s vision for a carrier-based Gambit UAS underscores a possible shift in naval airpower, where autonomous platforms augment the reach and versatility of aircraft carriers in high-risk environments. If the technical challenges in launch, autonomy, communication, stealth, and endurance are effectively addressed, the Gambit UAS could redefine carrier capabilities and contribute to a new era of autonomous maritime warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/general-atomics-hints-at-gambit-uas-autonomous-combat-airpower-from-aircraft-carriers	2024-10-28T06:54:49-07:00

Developed by Eurosam, a joint venture between MBDA and Thales, the SAMP/T is capable of countering threats within a 600 km range class and is designed to operate effectively in environments with high electronic clutter and countermeasures. The system features the Aster 30 missile, which employs a tandem booster and advanced guidance technology for precise interception, and the Arabel radar, which provides multi-function detection and tracking capabilities. The SAMP/T NG (New Generation) variant incorporates significant upgrades, including the Aster Block 1 NT missile with an enhanced seeker and a new command and control module. The system’s rotating AESA radar ensures 360-degree coverage, while the eight vertical launchers, each carrying ready-to-fire Aster 30 missiles, allow rapid response and high firepower, with the ability to simultaneously engage multiple targets. The system is highly mobile, with components mounted on military trucks, making it suitable for rapid deployment and integration into broader NATO air defense architectures. The decision is part of broader defense cooperation between Belgium and France, as the two countries aim to harmonize efforts and optimize resources to meet Europe's growing security needs. By choosing the SAMP/T over the American Patriot, Belgium favors a European solution that, in addition to its technical advantages, could strengthen the continent's strategic sovereignty. The contract is expected to be worth several hundred million euros, although the exact number of systems to be acquired has yet to be determined. A complete SAMP/T battery is estimated at around $500 million, compared to roughly $1 billion for a Patriot battery. In return for this investment, Belgium aims to secure 'fair return' industrial compensations, which could also extend to other ongoing programs in the land domain. MBDA, with its experience in missile system development and a key role in Europe's defense architecture, is well-positioned to meet Belgium's needs. The company has already demonstrated its commitment to addressing European missile defense challenges through projects like TWISTER, a multi-role interceptor initiative designed to counter threats ranging from maneuvering ballistic missiles to hypersonic gliders. Supported by the European Defense Fund, this project aligns with efforts to strengthen Europe's strategic autonomy and address current capability gaps. Belgium is also preparing to finalize an agreement with France for FN Herstal to supply small-caliber ammunition to the French armed forces, in collaboration with a French-based industrial partner. Additionally, FN Herstal will begin producing its ultra-light Evolys machine gun for the French Land Army next year, with deliveries scheduled for late 2025. Regarding the Camo program, Belgium's counterpart to France's Scorpion program, the first Griffon vehicles are expected in 2025, followed by the Jaguar in 2026 and Caesar in 2027. In the naval sector, an agreement is being prepared between the Belgian and French Ministries of Defense on the specifications of mine-hunting vessels, jointly designed with Paris and The Hague, and produced by Naval Group. Belgium's decision to engage with MBDA comes amid heightened security concerns in Europe, prompting national military capability enhancements and increased collaboration among EU member states. By opting for the SAMP/T, Brussels joins a group of European countries already using the system, including France and Italy, which will facilitate system integration and resource sharing across the continent. Since January 2016, Belgium has shown a growing interest in acquiring ballistic missile defense capabilities, a priority highlighted by Defense Minister Steven Vandeput. This objective is part of the 2030 strategic plan to modernize the Belgian armed forces and contribute to NATO's Ballistic Missile Defense initiative, launched in 2010. In February 2016, Vandeput discussed with the defense committee the opportunity to equip the Land Component with a BMD system, considering two options: a radar system costing 50 million euros or a full missile battery, dubbed 'full Monty,' costing 600 million euros. At the time, potential systems included the American Patriot, Eurosam's SAMP/T, and Lockheed Martin's MEADS. Currently, Belgium mainly relies on the Mistral short-range air defense system, used to protect airbases and other sensitive sites. This infrared-guided missile system is designed to counter low-altitude threats such as helicopters and slow-moving aircraft. In addition, the Belgian armed forces employ anti-aircraft guns, though these aging systems no longer meet modern air defense standards against threats like ballistic missiles or drones. The lack of medium- or long-range surface-to-air defense systems underscores Belgium's interest in acquiring MBDA's SAMP/T to modernize and strengthen its air defense capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-belgium-set-to-choose-mbdas-samp-t-over-u-s-patriot-for-its-air-defense	2024-10-28T06:36:03-07:00

Northrop Grumman Announces Massive Expansion in B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber Production to Counter China	On October 24, 2024, Northrop Grumman announced that the U.S. Air Force is currently evaluating the possibility of expanding its fleet of B-21 Raider bombers to strengthen its capabilities in response to challenges posed by China. This initiative is part of a broader review of the Air Force's force structure, which could also impact the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber was unveiled to the public at a ceremony Dec. 2, 2022 in Palmdale, California (Picture source: US DoD) The B-21 Raider Bomber provides the U.S. Armed Forces with a crucial capability for long-range stealth bombing, allowing it to penetrate advanced enemy air defenses and deliver both conventional and nuclear payloads. Its advanced design improves strategic deterrence and enables the U.S. to project power globally, meeting modern operational requirements in contested environments. With rising threats from peer adversaries such as Russia and China, a larger B-21 fleet would enhance the Air Force's ability to respond quickly and effectively across multiple regions, addressing the need for versatile and survivable strike capabilities. Expanding the B-21 fleet is considered a cost-effective way to enhance U.S. defense posture, particularly as older bombers like the B-1 and B-2 near retirement. Acquiring more B-21s would not only modernize the bomber force but also provide a dual benefit by supporting both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence. As a platform already in production, scaling up B-21 procurement could swiftly improve U.S. military readiness without the delays associated with developing new systems like the NGAD fighter. Russia and China are developing their own long-range stealth bombers to rival the U.S. B-21. Russia is working on the PAK DA, a stealth bomber designed to replace its older fleet, featuring advanced radar-evading capabilities and long-range strike potential. Meanwhile, China is developing the H-20 stealth bomber, which aims to extend China's strategic reach and conduct missions deep into enemy territory. Both aircraft are intended to challenge U.S. air superiority and enhance their respective nations' strike capabilities. The B-21 Raider stands out due to its cutting-edge stealth technology, advanced materials, and digital design, which enhance its ability to evade radar detection more effectively than older bombers. Its modular architecture allows for future upgrades, making it adaptable to changing threats. Moreover, the B-21 is built with versatility in mind, supporting both conventional and nuclear missions, giving the U.S. a significant advantage in strategic deterrence and long-range precision strike capabilities. The B-21 Raider could be deployed in a strategic strike mission aimed at neutralizing heavily defended adversary military installations, such as missile launch sites or command centers deep within enemy territory. With its advanced stealth capabilities, the B-21 could penetrate sophisticated air defenses undetected, deliver precise strikes with conventional or nuclear munitions, and exit the area safely. For example, in a crisis scenario with an adversary possessing advanced anti-aircraft systems, the B-21 could be used to destroy radars or surface-to-air missile batteries, paving the way for other air forces to conduct offensive operations. In addition to its strategic strike capabilities, the B-21 Raider is designed to perform a wide range of conventional missions, such as supporting military operations in conflict zones, conducting air interdiction, and carrying out precision strikes on mobile targets. For instance, during an air campaign against an enemy force, the B-21 could be used to attack defensive positions, ammunition depots, or military convoys, thereby disrupting the adversary's logistical and operational capabilities. Its stealth allows it to penetrate deep into enemy territory and operate in contested environments, reducing the risk for pilots while maximizing the effectiveness of its strikes. Additionally, the B-21's flexibility enables it to be quickly reconfigured to accommodate various types of conventional missions, adapting its weaponry and sensors to specific field requirements. Warden revealed during an earnings call on October 24, 2024, that the Air Force is conducting a comprehensive review of its force structure, including the B-21 fleet. This review is part of a congressionally mandated effort to reassess the service's future capabilities and requirements. It also coincides with the Air Force's efforts to complete the NGAD program's requirements analysis, following a pause ordered by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall earlier this year. The NGAD program, aimed at developing a sixth-generation fighter to replace the F-22 Raptor, was paused before a decision was made between two competing designs. Kendall cited concerns over the program's cost, with initial estimates suggesting that each aircraft could cost several hundred million dollars. He has since indicated a preference for reducing the per-unit cost to a range closer to that of the F-35 fighter, between $80 million and $100 million. The cost difference, if achieved, could translate into savings of tens of billions of dollars across a planned fleet of 200 to 250 NGAD fighters. While the official stance of the Air Force has maintained that a fleet of 100 B-21 Raiders would meet current operational needs, there are growing voices within the defense community advocating for a larger fleet. The B-21 is designed to replace the aging B-2 Spirit and B-1 Lancer bombers, providing the U.S. military with a long-range stealth bomber capable of penetrating advanced air defenses. The platform is a cornerstone of the Air Force's future strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities. Northrop Grumman, the B-21's prime contractor, has stated that it is ready to increase production if the Air Force decides to expand the fleet. According to Warden, the decision on fleet size will likely become clearer in the coming months as the force structure review progresses. She emphasized that the performance and cost targets achieved during the B-21's initial production phase could influence the Air Force's decision. The cost of the B-21 has been a central issue in these discussions. The bomber's original unit cost was contractually set at $550 million in 2010, equivalent to approximately $780 million today. Despite this, Kendall informed Congress in April that B-21 production costs had remained below projections during low-rate initial production. However, the cost ceiling is expected to rise as production ramps up in later batches. Several senior officials and defense analysts have argued for increasing the B-21 fleet beyond the initial 100 units. Retired Colonel Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, has been outspoken about the need to increase the Air Force's bomber capacity to address emerging threats. He points out that the current bomber force is too small to meet the demands of a rapidly changing strategic environment, especially in deterring and potentially responding to simultaneous threats from peer adversaries like Russia and China. Gunzinger believes that the B-21 is particularly well-positioned to strengthen both conventional and nuclear deterrence due to its stealth capabilities, long range, and substantial payload capacity. He asserts that acquiring more B-21s at an accelerated pace would be the most cost-effective approach to strengthening the United States' power projection capabilities and operating in contested environments. Expanding the bomber fleet would provide a dual benefit by bolstering both conventional defense and strategic deterrence. Air Force General Anthony J. Cotton, head of U.S. Strategic Command, has also expressed support for increasing the number of B-21 bombers, emphasizing their importance in maintaining a credible deterrent posture. His views are echoed by other analysts, such as Christopher Bowie, who have suggested that 100 aircraft may not be sufficient for the U.S. to achieve its strategic goals, given that even the most advanced bomber can only be in one place at a time. One of the central questions in the ongoing review is whether potential savings from reducing the NGAD program could be redirected to fund additional B-21 bombers. The Air Force is attempting to balance the competing demands of modernizing its aging fleet while adhering to budget constraints. However, some experts, including Gunzinger, caution against viewing the NGAD and B-21 programs as interchangeable. This pause has opened the door for the B-21 to play a more significant role in the Air Force's future force structure. Northrop Grumman's willingness to increase production adds to the service's strategic flexibility as it navigates the challenges of modernizing its fleet under fiscal constraints. Warden indicated that the Air Force is expected to award a second low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract for the B-21 before the end of the year. The first LRIP contract was awarded following the bomber's first flight last year, although specifics regarding the number of aircraft covered under the agreement have not been disclosed. The outcome of the current force structure review and ongoing budget negotiations will likely influence future production rates and fleet size decisions. As the Air Force continues to assess its options, the B-21 remains a key element in the broader strategy to enhance U.S. airpower capabilities. Whether the service will ultimately expand its fleet of stealth bombers will depend on a variety of factors, including cost considerations, technological developments, and the evolving threat landscape. In the meantime, Northrop Grumman is positioning itself to respond quickly to increased demand, offering the U.S. government flexibility in shaping the future of its bomber force. The reconsideration of the B-21 fleet size underscores the dynamic nature of the U.S. Air Force's modernization strategy, driven by both strategic needs and budgetary realities. With the ongoing review of the NGAD program and discussions about expanding the bomber fleet, the Air Force is at a critical juncture. The decisions made in the coming months will shape the future of American airpower and its ability to deter adversaries and project power worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/northrop-grumman-announces-massive-expansion-in-b-21-raider-stealth-bomber-production-to-counter-china	2024-10-28T05:56:13-07:00

Taiwan Unveils Torpedo Launch Tube of Huilong Unmanned Underwater Vehicle	According to information published by TaiwanPlus on October 26, 2024, Taiwan revealed the torpedo launch tube of its domestically developed 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan reveals its 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle, equipped with dual torpedo launch tubes and surveillance capabilities. (Picture source: TaiwanPlus) Earlier, images of the propeller at the vehicle’s rear were also released. However, Taiwan's Defense Minister recently clarified over a lunch with the media that the Huilong platform is primarily intended for testing purposes, specifically for sonar and underwater mine systems, and does not feature an active propulsion system. Consequently, during sea trials, it is towed by support vessels rather than operating independently. The 'Huilong' project is a joint effort between Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Lung Teh Shipbuilding. The development officially commenced in 2020 under the 'Huilong Project,' aiming to establish a versatile, unmanned underwater test platform. According to reports, the vehicle displaces nearly 100 tons and has dimensions measuring approximately 30 meters in length, 3.6 meters in width, and 6 meters in height, including its command tower casing. This UUV resembles a compact submarine and is equipped with dual torpedo tubes. Notably, it is also reportedly designed to deploy small unmanned vehicles, potentially enhancing its capabilities in surveillance, target acquisition, and strike operations against enemy assets. One of the Huilong UUV’s primary roles could be to extend Taiwan’s underwater monitoring capabilities. Equipped with sophisticated sonar, the UUV can detect and track adversary submarines and other vessels operating in the waters around Taiwan. This would be particularly advantageous in tracking potential incursions by Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) submarines, enabling early detection and providing intelligence on the movements of hostile forces. Given the importance of information superiority in modern conflicts, the Huilong’s ability to conduct real-time, covert reconnaissance could significantly enhance Taiwan’s situational awareness. Taiwan’s fleet of submarines is relatively small and would be vulnerable in the event of a conflict. However, integrating UUVs like the Huilong could serve as a force multiplier. Deployed alongside or in support of manned submarines, these UUVs could take on high-risk reconnaissance or even offensive roles, allowing manned vessels to operate with less exposure to detection or attack. In any conflict scenario with a larger naval power like China, Taiwan’s strategy would likely rely on asymmetric tactics. UUVs offer a cost-effective means to deploy a range of weapons or carry out sabotage missions against high-value enemy assets, like aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-unveils-torpedo-launch-tube-of-huilong-unmanned-underwater-vehicle	2024-10-28T04:51:34-07:00

Exclusive: Discover Ukraine's Sky Dragon Devastating Drone-Dropped Incendiary Thermite Weapon Against Russia	Recently, Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, shared a detailed graphic on his X account explaining Sky Dragon, a new Ukrainian weapon system using multi-rotor drones to deploy thermite incendiary devices against Russian forces. This approach, which involves bundling thermite grenades and dropping them over Russian-occupied tree lines, has proven highly effective. By leveraging drones for precise delivery, the Sky Dragon system enables Ukrainian forces to target fortified Russian positions in difficult-to-reach areas, especially in densely forested terrain, causing significant damage to enemy equipment and personnel.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An aerial view captures the devastating impact of Ukraine's Sky Dragon incendiary thermite weapon as a drone drops the fiery payload onto its target.

(Picture source: Social network and X account Chuck Pfarrer) The use of incendiary thermite weapons in Ukraine has been reported during the ongoing conflict, with instances of classic incendiary munitions being employed by both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Thermite is used primarily to destroy equipment, fortifications, or infrastructure due to its ability to generate extremely high temperatures, melt metal, and start fires. The first publicized reports of thermite being used in Ukraine emerged in 2014, during the initial stages of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, when Russian-backed separatists were accused of using incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to target Ukrainian military positions. Recently, there have been renewed reports of thermite weapons being used in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, particularly in the context of intense battles in eastern Ukraine. These reports suggest that both sides may be employing incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to destroy military equipment, fortifications, and infrastructure. In late 2022 and throughout 2023, videos and eyewitness accounts surfaced showing the use of incendiary shells, which may contain thermite, in areas like Bakhmut and Mariupol, where fierce urban fighting took place. Sky Dragon uses commercially available multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, to carry bundles of thermite grenades and drop them over enemy positions. Thermite, a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxides, burns at extremely high temperatures when ignited, making it ideal for destroying military equipment, bunkers, and fortifications. The drones deliver these thermite devices in a precise and targeted manner, allowing Ukrainian forces to strike deep within Russian-controlled zones, including fortified positions concealed under tree canopies and within dug-in trenches. The Sky Dragon system operates through a combination of advanced drone technology and destructive incendiary devices. It uses multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, which are capable of carrying heavy payloads and modified for military use. These drones fly over Russian positions, allowing for the precise delivery of their incendiary payloads. The core of the system consists of bundled thermite grenades strapped together with metal bands. These grenades are equipped with a Nonel instantaneous fuse system, commonly used in demolition, ensuring that all grenades ignite simultaneously once they reach the target. This synchronization maximizes the thermite's destructive power. To protect the drone from the extreme heat generated by the thermite, a heat shield is employed along with a tow line that holds the grenades at a safe distance during flight. Once released, the grenades ignite mid-air, raining down molten thermite on the target, making it nearly impossible for enemy infantry or equipment to withstand the intense heat, which can exceed 2,000°C. Sky Dragon is proving to be highly effective against entrenched Russian positions, especially in forested areas. Traditional artillery and mortar systems struggle to penetrate tree lines where Russian forces are often dug in. However, drones can navigate these complex environments, hovering over specific positions and deploying incendiary grenades with pinpoint accuracy. When ignited, thermite creates temperatures exceeding 2,000°C (3,600°F), capable of burning through metal and concrete, making it particularly useful for destroying ammunition depots, bunkers, armored vehicles, and other critical military infrastructure. Graphic by Chuck Pfarrer illustrating Ukraine's Sky Dragon, a drone-deployed incendiary thermite weapon used to target Russian forces. (Picture source X account Chuck Pfarrer ) Additionally, the drones are difficult to detect and intercept due to their small size and low altitude. This makes them ideal tools for engaging targets in areas where Russian air defense systems are concentrated, as drones can maneuver around obstacles and deliver their payloads without risking large aircraft or manned vehicles. The introduction of Sky Dragon highlights Ukraine's ability to adapt to the realities of modern warfare, leveraging low-cost commercial drones in innovative ways to inflict significant damage on Russian forces. The use of incendiary devices like thermite further underscores Ukraine's intent to target key Russian positions where traditional weapons might fail or struggle to reach. As the conflict drags on, the emergence of these new tactics could force Russian troops to adapt their defensive strategies, potentially making their positions more vulnerable to other forms of attack. Sky Dragon adds yet another dimension to the drone warfare that has come to define much of the conflict, where both sides increasingly rely on unmanned systems to deliver destructive payloads with minimal risk to personnel. Sky Dragon represents a significant development in Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities, offering a cost-effective and highly destructive solution to the challenge of entrenched Russian forces. As the war continues, innovations like Sky Dragon will likely play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics on the battlefield, demonstrating how modern technology and creative problem-solving can shift the balance of power in asymmetrical warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-discover-ukraines-sky-dragon-devastating-drone-deployed-incendiary-thermite-weapon-against-russia	2024-10-28T03:41:16-07:00

Indonesia Navy Expels Chinese Coast Guard Ship from North Natuna Sea	According to information published by the Indonesian government on October 25, 2024, Indonesia’s Maritime Security Agency, Bakamla RI, successfully detected and expelled a Chinese Coast Guard vessel, CCG 5402, from the North Natuna Sea. This vessel had been interfering with seismic survey activities led by PT Pertamina East Natuna, a state-owned oil and gas company, which was conducting 3D seismic data processing using the survey vessel MV Geo Coral.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Indonesian Coast Guard Tanjung Datu-class patrol vessel KN Tanjung Datu, the Chinese Coast Guard OPV 5402 and the Indonesian Navy Kapitan Patimura-class corvette. (Picture source: Indonesian government) The incident unfolded when Bakamla RI’s Command and Control Center (Puskodal) received intelligence that CCG 5402 was obstructing MV Geo Coral’s survey, which was being escorted by three chase vessels—UB Anugerah Bersama 17, AHT PSB Roller, and TB Teluk Bajau Victory. These activities were taking place within the operational area of PT Pertamina East Natuna, which is situated on Indonesia's continental shelf in the North Natuna Sea. Following this alert, Bakamla dispatched the Indonesian State Vessel (KN) Tanjung Datu-301 to the location. Upon arrival, KN Tanjung Datu-301 detected the Chinese vessel CCG 5402 at 5:30 a.m. WIB, positioned at a 125° bearing and approximately 7.3 nautical miles away. Despite efforts to establish communication via radio, CCG 5402 asserted that the area fell under Chinese jurisdiction, a claim that Indonesia firmly disputes. Shortly after, at around 5:38 a.m., Bakamla RI received reinforcement from the Indonesian Navy’s (TNI AL) patrol vessel KRI Sutedi Senaputera 378 and a maritime patrol aircraft. Together, these Indonesian patrol forces shadowed the Chinese vessel, ultimately succeeding in expelling CCG 5402 from Indonesia’s jurisdictional waters in the North Natuna Sea. China’s Foreign Ministry responded to the situation in a routine press conference on Thursday, stating that Chinese coast guard vessels were patrolling 'waters under China’s jurisdiction' according to both international and domestic laws. The ministry expressed its willingness to negotiate with Indonesia to resolve maritime issues between the two countries. Although Indonesia is not involved in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, China’s 'Nine-Dash Line' claim overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Natuna Islands. Chinese coast guard vessels have entered Indonesia’s Natuna Sea in recent years. However, it is noteworthy that these two recent incidents occurred within a week of Prabowo taking office. China has consistently expressed interest in collaborating with Indonesia to develop the North Natuna Sea, so these actions may be a way to test the new administration’s stance on potential cooperation. The Chinese coast guard entered Indonesia’s EEZ in the Natuna Sea immediately after Prabowo’s inauguration and his meeting with China’s Vice President Han Zheng, which could be seen as an unwelcome 'gift' for Prabowo.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indonesia-navy-expels-chinese-coast-guard-ship-from-north-natuna-sea	2024-10-28T03:33:22-07:00

The two-year extension will see Raytheon continue to provide operations and maintenance support for the Sea-based X-band Radar and 13 Army-Navy Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Raytheon secures a $900 million contract extension with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to support and sustain advanced radar systems. (Picture source: Dvids) The Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX-1) remains a cornerstone of the U.S. ballistic missile defense strategy due to its unprecedented ability to detect and assess threats from vast distances, making it a powerful mobile asset for tracking and intercepting missile threats. Positioned on a self-propelled, semi-submersible oil platform, this radar provides coverage that can be quickly adapted to varying geopolitical hotspots across the Pacific, a region where missile threats from countries like North Korea, China, and Russia are a growing concern​. The SBX-1’s high-precision X-band radar, encased within a massive radome, has approximately 45,000 transmit/receive modules, allowing it to detect and discriminate between missiles, decoys, and debris. It can track objects as small as a baseball from up to 2,500 miles away, feeding critical data back to ground-based interceptors for midcourse corrections. This data transmission occurs through the In-Flight Interceptor Communications System Data Terminal onboard, which enables real-time adjustments for interceptors and heightens the radar’s utility in ballistic missile defense​. Operational since 2006, SBX-1 has been deployed extensively in the Pacific, often supporting defense readiness against North Korean missile tests and other emergent threats. However, recent deployments have highlighted both its strengths and limitations. While it offers exceptional tracking precision, its relatively narrow field of view poses challenges when responding to complex scenarios involving multiple missiles or advanced countermeasures such as decoys. In response, the SBX-1 has undergone upgrades and maintenance in Hawaii, addressing structural issues from its extensive 662-day deployment and enhancing its ability to support intercepts under higher demand from the U.S. Space Command and Space Force​.

Nonetheless, the radar’s mobility and ability to adjust to the Earth's curvature give it a distinct advantage over land-based radars, enabling tracking over oceanic expanses and the flexibility to relocate in response to shifting threat landscapes. These advantages remain critical as missile defense analysts underscore the necessity of monitoring emerging hypersonic threats, which can travel at extreme speeds and low altitudes, evading traditional missile defense systems​. Looking ahead, discussions around the SBX's future are ongoing, with considerations about whether additional units or complementary systems are required. Space-based sensors are also under evaluation as potential support for a more diversified missile defense network.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/raytheon-awarded-contract-to-maintain-us-navy-sea-based-x-band-radar	2024-10-28T02:52:00-07:00	
US Army’s Future XM30 Combat Vehicle to Redefine IFV with a 50mm Cannon and AI Technologies	According to Nicholas Drummond on October 27, 2024, the US Army’s future XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle is set to redefine the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category when it enters service in 2027, replacing the aging M2 Bradley. The US Army has awarded General Dynamics and Rheinmetall $800 million each to develop prototypes for this vehicle as part of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program. The total value of the program is estimated at $45 billion, with the Army planning to purchase approximately 3,800 units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, which has been in service since the 1980s. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The XM30 is expected to bring significant changes to the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category, featuring a 50x228 mm cannon in a remote-controlled turret, twin Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), an AI-enabled fire control system, and a hybrid drivetrain. The XM30 will have a crew of two (a driver and a commander) and will carry six infantry personnel. The vehicle’s size and capacity have been designed to maintain a balance between firepower and mobility while preventing it from becoming too large or heavy, as seen with some past IFV designs. It will be designed to work alongside future versions of the M1 Abrams and is expected to include protection against Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Digital engineering has been central to the development of the XM30. In the early phases of the program, five contractors were given approximately $60 million each to create digital designs based on draft requirements from the Army. Through this process that facilitated its design, development, and potential future upgrades, the US Army refined the vehicle's requirements and ensured they were achievable, avoiding issues that led to the cancellation of earlier programs. For instance, by using 3D models and simulations early in the design phase, the Army ensures that all requirements and subsystems, including sensors and fire control mechanisms, are aligned before physical prototypes are constructed. This approach minimizes development costs and helps contractors and the Army quickly address any design issues that arise during the process. The modular design of the XM30 supports future technological updates, enabling the integration of new systems with minimal changes to the vehicle's core architecture. Equipped with a hybrid-electric drivetrain and a variety of weapon systems, including a 50mm cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, the XM30 is configured to meet current operational requirements while maintaining flexibility for future needs. The vehicle's reduced crew size and its capacity to transport infantry are aimed at improving operational efficiency without increasing size or complexity. The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley, which has been in service since the 1980s. Despite several earlier attempts, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and Future Combat System programs, previous initiatives were not successful, often due to issues with aligning requirements, funding, technology, and schedule. Colonel Jeffery Jurand, the project manager for the XM30, has emphasized that the current program is aligned in these areas, supported by the use of digital engineering. This approach allows for the design and testing of the vehicle through digital models, avoiding some of the challenges faced by earlier programs. Both General Dynamics and Rheinmetall were selected to move forward in the competition, with the Army currently in phase three of a five-phase schedule. These contractors will deliver prototypes by late 2026, with the Army conducting critical design reviews by the first half of fiscal year 2025. The final selection of a single vendor for production will take place around the first quarter of fiscal year 2028, after testing and evaluation of the prototypes. The program is also supported by the 'digital trinity' approach, which includes models-based systems engineering, digital engineering, and development, security, and operations (DevSecOps). This digital approach has allowed for improved traceability and communication between contractors and the Army, with errors being identified and addressed earlier in the design process. The open architecture of the XM30 design has been highlighted as a way to accommodate future upgrades and reduce costs. The XM30 is one of six pathfinder programs identified by the Army to demonstrate the benefits of digital engineering. The Army's use of digital engineering for this project is intended to improve design efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the vehicle's modularity and adaptability for future needs. The program has drawn confidence from senior Army leaders, who have expressed support for its goals and its potential to provide long-term benefits, including cost savings through its open architecture. As the program moves forward, the remaining phases will focus on prototype development, testing, and evaluation. The Army is scheduled to begin testing the prototypes in 2026, with a final decision on production expected in 2028.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-armys-future-xm30-to-redefine-ifv-category-with-ai-driven-systems-and-50mm-remote-cannon	2024-10-28T02:29:56-07:00	
Satellite Images Reveal Rise of Chinese Forces with 59 New DF-26 Missile Launchers	In October 2024, new satellite images revealed a significant increase in Chinese production of launchers for DF-26 ballistic missiles, indicating a considerable strengthening of China’s strategic arsenal.

This observation highlights the growing capabilities of China, raising important strategic concerns, particularly in the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The DF-26 is an intermediate-range ballistic missile from the Dong Feng family, developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). With a range of 4,000 km, it is the first Chinese missile capable of striking conventional targets, such as U.S. bases in Guam. This solid-fuel, two-stage missile is 14 meters long and weighs 20 tons, capable of carrying a payload between 1,200 and 1,800 kg, including nuclear warheads and various conventional warheads. It is deployed on a mobile Taian HTF5680 launcher, allowing for rapid and discreet deployment. The DF-26’s modular design enables the warheads to be swapped based on mission requirements, with options for both land strikes and moving naval targets, supported by a terminal guidance system. Since its unveiling in 2015, production of the DF-26 has accelerated, with over 250 units produced by 2024. The brigades of the People’s Liberation Army equipped with these missiles benefit from their mobility and precision strike capabilities, targeting a range of assets including military installations and medium-sized ships. Its operational flexibility and extended range make it a key component of China’s anti-access and area denial strategy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Between 2023 and 2024, satellite images and industry reports indicate that the Beijing-Xinghang facility produced at least 72 new launchers, enough to equip two additional missile brigades. These units would join the seven existing brigades of the People’s Liberation Army, bringing the total number of DF-26 launchers to around 250. However, some experts, notably from the Federation of American Scientists, suggest that China may be inflating the actual number of launchers, potentially creating confusion about the true extent of its capabilities. The DF-26, part of the Dong Feng missile family ('East Wind'), offers enhanced strategic capabilities compared to earlier versions such as the DF-21. Its extended range, combined with improved accuracy through satellite-assisted inertial guidance, makes it a serious threat to high-value targets like military bases, airports, and naval facilities. The potential integration of terminal guidance could also enable the DF-26 to fulfill anti-ship roles, posing a threat to U.S. carrier strike groups operating in the Pacific. The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea. The expansion of China’s missile arsenal could also signal an intention to challenge U.S. access to its strategic bases, which play a crucial role in supporting regional alliances with Japan, South Korea, and other partners. Growing tensions in the region, combined with the DF-26's dual-use (nuclear and conventional) nature, raise concerns about the risk of unintended escalation in a crisis, particularly if a conventional strike is misinterpreted as a nuclear attack. As China strengthens its strategic forces, it continues to expand its nuclear capabilities. U.S. estimates suggest that by 2030, China's nuclear arsenal could exceed 1,000 warheads, primarily in the form of intercontinental missiles. In parallel, efforts are underway to increase the number of long-range missile launchers, including the DF-31 and DF-41, which are capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/satellite-images-reveal-rise-of-chinese-forces-with-59-new-df-26-missile-launchers	2024-10-28T02:23:01-07:00	
Ukraine's Su-24 Bomber Now Armed with Western SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow Missiles	Ukraine has successfully adapted its Soviet-era Su-24 bomber to carry and launch Franco-British SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow air-to-surface cruise missiles. This adaptation, facilitated by recent military support from Western allies, gives Ukraine the ability to strike high-value targets deep within Russian-occupied territories. The integration of this powerful missile system into Ukraine’s air fleet significantly enhances its long-range strike capabilities, marking a critical development in its defense strategy against Russian aggression.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Ukrainian Su-24 fighter jet armed with two SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow cruise missiles, showcasing its newly integrated long-range strike capability with Western-supplied precision weapons. (Picture source: X Account French Aid to Ukraine) The Su-24 is a Soviet-era, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing bomber aircraft designed for all-weather, low-level penetration strikes. Developed by Sukhoi in the late 1960s and introduced into service in the early 1970s, the Su-24 was intended to provide the Soviet Air Force with a deep strike platform capable of carrying a wide array of conventional and nuclear weapons. It became the backbone of the Soviet Union's tactical bomber fleet, comparable to the U.S. F-111, and saw significant upgrades over the years. Widely exported to allied nations, the Su-24 has remained in service in several countries, including Russia and Ukraine, with modernization efforts extending its operational lifespan and capabilities, even in the post-Soviet era. The adaptation of Ukraine’s Su-24s to deploy the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missile is a notable achievement, as it allows the Ukrainian Air Force to strike enemy targets with high precision at extended ranges. The Su-24, originally a Soviet-designed, all-weather attack aircraft built for deep penetration missions, has been extensively modified by Ukrainian engineers to fire these advanced Western missiles. The modifications involved updating the avionics, fire control systems, and communication interfaces between the missile and the aircraft, ensuring full compatibility with the SCALP-EG’s guidance and targeting systems. This successful integration marks the first time a non-NATO platform has been adapted to use this sophisticated missile, a testament to Ukraine’s ingenuity in modernizing its Soviet-era fleet with Western technology. The Su-24’s variable-sweep wing design and its ability to operate at low altitudes make it an ideal platform for launching SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles, enabling Ukraine to carry out precision strikes on critical Russian military infrastructure while minimizing the risk of detection. The SCALP-EG, also known as Storm Shadow in the UK, was delivered to Ukraine in mid-2023 as part of a broader package of military aid from France and the United Kingdom. These missiles were provided in response to Ukraine’s urgent requests for advanced weaponry capable of countering Russian long-range artillery and missile attacks. The delivery was a turning point, as it allowed Ukraine to bridge the gap in its long-range strike capabilities, giving it the tools to target Russian positions far beyond the front lines. The SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow is a long-range, air-launched cruise missile designed for precision strikes, offering key advantages in range, accuracy, and stealth. Its extended range, exceeding 250 kilometers (and up to 560 kilometers in some variants), allows Ukrainian forces to hit deep targets within Russian-occupied territories without entering contested airspace. The missile is equipped with a 450 kg BROACH (Bomb Royal Ordnance Augmented Charge) warhead, a two-stage system that first penetrates hardened structures and then detonates inside, maximizing destruction against fortified targets such as bunkers, command centers, and ammunition depots. Guided by a combination of GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain-following radar, the SCALP-EG ensures precise targeting, especially in the final phase of its flight, where it uses infrared sensors to compare the target with pre-loaded images. This ensures high accuracy even in heavily defended areas. Additionally, the missile's low radar cross-section gives it a stealthy profile, making it difficult to detect and intercept by enemy air defenses, which enhances its ability to penetrate contested airspace. Together, these features—long range, significant destructive power, and pinpoint accuracy—make the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow an effective tool for disrupting enemy operations, particularly by degrading logistical and command structures. This offers Ukraine a crucial strategic advantage in the ongoing conflict. The ability to launch SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles from Su-24 aircraft gives Ukraine a new level of operational flexibility. Prior to this development, Ukraine’s ability to strike at long-range was limited, but the integration of these missiles now allows the Ukrainian Air Force to conduct deep strikes into Russian-held territory without exposing its aircraft to significant risk. With a range of over 250 kilometers, the SCALP-EG can reach critical Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs far behind the front lines. This allows Ukraine to disrupt supply lines, command centers, and infrastructure that are essential for sustaining Russian operations. The Su-24’s ability to deliver these strikes at low altitude, combined with the missile’s stealth characteristics, greatly increases the likelihood of successful missions. Recent reports indicate that Ukrainian forces have already employed the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow in several operations, targeting Russian logistics centers and ammunition depots with precision.

US Navy Eyes Patriot Missiles to Counter China’s Hypersonic Threats in Pacific	According to information published by The Economic Times on October 25, 2024, the U.S. Navy is advancing plans to deploy Patriot interceptor missiles on its warships, Amid rising security concerns over China’s potential use of advanced hypersonic weapons in the Indo-Pacific. This move is intended to counter the growing threat of Chinese missile technology, specifically anti-ship ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles capable of evading traditional defense systems, according to two senior defense officials.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of US Navy warships. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Patriot missiles, particularly the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) variant, are already employed by the U.S. Army for land-based air defense. These interceptors, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, offer agility and the capability to target highly maneuverable threats, positioning them as a potential solution to counter hypersonic advancements anticipated in Chinese arsenals. Integrating these interceptors into naval defense systems signals a notable shift in U.S. military strategy as tensions in the Indo-Pacific persist and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) rapidly modernizes its capabilities. The addition of the PAC-3 interceptors to the Navy's arsenal is seen as essential to expanding the layered defense system on U.S. vessels. Demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors has soared, driven by a heightened interest from foreign governments and the U.S. Army’s ambition to more than double production in the coming years. Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3’s manufacturer, is exploring avenues to increase production, including plans for a new production line for missile seekers in Florida. This facility would supplement Boeing’s existing manufacturing of seekers, and production for PAC-3 could eventually include Japan, a key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific region. The PAC-3's compact size, agility, and advanced 'hit-to-kill' technology—which allows the interceptor to destroy threats by direct impact rather than proximity detonation—make it well-suited for combating high-speed ballistic and hypersonic missiles. These interceptors would enhance existing capabilities aboard U.S. ships to target and neutralize fast-moving threats. The U.S. Navy has already conducted preliminary virtual tests of PAC-3 interceptors aboard a 'virtual Aegis ship,' using the Mk. 70 vertical launcher system, which is foundational for naval missile launches. However, the interceptors have yet to be physically deployed on a vessel, and additional testing is required to synchronize PAC-3 systems with the Navy's SPY-1 radar, a key component of the Aegis missile defense system. The PAC-3 interceptors have demonstrated significant capabilities in recent conflicts, successfully intercepting high-speed threats such as Russia’s Khinzal missiles in Ukraine. The missile’s success has spurred interest in incorporating it into the Navy’s defenses, adding a cost-effective layer against the sophisticated hypersonic and ballistic missiles developed by China. China’s missile capabilities, particularly the DF-21D 'carrier killer' and the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, are a central security concern for U.S. forces in the Pacific. The DF-27, which can cover a range of up to 5,000 miles, features an aerodynamic warhead that can maneuver, complicating defense strategies. This missile could pose a direct threat to U.S. naval forces and moving targets alike. While the Navy’s existing SM-6 missiles can reach targets in space, the PAC-3, though limited in range, offers greater agility due to rockets positioned near its nose, enabling it to respond effectively to high-speed threats in lower altitudes. The introduction of PAC-3 MSE interceptors could supplement these existing capabilities, enhancing the layered defense necessary to address the evolving threat environment in the Indo-Pacific.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-eyes-patriot-missiles-to-counter-chinas-hypersonic-threats-in-pacific	2024-10-25T05:18:04-07:00

US Military Base in Syria’s Koniko Gas Field reportedly Hit by Missile Attack	According to information published by the Times of India on October 24, 2024, the U.S. military base stationed in the Koniko gas field, located in Syria's Deir ez-Zor province, came under missile attack.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a US military base in Syria's Koniko gas field. (Picture source: Generated by AI) In response to the missile attack, American forces deployed artillery strikes targeting villages along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River. These villages—Hatlah Tahtani, Marrat, Khsham, and Hawijah—fall under the jurisdiction of the Syrian government. The retaliatory strikes reportedly aimed to secure the area and dissuade further assaults on the U.S.-controlled facility. The Koniko gas field is a strategically significant site for U.S. forces operating in Syria. It has been a focal point of tension, given its proximity to areas held by the Syrian government and the region’s value in terms of energy resources. Control of such sites has been a point of contention in Syria, where U.S. and Syrian government forces, as well as other factions, maintain a presence amid the country’s ongoing conflict. The current military presence in Iraq and Syria reflects a complex, evolving strategy involving the United States, Iraq, Iran-backed militias, and other regional forces, primarily focused on countering the remnants of ISIS and addressing broader regional security concerns. In Iraq and Syria, the U.S. military and coalition allies rely on an array of armored and tactical vehicles, artillery systems, and defensive structures to support counter-terrorism and regional security efforts. Vehicles like MRAPs and M-ATVs form the backbone of protected ground transport, with their reinforced hulls designed to withstand roadside bombs and attacks from militant groups, a frequent risk in the operational landscape. M-ATVs, in particular, offer enhanced off-road capabilities, allowing forces to traverse Syria's rugged terrain where ISIS remnants sometimes establish hideouts​. Supporting logistics and tactical coordination, larger bases like Al Asad and Erbil house surveillance and defense infrastructure critical for both operations and base security. These include Patriot missile batteries and C-RAM systems, which intercept missile or rocket attacks often launched by Iran-backed militias. These defensive assets are essential, especially following recent escalations in militia activities in the region​. Artillery such as the M777 howitzer provides long-range fire support, crucial in both pre-emptive and reactive operations against ISIS positions. The M777’s range enables strikes from secure locations, effectively disrupting hostile forces without exposing ground personnel to direct combat. Additionally, the U.S. utilizes drones, including MQ-9 Reapers, for surveillance and strike operations, which are integral to both intelligence gathering and precision targeting, especially in Syria where ISIS cells may remain embedded​. Helicopters, like Black Hawks, offer rapid mobility for personnel and critical medical evacuation capabilities across Iraq and Syria. They also provide air cover during ground operations and facilitate quick logistical support for remote outposts, thus maintaining operational continuity and safeguarding personnel. This coordinated use of vehicles, heavy weaponry, and defensive measures forms a robust infrastructure aimed at countering ISIS and maintaining regional stability amidst complex security dynamics​.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-military-base-in-syrias-koniko-gas-field-reportedly-hit-by-missile-attack	2024-10-25T04:16:03-07:00	
Iran to produce Su-30 and Su-35 fighter jets following Russia's agreement	According to the Telegram account Mezuzah on October 25, 2024, reports emerged indicating that Iran had received a license from Russia to domestically produce Su-30 and Su-35 fighter jets. According to these reports, the Iranian Air Force intends to manufacture between 48 and 72 Su-35 fighter jets, while the number of Su-30 jets to be produced has not yet been specified. This information likely stems from agreements made during the BRICS summit held in Kazan, Russia, from October 22 to 24, 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Iranian Air Force intends to manufacture between 48 and 72 Su-35 fighter jets, while the number of Su-30 jets to be produced has not yet been specified. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Su-35 and Su-30 are classified as fourth-generation, multirole supersonic fighter jets.

Earlier reports, such as Tasnim in November 2023, confirmed Iran’s acquisition of Russian aircraft, including Mil Mi-28 attack helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 training jets. According to Sardar Seyed Mehdi Farhi, Deputy Minister of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, these acquisitions are part of ongoing efforts to enhance Iran’s military aviation capabilities, particularly focusing on helicopter upgrades and improvements to night flying and avionics systems. Farhi also mentioned the work of Iran’s Helicopter Support and Renovation Company (Panha) over the past three decades. This development aligns with discussions held in January 2023 between Igor Levitin, a special assistant to the Russian president, and Iran’s First Vice President, Mohammed Mokhbar. During this meeting, Levitin expressed Russia’s readiness to pursue joint helicopter production with Iran. Amir Mojtaba Rouhani, CEO of Panha, had previously noted Iran’s regional leadership in helicopter maintenance services. In June 2023, Iranian Air Force Commander Amir Hamid Vahedi, in an interview about the Su-35, stated, 'We need the said Sukhoi jet, but we don’t know when it will arrive.' Vahedi referred to the construction of underground air bases, such as 'Oryol 44,' designed to protect the country’s fighter jets from potential attacks, including bunker-buster munitions. He indicated that these bases are strategically located to ensure operational safety and readiness. Vahedi also highlighted the modernization of Iran’s fleet of F-4 and F-14 aircraft, focusing on radar upgrades and extending the range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Iran’s Air Force currently operates a diverse fleet of fighter jets, including American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, as well as Russian-made MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft. The fleet also includes domestically produced jets like the HESA Saeqeh and Kowsar. The recent acquisitions of Mil Mi-28 helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 trainers represent further steps in diversifying Iran’s air capabilities. The first two Yak-130 aircraft were delivered on September 11, 2023, and stationed at Shahid Babaei Air Base in Isfahan, central Iran. These jets are intended to facilitate the training of Iranian pilots in operating advanced Russian-made fighter jets, including the Su-35. In recent years, Iran has been working toward acquiring Su-35 fighter jets from Russia. Although there have been multiple reports about anticipated deliveries, Iranian officials have denied these claims. In April 2024, Tehran refuted reports that 12 Su-35 jets would be delivered imminently, which had been circulated in Iranian media and later retracted by the country’s Student News Network (SNN). Similar expectations were reported earlier in January 2023, indicating that the jets would arrive by March, yet the deliveries were postponed. Despite these delays, confidence in the eventual delivery of Su-35 fighter jets remains strong, bolstered by Iran’s successful procurement of Yak-130 trainers and Mil Mi-28 helicopters in November 2023. The Su-35’s specifications include enhanced avionics and radar systems designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 2.25 and an operational range of 3,600 kilometers, featuring an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar that allows for tracking multiple targets. As part of these efforts, the Yak-130 trainer has been integrated into the fleet alongside the planned acquisition of Su-35 fighter jets. These additions represent a significant step in Iran’s strategy to upgrade its air capabilities amid ongoing scrutiny and increasing attention to its defense partnerships with Russia. The United States has expressed concerns over the expanding cooperation between the two countries, particularly within the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Iran, however, has denied supplying weapons to Russia for use in the conflict. Regardless of these accusations, the growing defense cooperation between Russia and Iran is shaping regional military dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/iran-to-produce-su-30-and-su-35-fighter-jets-following-russias-agreement	2024-10-25T03:36:30-07:00

South Korea reveals supersonic air-to-surface missile to strengthen fighter jets exports	On October 24, 2024, at the Sacheon Air Show, the South Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) unveiled a supersonic air-to-surface missile for the first time. This unveiling comes amidst concerns over delays in weapons integration, which have affected the export competitiveness of domestic fighter jets such as the FA-50 and the KF-21. However, the new missile offers promising export potential and may help strengthen the position of Korean defense exports in international markets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. (Picture source: YouTube/슈퍼소닉TV) The supersonic air-to-surface missile is designed to be mounted on aircraft and can strike key ground targets with precision from long range. Similar to missiles like the Cheonryong developed by LIG Nex1 and Germany’s Taurus, this missile performs the same fundamental task. However, unlike subsonic air-to-surface missiles that fly at speeds of 700–1,100 km/h, the newly unveiled missile reaches supersonic speeds of Mach 2.5, or around 3,000 km/h, making it much harder to detect and intercept. With a range of 300 km, the missile can hit its target in just about five minutes after launch, significantly reducing the reaction time for enemy defenses. The missile is also expected to incorporate stealth technology, making it less detectable by enemy radar. One of the key features enabling such high speeds is the ducted ramjet engine. This innovative propulsion system combines the advantages of jet and rocket engines, using atmospheric oxygen instead of carrying an onboard oxidizer. This design not only simplifies the structure but also allows for longer burn times and faster speeds compared to traditional jet engines. Another notable characteristic of this missile is its modular design, which enables it to perform multiple functions. By simply swapping modules, the missile can be configured to engage either ground targets or enemy ships. The missile’s seeker, equipped with both radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, further enhances its ability to accurately strike targets in various weather conditions and amidst electronic countermeasures. Although the missile displayed at the air show was a test model rather than a final product, it represents a significant step forward. Weapons intended for aircraft integration typically require extensive software development and flight testing, which incurs substantial costs. To address this, ADD has been using test models for preliminary drop and flight tests. Flight tests of this new missile are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. (Picture source: 23.BLT) According to the data released by ADD, the missile has been under development since 2022, with full completion expected by 2026. Flight tests are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. Key defense contractors such as Hanwha Aerospace and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) are participating in the missile's development. Once integrated with the FA-50, the supersonic air-to-surface missile will offer an unparalleled capability within its class, significantly boosting the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jet. In contrast, rival jets like the F-16V and JAS-39E Gripen currently only operate subsonic air-to-surface missiles. While France’s Rafale can carry supersonic air-to-surface missiles, these are equipped with nuclear warheads, making them unsuitable for export. As a result, the supersonic missile will be an exclusive asset for the FA-50 and KF-21. Countries that have already purchased the FA-50, such as Poland, are expected to express interest in this missile as well. For instance, the South Korean Air Force (ROKAF) first deployed the FA-50 in 2014, assigning 20 units to an Air Force wing. ROKAF ordered a total of 60 FA-50s, and in 2014, the aircraft successfully conducted a test firing of an AGM-65 Maverick missile. Indonesia signed a contract in 2011 for 16 T-50i aircraft, a variant of the FA-50 with light attack capabilities, followed by additional orders in 2021. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute to the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jets. (Picture source: Twitter/KalisGo) Iraq also signed a contract for 24 FA-50IQ variants in 2013, receiving the first batch in 2017, though operational challenges delayed their deployment until 2022. The Philippine Air Force procured 12 FA-50PH units in 2014, and since 2017, these aircraft have been used in various combat operations, including airstrikes against terrorist positions. Additional orders are being considered as part of the PAF's Flight Plan 2028. Several other countries have purchased or shown interest in the FA-50. Thailand ordered a total of 12 T-50TH units, with deliveries starting in 2018. Poland is acquiring 48 FA-50 aircraft to replace its aging MiG-29 and Su-22 fleets, with deliveries beginning in 2023. Malaysia finalized a contract for 18 FA-50 Block 20 aircraft in 2023, with the possibility of future orders. Other nations expressing interest or considering the FA-50 include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brunei, Colombia, Croatia, Egypt, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, Spain, Slovakia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Vietnam. Some of these countries have explored options for joint production, while others are considering the FA-50 for advanced tactical and training purposes. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute not only to the enhancement of military power but also to the growth of defense exports. By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. Therefore, this new supersonic air-to-surface missile is poised to play a key role in both augmenting South Korea’s military strength and expanding its defense exports, marking a significant upgrade of the FA-50's capacities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/south-korea-reveals-supersonic-air-to-surface-missile-to-strengthen-fighter-jets-exports	2024-10-25T01:34:31-07:00

US Marines Integrate Moving Stock Aiming System to Enhance Rifle Accuracy Against Drones	The U.S. Marines are exploring an automated targeting system for standard infantry rifles, aimed at improving every soldier’s capacity to defend against the rising threat of drones on the battlefield. The ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS) innovation incorporates an automatic adjustment mechanism to fine-tune the aiming point, optimizing precision against unmanned aerial threats. Currently undergoing tests with the 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii, this equipment marks a significant advancement for accurately targeting moving threats, which are often challenging to counter through traditional methods. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marine fires a ZeroMark Fire Control System attached to an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle during a live-fire demonstration on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Oct. 23, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Developed by New York-based startup ZeroMark, founded in 2022, the ZeroMark FCS has received investment from prominent backers, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Ground Up Ventures, and benefits from $7 million in funding for research and development. The system relies on sophisticated machine vision technology, with electro-optical cameras and LiDAR sensors to detect and track targets in real time. The system’s distinct feature lies in its motorized buttstock, which adjusts the rifle’s angle to optimize shooting accuracy, allowing the shooter to target drones more effectively. Unlike existing assisted-aiming systems like the SMASH 2000 series from Israeli firm Smart Shooter, ZeroMark’s FCS uses advanced vision algorithms to steer the weapon’s barrel, even making slight angular adjustments to maximize shot alignment. ZeroMark’s technology, described as a 'fire control system,' includes a small computer and motorized stock. CEO Joel Anderson explains that this motorized stock creates a virtual pivot between the shoulder and rifle, allowing small degree adjustments to refine shot trajectory and compensate for both drone and shooter movement, as well as variations caused by noise or torque. Installation on any rifle takes just 30 seconds, potentially making drone defense a manageable task for the average soldier. Anderson states that the system 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting an 18-meter-diameter circle,' making such skills accessible to a broader range of soldiers. A former U.S. Navy member and the first security director of MongoDB, Anderson says he drew inspiration for ZeroMark after driving a Tesla with autopilot and wondering why similar technology wasn’t available to soldiers. Seeing a growing need for anti-drone solutions, he presented the prototype to a16z partners, who encouraged him to launch the startup in 2022. ZeroMark’s development is focused solely on countering offensive drones. While acknowledging that the concept of a weapon 'that never misses' may be controversial, Anderson clarifies that the company avoids marketing its systems to law enforcement, stating: 'I don’t believe the world is ready for that, nor am I. I don’t want to see AI-enabled weapons in police hands.' To mitigate potential misuse, the company has incorporated remote management, license-based activation, and fleet management features to ensure responsible use. FCS units are already in use by private security firms to protect assets like boats against potential drone threats related to piracy. ZeroMark is in talks to send its devices to Ukraine and is engaging in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense for testing and evaluation that could lead to larger orders. Beyond self-targeting capabilities, Anderson envisions ZeroMark software being applied in other contexts, such as cameras capable of identifying drone types, origin, or payload. In the long term, he envisions integrating the system into head-up displays or auditory interfaces to deliver real-time critical information to soldiers. Anderson sums up his vision: 'Large systems like aircraft carriers don’t win wars. They help project power but don’t capture Husseins, don’t kill Bin Ladens, don’t bring hostages home; soldiers do... and I want them to be as untouchable as an F-22 in the sky.'	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-marines-integrate-moving-stock-aiming-system-to-enhance-rifle-accuracy-against-drones	2024-10-25T00:50:07-07:00

This marked a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, showcasing Hezbollah's growing missile capabilities and its increasing reliance on advanced military technology.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hezbollah fighters launch a Qader-2 missile from a concealed underground silo to target Israeli territory. (Picture source: Social Network) The current situation between Hezbollah and Israel has intensified, with Hezbollah significantly increasing its missile attacks on Israeli territory. In recent weeks, the militant group has launched a series of missile barrages, targeting key Israeli cities and military installations. These attacks have escalated in both frequency and intensity, with Hezbollah deploying more advanced missiles such as the Qader-2 and Nasr 1. The use of underground launch sites has made these strikes harder to detect and intercept, challenging Israel’s air defense systems. The Qader-2, an upgraded version of Iran's Qader-1 missile, was specifically engineered for precision strikes and enhanced destructive capability. It boasts a maximum range of approximately 300 kilometers, surpassing the 200-kilometer range of its predecessor, making it more versatile in targeting deeper Israeli territory. The missile's pinpoint accuracy, reportedly within five meters, gives Hezbollah a tactical advantage in hitting strategic and critical infrastructure targets with high precision. According to the Iranian Press Agency, Hezbollah launched these missiles in response to air strikes on Lebanese territory in recent days. The Qader-2 missiles were part of a broader missile barrage that included Nasr 1 missiles, aimed at the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Iran has been a critical supporter of Hezbollah, providing the group with financial, military, and logistical backing for decades. This support includes the supply of advanced weaponry, such as the Qader and other ballistic missiles, which significantly enhance Hezbollah’s military capabilities. Iran's Revolutionary Guard plays a pivotal role in training Hezbollah fighters and aiding in the development of their missile programs, including the construction of underground launch sites. This relationship allows Hezbollah to maintain a robust arsenal and operational infrastructure, enabling it to challenge Israeli forces and carry out sophisticated attacks. Iran’s support of Hezbollah is part of its broader strategy to exert influence in the region and confront Israel indirectly through proxy forces. What makes this attack particularly concerning is the method of deployment. The Qader-2 missiles were fired from underground silos, demonstrating Hezbollah's increasing reliance on concealed and hardened launch sites. This tactic complicates efforts to detect and intercept such missiles, making it more difficult for Israel's missile defense systems to neutralize before launch. The use of underground missile sites underscores Hezbollah's capability to strike while minimizing exposure to counterstrikes. The Qader-2 missile represents a significant leap in Hezbollah's military technology, enhanced to meet the group’s specific operational needs. With an increased range, accuracy, and destructive power, these missiles enable Hezbollah to carry out more precise attacks on Israeli territory, including heavily fortified areas. This latest round of missile strikes marks a new chapter in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, intensifying regional tensions as both sides continue to escalate their military actions. As Hezbollah deploys more advanced weaponry like the Qader-2 from underground silos, the threat to Israeli cities and infrastructure grows, raising the stakes in the ongoing confrontation. The key threat to Israel from Hezbollah's missile attacks lies in the advanced technology and tactics the group employs. Missiles like the Qader-2, with an extended range of up to 300 kilometers and precision targeting within five meters, can strike deep into Israeli territory, including densely populated cities and critical infrastructure. Hezbollah's use of underground silos for launching these missiles makes detection and pre-emptive strikes difficult, reducing Israel's ability to neutralize threats before launch. Despite Israel's sophisticated air defense systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling, the sheer volume of missile barrages combined with Hezbollah's ability to conceal launch sites strains these defenses, increasing the likelihood of successful strikes and further complicating Israel’s military response.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-hezbollah-launches-qader-2-missiles-from-underground-silos-targeting-israel	2024-10-24T02:18:21-07:00

US confirms 3000 North Korean soldiers moved to Russia for military training	On October 23, 2024, during a press conference, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the deployment of these 3,000 North Korean soldiers to eastern Russia. According to reports, these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan region in North Korea to Vladivostok, a major port in eastern Russia. They were then transferred to various military training centers in eastern Russia, where they are currently undergoing intensive training. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning (Picture source: KNCA) The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning. Fears of these troops engaging in combat alongside Russian forces have heightened concerns about further escalation in the war in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin echoed this concern, stating that this development would be a 'serious step' after North Korea had already supplied arms to Russia. The exact nature of the North Korean soldiers' mission, who are currently in training, remains unclear. This situation arises as Russia seeks to bolster its military capabilities in a conflict that has become protracted. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, the war has escalated, causing significant casualties on both sides, while remaining largely focused on the eastern front of Ukraine. The potential arrival of North Korean soldiers could mark a significant shift in this war of attrition. The U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation and has briefed Ukrainian authorities as well as international partners. Kirby added that should these North Korean soldiers enter combat, they would become 'legitimate targets' for the Ukrainian forces. The deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia is seen by many observers as a sign of weakness on the part of the Kremlin. The decision to turn to Pyongyang, a largely isolated state on the international stage, reflects the difficult position in which Moscow finds itself after more than two years of conflict. Relying on North Korean human resources further highlights Russia’s growing dependence on marginal alliances, even as its losses on the battlefield continue to mount. The South Korean government, for its part, has expressed concern about the potential military technology Russia might offer North Korea in exchange for this military support. Some experts suggest that Moscow could provide advanced military technologies to Pyongyang, particularly in the areas of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which would significantly enhance the threat posed by North Korea to the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has also indicated that this deployment could involve up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers by the end of the year. Despite denials from both Moscow and Pyongyang regarding troop deployments or arms transfers, the international community, especially NATO, views this growing military alliance between Russia and North Korea as a major concern. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been invited to Brussels to share intelligence on these developments with NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-confirms-3000-north-korean-soldiers-moved-to-russia-for-military-training	2024-10-24T01:10:49-07:00

(Picture source: Chinese MoD) The Type 903A supply ships are integral to the PLA Navy’s logistics, designed to support naval operations through extensive replenishment functions. The Kekexilihu is equipped to deliver a wide array of supplies, including fuel and essential materials, while also facilitating helicopter operations. Replenishment operations Replenishment at sea (RAS) plays a crucial role in modern naval warfare by enabling fleets to remain operational far from their home bases for extended periods. This capability extends the endurance of naval forces by allowing them to resupply with fuel, ammunition, food, and other essential stores without returning to port, thus maintaining their presence in the operational area and maximizing combat effectiveness. During major naval campaigns like World War II, RAS allowed fleets, such as the U.S. Navy’s Task Force 58, to remain engaged in continuous operations, including long-range strikes against Japan, by refueling and resupplying at sea. The ability to conduct underway replenishments meant that fleets could avoid the lengthy transit times to distant bases, which would otherwise limit their operational tempo. By the end of the war, the U.S. had refined RAS to include not just fuel but also ordnance, enabling sustained high-tempo operations over vast distances​. In more recent conflicts, such as the Falklands War, the critical nature of RAS was highlighted when the British Navy operated 7,000 miles from home. The success of this operation relied heavily on the Navy’s ability to sustain its fleet through effective resupply at sea. Similarly, today’s complex naval missions—ranging from humanitarian aid to high-intensity conflict—depend on the logistical support provided by RAS to maintain forward-deployed naval forces​. Moreover, replenishment operations are not without risks. Ships involved in RAS are highly vulnerable, as their ability to maneuver is limited while they are connected for resupply. This vulnerability underscores the importance of coordination, precision, and technology, as modern RAS systems increasingly emphasize safety and reliability​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-supply-ship-kekexilihu-conducts-helicopter-replenishment-during-maritime-drill-in-yellow-sea	2024-10-24T00:50:54-07:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance (Picture source: Leonardo ) In November 2023, rumors surfaced suggesting that Germany might abandon the SCAF program in favor of joining GCAP. Despite official denials, the Trinity House Agreement seems to bolster these claims by intensifying defense ties between Germany and the UK, including joint land-based weapons projects and drone development. The SCAF Project, also known as FCAS (Future Combat Air System), is a large-scale European initiative involving France, Germany, and Spain. It aims to develop a next-generation air combat system, expected to be operational around 2040. This program is based on a 'system of systems' approach, including three main components: the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), unmanned systems called Remote Carriers (RC), and a digital infrastructure known as the Combat Cloud. The NGF, led by Dassault Aviation, will serve as the central platform for advanced combat missions, assisted by RC drones that provide specific support capabilities. The Combat Cloud will enable integrated communication between all system elements, optimizing data management and decision-making, even in contested environments. The objective is to strengthen European technological sovereignty and ensure autonomous defense capabilities for future threats. The GCAP Project, launched in 2022, is a competing initiative led by the UK, Italy, and Japan. The goal is to develop a sixth-generation fighter that can operate alongside unmanned systems, combat drones, and advanced intelligent weapons. Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance. The project aims to replace the UK and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons and Japan's Mitsubishi F-2 by 2035. It benefits from industrial expertise provided by partners such as BAE Systems, Leonardo, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries​. While both programs aim to develop next-generation air combat capabilities, they differ in structure and ambition. SCAF focuses on enhancing European interoperability between existing platforms like the Rafale and Eurofighter, while GCAP involves broader cooperation with a focus on transnational alliances beyond Europe. However, delays in the SCAF program could lead to Germany reorienting part of its efforts toward projects that address its more immediate needs. The Trinity House Agreement, presented by the UK Ministry of Defense as a significant step for European security, underscores the growing importance of cooperation between the two largest European defense investors. In addition to enhanced joint exercises, the agreement includes provisions to protect critical underwater infrastructure and marks the first-ever temporary deployment of German P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in Scotland, bolstering the UK's surveillance capabilities. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon (Picture source: Army Recognition) A major component of this agreement is the defense industry collaboration, including plans for a large-caliber weapons manufacturing facility in the UK and joint work on ground-based drones (UGVs). This initiative could pave the way for British participation in the Franco-German MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) project. The agreement also emphasizes the rapid development of new, more precise long-range weapons systems. Although the German Defense Ministry has been vague on this point, these projects could fall under the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, which the UK recently joined. The Trinity House Agreement also touches on air defense cooperation, with plans to integrate British and German systems to better protect European airspace from long-range missile threats. Despite the UK's current limitations in this domain, as noted in a recent report, this cooperation could enhance collective security in Europe. One of the most notable aspects of this agreement is the commitment to developing autonomous aerial drones that can operate in coordination with fighter aircraft. Although Germany had initially planned to collaborate with France on the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS) project, Berlin's decision to purchase P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Boeing ended that initiative. The agreement with the UK could signal a shift toward solutions more tailored to the specific needs of both nations. The German Ministry of Defense clarified that these drones will be developed in close cooperation with allies, particularly France, as part of SCAF's third pillar, which Germany oversees. This pillar focuses on drones and connected effectors. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon. Although the technical details of this project remain undisclosed, it appears to align with the goals of the Trinity House Agreement. Finally, supporting Ukraine remains a central objective for both countries. This agreement reaffirms their commitment to providing Ukraine with the military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Concrete initiatives include integrating modern missile systems into the Sea King helicopters donated by Germany and closer collaboration between the UK and German defense industries to support Ukraine's war effort.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/leave-scaf-for-gcap-germanys-growing-alliance-with-uk-in-combat-drone-technology	2024-10-24T00:27:21-07:00

Poland introduces SA-35MM counter-drone air defense system using programmable ammunition	At the inaugural International Armament Congress, held from October 21 to 25, 2024, in Kraków, Poland, defense company Pit-Radwar presented a new 35mm self-propelled artillery system equipped with programmable ammunition. Designed to integrate into the evolving air defense architecture of the Polish Armed Forces, this system aims to enhance very short-range air defense (VSHORAD) capabilities against modern aerial threats, including drones, aircraft, and cruise missiles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The SA-35MM achieves a 97% hit probability using programmable ABM ammunition, with just seven projectiles releasing over 50 subprojectiles each. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The newly unveiled system, named the SA-35MM, combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system. It features an independent optoelectronic target-tracking system called ZGS-35, a hybrid fire control system with the TUGA radar, and optoelectronic sensors. Mounted on a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform, the system is developed to engage a wide spectrum of air targets performing maneuvers in course, speed, and altitude within the fire zone, enabling effective short-term anti-aircraft defense of stationary strategic assets, troop concentrations, and mobile units. The SA-35MM is particularly effective against low-cost, small, and very small targets, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (including kamikaze drones). The system is compatible with Polish air defense systems and is capable of autonomous target engagement, offering a high level of automation and remote control capabilities. Its design allows for fast mission readiness and deployment without manual alignment. The AM-35mm automatic cannon has a rate of fire of 550 rounds per minute and features a two-sided, chained ammunition feeding system with a magazine capacity of 2 x 100 rounds. It can immediately switch between two types of ammunition, typically sub-caliber FAPDS-T (Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot with Tracer) and programmable Air Burst Munition (ABM), allowing it to effectively combat various airborne and ground threats. The cannon is reduced in size and weight by utilizing carbon fiber technology, and it can operate autonomously via its own remote-control console or integrated with a combat management system. The ZGS-35 optoelectronic tracking system includes an infrared thermal imaging camera, a daylight camera, a high-repetition laser rangefinder, a video tracker, and a short-range interrogator. These components enable accuracy in dynamic object tracking, allowing the system to perform combat operations in various weather conditions, both day and night. The tracking head has an operational range in elevation from -10° to 85° and can perform continuous 360° rotation in azimuth. It provides range readout limits from a minimum of 200 meters to a maximum of 30,000 meters, with a ranging rate of 30 Hz. The SA-35MM combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system and a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The TUGA radar, part of the hybrid fire control system, operates on continuous wave modulation by frequency (FMCW) with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna in the X-band. This radar technology uses low transmitted signal power, making it difficult to detect by enemy reconnaissance devices, thus increasing operational security. Despite its low power and compact size, the TUGA radar has a detection range from 50 meters to 50 kilometers and can detect small drones at distances up to 5 kilometers. The development of this artillery system is a collaborative effort involving Pit-Radwar, the Military University of Technology, and the defense company Mesko. The project is co-financed by Poland's National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR), as part of Competition no. 12/2022 for projects in development works for state defense and security. The Tactical and Technical Assumptions have been approved by the AU Chief, with the objective to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system. The implementation period spans from December 20, 2022, to June 20, 2025. During the congress, Pit-Radwar conducted demonstrations showcasing the system's capabilities. One test involved targeting a small unmanned aerial vehicle located 1,000 meters away, with an angular size of 0.5x2.0 milliradians. The AG-35 cannon achieved a dispersion of no more than 0.5 milliradians, closely matching the dimensions of the drone, demonstrating the system's precision. Field test results indicated that achieving a 99% probability of hitting the target with at least one projectile required firing 24 rounds of typical TP-T/FAPDS-T ammunition. In contrast, using programmable ABM ammunition, firing only seven projectiles achieved a probability of hitting at the level of 97%, with each projectile releasing over 50 subprojectiles. This represents a significant reduction in ammunition consumption while maintaining a high probability of target destruction. The objective is to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system, before June 20, 2025. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) Pit-Radwar proposed integrating the 35mm cannon into self-propelled artillery systems mounted on the AS-35 wheeled chassis. Two configurations for very short-range air defense (VSHORAD) batteries were suggested. The first, an artillery battery, would consist of four self-propelled SA-35 guns, a WG-35 fire control vehicle, a command vehicle, and a preliminary detection radar such as the Soła or Bystra systems. The second, a rocket-artillery battery, would include self-propelled Poprad missile systems enhanced with anti-drone technologies and a K-band tracking radar, in addition to the artillery components. The SA-35MM system operates autonomously, equipped with its own fire control system based on the ZGS-35 optoelectronic tracking and aiming head. The integrated optoelectronic tracking head ensures accuracy in dynamic object tracking through its sensors, which include thermal imaging and daylight cameras, a laser rangefinder, and a video tracker. The system also features a communication and data transmission subsystem, enabling radio and cable communication with the battery command and control system and the WG-35 fire control vehicle, allowing for remote control from a portable terminal. The drive subsystems of the gun and the optoelectronic tracking head are designed with advanced drive units and dedicated electronic controllers, providing high dynamics and precision of movement. An inertial navigation subsystem, including GPS, ensures accurate positioning and continuous measurement of azimuth angle, inclination, and tilt. The system also includes a non-kinetic UAV neutralization system and emphasizes cost-efficiency by reducing logistics and personnel requirements, thereby lowering life-cycle costs. Public and expert reactions at the congress reflected interest in the potential implementation of the system. The presentation of this new 35mm air defense system underscored its significant advantage in reducing ammunition consumption while maintaining effectiveness, especially when compared to 23mm caliber systems. This efficiency is largely attributed to the use of programmable ammunition in the 35mm system, enhancing precision and operational capability. Observers expressed hope that the program would be carried out consistently, with some anticipating the first batteries to be operational by 2026. Others highlighted the necessity for mass production to ensure the security of key facilities and troops, especially given the increasing use of drones in modern conflicts, such as in Ukraine, Gaza, or Lebanon.

British army Intel Reports Russia's Escalation in Use of One-Way Attack Drones Against Ukraine	According to a report published by the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) Intelligence Service on September 23, 2024, Russia launched over 1,300 One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (OWA-UAVs) into Ukraine during September alone. This marks the highest number of such drone strikes in a single month since the beginning of the conflict, signaling a significant escalation in the use of these unmanned aerial systems. The British MoD warns that, based on the current rate of operations, it is almost certain that Russia will surpass this figure in October 2024, reflecting a growing trend of intensified aerial assaults against Ukrainian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Debris of a Russian Shahed-136 (Geran-2) drone scattered across a Ukrainian field. (Picture source: Russian Social Network) While it remains unclear whether Russia can sustain this aggressive rate of OWA-UAV (One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles ) strikes throughout the year, intelligence reports suggest that Moscow is likely expanding its capacity to produce these drones domestically. Previously reliant on Iranian-supplied UAVs, Russia is believed to be increasing its production capabilities to maintain and even amplify its ability to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine. This shift in supply lines is seen as part of a broader strategy to mitigate the risks of sanctions and supply chain disruptions, giving Moscow a more resilient capability to sustain its drone warfare efforts. OWA-UAVs, often colloquially referred to as 'kamikaze drones,' are primarily employed to strike critical Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly energy facilities. These drones, due to their low cost and ability to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory, have proven effective in disrupting energy supplies and damaging critical civilian infrastructure, particularly ahead of the harsh winter months. This has put enormous pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems, which are tasked with countering both conventional missile strikes and these swarming UAVs. In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, several Russian One-Way Attack (OWA) drones, or loitering munitions, have been deployed, each with specific technical features. The Shahed-136 (Russian designation: Geran-2), developed by Iran, is one of the most frequently used OWA drones. It is known for its delta-wing design, giving it a distinctive appearance. The Shahed-136 is powered by a small engine, typically the MD-550, and has a range of about 2,500 kilometers. It carries a warhead of approximately 40-50 kilograms and is designed to strike static targets such as infrastructure and supply depots. While its speed is relatively low (about 185 km/h), its main strength lies in the ability to be deployed in large numbers, making it difficult for defense systems to intercept all of them​. The Shahed-131 (Russian designation: Geran-1) is a smaller version of the Shahed-136 and shares much of the same design, though with a smaller payload and range. It has a range of about 900 kilometers and carries a warhead weighing around 10-15 kilograms. It also features a delta-wing design and is primarily used for shorter-range attacks on military targets​. Russia’s domestically produced Lancet drone, developed by ZALA Aero, features more advanced targeting capabilities compared to the Shahed drones.
