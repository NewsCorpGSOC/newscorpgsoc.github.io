This strike, aimed at showing solidarity with Gaza amidst escalating regional tensions, marks a significant escalation in Yemen's role in the broader Middle Eastern conflict.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Propaganda footage released by Yemen showcases the launch of the advanced 'Palestine 2' hypersonic missile. (Picture source: Yemen armed forces) The 'Palestine 2' hypersonic missile represents a technological milestone for Yemen’s military. Capable of speeds up to Mach 16 and a range of 2,150 kilometers, the missile utilizes a two-stage solid fuel system, making it highly efficient and reliable. Enhanced with advanced stealth technology and exceptional maneuverability, it poses a direct challenge to even the most advanced air defense systems, such as Israel’s Iron Dome. Yemen’s deployment of this weapon underscores its commitment to supporting the Palestinian cause, while highlighting its increasing alignment with Iran’s regional strategy. Yemen’s involvement in the conflict against Israel is not limited to symbolic gestures but now extends to active military engagement. By launching the 'Palestine 2' missile in support of Gaza, Yemen has positioned itself as a vital member of the regional resistance front. This alliance, supported by Iranian expertise and resources, includes actors such as Hamas and Hezbollah, all of whom share a common goal of challenging Israel’s dominance in the region. Yemen’s ability to deploy such advanced weaponry not only signals its growing military capabilities but also intensifies the pressure on Israel, forcing it to contend with threats from multiple directions. For Israel, the arrival of hypersonic missile technology in the region represents a grave threat. Israel’s advanced missile defense systems—Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow—are designed to counter conventional missile threats. However, the unique characteristics of hypersonic missiles, including their extreme speed and ability to maneuver unpredictably, significantly reduce the effectiveness of these defenses. The 'Palestine 2' missile’s capacity to evade interception makes critical infrastructure and population centers like Tel Aviv particularly vulnerable. The psychological impact of this new threat cannot be overstated. Israel’s reputation for maintaining an impenetrable defense network has been a cornerstone of its security doctrine. Yemen's successful deployment of hypersonic technology undermines this perception, potentially eroding public confidence and emboldening adversaries. Furthermore, the threat of coordinated attacks involving Yemen, Hamas, and Hezbollah stretches Israel’s military resources, increasing the likelihood of defensive oversaturation and failure to address all threats effectively. The risks extend far beyond Israel’s borders. The 'Palestine 2' missile also introduces significant challenges for the United States and its allies, particularly naval forces operating in the region. Hypersonic missiles are a game-changer for maritime warfare, capable of targeting large and mobile assets such as aircraft carriers, destroyers, and amphibious ships. Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons combine extreme speed with unpredictable flight paths, rendering existing ship-based defenses, such as the Aegis Combat System, less effective. The potential for Yemen to target U.S. vessels not only threatens military operations but also undermines the perception of American dominance in the region. In addition to naval assets, Yemen’s hypersonic capabilities threaten key maritime chokepoints, including the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden. These waterways are critical for global commerce and military logistics. A strike or even the credible threat of disruption in these areas could have catastrophic economic consequences, affecting trade routes and energy supplies worldwide. U.S. allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are also at significant risk. Their naval forces and offshore energy infrastructure remain particularly vulnerable, given their relatively limited defensive capabilities compared to those of the U.S. Navy. On a broader scale, the emergence of hypersonic missile technology in Yemen reshapes the balance of power in the Middle East. Hypersonic missiles combine speed, precision, and maneuverability, making them extremely difficult to counter. Their deployment undermines traditional deterrence frameworks, heightens the risk of miscalculation, and complicates military planning for nations dependent on conventional defense systems. The proliferation of such technology to smaller states and non-state actors like Yemen, often through Iranian support, accelerates the destabilization of an already volatile region. Yemen’s deployment of 'Palestine 2' missile underscores its commitment to the Palestinian cause and its role in the broader anti-Israel alliance. Its use of advanced technology highlights a growing willingness to engage directly in regional conflicts, challenging Israel and its allies both strategically and militarily. For the United States and its partners, this development necessitates urgent investment in next-generation defensive technologies, such as directed-energy weapons, enhanced early-warning systems, and hypersonic interception capabilities. As tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate, the strategic, economic, and military implications of Yemen’s actions are profound. By introducing hypersonic missiles into the theater, Yemen has reshaped the contours of conflict, setting a precedent that will likely influence regional and global security strategies for years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-yemen-targets-israel-with-palestine-2-hypersonic-missile-posing-new-threats-for-us-and-allies	2024-12-18T02:00:13-08:00

Bulgaria's Naval Modernization: Second Patrol Vessel Successfully Launched	According to information published by MTG Dolphin on December 13, 2024, the second Multipurpose Modular Patrol Vessel (MMPV) for the Bulgarian Navy was successfully launched at the MTG Dolphin Shipyard in Varna.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launching ceremony of the second Bulgarian Navy's Multipurpose modular patrol vessel or MMPV. (Picture source: MTG Dolphin Shipyard) The MMPVs, designed for versatility and multi-role operations, are being constructed at MTG Dolphin Shipyard under a contract with the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense. The project is carried out in cooperation with NVL Group (formerly known as Lürssen Defence), a renowned German shipbuilder specializing in naval vessels. The Multipurpose Modular Patrol Vessels are intended to perform a variety of missions, including maritime surveillance, search and rescue (SAR), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), and environmental monitoring. The first MMPV was launched earlier this year, marking the beginning of the new generation of patrol vessels for Bulgaria. With the successful launch of the second vessel, the Bulgarian Navy is on track to further enhance its naval capabilities and operational readiness in the Black Sea region, a strategically important area for both national and NATO interests. The MMPVs are expected to feature a displacement of approximately 2,300 tons, a length of around 90 meters, and a speed exceeding 21 knots. The vessels will accommodate 50-60 personnel and be equipped with modular weapons systems for anti-surface and anti-air defense, as well as advanced radar and surveillance systems for maritime situational awareness. They will also support mission-specific equipment, including unmanned systems and auxiliary boats for interception, rescue, or inspection operations. Black Sea The Black Sea remains a vital and contested maritime domain, with the navies of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia all navigating evolving challenges and roles in the region. Russia's Black Sea Fleet, once dominant, has faced severe disruptions. Ukrainian attacks, particularly with drones and long-range missiles, have significantly reduced Russia’s operational freedom. The loss of the Moskva cruiser and repeated strikes on Sevastopol have forced Russia to reposition much of its fleet to Novorossiysk and further into the Sea of Azov. While it retains submarines and missile-capable corvettes, Russia’s ability to project power in the Black Sea has been hampered, forcing it into a more defensive posture. The Ukrainian Navy, though diminished in conventional strength, has revolutionized naval warfare in the Black Sea. With innovative use of unmanned surface vessels and domestically produced Neptune missiles, Ukraine has inflicted disproportionate damage. This asymmetric strategy has not only targeted major Russian vessels but has also disrupted supply lines to Crimea, diminishing Russia's naval control. Turkey, as the most significant naval power in the Black Sea, carefully manages its position. Its navy, which operates advanced frigates, corvettes, and submarines, focuses on safeguarding Turkish interests while balancing its geopolitical relationships. Turkey’s strict enforcement of the Montreux Convention limits external naval intervention in the Black Sea, ensuring it remains a regional actor with considerable influence. Romania’s naval forces are modest but active. While relying on aging Type 22 frigates and smaller patrol vessels, Romania has increasingly focused on modernization programs to enhance its capabilities. This includes upgrading its fleet for better coastal defense and mine-clearance operations, vital for maintaining the safety of Black Sea shipping lanes. Georgia does not maintain a formal navy. Its Coast Guard remains responsible for maritime security, focusing on territorial water patrols and countering smuggling. Heavily reliant on external support, Georgia continues to upgrade its patrol capabilities through assistance programs.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/bulgarias-naval-modernization-second-patrol-vessel-successfully-launched	2024-12-17T01:43:55-08:00

Argentine Prepares To Field First 10 VC TAM 2C-A2 Main Battle Tanks	On 20 December 2024, the President of Argentine, Javier Milei, will visit the facilities of the Dirección de Arsenales in Boulogne to preside over the ceremony marking the delivery of the first 10 VC TAM 2C-A2 main battle tanks to the Argentine Army. However, the announced number of tanks raises questions, as not all units will be fully operational due to various delays and issues encountered in the modernization program. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The VC TAM 2C-A2 project is seen as a key element in the modernisation of the Argentine army's armoured capabilities. (Picture source: Social Media) The VC TAM 2C-A2 project, considered a key element in modernizing the armored capabilities of the Argentine Army, is facing financial and logistical difficulties that are slowing its execution. One of the main challenges is the shortage of critical spare parts for the chassis of the selected tanks, which has hindered the completion of the planned units. This issue also extends to other essential supplies needed for the advancement of the program. According to sources consulted, concerns have been expressed regarding the lack of released financial guarantees for various suppliers. Several sectors have pointed out that difficulties related to these guarantees are causing additional delays and significant financial costs. This situation is also reflected in the shortage of spare parts and critical components, the delivery of which depends on contracts currently undergoing renegotiations with international suppliers, including key players such as the Israeli company Elbit Systems. Efforts are currently underway to amend the contract to include ammunition and spare parts, although the process is progressing slowly. Argentine faces several potential threats in its region, both military and economic. Among the major concerns is the ongoing dispute with the United Kingdom over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, a conflict that has persisted since the 1982 war and could still lead to tensions. Additionally, instability in neighboring countries, particularly in Venezuela and Bolivia, could have repercussions for regional security. The growing activities of transnational criminal groups, including drug trafficking and terrorism, also pose a threat to domestic stability. Finally, the strengthening of military capabilities by other South American nations, coupled with defense agreements with extra-regional powers like the United States or China, raises concerns about the strategic balance in the region. One of the most criticized aspects of the VC TAM 2C-A2 program is the frequency with which the systems are presented at ceremonial events. While these events aim to showcase progress and maintain visibility of the program, they disrupt modernization efforts due to the shortage of personnel assigned. As a result, this exacerbates the delays in the program and reduces the number of fully operational systems. The financial difficulties related to the release of guarantees have had a significant impact on both suppliers and the program itself. As highlighted in a previous article by Zona Militar, these debts are creating a bottleneck in the development of military capabilities and raising concerns about the financial management of the Argentine Armed Forces. Despite these challenges, the VC TAM 2C-A2 program remains a central component of the Argentine Army's modernization efforts. However, the lack of significant progress highlights the need for a reassessment to ensure the program’s continuity and adherence to reasonable timelines. Ceremonial events, such as the one scheduled for Friday, reinforce the narrative of progress in the public eye but also highlight the structural limitations of the program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/argentine-prepares-for-integration-of-first-10-vc-tam-2c-a2-main-battle-tanks	2024-12-17T01:24:49-08:00

At AED Days 2024, the Portuguese Air Force Chief of Staff reiterated the importance of a light attack aircraft for both operational roles and advanced pilot training. The memorandum of understanding signed in April 2023 between Embraer and four Portuguese companies—CEiiA, Empordef, GMV, and OGMA—supports the development of technologies related to the A-29N and ensures Portuguese industry involvement. OGMA, in which Embraer has a majority stake, will play a key role in the production and maintenance of the aircraft, as it already does for Embraer’s KC-390 Millennium transport aircraft. Portugal will be the first European operator of the A-29N Super Tucano, making this a notable development for Embraer’s efforts to expand its market within NATO member states. The agreement is expected to enhance interoperability within NATO by equipping the Portuguese Air Force with an aircraft tailored to the alliance’s operational requirements. Further details, including the delivery schedule and the extent of Portuguese industry’s role in production, will be clarified upon the signing of the formal contract.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/portugal-becomes-first-european-operator-of-brazilian-a-29n-super-tucano-light-attack-aircraft	2024-12-16T05:33:56-08:00	
15th Khordad Air Defense Systems: Iran’s Response to Growing US-Israel Strike Threats	According to information published by Russian sources on December 15, 2024, Iran has begun deploying its 15th Khordad air defense systems near critical nuclear facilities, a move aimed at countering escalating threats from the United States and Israel. The latest reports confirm the presence of these systems around the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear site in Natanz, a key location in Iran’s uranium enrichment efforts situated in Isfahan Province.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Iran fortifies its nuclear facilities with advanced 15th Khordad air defense systems, signaling preparedness against potential U.S. and Israeli strikes. (Picture source: Defa Press) The Natanz facility, one of Iran’s key nuclear sites, has long been under international scrutiny due to allegations by the U.S. and Israel that it plays a central role in Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Both nations claim that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities, a charge Tehran vehemently denies, asserting its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Despite these denials, Israel and the U.S. have reiterated their commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, with Israel in particular warning of preemptive military action if diplomatic efforts fail. The 15th Khordad air defense system, introduced in 2019, represents a significant leap in Iran’s ability to defend its airspace. As a domestically designed and manufactured platform, it symbolizes Iran’s push for self-reliance in military technology, especially under the weight of international sanctions that limit its access to foreign arms. This advanced system is capable of detecting and engaging a wide range of aerial threats, including fighter jets, drones, and stealth aircraft. It can identify targets at a distance of up to 150 kilometers, track them within a 120-kilometer radius, and engage at ranges of up to 75 kilometers. For stealth targets, the system offers detection capabilities at 85 kilometers and interception at 45 kilometers. The 15th Khordad is also capable of simultaneously tracking and intercepting six targets, making it a formidable tool against coordinated aerial attacks. One of its standout features is its rapid deployment time, requiring less than five minutes to become operational, allowing Iranian forces to quickly respond to potential threats. The system is equipped with Sayyad-3 missiles, which are designed for medium- to long-range engagements. These missiles enhance the system’s capacity to neutralize advanced aerial threats, including those posed by modern fighter aircraft and high-altitude surveillance platforms. The system’s maximum operational altitude is 27 kilometers, enabling it to engage targets across a broad vertical range. The placement of the 15th Khordad systems near the Natanz nuclear facility signals Iran’s intent to shield its most sensitive sites from potential airstrikes. This move comes amid heightened tensions with Israel, which has a history of targeting Iranian-linked assets in Syria and is widely believed to have carried out sabotage operations against Iranian nuclear sites in the past. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasized that his country will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weapons capability, and Israeli military officials have reportedly developed operational plans for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. U.S. rhetoric has also been strong, with Washington maintaining that all options remain on the table to prevent Iran from advancing its nuclear program. However, the Biden administration has so far prioritized diplomatic efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. Despite these efforts, the lack of progress in negotiations has fueled speculation that military action by either Israel or the U.S. remains a possibility. The deployment of the 15th Khordad systems also reflects Iran’s broader strategy to counter increasing Israeli activity in the region. Over recent years, the Israeli Air Force has conducted numerous strikes in Syria, targeting Iranian-aligned forces and infrastructure. These operations, facilitated by the limited air defense capabilities in Syria, demonstrate Israel’s ability to project power across the region. Analysts suggest that these missions could serve as a precursor to strikes on Iran, as they test Israel’s operational readiness and tactics. Iran’s deployment of the 15th Khordad systems adds another layer of complexity to the already volatile Middle East. While Tehran views these measures as defensive, their strategic implications are likely to alarm its adversaries.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/15th-khordad-air-defense-systems-irans-response-to-growing-us-israel-strike-threats	2024-12-16T05:27:35-08:00

India Conducts High-Altitude Trials of its New Zorawar Light Tank	India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) have recently showcased the latest trials of the Zorawar light tank, a new combat platform specifically designed for high-altitude operations. Footage released by the Indian Ministry of Defence shows the Zorawar engaging in live-fire exercises at elevations exceeding 4,200 meters, demonstrating both its firing accuracy and maneuverability under some of the most challenging environmental conditions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Zorawar light tank is a new combat platform specifically designed for high-altitude operations. (Picture source: Indian Social Media) These trials took place in the Ladakh region, an area of strategic importance where India and China have longstanding territorial disputes. The Indian Army has identified a need for 354 of these 25-ton-class light tanks to enhance its combat capabilities in mountainous terrain. Entirely developed within India, the Zorawar represents a significant departure from the heavier armored platforms previously deployed by the nation’s ground forces, which have traditionally relied on main battle tanks originally intended for use on flat plains and deserts. According to the Hindustan Times, the Zorawar prototype was completed at L&amp;T’s facility in July, marking a critical developmental milestone achieved in just two years. The tank is expected to become fully operational by 2027, a move that will bolster India’s defense posture along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and better equip the Indian Army to counter the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA has already introduced modern light tanks into the region—platforms that offer high power-to-weight ratios, agility, and strong performance at altitude. Currently, the Indian Army has deployed dozens of Russian-designed T-72 and T-90 tanks to the Ladakh theater. While these tanks are combat-proven and formidable in many scenarios, their operational effectiveness is limited by the thin air, steep inclines, and rugged terrain of high-altitude areas. Designed originally for operations on level ground and in desert environments, the T-72s and T-90s do not possess the same adaptability when confronted with the harsh mountain conditions. The introduction of the Zorawar is intended to close these capability gaps. By optimizing the platform for high altitude performance, agility, and quick reaction times, India aims to field a light tank that can excel where heavier platforms struggle. Beyond just firepower and armor, the Zorawar’s design priorities include improved engine performance in low-oxygen environments, advanced suspension systems to handle uneven terrain, and state-of-the-art target acquisition sensors to ensure accuracy despite difficult visibility and weather conditions. This evolution in India’s armored forces could be instrumental in maintaining a credible defensive and, if necessary, offensive stance in one of the world’s most demanding operational theaters. As both India and China continue to reinforce their positions along disputed border areas, the introduction of a homegrown, high-altitude-capable tank like the Zorawar underscores India’s strategic emphasis on self-reliance, technological innovation, and readiness to operate effectively in extreme conditions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/india-conducts-high-altitude-trials-of-its-new-zorawar-light-tank	2024-12-16T02:29:01-08:00

Belarus Hosts Russian Nuclear Weapons and Prepares for Oreshnik Ballistic Missile Deployment	Amid heightened international tensions fueled by the conflict in Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his country is hosting dozens of Russian tactical nuclear weapons and is preparing to deploy the new Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile. Reported by AP News on December 10, 2024, this statement, made during discussions on strengthened security guarantees between Minsk and Moscow, highlights an increasingly strategic partnership between the two allies in their stance against the West. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belarus notably possesses Russian Iskander-M launchers and missiles capable of being equipped with nuclear warheads (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) This nuclear deployment aligns with a significant revision of Russia’s nuclear doctrine, which now explicitly includes Belarus under Moscow’s 'nuclear umbrella.' This marks a historical shift for Minsk, which relinquished its nuclear arsenal following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. At that time, Belarus transferred its nuclear weapons to Russia and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear state. However, recent events, including a 2022 constitutional referendum that removed Belarus’ nuclear-free status, have paved the way for this return to hosting nuclear capabilities. President Lukashenko stated that these weapons were transferred discreetly, avoiding detection by Western intelligence agencies. He emphasized their defensive role against potential threats, particularly from Belarus’ borders. This strategy relies on Iskander ballistic missiles, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, as well as fighter jets equipped with nuclear bombs. These systems enable rapid targeting of potential positions in Ukraine or NATO member states, enhancing the deterrence capabilities of the Russo-Belarusian alliance. In addition, Lukashenko revealed preparations are underway for the deployment of the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile in 2025. Capable of carrying multiple warheads and reaching speeds exceeding Mach 10, this system is designed to evade missile defense systems, offering Russia an unparalleled strategic advantage. Russian President Vladimir Putin has highlighted the conventional power of the Oreshnik, stating its destructive capability rivals that of nuclear strikes. While control of these weapons will remain with Moscow, Minsk will be involved in selecting targets, further integrating the military strategies of the two nations. The Oreshnik missile represents a notable development in Russia's strategic arsenal. With hypersonic capabilities and an estimated range of 1,000 to 5,500 kilometers, it can strike critical infrastructure across Europe and parts of Asia. Equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), it can deliver conventional or nuclear warheads to several targets simultaneously with precision. First used operationally in November 2024 during the conflict in Ukraine, the missile demonstrated its strategic potential in a strike against an industrial facility. Although the warheads used were inert, the kinetic energy generated by the hypersonic speed caused significant damage, showcasing its effectiveness as both a tactical weapon and a tool of strategic deterrence. Lukashenko also noted that Belarus has retained dozens of Soviet-era sites suitable for deploying such systems. These facilities, combined with local production of transport vehicles for ballistic missiles, underline Minsk’s commitment to strengthening its role within its strategic partnership with Moscow. This alliance, formalized through a recently signed mutual security treaty, aims to deter any external aggression, particularly from NATO. The deployment of these systems, however, raises international concerns about regional stability and the risk of military escalation. While Moscow and Minsk assert that the measures are purely defensive, they represent a substantial increase in strategic pressure on Eastern Europe. Additionally, the recent lowering of Russia’s threshold for nuclear weapon use amplifies fears of potential conflict involving weapons of mass destruction. The hosting of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus and the planned deployment of Oreshnik missiles mark a significant evolution in regional security dynamics. For Minsk, these developments strengthen its strategic position alongside Moscow but also pose questions about its long-term sovereignty and security. As Belarus becomes an integral part of Russia’s nuclear strategy, these actions underscore growing tensions among major powers, signaling considerable challenges for international stability and security. Belarus’ interest in hosting advanced missile systems such as the Oreshnik lies in its strategic value. By accommodating these advanced systems, Belarus enhances its military alliance with Russia, securing stronger defense guarantees amid growing tensions with NATO and Western nations. These weapons provide Minsk with a deterrent against potential foreign intervention and bolster its geopolitical leverage in international negotiations. For European nations and NATO, the deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus represents a significant escalation of threats near their eastern borders.

(Picture source: Russian MoD) The Oreshnik ballistic missile, an experimental weapon in Russia’s arsenal, has garnered significant attention within the global defense community. First introduced publicly as part of Russia’s advanced missile development programs, the Oreshnik is believed to be a precision-guided, hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) designed to enhance strike capabilities. It reportedly travels at speeds exceeding Mach 10, making it highly challenging to intercept with current defense systems. The missile is equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing it to carry several warheads—either conventional or nuclear—capable of striking multiple targets simultaneously. Its range is estimated to be between 1,000 and 5,500 kilometers, enabling it to reach targets across Europe and parts of Asia. The Oreshnik saw its first confirmed operational use on November 21, 2024, during the Russo-Ukrainian War. The missile was employed in an attack on Ukraine's PA Pivdenmash facility in Dnipro. Initially, Ukrainian reports speculated that the attack involved an intercontinental ballistic missile; however, subsequent assessments identified the Oreshnik as the weapon used. The missile was launched from Astrakhan Oblast, likely the Kapustin Yar training ground. It reportedly carried a MIRV payload, as suggested by unverified footage. Later analyses indicated the strike may not have involved explosives and was potentially intended as a political demonstration. According to senior Ukrainian officials, the missile was equipped with 'dummy' warheads that lacked explosives, prompting U.S. experts to describe the method as an 'expensive way to deliver not that much destruction.' Despite that, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that Oreshnik's warheads, even inert, can cause 'a lot of damage' because of the kinetic energy created by their hypersonic speed. The launch appears to have been conducted with a lofted trajectory. Eyewitness accounts described prolonged explosions lasting up to three hours. Deputy Press Secretary Singh sought to temper speculation about the missile’s potential impact, emphasizing that it would not constitute a decisive shift in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. 'Should Russia choose to launch this type of missile, it’s not going to be a game changer on the battlefield,' Singh said. 'They’re trying to use every weapon in their arsenal to intimidate Ukraine. But Ukraine, with the United States and other partners around the world, continues to have our support as they fight every single day on the battlefield.' The United States and its allies have been steadfast in their military and economic support for Ukraine, supplying advanced weaponry, intelligence, and financial assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities. Despite Russia’s efforts to escalate tensions through demonstrations of military power, Singh reaffirmed the commitment of Ukraine’s international partners to ensure its resilience and sovereignty. The potential use of Oreshnik missiles poses significant threats to both Ukraine and Europe. For Ukraine, the missile’s high speed, precision, and ability to carry multiple warheads amplify the risks to critical infrastructure and civilian populations. Russia’s ability to conduct long-range strikes with near impunity challenges Ukraine’s air defense systems and could complicate ongoing counteroffensives. Beyond Ukraine, the missile’s range places much of Europe within reach, raising concerns about the broader security of NATO member states and the potential for escalations in the region. Additionally, the threat of Russia pairing hypersonic delivery systems with nuclear warheads heightens the strategic risk, forcing European nations to reassess their missile defense capabilities. In conclusion, while the Oreshnik missile’s tactical value on the battlefield may be limited, its potential as a strategic weapon of intimidation underscores the need for continued vigilance and cooperation among Ukraine’s allies. The missile serves as a reminder of the evolving nature of modern warfare and the importance of maintaining robust defenses against emerging threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-says-russia-plans-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-test-against-ukraine-soon	2024-12-15T02:53:31-08:00

This repositioning follows the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy ships anchor off the Syrian coast as satellite imagery captures their repositioning amid the fall of the Assad regime and mounting regional uncertainty.. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The images show at least three Russian vessels, including two guided-missile frigates and an oiler, stationed offshore. The remainder of Russia’s Mediterranean fleet, which previously consisted of five surface ships and a submarine, could not be located in the latest imagery. This dispersal comes in the wake of intensified security concerns surrounding Russia’s military presence in Syria. Earlier satellite data from December 5 by BlackSky confirmed all six vessels stationed at Tartous, Russia's primary Mediterranean naval base. By December 9, however, the base appeared vacant, corroborating reports from Russian war blogger 'Rybar' that the warships had vacated the facility to establish a more secure offshore position. The sudden collapse of the Assad regime has thrown Russia’s long-standing strategic partnership with Syria into turmoil. Russia, a staunch ally of Assad for decades, now faces the challenge of negotiating with the new regime to ensure the safety and continued operation of two critical military installations: the Tartous naval facility and the airbase in Latakia. These bases are pivotal for Russia’s regional military strategy, serving as hubs for naval replenishment and staging points for operations, including deployments to Africa. The naval base at Tartous is Russia’s only repair and replenishment hub in the Mediterranean. It has played a crucial role in supporting Moscow’s military contractors and logistics network. The departure of the fleet from Tartous underscores heightened security concerns as Russia scrambles to maintain its foothold in the region amidst the shifting political landscape. The Russian Defense Ministry has yet to comment on the redeployment of its naval assets or its broader strategy in Syria following Assad's ouster. The sudden political upheaval has not only destabilized Syria but also cast uncertainty over Russia’s military and geopolitical ambitions in the Mediterranean. This development marks a significant challenge for Moscow as it seeks to adapt to the rapidly evolving situation, balancing its military presence with the need for strategic diplomacy with the new Syrian leadership.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/satellite-images-show-russian-naval-shift-after-assads-overthrow-in-syria	2024-12-12T07:27:37-08:00

Syria's Navy Neutralized: Israeli Forces Target Missile Boats in Mediterranean	According to information published by the Israeli MoD on December 10, 2024, the Israeli Navy launched a large-scale offensive yesterday targeting Syrian naval assets at the Port of Latakia and Minet el-Beida Bay in Northwestern Syria. The operation, described by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Katz as a 'decisive strike,' reportedly resulted in the complete destruction of the Syrian Navy's Mediterranean fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Israeli Navy strikes Syrian naval assets in Latakia and Minet el-Beida Bay, claiming total destruction of the Syrian Navy's Mediterranean fleet. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) Footage released by the Israeli Navy captures the intensity of the operation, which focused on neutralizing strategic assets of the Syrian Navy. Among the targets were six Osa I and six Osa II-class missile boats, vessels armed with potent sea-to-sea missile systems. These Soviet-designed fast attack crafts, renowned for their speed and firepower, have been a cornerstone of Syrian maritime defense for decades. However, their destruction represents a critical blow to Syria's naval capabilities in the region. The Israeli Navy employed precision-guided munitions, electronic warfare measures, and coordinated strikes to neutralize these vessels. The operation reportedly involved advanced missile systems, potentially launched from Israel's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes and Dolphin-class submarines. The Port of Latakia, Syria's principal seaport, and Minet el-Beida Bay, a strategic maritime location near the Turkish border, were key focal points of the offensive. Latakia has been a hub for Syrian naval operations and has seen increased activity due to its proximity to Russian military installations. The targeting of this port underscores Israel's intent to disrupt Syrian maritime operations and its broader strategic partnerships. Minet el-Beida Bay, though less prominent, holds strategic value due to its location and potential use as a covert operational base for Syrian forces. By striking these locations, Israel aims to limit any future resurgence of Syrian naval power in the Mediterranean. The offensive comes amid heightened tensions in the region, with ongoing conflicts and shifting alliances complicating the geopolitical landscape. The Syrian Navy's reliance on aging Soviet-era vessels, coupled with limited resources for modernization, had already placed it at a disadvantage compared to Israel's naval fleet. This operation further solidifies Israel's maritime dominance. Meanwhile, regional observers suggest the operation could have far-reaching implications for maritime security in the Eastern Mediterranean. The destruction of Syrian naval assets not only weakens Damascus but also sends a warning to other adversaries in the region. This operation aligns with Israel's long-standing policy of preemptive strikes against perceived threats. While previous actions have primarily targeted land-based missile sites and arms depots, this marks one of the most significant naval operations by Israel in recent years. As tensions remain high, the Eastern Mediterranean is likely to see increased militarization and potential for further confrontations. For Israel, the success of this operation reinforces its strategic deterrence, though the broader regional fallout remains uncertain. Israel’s readiness and ability to conduct such a comprehensive maritime operation underscore its focus on maintaining security and supremacy in the face of regional threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/syrias-navy-neutralized-israeli-forces-target-missile-boats-in-mediterranean	2024-12-12T02:19:34-08:00

Japan selects US-made T-6 Texan II as new trainer aircraft to replace locally-made Fuji T-7	Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on November 29, 2024, the selection of the Textron Aviation Defense Beechcraft T-6 Texan II turboprop aircraft, proposed by Kanematsu Corporation, as the next-generation primary trainer for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). This selection is part of the replacement program for the Fuji T-7 trainers, which have been in service since 2003 and are approaching the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The selection process commenced on August 21, 2024, when the MoD issued requests for proposals. Evaluations were conducted in two stages. The first stage assessed compliance with performance, ground training systems, logistical support, and operational requirements. Out of four proposals, only the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II and the PC-7MKX, proposed by Subaru Corporation, advanced to the second stage. The Turkish Hurkus, proposed by Daihyaku Shoji, did not meet critical requirements, while Shintoa Trading’s proposal was disqualified due to the absence of a required aircraft component. In the second stage, a scoring system was used to evaluate performance, cost, and operational factors. The T-6 Texan II achieved the highest score and was selected. The total program cost for the T-6, including six simulators and other ground training equipment, is estimated at JPY 133.65 billion ($882.09 million). Each aircraft is projected to cost JPY 1.21 billion ($7.99 million). The FY2025 budget includes an allocation of JPY 21.2 billion ($139.92 million) for two aircraft and related systems. Japan plans to procure 36 aircraft in total, all to be imported, with deliveries scheduled through FY2030 to align with the planned retirement of the Fuji T-7 fleet. The selection of the T-6 Texan II did not include trial flights, relying instead on document-based evaluations. This methodology, while less common, reflects the MoD’s focus on cost-effectiveness and operational compliance. The decision builds on Japan’s historical use of earlier T-6 variants, including the T-6D/F/G and SNJ-5/6, operated by the JASDF and Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) from 1955. These earlier variants were replaced by jet-powered trainers in the 1960s, though some are preserved in museums, and one remains operational at Shizuhama Air Base. The MoD’s selection of the T-6 Texan II is part of a broader modernization of Japan’s pilot training infrastructure. The program is designed to prepare pilots for advanced fighter aircraft while addressing operational requirements. It remains uncertain whether the T-6 could also replace other training platforms, such as the Maritime Self-Defense Force’s T-5 trainer or the Kawasaki T-4 advanced trainer. The T-6 Texan II, derived from the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, is used by 14 countries, NATO flight schools, and the U.S. Air Force and Navy. Japan’s acquisition of the T-6 aligns with international trends toward standardization in training systems. Deliveries are set to begin in 2027, marking the first step in Japan’s phased approach to upgrading its training fleet. The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II is equipped with a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-68 turboprop engine generating 1,100 horsepower. Its specifications include a maximum speed of 586 km/h, a climb rate of 1,372 meters per minute, a service ceiling of 9,500 meters, and a range of 1,574 kilometers. Compared to the T-7, which has a maximum speed of 376 km/h and a ceiling of 7,620 meters, the T-6 provides increased performance metrics. The aircraft incorporates a digital glass cockpit with multi-function displays, a head-up display, and navigation systems. Safety features include ejection seats capable of zero-zero operations and a pressurized cockpit. It also supports synthetic air-to-ground and air-to-air training capabilities. The Fuji T-7, developed by Fuji Heavy Industries (now Subaru), has served as the JASDF’s primary trainer since 2003, replacing the T-3. Its design is derived from the Fuji T-3, which was influenced by the Beechcraft T-34C Turbo Mentor, highlighting the historical use of American aircraft designs in JASDF training.

US Deploys A-10 Thunderbolt II Ground Attack Aircraft Squadron to Counter China Threats in the Philippines	On December 11, 2024, the United States deployed A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, nicknamed 'Warthogs,' to the Philippines for joint training exercises with the Philippine Air Force. This deployment underscores the longstanding defense partnership between the two nations and takes place amid rising tensions in the South China Sea. The A-10s, assigned to the 25th Fighter Squadron based in South Korea, landed at Clark Air Base on December 6 and will remain in the Philippines until December 15. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US A-10 Thunderbolt II Ground Attack Aircraft (Picture source: US MoD) This training is part of the U.S. Air Force's Dynamic Force Employment (DFE) strategy, which aims to ensure strategic predictability while maintaining operational unpredictability in contested regions. Officially adopted in 2018, the DFE strategy combines strategic foresight with operational flexibility to respond effectively to threats in disputed areas. Developed against the backdrop of growing rivalries with powers like China and Russia, this approach prioritizes agile and short-term deployments over prolonged or fixed rotations. Since its implementation, DFE missions have been conducted in strategic regions, including Europe and the Indo-Pacific, to test and demonstrate force responsiveness. These rapid, often unannounced, deployments are designed to keep adversaries uncertain about U.S. intentions while enhancing deterrence. At the same time, this strategy maximizes troop readiness for rapidly evolving geopolitical threats, a critical factor in sensitive areas like the Indo-Pacific, where DFE was recently applied with the A-10 deployment to the Philippines in December 2024. This joint training operation occurs against the backdrop of escalating tensions in the South China Sea, where reports from late November 2024 indicated the presence of nearly 100 Chinese vessels near Thitu Island, occupied by the Philippines. The contested waters are central to overlapping territorial claims involving China, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian nations. The Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951 between the United States and the Philippines obligates both nations to respond jointly to any attack on their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces in the Pacific region, highlighting the importance of these military collaborations. Military ties between the Philippines and the United States are deeply rooted, dating back to the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, which commits both nations to mutual defense in the event of armed attacks in the Pacific region. These ties were further solidified by the 1947 military base agreement, which allowed the U.S. to maintain strategic installations such as Clark Air Base, north of Manila, and Subic Bay Naval Base, on the western coast of Luzon. Although the U.S. withdrew from these bases in 1991 following a Philippine Senate vote, cooperation resumed vigorously with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed in 2014. This agreement grants U.S. forces access to several key bases, including Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, near the South China Sea, and Basa Air Base in Pampanga, for temporary rotations. These bases play a strategic role in regular joint exercises like Balikatan, which aim to enhance interoperability and address security challenges, particularly amid China's growing claims in the South China Sea. Today, this alliance remains a cornerstone of stability in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Department of Defense has designated the Indo-Pacific region as a priority due to escalating Chinese military and maritime activities. Regular joint training exercises, such as the arrival of A-10s and a recent air drill over the Philippine Sea in November, are central to Washington's strategy for maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. According to U.S. officials, these exercises aim to bolster interoperability and shared capabilities, ensuring preparedness for emerging regional challenges. The A-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the 'Warthog,' is a twin-engine attack aircraft renowned for its rugged design and close air support capabilities. Powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines, it achieves a maximum speed of 833 km/h and has a combat range of 460 km. The aircraft is heavily armored to withstand ground fire and features redundant systems for enhanced survivability. Its primary weapon is the GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm rotary cannon, capable of firing 3,900 rounds per minute, optimized for destroying armored vehicles. Additionally, the A-10 can carry up to 7,260 kg of mixed ordnance, including missiles, bombs, and rockets, across 11 hardpoints. Its ability to operate at low altitude and slow speeds makes it unmatched in close air support and battlefield interdiction. The development of the A-10 Thunderbolt II dates back to the late 1960s when the U.S. Air Force initiated the AX (Attack Experimental) program to design an aircraft capable of providing close air support in hostile environments. The A-10's maiden flight occurred in May 1972, and it officially entered service in 1976. Designed to withstand ground fire and neutralize enemy armor, the A-10 first demonstrated its combat prowess during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, destroying hundreds of Iraqi tanks. It is equipped with the GAU-8/A Avenger rotary cannon, utilizing depleted uranium armor-piercing (API) or high-explosive incendiary (HEI) ammunition to neutralize heavily armored targets. The aircraft has also proven effective in conflicts such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, and more recently in Syria, where it was deployed against Islamic State positions. Despite multiple attempts to retire the aircraft due to its age, field reports emphasize its durability, precision, and unique ability to support ground troops, qualities that continue to justify its active service.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-deploys-a-10-thunderbolt-ii-ground-attack-aircraft-squadron-to-counter-china-threats-in-the-philippines	2024-12-11T02:10:48-08:00

Greece Prioritizes M113 Modernization Over US Bradleys and French VBCIs	According to information published by the specialized website OnAlert on December 9, 2024, the Greek military has decided to modernize its fleet of M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) rather than acquire new vehicles like the American M2 Bradleys or the French VBCIs. This decision, driven by budgetary constraints and operational requirements, represents a significant move in Greece's efforts to upgrade its armored vehicle fleet while addressing its military needs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Army soldiers conducted a convoy operation to an objective during force-on-force training at Petrochori Range, Triantafyllides Camp, Greece, as part of Olympic Cooperation 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) For years, the Greek General Staff has sought to modernize its mechanized infantry, which has faced growing obsolescence in its equipment. The Kentauros Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) project, launched in the 2000s, was abandoned, leaving Greece without a viable replacement for its aging vehicles. In 2020, a proposal was made to acquire M2A2/M2A2OD Bradleys from the United States. Although approved in 2023 for the transfer of 300 units, the refurbishment costs of the vehicles proved prohibitive. Even an offer involving 62 Bradleys free of charge and 102 more under favorable financial terms was deemed unaffordable by Athens due to budgetary limitations. Simultaneously, France proposed a compelling alternative: the immediate delivery of 120 VBCIs, with an additional 250 units to be co-produced with Greek industry. However, this option was also considered too costly. A competing offer from Rheinmetall for its KF-41 Lynx failed to secure interest for similar reasons. Ultimately, the Greek military opted for a more economical solution by modernizing its M113 fleet. This program, a collaboration between the Israeli company Rafael and the Greek firm METKA, involves upgrading over 500 M113 vehicles. The modernization includes the installation of remote-controlled weapon stations with 30mm cannons, enhanced armor, a new, more powerful propulsion system, advanced communication systems, and modern optronic sensors. The upgrades will be conducted at METKA’s facility in Magnesia, with costs significantly lower than the alternatives proposed, making this option particularly attractive for Athens. However, M113s remain APCs with a weight of 12 tons, which is significantly lighter than modern IFVs like the Bradley and VBCI, which weigh nearly twice as much and offer superior firepower. The standard M113 armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun, suitable for defense against infantry and lightly armored threats. In contrast, the VBCI is equipped with a 25mm cannon mounted on a remote turret, while the Bradley boasts a 25mm M242 cannon and can be fitted with TOW anti-tank missiles, providing substantial offensive capabilities against heavily armored targets. Regarding protection, the M113 features aluminum armor designed to withstand small arms fire and shell fragments but remains vulnerable to modern anti-tank weapons. By contrast, the VBCI and Bradley provide more robust protection against ballistic threats and improvised explosive devices. Both IFVs also incorporate advanced detection and communication systems, enhancing their battlefield efficiency. While the M113 fulfills its primary role as a troop carrier, the VBCI and Bradley surpass it in firepower, protection, and operational versatility. This choice reflects a pragmatic approach by Greece to extend the lifespan of existing equipment while addressing immediate operational needs. Modernizing the M113 fleet offers a cost-effective alternative to acquiring modern IFVs, especially considering the purchase, maintenance, and training costs associated with new vehicles. Moreover, the program supports local industry through partnerships like that with METKA, contributing to the Greek defense economy. Modernizing the M113 allows Greece to respond swiftly to operational demands. While these vehicles do not match the capabilities of Bradleys or VBCIs, upgrades such as remote weapon stations, improved armor, and advanced communication systems enhance their battlefield utility. This approach also enables Greece to deploy a larger number of modernized vehicles, reinforcing its mechanized forces quantitatively, even if qualitatively they remain behind modern IFVs. Currently, the Greek military possesses approximately 2,900 M113 APCs, including various variants acquired over decades to meet operational requirements. The decision to modernize these vehicles underscores Greece’s commitment to strengthening its military capabilities within strict budgetary limits. Although economical, this strategy raises questions about its long-term viability in addressing evolving threats and operational challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-prioritizes-m113-modernization-over-american-bradleys-and-french-vbcis	2024-12-10T23:53:47-08:00	
Analysis: With Fewer Forces Than Cold War British Army Could Collapse in 6 Months of Ukraine-Style War	Veterans Minister Al Carns, a former Royal Marine colonel, has issued a grave warning about the readiness of the British Armed Forces. He cautioned that in a conflict of the scale and intensity of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the British Army could be 'expended in six months to a year.' This stark assessment underscores significant limitations in the UK’s capacity to sustain prolonged, high-intensity military engagements, raising pressing questions about its ability to fulfill national defense obligations and meet NATO commitments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British soldiers during training exercises, highlighting efforts to maintain readiness as the Army faces historic reductions in troop numbers and challenges in sustaining prolonged high-intensity conflicts. (Picture source: British MoD) Data released earlier this year by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) lends weight to these concerns. British troop numbers have plummeted to their lowest levels since the early 1800s, with a 38% decline in recruits over the past two decades. Total personnel in the armed forces has dropped from 207,000 in 2000 to just 131,000 in 2024. The British Army now fields approximately 73,000 regular soldiers—the smallest force in its modern history—while the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force stand at 29,000 and 33,000 personnel, respectively. This dramatic erosion contrasts sharply with the Cold War, when the UK maintained robust military forces designed to counter large-scale threats such as the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the British Army was one of NATO’s strongest and most capable forces. Though smaller than the U.S. military, the UK played a pivotal role in the alliance’s defense strategy, particularly in Europe. Its reputation rested on a combination of highly trained personnel, modern equipment, and strategic positioning, bolstered by its independent nuclear deterrent. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), stationed in West Germany, exemplified this strength, consisting of four armored divisions equipped with over 800 Chieftain and Challenger 1 tanks, advanced artillery, and air defense systems like the Rapier missile. The UK’s global reach further enhanced its military power. The Royal Navy operated over 130 combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and a formidable submarine fleet. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force fielded more than 850 aircraft, including Tornado, Harrier, and Jaguar fighters, alongside robust reconnaissance and transport capabilities. Today, this once-formidable capability has been significantly diminished. The British Army now operates only 227 Challenger 2 tanks, with upgrades to Challenger 3 underway. Artillery inventories have been severely reduced, and the British Army’s ability to sustain high-volume, long-range firepower in prolonged engagements falls short of modern requirements. The Royal Navy, once boasting 130 vessels, now operates just 73, including two Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but with only 19 frigates and destroyers to escort them. Similarly, the Royal Air Force’s fleet has declined to around 500 aircraft, even as advanced platforms like the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II have entered service. The war in Ukraine vividly illustrates the resources and resilience required for sustained, high-intensity conflict. Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia has depended on continuous supplies of tanks, artillery, drones, and ammunition, much of it provided by NATO allies. If the UK faced a similar-scale conflict, the British Armed Forces would likely struggle to sustain operations beyond a few months. Insufficient ammunition stockpiles, aging equipment, and gaps in critical systems such as air defense are significant vulnerabilities. British ammunition reserves, in particular, would be quickly exhausted, given the consumption rates observed in Ukraine, where thousands of artillery rounds are fired daily. Logistical endurance remains a critical challenge. The lack of robust air defense systems capable of countering drones and precision missile strikes further exposes vulnerabilities in prolonged engagements. These deficiencies underscore the UK's challenges as it seeks to modernize its forces and rebuild its capacity. Efforts to address these issues are underway. The Future Soldier initiative aims to restructure the British Army into smaller, agile Brigade Combat Teams with enhanced digital capabilities. Procurement projects, including upgrades to Challenger 3 tanks, the acquisition of Archer self-propelled howitzers, and investments in counter-drone technologies, represent steps in the right direction. However, the pace of modernization has been slow, and the gap between current capabilities and the demands of high-intensity warfare remains substantial. Financial constraints further complicate these efforts. The UK’s defense budget for the 2023/24 fiscal year was £53.9 billion, with planned increases to £56.9 billion in 2024/25 and £59.8 billion in 2025/26. This represents an annual real-terms growth rate of 2.3%. While former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030—potentially delivering an additional £75 billion—specific plans to achieve this target remain unclear. Current allocations may be insufficient to address existing capability gaps and modernization needs. The warnings from Veterans Minister Al Carns, coupled with British MoD data and lessons from the Ukraine war, highlight the urgent need for a reassessment of the UK’s defense priorities. The sharp decline in personnel, equipment, and logistical endurance underscores a critical challenge in maintaining a credible deterrent. Heavy weaponry, robust air defenses, and sustained logistical support are essential areas for investment if the British Armed Forces are to remain effective in modern warfare. Without decisive action and adequate funding, the UK risks further erosion of its military capabilities and its standing as a global military power.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-with-fewer-forces-than-cold-war-british-army-could-collapse-in-6-months-of-ukraine-style-war	2024-12-10T09:38:27-08:00

Equipped with the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar and the Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS), the ship is capable of deploying a range of missiles, including the Tomahawk. This adaptability highlights the destroyer’s multi-mission flexibility, integrating robust air and missile defense capabilities with long-range strike options. The Tomahawk cruise missile, with a range exceeding 1,500 kilometers, significantly extends the RAN’s operational reach. Designed for precision, the missile leverages GPS guidance and terrain-following flight capabilities to effectively strike high-value targets while minimizing the risk of interception. This precision, combined with the ability to reprogram the missile mid-flight, makes it an exceptionally versatile weapon for both preemptive and retaliatory missions. By introducing this capability, HMAS Brisbane can now engage targets far beyond the ship’s visual horizon, including strategic assets deep inland. The integration of Tomahawk missiles into the Hobart-class destroyer fleet required sophisticated updates to the Aegis Combat System, ensuring seamless command and control of this advanced weapon. Crew readiness also played a crucial role, with extensive training required to familiarize personnel with the missile’s operational and maintenance demands. This process reflects the RAN’s growing technological acumen and ability to incorporate cutting-edge systems into its existing platforms. Strategically, the deployment of Tomahawk missiles aligns with Australia’s broader defense posture. It enhances the RAN’s interoperability with allied navies, particularly the United States, which has long fielded Tomahawks as a cornerstone of its maritime strategy. This shared capability strengthens collective security frameworks like AUKUS, bolstering Australia’s position as a key contributor to regional stability. The implications of this capability are profound. The RAN’s ability to conduct precision strikes at long distances reshapes the regional power balance, signaling a shift from purely defensive maritime operations to a more proactive, deterrence-focused approach. This capability, when combined with other emerging assets such as nuclear-powered submarines, ensures that Australia remains equipped to address escalating security challenges in contested waters like the South China Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/historic-moment-australia-joins-elite-group-to-test-tomahawk-cruise-missiles	2024-12-10T08:30:02-08:00

China Develops a Near-Light-Speed Radar System to Counter Submarine Stealth	Chinese scientists have developed a 'ghost' radar capable of emitting electromagnetic waves at speeds close to the speed of light, enabling submarine detection. This innovation is based on the advanced use of the Doppler effect and high-energy microwave synthesis, as detailed in a study published on November 28, 2024, in the Chinese academic journal Modern Radar. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chinese Academy of Sciences designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky that generates continuously moving extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic capable of penetrating seawater and effectively detecting submarines several hundred meters below the surface. (Picture source: China Military) The team, led by Li Daojing of the National Key Laboratory of Microwave Imaging at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has designed a virtual radio emission source in the sky. This constantly moving source continuously generates extremely low-frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves capable of penetrating seawater to detect submarines several hundred meters below the surface. These ELF signals, with wavelengths exceeding 100 meters, allow for effective submarine detection due to their interaction with the aquatic environment. The researchers describe this technology as capable of transforming underwater detection. When ELF signals at 100 Hz interact with a nuclear submarine, its radar cross-section (RCS) can reach up to 88 square meters, enabling identification using standard magnetic detectors. Compact detectors mounted on drones could achieve gradient detection across wide areas, providing extensive and precise coverage. Traditionally, ELF signals required massive antennas, such as the ELF facility in central China, which spans over 100 km. Li Daojing's team has significantly reduced the size of these structures. Their new transmitter, measuring only 100 meters in length, is compact enough to be installed on Chinese naval ships. The high-frequency, high-power microwaves emitted by these antennas converge in the sky to form a virtual radio source. As one source dissipates, another is instantly generated, creating a continuous flow of ELF signals. This technique employs a network structure to simulate high-speed motion using Doppler signals in space. It reduces signal frequency while widening pulse width. The Doppler effect—where wave frequency changes based on relative motion between the source and observer—is a fundamental principle of this development. The perceived frequency increases as the source and observer approach each other and decreases as they move apart. Beyond submarine detection, the technology has potential applications for communication between surface ships and submarines, with an estimated range of 6,000 kilometers. Following successful ground-based trials, the team plans to reduce the transmitter's size to about 30 meters, making it more adaptable for various uses. This development was achieved with contributions from institutions such as the China Electronics Technology Group and Northwestern Polytechnical University, both key players in advanced military technologies for the People’s Liberation Army. The research highlights the integration of scientific innovation with strategic application to enhance underwater detection and communication capabilities. The innovation aligns with China's strategic priorities amid Sino-American rivalries, particularly regarding Taiwan and regional maritime security. While still in development, the technology could bolster China's ability to monitor and control its maritime zones, potentially affecting the strategic balance with the United States and its allies. By improving submarine detection, China aims to safeguard its territorial interests and assert its presence in the South China Sea, a region of heightened tensions surrounding Taiwan. This technological progress could reshape maritime security dynamics and influence submarine operations by external forces, reinforcing China's regional claims.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-develops-a-near-light-speed-radar-system-to-counter-submarine-stealth	2024-12-10T05:30:54-08:00

Taiwan ramps up Wanjian cruise missile production to strengthen the country’s naval and air capabilities	As reported by the Liberty Times on December 7, 2024, Taiwan has completed the mass production of its domestically developed Wanjian air-to-ground cruise missile, providing new capabilities for preemptive strikes on key Chinese military positions. Over 150 units of the Wanjian-1 bomb, with a range of 200 kilometers, have been produced, and the development of an extended-range version, the Wanjian-2 with a range of 400 kilometers, is now being carried out under the Ministry of National Defense's annual budget for further testing and small-batch production.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. (Picture source: Twitter/Taepodong) The development of Taiwan's Wanjian missile, also known as the Wan Chien or the 'Ten Thousand Swords Bomb,' began in the early 2000s as a response to the growing threat posed by China's military advancements. Initiated under the codename 'Project Divine Axe' by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the missile was designed to neutralize strategic targets such as airstrips, radar installations, and troop concentrations on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Drawing inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the Storm Shadow, its development incorporated advanced features like GPS and inertial navigation guidance, as well as a turbofan engine for extended range. The missile first underwent testing in the mid-2000s, achieved combat readiness in 2010, entered service in 2011, and entered mass production in 2015 after system integration with Taiwan’s AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter jets. Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. Live-fire exercises by F-CK-1 units in Tainan and Taichung demonstrated its effectiveness, targeting simulated installations on the southeastern coast of China, including strikes targeting facilities in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces from positions near the midline of the Taiwan Strait. It supports Taiwan’s defensive strategy by enabling precision strikes on key installations beyond the reach of short-range defenses. The Wanjian bomb is integrated with the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, with each aircraft capable of carrying one missile under each wing. The missile is guided by GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain recognition (TERCOM) systems for mid-flight adjustments, along with terminal guidance technologies such as image infrared (IIR) and digital scene matching area correlation (DSMAC). The missile’s design features a square body, foldable wings for compact storage and aerodynamic performance, an X-shaped rudder for directional control, and a turbofan engine that allows subsonic speeds up to Mach 0.8. It carries a 350-kilogram warhead containing submunitions equipped with delayed fuzes. These submunitions are engineered to penetrate surfaces and detonate underground, maximizing damage to hardened targets. The development of the Wanjian-2, also known as the Extended-Range Wanjian Bomb, is now being carried out to realize precision strikes at ranges up to 400 km. Also designed for the F-CK-1 fighter, it features a cluster munition warhead capable of targeting runways, radars, and troop concentrations. The missile utilizes GPS and inertial navigation with advanced terminal guidance for enhanced accuracy. Its design includes foldable wings, an X-tail configuration, and a turbofan engine for subsonic flight. It seems that small-scale production of the Wanjian-2 variant is set to continue under Taiwan's annual defense budget to bolster long-range strike capabilities. This extended-range version will enhance strike capabilities by allowing deeper penetration into adversary-controlled areas. However, it remains in the development phase under the Ministry of National Defense’s regular budget allocations. The Wanjian draws inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the British Storm Shadow. (Picture source: NCSIST) Despite its capabilities, the Wanjian missile's reliance on a non-stealthy design and subsonic speed makes it vulnerable to modern air defense systems, particularly during low-altitude flight paths needed for accurate targeting of runways or other fixed installations. The missile's effectiveness is further constrained by the limited range and survivability of its carrier platform, the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter, which risks interception before launch in contested airspace. Additionally, dependence on civilian GPS navigation rather than military-grade systems reduces its accuracy under electronic countermeasure conditions. These factors could collectively undermine the Wanjian's operational potential in high-threat environments. In addition to its existing applications, the feasibility of adapting the Wanjian bomb for use on helicopters was proposed by Kuomintang legislators in 2019. The proposal emphasized the need to overcome the dependency on operational runways during a conflict, addressing the expected asymmetry in air force readiness caused by immediate damage to airfields. However, a feasibility assessment by the Air Force concluded that adapting the Wanjian bomb for helicopter deployment is both technically challenging and impractical. The assessment cited the size and weight of the missile, the limited payload capacity of helicopters, and the need for U.S. approval for modifications to American-made rotorcraft as significant obstacles. While the suggestion aimed to reduce dependency on runways, the Air Force stated that the Wanjian bomb’s current integration with AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo aircraft remains the optimal approach. In recent years, Taiwan has been enhancing its cruise missile capabilities through the development and deployment of several systems. For instance, the Ching Tien (擎天) supersonic cruise missile, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, has entered mass production and is being deployed by the Air Force, enabling it to reach targets north of Beijing. The Hsiung Sheng, an extended-range variant of the Hsiung Feng IIE land-attack cruise missile, is planned for deployment in 2024, offering a range of up to 1,200 kilometers to target critical sites such as the People's Liberation Army's Eastern and Southern Theater Command bases. With the production of the Wanjian missile system, these missiles are part of Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid regional security concerns. Taiwan is responding to increased military pressure from China by enhancing its defense capabilities through various measures. The United States has approved arms sales to Taiwan, including a $2 billion package featuring the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Taiwan has increased its defense budget by 7.7% for 2025, with allocations for new fighter jets and missile production. Domestically, Taiwan launched its first indigenously built submarine, the Haikun, to strengthen naval deterrence. The US Department of Defense is also working with Taiwan on deploying drone swarms aimed at deterring potential Chinese actions. These measures reflect Taiwan’s efforts to address regional security tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/taiwan-ramps-up-wanjian-cruise-missile-production-to-strengthen-the-countrys-naval-and-air-capabilities	2024-12-10T02:15:20-08:00	
Breaking News: Taiwan Launches Combat Readiness Exercises Following China's Deployment of 90 Warships	China's recent deployment of approximately 90 naval and coast guard vessels near Taiwan represents a large escalation in regional tensions, prompting a robust response from Taiwan. On December 9, 2024, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense announced the launch of combat readiness exercises to counter this unprecedented show of force, the largest in recent months. The deployment spans waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas, surpassing previous military activities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan has raised its alert level following the sighting of over 90 Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the region. However, the defense ministry has not officially classified the movements as drills. (Picture source: Taiwanese Media TV screenshot) The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has also established an emergency response center to monitor the situation closely and address all 'gray zone' incursions—non-traditional military operations designed to exert pressure without open conflict. This escalation coincides with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's recent visit to Guam, a move Beijing views as provocative due to its opposition to official interactions between Taiwan and the United States. China's actions align with its broader strategy to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, potentially through military force. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has undergone rapid modernization and expansion, significantly enhancing its power projection capabilities. Beijing's possible plans for a naval assault include several scenarios. One potential strategy is a large-scale amphibious invasion, requiring substantial lift capacity and coordination to transport troops and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. However, China's current amphibious fleet may fall short of the requirements for a full-scale invasion, potentially necessitating the use of civilian vessels. While increasing transport capacity, these vessels are more vulnerable to Taiwan’s asymmetric defenses, such as missile-armed fast attack boats and stealthy corvettes. Another strategy could involve imposing a maritime blockade to sever Taiwan's critical supply lines, aiming to force political concessions without direct confrontation. Taiwan's heavy reliance on maritime trade makes it particularly susceptible to such a strategy. Additionally, China might continue to employ gray zone tactics, such as deploying maritime militias and conducting frequent incursions into Taiwanese waters and airspace, designed to test Taiwan’s responses and exert sustained pressure without triggering outright conflict. Taiwan's Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is a critical component of its defense strategy, tasked with countering these potential threats. As of 2024, the ROCN comprises approximately 40,000 personnel and a diverse fleet. The navy operates four Kee Lung-class guided-missile destroyers, which are former U.S. Navy vessels serving as the backbone of Taiwan's surface combatants. It also operates 22 frigates, including eight Cheng Kung-class frigates (based on the U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry-class) and six Kang Ding-class frigates, offering versatile capabilities for maritime defense. Two Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvettes have been commissioned, designed for high-speed operations and equipped with advanced anti-ship missiles. The ROCN maintains four submarines, including two Hai Lung-class and two older Hai Shih-class vessels, focused on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Taiwan has launched an ambitious program to construct seven new diesel-electric submarines over the next decade, significantly bolstering its undersea capabilities. Additionally, the navy operates eight amphibious ships, including tank landing ships and a recently commissioned Yushan-class amphibious transport dock, as well as various support vessels for logistics and replenishment. Recent efforts to develop asymmetric warfare capabilities focus on smaller, stealthier vessels equipped with precision-guided weaponry to offset the PLAN's numerical superiority.The Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC), Taiwan's elite amphibious warfare unit, plays a critical role in the defense of the island nation. With a strength of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 personnel, the ROCMC is trained for specialized missions, including amphibious assaults, coastal defense, and the protection of Taiwan's offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. Equipped with a diverse array of weapons and platforms, the Marine Corps fields modern assault rifles, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers for ground operations. For amphibious missions, they rely on vehicles like the AAV-7A1 amphibious assault vehicles, capable of transporting troops from ships to shore under combat conditions. The ROCMC also trains extensively in urban warfare, jungle operations, and joint exercises with other branches of Taiwan's military to ensure interoperability. These forces are prepared to respond swiftly to invasions or incursions, emphasizing the defense of Taiwan's sovereignty and the recovery of occupied territory in a conflict scenario. China's naval forces have seen rapid growth, making the PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy - Chinese Navy) the world's largest navy, with over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface combatants. The PLAN’s modern arsenal includes advanced warships such as the Type 055 destroyers and the aircraft carrier CNS Fujian, reflecting China’s ambition to project power and assert its maritime claims. China’s shipbuilding capacity, which is over 230 times greater than that of the United States, has enabled this rapid expansion. The current developments mark a critical juncture in cross-strait relations, with China's substantial military presence near Taiwan heightening regional tensions. Taiwan's proactive defense measures and calls for international support reflect its determination to safeguard its sovereignty amidst growing external pressures. The evolving naval capabilities of both Taiwan and China will play a pivotal role in shaping the future security dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-taiwan-launches-combat-readiness-exercises-following-chinas-deployment-of-90-warships	2024-12-10T02:03:37-08:00	
Russia May Exchange MiG-29 and Su-27 Fighter Jets for North Korean Troops Deployed in Ukraine	Russia and North Korea have reportedly reached a strategic agreement marking a significant step in their military cooperation. This deal aligns with Moscow’s strategy to strengthen its alliances amidst Western sanctions, while Pyongyang sees a rare opportunity to modernize its outdated air force. According to information disclosed by Admiral Samuel Paparo at the Reagan National Defense Forum on December 7, 2024, North Korea would receive Russian MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets. In return, North Korea is believed to have sent approximately 12,000 soldiers to support Russian military operations in Ukraine. These troops, though not directly involved in combat, are reportedly deployed in conflict zones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This agreement offers North Korea a critical upgrade from its outdated second-generation aircraft fleet to more advanced MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) The delivery of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets is part of Russia’s broader strategy to leverage its allies to counter international pressures. While the exact number of aircraft to be transferred remains unclear, their inclusion in North Korea’s fleet would significantly bolster Pyongyang’s military capabilities. However, these jets are technically inferior to fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. This agreement comes as North Korea’s air force, historically reliant on Soviet and Chinese support, struggles with decades of stagnation and international sanctions. Its current fleet is largely composed of Soviet-era aircraft from the 1980s, many of which are no longer operational. The MiG-29, developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich, is a twin-engine, fourth-generation fighter designed for air superiority. It is equipped with a Phazotron N019 radar capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' operations. The jet’s armament includes a 30mm cannon and air-to-air missiles such as the medium-range R-27 and short-range R-73. Renowned for its exceptional maneuverability, the MiG-29 features advanced aerodynamics and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, reaching speeds of Mach 2.3 and operating at altitudes up to 17,000 meters. The Su-27, designed by Sukhoi, is a long-range air superiority fighter equipped with a Phazotron N001 Myech radar, also capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' targeting. It is armed with a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 30mm cannon and up to ten hardpoints for air-to-air missiles like the R-73 and R-27. Known for its agility, the Su-27 incorporates advanced fly-by-wire controls and can execute complex maneuvers such as the 'Cobra.' It achieves speeds of Mach 2.35 and operates at altitudes up to 18,500 meters. For North Korea, this agreement addresses a major strategic gap. Its air force currently includes over 400 combat aircraft, but a significant portion belongs to the second generation, such as the Chinese-made J-5 and J-6, copies of the Soviet MiG-17 and MiG-19. Adding MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters from the 1980s would represent a considerable technological upgrade. These jets, equipped with relatively modern radars and weapon systems for their era, would enhance Pyongyang’s defensive capabilities against advanced South Korean forces. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The deal also underscores Pyongyang’s broader interest in advanced military technologies. In addition to fighter jets, North Korea may seek Russian expertise in ballistic missile re-entry vehicles, modern submarines, and air defense systems. This cooperation could help North Korea counter South Korea’s 'three-axis' doctrine, which focuses on neutralizing North Korean threats through preemptive, defensive, and offensive measures. This exchange occurs amid heightened regional tensions between the two Koreas. In June 2024, North Korean soldiers crossed into South Korea before retreating under warning shots from South Korean forces. More recently, in October 2024, North Korea destroyed sections of roads symbolizing reunification efforts and bolstered defensive structures along the border. These incidents highlight escalating tensions, marked by border clashes and military threats. Integrating MiG-29 and Su-27 jets into North Korea’s air force could improve its air defense and air superiority capabilities. However, these aircraft remain outclassed by fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. Additionally, the operational effectiveness of these jets will depend on pilot training and maintenance, areas where North Korea faces significant challenges. While this agreement strengthens North Korea’s air fleet quantitatively, it is unlikely to shift the aerial power balance significantly in the Korean Peninsula. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China. Recently, Iran received Su-35 jets and Mi-28 helicopters, while China has benefited from increased Russian technological support in sensitive areas like submarines and missiles. These partnerships reflect Russia’s growing reliance on allies to sustain its military capabilities under international sanctions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-may-exchange-mig-29-and-su-27-fighter-jets-for-north-korean-troops-deployed-in-ukraine	2024-12-10T01:55:42-08:00

It was launched on November 29, 2023, from Sevmash's shipyard in Severodvinsk for final outfitting and floating completion. In the event of a military conflict between NATO and Russia, the Arkhangelsk submarine, as part of the modernized Yasen-M class, could play a pivotal role in shifting the balance of power in the maritime domain and beyond. Its advanced capabilities make it an asset capable of addressing several strategic and tactical objectives: The Arkhangelsk is equipped with Kalibr-PL cruise missiles, capable of striking NATO targets at long distances, including critical infrastructure, command centers, and military bases. This capability serves as a strong deterrent, as the threat of precision strikes can dissuade adversaries from escalating conflict. Additionally, its ability to launch Oniks supersonic missiles provides a credible countermeasure to NATO surface fleets, including aircraft carrier strike groups. Operating in key maritime regions such as the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, or the Arctic, the Arkhangelsk could enforce sea denial strategies, restricting NATO's freedom of movement. Its stealth capabilities enable it to approach high-value targets undetected, posing a constant threat to NATO naval operations. By deploying near NATO maritime chokepoints, the submarine could effectively challenge or block naval reinforcements. With its advanced sensors, weaponry, and stealth design, the Arkhangelsk would likely be a formidable opponent in undersea warfare. It could hunt NATO submarines, including those tasked with deploying ballistic or cruise missiles, thus undermining NATO’s strategic deterrent capabilities. The submarine’s ability to operate covertly in the Atlantic could allow it to disrupt NATO's vital maritime supply routes between North America and Europe. Striking supply convoys and transport vessels would complicate NATO’s logistical efforts, potentially delaying reinforcements and resupply operations. The Kalibr-PL missiles on board the 'Arkhangelsk' are capable of precision strikes on land-based targets. In a conflict, the submarine could launch coordinated missile barrages against NATO military installations, communication hubs, or missile defense sites, potentially neutralizing critical components of NATO’s operational network. Given its Arctic-capable design, the 'Arkhangelsk' could support operations in the increasingly contested Arctic region. Control over this region is crucial for both Russia and NATO, as it holds strategic sea lanes and natural resources. The submarine could patrol under the Arctic ice, undetected, projecting power and securing Russian claims in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-to-receive-newest-nuclear-submarine-arkhangelsk-with-kalibr-missiles-in-summer-2025	2024-12-10T01:32:35-08:00	
US Army Explores PrSM Inc. 5 Missile for Autonomous Launchers Exceeding 1000 km	The US Army is advancing its technological capabilities in long-range precision strikes with plans to develop a fifth iteration of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), designed to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers. During a December 3, 2024 event hosted by the Association of the US Army, two senior military officials shared insights into this project, which could significantly enhance the Army's strike range capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Major General Winston Brook, commander of the Fires Center of Excellence, presented a slide that identified the PrSM Increment 5 as a prospective future capability. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, explained that preliminary work on this fifth version of the PrSM has commenced, with a formal science and technology development initiative scheduled for fiscal year 2026. According to Brig. Gen. Crooks, the primary goal of Increment 5 is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous platform, departing from traditional systems like the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS. This innovation involves creating a launcher without a cab, allowing for potentially larger and longer-range munitions. 'If you’re familiar with an MLRS pod, it’s about 13 feet long. With an autonomous system, you might be able to use something longer,' Crooks noted, suggesting the possibility of achieving ranges currently deemed unrealistic. Although the program has received initial funding for science and technology research, Crooks clarified that there is no definitive timeline for formal competition or development. This highlights the program's exploratory nature, with its future depending on results from these early stages. For several years, the Army has been developing earlier versions of the PrSM to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and ensure compatibility with current launch systems like HIMARS and the M270A2 MLRS. Currently, Increment 1 missiles, produced by Lockheed Martin, are being fielded and are capable of striking targets at distances of at least 500 kilometers. Subsequent increments include Increment 2, which features a multimode seeker known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and Increment 3, which is designed to incorporate enhanced lethality payloads. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team are working on competing designs for Increment 4, which aims to double the range of earlier versions, surpassing 1,000 kilometers. The development of Increment 5 represents a pivotal step toward integrating autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, the initiative underscores the Army’s commitment to extending the boundaries of precision long-range strikes.

This project marks a new focus for Italy's defense industry, which has not previously been involved in the development of directed energy weapon systems. The initiative is also part of a broader effort by MBDA to advance laser technology, building on existing partnerships and projects. In Germany, MBDA has tested a laser demonstrator with Rheinmetall, incorporating a multistage tracker and effector system to bundle multiple laser sources into a single beam. In the United Kingdom, MBDA, Leonardo UK, and QinetiQ are collaborating on the DragonFire system, which has demonstrated high-power laser capability against aerial targets. This system has been tested successfully, achieving notable precision. MBDA has further expanded its expertise in laser technology through its stake in CILAS, a French company specializing in military laser systems. CILAS has developed the HELMA-P system, which completed its initial testing during the summer of 2024. These developments have bolstered MBDA's growing portfolio of directed energy weapon technologies. The systems under development in Italy will feature dual power classes, enabling them to address various types of drone threats effectively. MBDA's 'light' Fire Unit will be optimized for existing ships, while Leonardo's 'high-end' Fire Unit will equip future naval platforms. This division ensures tailored solutions for both current and future operational needs. Both companies will share their technical knowledge, and national supply chains will contribute to the project. The MoU lays the foundation for defining technical and commercial solutions to meet customer requirements. It also establishes a framework for the joint promotion of the resulting products. The agreement reflects a broader trend in defense technology development, emphasizing directed energy weapons as a cost-effective solution for neutralizing threats. Naval laser weapons are being developed and deployed globally due to their precision and cost-efficiency in countering threats such as drones and missiles. The United States has installed the HELIOS laser system on the USS Preble to enhance defense capabilities in the Pacific. China has integrated a laser weapon system into its Type 071 amphibious transport dock and is exploring the installation of laser weapons on its submarines. The United Kingdom plans to deploy the DragonFire laser on Royal Navy warships by 2027 to counter aerial and missile threats. South Korea, France and Italy are similarly investing in directed energy technologies to strengthen naval defense systems. These efforts highlight a global trend among major military powers to incorporate laser-based systems into naval operations to address modern security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/italian-navy-launches-laser-weapon-development-for-current-and-upcoming-ships	2024-12-09T08:27:51-08:00	
France boosts SCALP missile production to support Ukraine and enhance Air Force readiness	As reported by French Aid to Ukraine on November 26, 2024, France has initiated an extensive plan to replenish and expand its missile stockpiles as part of a long-term strategy to reinforce defense capabilities. The General Staff of the Armed Forces has announced that the Air Force's SCALP-EG cruise missile stocks will be replenished in 2024. A parliamentary report indicates that 2025 will be a critical year for additional replenishment, including replacing SCALP missiles transferred to Ukraine. A total of €2 billion has been allocated for 2025 to support the restocking of SCALP-EG, Aster, and MICA missiles, as part of a broader €16 billion budget designated for defense inventory improvements between 2024 and 2030.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French President Emmanuel Macron announced the initial SCALP deliveries to Ukraine in July 2023, with additional shipments confirmed in November 2024. (Picture source: French Air Force) In July 2023, France began providing SCALP long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine to enhance its capability for striking high-value targets at extended ranges. Initial shipments included approximately 40 missiles, followed by subsequent deliveries of around a dozen missiles per batch, as reported in November 2024. The total number of SCALP missiles transferred to Ukraine remains undisclosed. However, these missiles have been utilized in several operations, including the September 2023 strike on the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea. The attack caused significant damage and reportedly resulted in casualties among senior Russian naval officers. SCALP missiles, integrated with Ukraine’s Soviet-era Su-24 bombers, have allowed for precision strikes on key Russian infrastructure, including command centers and logistical nodes. These operations have disrupted Russian military activities in occupied territories. The missiles' capability for long-range precision strikes on critical infrastructure has been integrated into Ukraine's defense strategy, significantly influencing the operational environment. France’s contributions complement those of the United Kingdom, which has supplied Storm Shadow missiles, a variant of the SCALP system. French President Emmanuel Macron announced the initial SCALP deliveries in July 2023, with additional shipments confirmed in November 2024. While specific numbers remain confidential, reports in November 2024 mentioned preparations for another batch of approximately ten SCALP missiles for Ukraine. While the missiles' deployment is seen as an operational advantage, it has also prompted concerns about escalation, with Russia issuing warnings of 'countermeasures.' France has maintained an active SCALP-EG missile production. The MBDA facility in Bourges remains operational, carrying out mid-life upgrades for Greece's SCALP inventory alongside new production projects. Investments amounting to €1 billion over five years aim to expand production infrastructure across MBDA’s European facilities. For instance, the production rate for Mistral missiles is set to double to 40 units per month by 2025, while delivery times for Aster missiles are being reduced from 40 to 24 months. The SCALP/Storm Shadow is a Franco-British air-launched cruise missile developed by Matra and British Aerospace, currently produced by MBDA. It is designed for low observability, with a maximum range of 550 km and guided by GPS, INS, TERPROM, and infrared homing systems. The missile carries a 450 kg BROACH warhead, optimized for penetrating fortified structures and targeting strategic assets such as command centers, airfields, and infrastructure. It has been operational since 2003 and has been used in conflicts including Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine. Export variants, like the Black Shaheen, have been adapted to comply with Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) restrictions. A replacement, the Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon, is under development by France, the UK, and Italy, with planned capabilities for land-attack and anti-ship missions by 2028 and 2034, respectively. Beyond the SCALP-EG, France’s broader missile stockpile strategy includes additional orders for METEOR long-range air-to-air missiles and MICA air-to-air missiles. Modular air-to-ground munitions (AASM) are also being produced, with a target of 1,200 units by 2025. Other defense modernization efforts include upgrading aeronautics infrastructure, implementing Rafale F5 standards, and deploying advanced reconnaissance pods and Medevac kits. The €2 billion allocation for missile replenishments in 2025 highlights France’s efforts to sustain readiness while meeting allied commitments. These actions are part of a broader strategy to address immediate needs and align with European defense objectives. Through sustained production capabilities and expanded stockpiles, France seeks to enhance its defense strategy and reinforce its role within international defense frameworks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-boosts-scalp-missile-production-to-support-ukraine-and-enhance-air-force-readiness	2024-12-09T08:21:50-08:00	
Czech Republic to reinforce anti-tank capabilities with 10,000 Finnish Sentry mines	On December 5, 2024, the Czech defense company STV Group signed a seven-year framework agreement with the Czech Ministry of Defence for the supply of the Sentry anti-tank mine system. The contract, valued at up to CZK 4.08 billion ($172 million), includes at least 10,000 mines along with training and associated tools. The Sentry anti-tank mine system incorporates encrypted mesh connectivity, remote control features, autonomous target recognition, and deactivation functionality for friendly forces.

(Picture source: Forcit Defence) The Sentry system, developed jointly by Finland’s Forcit Defence and STV Group, is categorized as a next-generation anti-tank mine system with integrated networking and remote-control capabilities. Forcit Defence has previously delivered 1,500 Hailstorm shrapnel charges to the Czech Ministry of Defence. This agreement extends the existing collaboration between the Czech and Finnish defense industries. The Sentry system uses 10.5-kg multi-sensor anti-tank mines with insensitive explosives and electronic modules. The mines are equipped with seismic and magnetic sensors for detecting armored vehicles and can be programmed to target specific equipment or convoys. They can function autonomously under electronic warfare conditions and allow for the safe passage of friendly forces. The mines feature encrypted communication systems for secure operation and can be managed remotely at both individual and minefield levels. Each mine includes GPS for precise geolocation and can alert operators to positional changes. The mines can be deployed on the surface or buried, with real-time adjustability. They use a directional warhead designed to penetrate up to 140 mm of rolled homogeneous armor. Anti-handling mechanisms prevent tampering, and unused mines can be retrieved and redeployed. Deployment requires intervals of 2.5 meters, and nine mines are sufficient to block a standard two-lane road. The system is designed to achieve similar effectiveness to conventional mines with fewer units. Lithuania has also procured the Sentry system, purchasing a batch for €5.9 million ($6.51 million). These mines are being deployed as part of a counter-mobility initiative along Lithuania’s borders with Belarus and Russia’s Kaliningrad region. Lithuanian authorities highlighted the system’s ability to differentiate between friendly and hostile forces and its remote activation and deactivation capabilities as operational advantages. This deployment forms part of a broader strategy to strengthen border defenses, including physical barriers and other obstacles. The Czech Republic is enhancing its military capabilities due to heightened security concerns in Europe, particularly related to Russia's military actions in Ukraine. According to the 2023 Defence Strategy, Russia is identified as the primary long-term threat to the Czech Republic and NATO, marking the highest risk of military conflict since the Cold War. The strategy underscores the necessity for stronger national defense and increased NATO cooperation to address these risks. Modernization efforts include the acquisition of new military equipment and international defense partnerships. The Czech government has approved the purchase of 24 F-35 fighter jets from the U.S., with deliveries scheduled between 2029 and 2033. Additionally, up to 28 Leopard 2A4 and 77 Leopard 2A8 tanks are being procured from Germany to replace Soviet-era T-72 tanks, reducing reliance on Russian-manufactured equipment. The Czech Republic has also provided $288 million in military aid to Ukraine, including aircraft, tanks, and ammunition. Furthermore, it is coordinating the procurement of artillery shells for Ukraine, financed through frozen Russian assets within the EU. These initiatives aim to strengthen national defense and address regional security objectives.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/czech-republic-to-reinforce-anti-tank-capabilities-with-10-000-finnish-sentry-mines	2024-12-09T08:17:28-08:00

The vehicles will enhance the Armed Forces' operational capacity during the ongoing State of Exception and are intended to address an increased activity of organized crime and narco-terrorism. These units are to be deployed to conflict-prone regions immediately. The announcement was made during a ceremony at Wing 23 in Manta, attended by Minister of Defense Gian Carlo Loffredo and President Daniel Noboa, who reviewed the vehicles. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ecuador's massive procurement of modern armored vehicles is a response to increasing violence related to organized crime and drug trafficking, particularly along its northern border. (Picture source: Ecuador MoD) Ecuador's procurement of advanced armored vehicles is a response to increasing violence related to organized crime and drug trafficking, particularly along its northern border. The presence of Colombian armed groups and dissidents, including remnants of the FARC-EP, has intensified security issues. This latest delivery follows the August addition of 51 vehicles, bringing the total to over 100. Under a $65 million contract with Elbit Systems in 2022, Ecuador has acquired 137 vehicles, including Israeli-made MDT Armor Tiger MKII 4x4 and South African Mbombe 6 6x6 models. These vehicles are intended to support surveillance, control operations, and counterinsurgency missions in high-risk areas. The Mbombe 6, produced by South Africa’s Paramount Group, is a 6x6 armored vehicle providing STANAG Level 3 protection and a V-shaped hull designed to withstand up to 10 kilograms of TNT. It is armed with a 30 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun. The vehicle accommodates 11 personnel, including the driver and commander, and offers a payload capacity of 2,300 kilograms. With a top speed of 100 kilometers per hour and an operational range of 700 kilometers, it is designed for use in urban, rural, and border operations. The MDT David 4x4, manufactured by MDT Armor Corporation, a subsidiary of Israel’s Shladot LTD, is based on the Toyota Hilux platform and provides STANAG Level II ballistic protection. It can transport up to eight personnel and is configurable with 3, 4, or 5 doors. The vehicle features a 148 horsepower engine with 408 Nm of torque, options for manual or automatic transmission, a ground clearance of 279 mm, and approach and departure angles of 35° and 30°, respectively. With a gross vehicle weight of 4,200 kilograms, it is designed for personnel transport, reconnaissance, and tactical missions. In 2024, Ecuador introduced its first locally developed Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, the Blindex Armorings C.A-Hino Dutro 716. This vehicle has NIJ Level III ballistic protection, a monocoque body, and reinforced structures capable of withstanding 7.62 x 51 mm NATO rounds. It can transport up to ten occupants, including a gunner, and is equipped with fire suppression systems, security cameras, and ballistic glass windows. It is designed for anti-terrorism and counter-narcotics operations. Additionally, Ecuador procured 20 Otokar Cobra II 4x4 tactical vehicles from Turkey’s Otokar company in August 2023, followed by 15 Otokar Ural 4x4 tactical vehicles in November 2023. These acquisitions form part of a broader effort to improve operational capabilities against criminal and insurgent activities. Ecuador is experiencing a significant security crisis driven by organized crime and drug trafficking. In January 2024, the escape of drug lord Adolfo Macias, alias Fito, exacerbated the situation. In early December 2024, ten individuals, including nine Colombians, were killed in El Guabo, El Oro Province, in an attack linked to gang conflicts. In another incident, footballer Pedro Pablo Perlaza was kidnapped in Esmeraldas but later rescued by police. Additionally, Olger Moreno, the deputy security chief of Cotopaxi prison, was assassinated in late November. Ecuador has accepted military assistance from over 38 nations, including the United States and Argentina, as part of its efforts to address these issues. A state of emergency has been declared, and military forces have been deployed to support police operations against criminal groups. Despite these measures, violence remains a concern, particularly in areas where Colombian and Ecuadorian drug trafficking organizations compete for control of cocaine production and trafficking routes along the Amazonian border. These efforts reflect Ecuador's attempt to strengthen its security infrastructure and respond to escalating threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/ecuador-deploys-over-100-new-israeli-mdt-david-and-south-african-mbombe-6-armored-vehicles-to-address-escalating-violence	2024-12-09T08:09:24-08:00	
Qatar Increases Air Combat Power with Additional Order of Twelve New Typhoon Fighters	On December 6, 2024, the Qatari government announced its intention to acquire 12 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighters, thereby strengthening its military aviation capabilities and deepening defense ties with the United Kingdom. The agreement was disclosed following the state visit of Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, to the United Kingdom, where he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This decision marks a significant step in the growing partnership between the two countries, particularly in the field of defense cooperation. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Qatari government announced its intention to acquire 12 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighters. (Picture source: BAE Systems) The contract, valued at approximately £2.8 billion, will benefit the production facilities of BAE Systems in Samlesbury and Warton, ensuring continuity of operations at these key sites. This new order builds on Qatar’s 2017 purchase of 24 Typhoons and complements its diverse fleet, which also includes French Rafales and American F-15QAs. The integration of the Typhoons into the joint No. 12 Squadron, operated by the Qatari Air Force and the British Royal Air Force, underscores their strategic role in strengthening bilateral military collaborations. Qatar has significantly enhanced its military air fleet over the past decade by adopting a strategy of supply diversification to ensure its security and operational independence. In 2017, Doha signed a €5.6 billion contract for the acquisition of 24 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters from the Eurofighter consortium (BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo), reinforced by an additional order for 12 units announced in December 2024, valued at an estimated £2.8 billion. These aircraft are integrated into the joint No. 12 Squadron with the British Royal Air Force, symbolizing strengthened military cooperation between Qatar and the United Kingdom. In December 2024, during the state visit of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to the United Kingdom, the two nations strengthened their defense partnership by signing agreements to extend their collaboration on joint squadrons of Typhoon and Hawk aircraft. On this occasion, two Typhoon fighters from the joint No. 12 Squadron escorted the Emir’s aircraft as it entered British airspace, illustrating their operational synergy. This visit highlights the deepening military ties between the United Kingdom and Qatar, based on their historical relationship and shared commitment to regional security. The Typhoon offers Qatar’s armed forces a modern and versatile combat platform capable of meeting diverse operational needs. With its advanced avionics, high-speed performance (Mach 2), and exceptional maneuverability, it is perfectly suited for air-to-air combat and ground attack missions. Equipped with the AESA Captor-E radar and a wide array of precision-guided munitions, including Meteor and Brimstone missiles, the Typhoon enhances Qatar’s air superiority and strike capabilities. Additionally, its integration into the joint No. 12 Squadron between the United Kingdom and Qatar provides valuable training, NATO-standard interoperability, and a strategic partnership with a key ally, further strengthening Qatar’s defensive posture and regional influence. In parallel, Qatar has also invested in French Rafale fighters, signing an initial contract for 24 aircraft in 2015, followed by an additional order for 12 units in 2017, bringing the total cost to approximately €6.3 billion. These Rafales are expected to be upgraded to the F4 standard, adding enhanced capabilities such as advanced connectivity systems and next-generation armaments. Finally, Qatar purchased 36 American F-15QA fighters under a $12 billion contract signed in 2017. These acquisitions reflect a pragmatic strategy, balancing strategic alliances and military enhancement, with a fleet combining the strengths of major aviation powers. While the announcement surprised France, where negotiations for additional Rafales and other military equipment were ongoing, it illustrates Qatar’s delicate balance between maintaining operational readiness and developing strong relationships with major defense suppliers. This agreement is particularly significant as the Typhoon had not received recent export orders before Qatar’s renewed interest, positioning the United Kingdom as a key strategic partner for Doha in a competitive regional landscape. This development also reflects changes in Qatar’s defense procurement strategy, including its exploration of joint infantry mechanisms with the United Kingdom, potentially centered on ARTEC’s Boxer armored vehicle. By diversifying its defense assets and partnerships, this Typhoon agreement highlights Qatar’s commitment to a robust and versatile military posture aligned with NATO standards and adapted to an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Qatar’s decision not to opt for additional Rafales, despite the aircraft’s excellent performance, can be attributed to several strategic and political reasons. Firstly, Qatar already has 36 Rafales in its fleet, which may limit the immediate appeal of a new order, especially with existing aircraft undergoing upgrades to the F4 standard. In contrast, the Typhoon provides an opportunity to further diversify operational capabilities and strategic partnerships, strengthening the already solid military cooperation with the United Kingdom, particularly through the joint No. 12 Squadron. Additionally, the purchase of new Typhoons can be seen as a political decision aimed at balancing relationships with multiple major defense suppliers, avoiding over-reliance on France, which has already supplied Rafales and various military equipment. Furthermore, support for the British industry, facing challenges with the Typhoon in the international market, may have influenced the decision. This strategic choice also allows Qatar to leverage the specific advantages of the Typhoon, such as its enhanced air superiority through the Captor-E radar and Meteor missile, complementing the capabilities already offered by the Rafale. In summary, this decision seems driven more by diplomatic and strategic considerations than by any technical shortcomings of the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon operated by Qatar is a high-tech multirole fighter equipped with the most advanced technologies. It features the AESA Captor-E radar for superior target detection and tracking, along with the advanced Defensive Aids Subsystem (DASS) for enhanced survivability and modern avionics that ensure high operational versatility. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines, the Typhoon reaches a maximum speed of Mach 2 and has a combat range of over 1,500 km. Its armament systems include a wide range of air-to-air missiles, such as the Meteor, precision-guided munitions, and the Brimstone missile for ground-attack missions, making it a formidable force in modern aerial combat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/qatar-increases-air-combat-power-with-additional-order-of-twelve-new-typhoon-fighters	2024-12-09T07:28:26-08:00	
Breaking News: Dutch F-35 Fighter Jets Conduct First Interceptions of Russian Spy Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	Dutch Air Force F-35 fighter jets stationed in Estonia have successfully conducted their first operational interceptions over the Baltic Sea, showcasing the Netherlands’ commitment to NATO’s collective defense. On Friday, December 6, two Dutch F-35s were scrambled twice under the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) protocol to intercept and monitor Russian aircraft operating near NATO airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During an interception mission, a Dutch Air Force F-35A Lightning II escorts a Russian SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea, demonstrating NATO's vigilance in safeguarding its airspace. (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) During the first interception, the Dutch F-35 fighter jets identified a Russian Antonov AN-73/74 'Coaler' transport aircraft and a Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance jet. The SU-24MR specializes in electronic intelligence gathering, highlighting the persistent surveillance activities conducted by Russian forces near NATO territory. Later in the day, the QRA was activated again, with the F-35s intercepting an Ilyushin IL-20 'Coot A,' an advanced surveillance aircraft equipped for electronic monitoring. The Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' is a specialized variant of the SU-24, a supersonic, all-weather tactical bomber developed by the Soviet Union. The SU-24MR is configured specifically for reconnaissance missions, equipped with advanced sensors and electronic intelligence-gathering systems. Although the Russian planes remained in international airspace, the Dutch F-35s closely monitored and escorted them to the edge of NATO’s area of responsibility. These interceptions demonstrate NATO’s operational readiness and ability to secure its airspace amid increased tensions in the Baltic region. The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Estonia is part of NATO’s Air Policing mission, which aims to protect the airspace of its eastern members. Since December 1, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) has operated four F-35A Lightning II fighters from Ämari Air Base. This deployment underscores the Netherlands’ dedication to NATO and the security of its allies in Eastern Europe. The F-35 program has been a cornerstone of the Netherlands’ air defense modernization strategy. The acquisition process began in the early 2000s when the Netherlands joined the Joint Strike Fighter program as a Level 2 partner, contributing significantly to the aircraft’s development. The first operational F-35A arrived in the Netherlands in October 2019 at Leeuwarden Air Base. By December 2021, the RNLAF declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its fleet, signaling readiness for limited combat operations. Initially, the Netherlands planned to acquire 85 F-35As to replace its aging F-16 fleet, but budget constraints later reduced the order. As of 2022, the Ministry of Defence expanded its plans, increasing the total to 52 aircraft. The first operational deployment of Dutch F-35s occurred in April 2022 when four jets were stationed in Bulgaria to support NATO’s enhanced Air Policing mission. The F-35A’s advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and electronic warfare capabilities have made it an essential component of NATO operations. Its introduction has significantly enhanced the RNLAF’s ability to detect, monitor, and respond to threats, particularly in high-tension areas like the Baltic. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans praised the rapid response of Dutch forces during the recent interceptions. 'This is why our people are there: to protect our collective airspace against Russian threats. As was once again evident on Friday, Russian forces are active in various ways near NATO airspace. Our allies in the Baltic states are pleased with our efforts. I am proud of our people who were able to immediately demonstrate their value to our security,' he said. The Baltic region remains a hotspot for military activity, with frequent incursions by Russian aircraft testing NATO’s readiness. These incidents underscore the importance of the QRA protocol, which allows NATO fighter jets to scramble within minutes to intercept and identify potential threats. The successful interception mission by Dutch F-35s highlights NATO’s resolve to protect its members and affirms the Netherlands’ role as a critical player in the alliance’s defense strategy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-dutch-f-35-fighter-jets-conduct-first-interceptions-of-russian-spy-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2024-12-09T06:59:02-08:00	
Peru Modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean 4x4 K808 IFVs and K2 Tanks to Replace Soviet-Era Vehicles	On December 9, 2024, in Lima, the Peruvian Army unveiled the K808 'White Tiger' armored personnel carrier during the celebrations of the Battle of Ayacucho and Army Day. In May 2024, Hyundai Rotem and STX were selected to supply 30 K808 'Baekho' wheeled armored vehicles to Peru under a contract valued at $60 million. This order marks the first export of South Korean armored vehicles to Latin America. Initially planned for 30 units, the contract could expand to a total of 120 vehicles depending on the future needs of the Peruvian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Peruvian Army modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean K808 'White Tiger' IFVs. (Picture source: Peru MoD) On November 16, 2024, also in Lima, Hyundai Rotem signed a second memorandum of understanding with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian Army’s weapons and ammunition factory, for the supply of K2 'Black Panther' main battle tanks. Although financial details and the exact number of tanks have not been officially disclosed, sources suggest that Peru plans to acquire approximately 100 K2 tanks to replace its aging fleet of T-55 tanks. This initiative is part of a broader modernization program for the Peruvian Armed Forces, aimed at strengthening their operational capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment. On December 9, 2024, three K808 'White Tiger' vehicles paraded, proudly displaying the Peruvian and South Korean flags, symbolizing South Korea's growing importance to the Peruvian Armed Forces and Peru’s commitment to modernizing its aging fleet. The fleet, still largely composed of Soviet-era vehicles such as the T-55 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), demonstrates the need for modernization. The BMP-1, developed in the 1960s, is equipped with a 73mm cannon and anti-tank missile launcher but is outdated in terms of armor and weaponry by current standards. This reliance on aging equipment underscores the necessity for Peru to upgrade its armored fleet to meet the demands of modern battlefields and provide better protection and operational effectiveness for its troops. Peru has shown an increasing willingness to diversify and modernize its armed forces by turning to Western partners. This trend was reinforced in September 2024 when the government included funding for 24 new fighter jets in the 2025 budget. Among the options considered, the French Rafale emerged as a favorite, outpacing competitors like the American F-16 and Swedish Gripen. In November 2024, this shift continued with the Peruvian Congress authorizing the entry of 600 U.S. military personnel to assist with security preparations for the 2024 APEC meetings, further strengthening military ties with the United States. This shift represents a notable departure from Peru’s historical reliance on Russian military equipment. In the 2010s, the country had considered acquiring T-90 tanks to replace its aging T-55s. However, in 2023, significant challenges in obtaining spare parts for its MiG-29 fleet highlighted the limitations of cooperation with Russia. While relations with Moscow persist, decisions made between 2023 and 2024 demonstrate Peru’s growing commitment to strengthening partnerships with Western nations to meet the demands of modernizing its armed forces and aligning with contemporary military standards. Discussions about the South Korean agreements began several years ago, supported by consistent diplomatic efforts. In 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sent a letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, celebrating 60 years of bilateral relations and emphasizing the potential for increased defense cooperation. Between 2023 and 2024, Peruvian military delegations visited South Korea to witness demonstrations of the K808’s capabilities in scenarios simulating mountainous operations and counterterrorism missions. The K808, also known as 'Baekho' (White Tiger), was designed in 2003 and has proven its reliability in the South Korean Army, with over 500 units delivered. Capable of overcoming 40cm obstacles, crossing 1.5-meter trenches, and navigating waterways with its jet propulsion system, it is well-suited to Peru's challenging geography. Its central tire inflation system (CTIS) and advanced mobility make it a strategic asset for the Peruvian Armed Forces. This contract is part of a broader modernization program for Peru's armored fleet, which is still heavily reliant on outdated main battle tanks such as the T-55 and AMX-13 from the 1950s. With this initial order, the long-term outlook is promising. STX and Hyundai Rotem are already in discussions for additional orders and expanded technical collaboration with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian state arms manufacturer. This partnership, which could span several years, enhances South Korea’s strategic presence in the Latin American defense market. A Hyundai Rotem representative reaffirmed the company’s commitment to leveraging its technological expertise to ensure the success of this collaboration and support Peru’s defense objectives in the years ahead. The partnership between Hyundai Rotem and FAME S.A.C. aims to establish a lasting collaboration, paving the way for future contracts and supporting Peru’s defense modernization efforts. This agreement also solidifies South Korea’s position as a competitive player in the Latin American defense market, aligning with its global strategy for growth in the defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-modernizes-armored-fleet-with-south-korean-4x4-k808-ifvs-and-k2-tanks-to-replace-soviet-era-vehicles	2024-12-09T06:51:39-08:00

However, the Turkish Ada-class corvette design was ultimately selected for its operational performance, compatibility with Malaysia’s requirements, and its ability to integrate future naval subsystems from over 50 Turkish defense companies. STM, the project's main contractor, is responsible for all phases, including design, project management, material procurement, assembly, testing, and integrated logistics support (ILS). This marks Malaysia's first defense acquisition through a government-to-government memorandum of understanding (G2G) with another country. STM’s previous experience with Ada-class corvettes for Türkiye, Pakistan, and Ukraine likely influenced this decision. The Ada-class corvette was originally developed under Türkiye’s MILGEM program to meet requirements for anti-submarine warfare, patrol, and maritime surveillance. It features stealth technology, a low radar cross-section, and distributed sensors and weapons systems. The LMSB2 configuration integrates these capabilities while incorporating modifications to meet RMN’s operational needs. The LMSB2 project is a significant component of RMN’s efforts to enhance maritime capabilities, providing flexible operational capacity and effective security for Malaysia’s extensive maritime domain. The ships will feature a lot of systems from Turkish defense companies. Aselsan will supply the 3D surveillance radar, fire control radar, electronic support measures (ESM), and chaff decoy systems. Havelsan will provide the combat management and gun fire control systems. Surface-to-surface missiles (SSMs) will include Roketsan’s Atmaca, while the ships will also be equipped with two quad-packed vertical launch systems (VLS) for 16 Haegung surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) from South Korea’s Lig NEX1. Armament will include a 76mm main gun, a 30mm secondary gun, and decoy launcher systems. Other equipment includes navigation systems, electronic plotting tables, and communication systems. Each Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) vessel will measure 99.56 meters in length, have a displacement of approximately 2,500 tons, and accommodate 111 personnel. They will use a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion system with four diesel engines, providing a top speed of 26 knots, a cruising speed of 14 knots, and an operational range exceeding 4,000 nautical miles. The vessels will have an endurance of 14 days and feature a helipad and hangar for a 10-ton helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicles. Construction and outfitting are expected to conclude by the end of 2027, with delivery to RMN anticipated shortly thereafter. This project aligns with Malaysia’s naval modernization program, guided by the '15 to 5' Transformation Programme, which aims to consolidate RMN’s fleet from 15 classes to five core classes for improved operational and cost efficiency. Key acquisitions include Maharaja Lela-class frigates, Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels, Littoral Mission Ships (LMS), Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), and Scorpène-class submarines. The Maharaja Lela-class program advanced with the launch of KD Maharaja Lela in June 2024. RMN recently updated its transformation plan to address current maritime security challenges and regional threats. Malaysia's extensive maritime zones, including the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, and the Sulu Sea, are critical to its national security and economic prosperity. These waters, rich in natural resources, also serve as vital trade routes but face challenges such as territorial disputes, illegal fishing, smuggling, and piracy. RMN has identified a growing mismatch between its naval capabilities and the demands of effectively securing these areas. Many RMN vessels date back to the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in increased maintenance issues and reduced readiness. To address this, RMN plans to acquire 18 LMS to bolster patrol and surveillance across its maritime zones. These ships will support diverse missions, including anti-surface warfare, mine warfare, hydrography, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. In the South China Sea, Malaysia asserts its rights over its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and conducts oil and gas exploration through Petronas, despite objections from China. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has confirmed that these operations will continue alongside diplomatic discussions with China. RMN monitors the region and reports the situation as secure, according to Admiral Datuk Zulhelmy Ithnain. In the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia collaborates with regional partners through initiatives like the Malacca Straits Patrol to counter piracy and smuggling. In the Sulu Sea, Malaysia conducts joint patrols with Indonesia and the Philippines to combat transnational crimes such as piracy and kidnapping. These efforts combine diplomacy, security measures, and regional cooperation to manage Malaysia’s maritime zones effectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-malaysian-navy-starts-littoral-mission-ship-batch-2-construction-in-tuerkiye	2024-12-09T05:44:59-08:00

Focus: US-made F-35 Stealth Fighter Demonstrates Unmatched Combat Capabilities in Israeli Strike Against Iran	Citing a report from the Simple Flying website, British Admiral Tony Radakin spoke at a Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) lecture in London about how Israel showcased the impressive performance and capabilities of the American-made stealth F-35 fighter jet during the recent airstrikes on Iran. This operation, which targeted over 20 key Iranian military sites, underscored the extraordinary combat capabilities of Israel's fleet of F-35I aircraft, confirming the jet’s role as an unparalleled asset in modern air combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Israeli Air Force F-35 stealth fighter jet demonstrates advanced capabilities in the recent strike on Iranian targets. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The raid, which took down missile-manufacturing facilities and critical air-defense systems, highlighted the F-35’s stealth, precision, and long-range strike abilities—key factors that allowed Israel to execute a high-stakes operation with minimal exposure to risk. Israel has now received around 40 of the 75 F-35I aircraft it ordered, and these advanced jets have proven pivotal in enhancing Israel's air superiority. The F-35I, an Israeli-specific variant of the F-35 Lightning II, has been customized with Israeli avionics, software, and systems, enabling the Israeli Air Force to carry out missions with exceptional precision and efficiency. With its combination of stealth technology, cutting-edge sensors, and advanced munitions, the F-35 has set a new standard for military airstrikes, as demonstrated in the operation that Radakin described. Israel’s F-35Is were central to the success of this high-stakes operation, showcasing the fighter’s advanced stealth features, which allowed Israeli jets to penetrate Iranian airspace without being detected by the country’s sophisticated air-defense systems. The F-35's low-observable design—featuring radar-absorbing coatings, advanced shaping, and internal weapons bays—made it virtually invisible to radar, even to Iran's advanced air-defense missile systems, such as the Russian-made S-300s. This allowed Israel to strike key targets deep inside Iranian territory without exposing their aircraft to the kind of risks that conventional fighter jets would face in a similarly contested environment. The F-35’s radar and sensor systems, particularly the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, also played a critical role in the operation. These sensors allowed Israeli pilots to detect and track targets from long distances, far beyond the range of many conventional radar systems. Combined with the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), which offers a 360-degree view of the battlefield, Israeli pilots could identify targets with remarkable accuracy and engage them from a safe distance. The precision of the airstrike was made possible by the F-35’s ability to carry out precision-guided strikes on a variety of targets. With its advanced weapon systems, such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and StormBreaker bombs, the F-35 can accurately strike even highly protected or deeply buried targets. These munitions are guided by GPS, infrared, and laser systems, ensuring they hit their targets with near-perfect accuracy. In this raid, Israel used fewer than 100 munitions to take out more than 20 military sites, emphasizing the high efficiency of the operation. This operational precision stood in stark contrast to other air campaigns, such as Russia’s strikes in Ukraine, where inefficiency and missed targets have been commonplace. The F-35’s stealth and precision capabilities were crucial in executing a mission where each strike needed to count. No aircraft got within 100 miles of the target in the first wave, yet nearly the entirety of Iran's air-defense system was dismantled. This highlights the F-35’s stand-off strike capability, where weapons can be deployed from a safe distance without compromising the safety of the aircraft or pilots. Beyond its combat and strike capabilities, the F-35’s advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems were pivotal in degrading Iran’s air-defense networks. These EW systems allow the F-35 to disrupt enemy radar, communication, and targeting systems, effectively blinding or misleading adversary defenses. As Admiral Radakin noted, the strike took down 'nearly the entirety of Iran’s air-defense system,' likely facilitated by the F-35’s ability to disrupt and neutralize these defenses before they could respond effectively. Iran’s acquisition of S-300 systems from Russia posed a significant threat to any aircraft attempting to strike Iranian targets. However, Israel’s F-35s used their superior electronic warfare capabilities to target and degrade these systems, making it possible to carry out the mission with minimal risk to the aircraft. The success of this operation also speaks to the multi-role versatility of the F-35. While primarily an air-to-air and air-to-ground combat aircraft, the F-35 also serves as a platform for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). During the strike on Iran, Israeli F-35s likely performed a variety of roles, from gathering intelligence to ensuring that each target was hit with precision and efficiency. The aircraft's ability to switch between strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare roles is a key reason for its operational effectiveness in high-stakes missions like this. The F-35’s ability to carry out surgical strikes on critical infrastructure while maintaining air superiority and disrupting enemy defenses makes it the ideal platform for modern military operations, especially in hostile environments where the enemy possesses advanced air-defense capabilities. The recent Israeli operation against Iranian targets has once again demonstrated the unparalleled combat capabilities of the F-35. With its combination of stealth, precision strike systems, advanced munitions, and superior electronic warfare capabilities, the F-35 has redefined the standards for modern air combat. Israel’s use of this advanced fighter jet highlights its significant technological edge and ability to project power with minimal risk and maximum precision. As Israel continues to expand its fleet of F-35Is, the aircraft will undoubtedly play a central role in future operations, setting a new benchmark in modern military aviation. The F-35’s performance in this operation serves as a clear demonstration of how advanced technologies—stealth, precision, and electronic warfare—are transforming military air operations and ensuring that air forces can meet the complex challenges of the modern battlefield with unprecedented effectiveness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-demonstrates-unmatched-combat-capabilities-in-israeli-strike-against-iran	2024-12-06T08:51:48-08:00

According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia can now produce up to 25 units of RS-26 Rubezh each year, including its new Oreshnik variant. This new development highlights the growing production capacity of Russia's missile forces and their focus on strengthening their medium-range missile arsenals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Test fire at Kapustin Yar: Russia's RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik variants undergo critical testing at the Astrakhan region missile launch site, enhancing Russia's strategic missile capabilities. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The RS-26 Rubezh, at the heart of Russia's modern missile capabilities, represents a strategic shift in Moscow's approach to missile warfare. Its production plays a significant role in Russia’s efforts to counter NATO's missile defense systems. The Oreshnik, a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh, has been shrouded in controversy, particularly following its use in an attack on Ukraine's Dnipro River on November 21, 2024. The RS-26 Rubezh is a crucial missile for Russia’s defense strategy. Classified as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the RS-26 is designed to carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and has a range of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 km (2,175 to 2,485 miles). This puts it within the category of medium to long-range missile systems capable of striking targets across Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Russia has invested heavily in producing the RS-26 Rubezh and its variants. The missile is manufactured at high output and can produce up to 25 units per year, a significant increase from earlier periods. This production surge follows the technical experience gained from Russia's previous RS-24 Yars ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile) program, which has informed the development of the RS-26’s advanced features, including hypersonic speed and maneuverability designed to defeat modern missile defense systems. The controversy surrounding Russia’s missile capabilities deepened after an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on November 21, 2024. During the attack, Russian forces used what they claimed to be a 'new medium-range system' that President Vladimir Putin referred to as the Oreshnik. At the time, Ukrainian officials initially identified the missile used in the strike as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), but Putin contradicted this, announcing that the missile was a new addition to Russia’s missile arsenal, designed specifically for medium-range strikes. In contrast, American officials labeled the missile as 'experimental,' suggesting that while it may have been deployed operationally, the Oreshnik was still in an advanced testing phase. According to U.S. officials, the missile appears to be a non-nuclear, hypersonic ballistic missile, a designation that aligns with previous reports of its high-speed and maneuvering capabilities. These features make the missile extremely difficult to intercept, as it travels at speeds greater than Mach 5 (over six times the speed of sound) and can follow unpredictable flight paths to bypass missile defense systems. Despite these claims of a new missile type, the Oreshnik is widely regarded as a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh—with enhancements aimed at improving its hypersonic capabilities and range. The missile's inclusion in Russia’s operational arsenal is seen as part of a broader strategy to bolster its missile forces, specifically in response to NATO’s missile defense systems in Europe. Both the RS-26 Rubezh and its Oreshnik variant undergo testing at Russia’s key missile testing sites. These include Kapustin Yar, located in the Astrakhan region, which has long been a central hub for developing and testing Russia’s missile systems, including the RS-26 and its variants. Additionally, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk region plays a critical role in missile testing. Though better known for space launches, Plesetsk is integral to Russia’s missile development and operational readiness. The international community has responded with heightened concern over the deployment of the Oreshnik missile. The United States, in particular, has expressed its reservations, labeling the missile 'experimental' and underscoring the potential escalation of tensions. The missile’s hypersonic nature and non-nuclear profile make it a versatile tool for Russia’s military, capable of striking with precision while circumventing most conventional missile defense systems, including THAAD and Aegis. The attack on Dnipro has further fueled worries that Russia may be advancing its missile technology with a focus on bypassing traditional defense mechanisms. With its ability to target high-value military and infrastructure assets over a long distance, the RS-26 Oreshnik represents a serious threat in a region already facing significant instability. For NATO and the West, the growing production of intermediate-range ballistic missiles like the RS-26 Rubezh, and the operational readiness of the Oreshnik, highlight the urgent need to adapt and modernize missile defense capabilities to respond to Russia's evolving missile threats. Russia’s ability to ramp up production of the RS-26 Rubezh, including its Oreshnik variant, signals a major shift in the strategic landscape. With up to 25 units of the RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik expected to roll out annually, Russia is significantly enhancing its missile arsenal, increasing its ability to project power over long distances. As the Oreshnik variant enters the operational phase, the growing concern about its hypersonic and maneuverability features will continue to shape global security dynamics. The missile’s potential to bypass missile defense systems, along with its strategic and tactical flexibility, makes it a formidable asset in Russia’s military planning. For the West, this development calls for reevaluating defense strategies and missile deterrence capabilities as Russia’s missile forces continue to evolve rapidly. The geopolitical implications of this missile advancement will likely influence future arms control talks and shape the future trajectory of global missile defense systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-ukraine-intel-reveals-russia-can-produce-25-medium-range-ballistic-missiles-annually	2024-12-06T08:12:52-08:00

The Javelin’s lightweight design and advanced LWCLU enhance operational flexibility, allowing for deployment in various environments with minimal setup time. Its fire-and-forget capability ensures greater safety for operators, as they can relocate immediately after launch. These features make the Javelin particularly suited to Tunisia’s evolving defense needs, providing its forces with a modern and versatile tool to address a wide range of armored and fortified threats. This acquisition underscores Tunisia’s commitment to advancing its military capabilities in alignment with regional security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-supports-tunisias-military-modernization-through-strategic-javelin-anti-tank-missile-deal	2024-12-06T05:51:25-08:00	
Japan Increases Defense Ties with Coastal Radars and Patrol Vessels Supplies Under OSA Program	On December 2, 2024, a Japanese government source revealed that Japan would supply specific defense equipment to the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Djibouti under its Official Security Assistance (OSA) program. This program, launched in April 2023, aims to strengthen the defense capacities of nations that share Tokyo's strategic values. For the 2024 fiscal year ending in March, the government allocated a budget of 5 billion yen ($33 million) to support these four priority countries. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mitsubishi J/FPS-3 Coastal Surveillance Radar (Picture source: Mitsubishi) In 2024, Japan decided to allocate a significant portion of this aid to the Philippines, which faces escalating Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. Tokyo plans to provide advanced maritime surveillance radar systems to Manila to enhance detection and control capabilities in this strategic area. These systems will complement the J/FPS-3 coastal surveillance radar developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, delivered in 2023, which significantly improved the security of the Philippines' territorial waters. Amid recurring confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels, these new radars aim to ensure better preparedness and a swift response to incursions. Mongolia, due to its strategic location between China and Russia, is expected to receive systems including Primary Surveillance Radars (PSR) produced by NEC Corporation, capable of detecting aircraft without transponders, and Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSR), which identify equipped aircraft and provide precise data on their altitude and trajectory. These systems will enable Mongolia to enhance its airspace monitoring capabilities and guard against potential intrusions. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Djibouti could receive Shikishima-class patrol vessels, built by Japan Marine United Corporation (JMU), or equivalent models designed to ensure maritime security and protect strategic trade routes. These vessels aim to counter illegal maritime activities in Indonesian waters and strengthen security in Djibouti's vital maritime corridor. Since its launch in April 2023, the OSA program reflects a strategic shift in Japan's international security policy. This proactive initiative aims to bolster the defense capacities of its partners in the face of growing threats, particularly China's military expansion. Through this targeted assistance, Tokyo reaffirms its commitment to promoting a free and stable Indo-Pacific while consolidating regional alliances in an increasingly tense geopolitical context. Japan's arms policy, long defined by a strict pacifist stance, is rooted in Article 9 of its 1947 Constitution adopted after World War II. This article prohibits Japan from using war as a means of resolving international conflicts and restricts its military capabilities to strictly territorial defense. For decades, this approach translated into stringent restrictions on arms exports and an exclusively defensive role for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). However, the evolving regional security environment has gradually pushed Tokyo to reassess this policy. Faced with China's growing military power, North Korea's nuclear threats, and the rising strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, several key changes have marked this transition. In 1967, the 'Three Principles on Arms Exports' established a strict ban on selling arms to communist countries, nations under UN embargo, or those involved in armed conflicts. These restrictions began to ease in 2014 when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe adopted the 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment,' allowing limited exports to countries sharing Japan's democratic values. A major turning point occurred in 2015 with the adoption of the collective security law, allowing the SDF to intervene to defend allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked. This change broadened the strictly defensive framework of Japan's military action. In 2023, Tokyo launched the OSA program, designed to provide non-lethal defense equipment to allied countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, or Mongolia. This program aims to strengthen the defense capacities of partner nations while stabilizing the region amid China's military expansion. In parallel, Japan significantly increased its military budget, reaching 2% of its GDP in 2024, in line with commitments outlined in its 2022 updated national defense strategy. This record budget marks a paradigm shift for a country that traditionally capped its military spending at around 1% of its GDP. These transformations reflect Japan's intention to play a more active role in regional and international security while asserting its commitment to ensuring a free and stable Indo-Pacific. This strategic shift marks a break from its historical pacifist stance while remaining aligned with contemporary geopolitical challenges. Outside the OSA framework, Japan has also supplied defense equipment to several countries through bilateral cooperation or specific loans. In 2016, the Philippines received TC-90 training aircraft, initially leased and later transferred permanently in 2018, to bolster maritime surveillance in the contested waters of the South China Sea. In 2020, Japan delivered patrol vessels to Vietnam via a low-interest loan, followed by a 2021 agreement to expand the export of maritime surveillance systems. In 2022, Japan concluded an agreement with Thailand for technology transfers in the defense sector, though specific systems have not been disclosed. Regarding Ukraine, while Japan has not supplied lethal military equipment, it delivered civilian drones, bulletproof vests, and other non-lethal support equipment in 2022 and 2023, underscoring its commitment to supporting Kyiv within the constraints of Japan's constitutional restrictions. These initiatives demonstrate Tokyo's intent to contribute to international security while adapting to the specific needs of its strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/japan-increases-defense-ties-with-coastal-radars-and-patrol-vessels-supplies-under-osa-program	2024-12-06T05:44:38-08:00	
First capture of intact Podlet-K1 radar by Syrian rebels could threaten Russia's air defense effectiveness	As reported by Clash Report on December 4, 2024, Syrian rebels have achieved the first recorded capture of an intact Russian 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, taken during an offensive near Hama at the headquarters of the Assad regime's 25th Special Forces Division. The system, valued at approximately $5 million and integral to the S-300PMU-2 and S-400 air defense networks, could pose a significant threat to Russian air defense effectiveness if its technology is analyzed by adversaries.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. (Picture source: Clash Report) Similar systems lost in Ukraine, such as those destroyed in Kherson and Crimea, were not seized intact. While operational use by the rebels is unlikely due to technical complexity, the most effective way to exploit its capabilities would be through detailed analysis, which could reveal vulnerabilities in Russian air defense systems, an eventuality which raises concerns among Russian analysts about its potential transfer to entities like NATO or Ukraine. Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. This information could advance the development of countermeasures, refine electronic warfare tactics, and highlight weaknesses in Russian air defense systems. The Podlet-K1's ability to detect low-altitude cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and R-360 Neptune, underscores its strategic importance. The capture occurred during a broader offensive by opposition forces in Hama province, following their takeover of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. This offensive, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), marked the first opposition control of Aleppo since 2016. After capturing several military installations, including the 87th Brigade base and a tank school, HTS forces advanced toward Hama. Although they temporarily breached the city's defenses, counterattacks by pro-Assad forces, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias, forced the rebels to retreat. The offensive resulted in significant equipment losses for both sides. Rebels reportedly seized 31 Russian-made tanks, including T-72 and T-90 models, 20 BMP armored personnel carriers, and 12 122mm artillery pieces. Additionally, they captured a Pantsir-S1, a Strela-10, and an S-125 air defense system. These acquisitions have enabled expanded drone and missile attacks on regime targets. However, intense fighting led to the destruction of other equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, though specific figures remain unverified. Among the abandoned systems was a ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures, left by the regime’s 4th Armored Division on the Khanasir-Ithrya road. This system, one of two upgraded in the Adra workshop, was filmed after its abandonment. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, rebels captured eight L-39 Albatros light training and attack jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The MiG-23, powered by a Tumansky R-29B turbojet engine, can reach speeds of up to 2,500 km/h and is designed for interception and air-to-ground missions. While these aircraft represent strategic assets, their operational potential is constrained by maintenance needs, a lack of skilled pilots, and vulnerability to airstrikes. Ground tests were attempted, but technical issues and attacks on captured bases hindered further use. The Podlet-K1 system can detect aerial targets at ranges of 10 to 300 kilometers and altitudes up to 10 kilometers, tracking up to 200 targets simultaneously. Its modular design comprises three components mounted on a KamAZ-6350 8x8 chassis: an antenna post, a mobile command post, and a power generator. It employs a phased-array S-band radar and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) technology, enabling operations against low-flying and high-speed targets. The system's deployment and pack-up can be completed within approximately 20 minutes. The capture of the Podlet-K1 radar system has drawn comparisons to a 2020 operation in Libya, where U.S. forces, in cooperation with Türkiye, extracted a Russian Pantsir-S1 system. Speculation suggests the radar could be transferred to Türkiye, given its use of Russian S-400 systems. Alternatively, Russian airstrikes might target the radar to prevent its analysis, similar to actions taken in Ukraine following the loss of a Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UAV. Despite logistical challenges, the radar’s intact condition could facilitate technical study and aid in developing countermeasures against similar systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/first-capture-of-intact-podlet-k1-radar-by-syrian-rebels-could-threaten-russias-air-defense-effectiveness	2024-12-06T05:08:14-08:00

Australia to test StrikeMaster coastal defense system with NSM missiles mounted on Bushmaster vehicles	According to ABC News on December 4, 2024, the Australian Army is advancing plans to integrate the StrikeMaster, a domestically developed missile-launching system mounted on the Bushmaster vehicle, into its long-range strike capabilities. The StrikeMaster is equipped with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a precision-guided weapon capable of striking targets at ranges exceeding 250 kilometers. It is designed to engage both land-based and maritime targets. Initially unveiled in 2022, the system was developed through a partnership between Kongsberg and Thales and is intended to provide 'area denial' capabilities in northern Australia as part of the country's updated defense strategy.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The StrikeMaster is equipped with the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), a precision-guided weapon capable of striking targets at ranges exceeding 250 kilometers. (Picture source: Thales) Under Project LAND 8113 Phase Two, the Federal Government has initiated a tender process to compare the StrikeMaster with the American-made M142 HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System). The HIMARS can deploy the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which has a range exceeding 400 kilometers. The government has highlighted the StrikeMaster as a less expensive and locally produced alternative, emphasizing its potential to strengthen domestic production capabilities. Despite its prioritization by the Albanese government, there has been internal resistance within the Army regarding the system's adoption. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM), developed by Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace in Norway, entered service in 2012 as the successor to the Penguin missile. It is constructed with materials designed to reduce radar visibility and features a titanium-cased warhead for precise targeting. Originally integrated into Norway’s Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates and Skjold-class corvettes, the NSM has also been adopted by Poland’s Coastal Missile Division, the United States, and Australia. The missile’s flexibility has enabled its use across a variety of platforms, including naval vessels and land-based systems. The NSM’s operational range exceeds 250 kilometers, and it employs GPS guidance, terrain-following technology, and an imaging infrared seeker for autonomous target identification and engagement. The missile is designed to fly at low altitudes to avoid detection and countermeasures. In Poland, the Coastal Missile Division deploys the NSM using mobile launchers supported by radar and command vehicles, enabling a networked defense system. The missile has also been adapted for land operations, as demonstrated by the U.S. Marine Corps' Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS), which employs unmanned vehicles for increased flexibility and range. The integration of naval missile systems onto land vehicles enhances coastal defense by enabling land-based forces to engage maritime targets. This capability allows rapid repositioning along coastlines, complicating adversary planning and operations. Using existing platforms to deploy naval missile technology reduces development costs while maintaining operational effectiveness. The NMESIS, for instance, successfully demonstrated this concept during a 2021 exercise, striking a target ship from a ground-based launcher. Similarly, the Australian Army is exploring the StrikeMaster system as a mobile coastal defense solution using the NSM, providing strike capabilities over 250 kilometers. Australia’s interest in long-range precision strike systems aligns with the 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR), which calls for a response to changing security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region, including the expansion of China’s military activities. The DSR recommends strengthening the Australian Defence Force (ADF) by acquiring more advanced strike systems across ground, air, and maritime domains to address vulnerabilities in conventional defenses. The ADF’s approach includes plans for domestic production of Kongsberg's NSM and Joint Strike Missile (JSM) and collaboration with the United States on the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) program to enhance ground-based strike capabilities. In the aerial domain, Australia has expressed interest in acquiring the B-21 Raider stealth bomber from the United States, citing previous experience with Canberra bombers and F-111 aircraft. In the maritime domain, the AUKUS agreement includes plans for the development of nuclear-powered submarines to increase operational capabilities in the region.

Breaking News: US Successfully Tests MACH-TB Hypersonic Flight to Accelerate Weapons Development	On December 5, 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announced the successful execution of a key flight test for the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed (MACH-TB), which took place in November 2024. The test, conducted by the Department of Defense’s Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, marks a significant milestone in the U.S. pursuit of hypersonic technologies. The MACH-TB is designed to advance the testing and development of hypersonic systems, providing crucial insights into the performance of cutting-edge weapons that could dramatically enhance U.S. military capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Testing the future of warfare: The MACH-TB hypersonic flight test accelerates the development of advanced weapons capabilities for the U.S. military. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The MACH-TB is a next-generation hypersonic flight test vehicle developed to accelerate the testing process for hypersonic systems across multiple branches of the U.S. military and other federal agencies. Its primary purpose is to provide a reliable, commercially launched platform capable of simulating and testing hypersonic conditions in real-world flight scenarios. By employing commercial launch services, the DoD aims to reduce the costs and time associated with testing hypersonic components while simultaneously increasing the testing frequency. Mr. George Rumford, Director of the TRMC, emphasized the value of this approach: 'Leveraging commercial launch services allows our Nation to test components early and frequently, accelerating hypersonic development affordably.' This approach not only helps expedite testing but also enables rapid feedback on the performance of hypersonic technologies, making it a critical enabler for developing advanced capabilities for U.S. forces. Hypersonic weapons are defined as those that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. These weapons are particularly notable because of their ability to maneuver while traveling at extreme speeds, making them highly difficult to track or intercept with current missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability creates significant strategic advantages for any military force capable of deploying them. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare is undeniable, as they offer a range of benefits. First, their speed and precision enable hypersonic weapons to strike targets at extreme distances in a fraction of the time compared to conventional missiles, potentially rendering existing defense systems obsolete. Second, unlike ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic weapons are capable of maneuvering in flight, further complicating interception efforts. Finally, their ability to penetrate heavily defended airspace provides a significant deterrent and strategic advantage during combat situations. The development of hypersonic technologies is, therefore, seen as a crucial part of the evolving global arms race, as nations seek to gain a technological edge on the battlefield. While the United States has made significant strides in hypersonic weapons development, it is far from alone in pursuing this advanced technology. China and Russia have emerged as key competitors, each heavily investing in hypersonic systems to bolster their own military capabilities. China has made rapid progress in developing hypersonic glide vehicles, such as the DF-17, which is capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. The Chinese military has also been investing in advanced launch platforms and testing mechanisms, with a focus on increasing the speed and range of their hypersonic systems. Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has aggressively pursued hypersonic weapons as part of its military modernization program. The country has already deployed hypersonic missiles like the Avangard, which is reportedly capable of reaching speeds up to Mach 27. Additionally, Russia has developed the Zircon missile, a sea-launched hypersonic weapon intended to target both naval and land-based targets at extreme speeds. Both China and Russia have demonstrated their capabilities through successful test flights, creating a sense of urgency in the U.S. military to advance its own hypersonic development programs. In addition to China and Russia, countries such as India, France, and Australia are also pursuing hypersonic technologies, each working to integrate these systems into their defense strategies. For the U.S. military and its allies, hypersonic weapons represent a paradigm shift in the way warfare could be conducted. The strategic advantages they offer are clear. Hypersonic weapons allow for near-instantaneous strikes, significantly shortening the response time to emerging threats and providing a new tool for rapid deployment of military force. They also can penetrate traditional missile defense systems. Systems like the U.S.-developed Aegis or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) are optimized for intercepting slower ballistic missiles, but hypersonic weapons, due to their high speed and unpredictable flight paths, present a much more difficult challenge for these systems to defend against. Additionally, hypersonic systems can be adapted to various platforms, from ground-based launchers to submarines and aircraft, allowing military forces to deploy these weapons in a variety of operational scenarios. Given their speed and range, hypersonic weapons could be used in a variety of theaters, from deterring regional conflicts to countering more sophisticated threats posed by adversaries with advanced air-defense systems. Therefore, the U.S. military's focus on hypersonics is not just about keeping pace with China and Russia but also about ensuring that it retains a technological edge that will be decisive in future conflicts. The MACH-TB test represents one critical step in this ongoing race to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, which will be a core element of the U.S. military’s arsenal in the years to come. The success of the MACH-TB flight test is a major achievement in the U.S. Department of Defense's quest to accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies. By leveraging commercial launch services, the DoD is setting the stage for more frequent and cost-effective testing, ultimately leading to faster deployment of these advanced weapons. With global competitors like China and Russia intensifying their own hypersonic development programs, the need for the U.S. to lead in this domain has never been more pressing. Hypersonic weapons are poised to revolutionize military strategies worldwide, and initiatives like MACH-TB are essential for ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-us-successfully-tests-mach-tb-hypersonic-flight-to-accelerate-weapons-development	2024-12-06T01:29:30-08:00

Their acquisition occurs amid an escalating conflict, where the Syrian Army is increasingly abandoning intact, modern Russian-supplied equipment during retreats, particularly following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Of the 30 T-90 and T-90A main battle tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been abandoned by the Syrian Army and captured by opposition forces. (Picture source: Twitter/Tendar and T-90K) During a recent offensive in Syria, opposition forces, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), captured significant quantities of Russian military equipment left behind by retreating Syrian government forces. To date, this included between six and eight T-90 and T-90A tanks, a Russian-made 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, a Buk-M2 air defense system, and one of two ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' vehicles equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system was also seized. Additionally, older systems such as T-72M and T-55 tanks, BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher, two BREM recovery vehicles (BREM-1 or BREM-2), and a 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer were captured. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, opposition forces seized eight L-39 Albatros light jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The range of equipment captured highlights the extent of material losses suffered by the Syrian Army. Among the captured equipment, the T-90 and T-90A tanks are particularly significant. Of the 30 T-90 tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been captured during this new offensive. Earlier incidents also reveal a consistent pattern of equipment loss. In 2016, a T-90A was captured by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham during clashes near Aleppo, marking the first documented instance of this tank falling into opposition hands. That unit has since been observed in various operations. Another T-90 was captured in 2020 during a government retreat. These incidents underscore vulnerabilities in securing advanced equipment during Syrian Army withdrawals. The latest captures occurred amid an offensive following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. This marked the first time opposition forces had taken control of Aleppo since 2016. The offensive, led by HTS, progressed into Hama province after capturing key installations such as the 87th Brigade base and a tank school. Despite breaching Hama’s defenses, opposition forces were eventually pushed back by counterattacks from Syrian government troops, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias. The captured T-90A tank provides Syrian rebels with notable combat capabilities due to its modern design and equipment. It is armed with a 125mm 2A46M-5 smoothbore gun, capable of engaging targets at distances up to 5 kilometers with precision, including while the tank is in motion.

The Syrian Army continues to face challenges in safeguarding its equipment during strategic retreats. The rapid advance of HTS and allied forces, combined with logistical constraints, has resulted in the abandonment of high-value assets. The Syrian military’s reliance on Russian-supplied systems, which are not fully integrated into its operational framework, further complicates its ability to manage withdrawals. Additionally, Russia’s focus on its own military commitments, including operations in Ukraine, has limited its capacity to provide immediate support to Syrian forces. These factors have contributed to repeated equipment losses, significantly impacting the Syrian Army’s overall operational capability. On the other hand, Syrian opposition forces have shown mixed capacities in effectively using captured tanks, including advanced models like the T-90A, against the Syrian Army. These capabilities are influenced by various factors, such as technical expertise, availability of spare parts, and tactical integration. Groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) have historically captured tanks during engagements, including T-55, T-72, and more advanced T-90A models. The T-90A, equipped with advanced thermal imaging, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, and a powerful 125mm smoothbore gun, poses significant challenges for opposition forces to maintain and operate due to its sophisticated systems. Nevertheless, there have been instances where such tanks were employed effectively, including a confirmed case in 2017 where HTS militants used a captured T-90A against government forces. Recent offensives, particularly in northwestern Syria, have also resulted in the capture of additional tanks abandoned by retreating Syrian Army units near Aleppo and Idlib.

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An M1A2 Abrams assigned to the 1st Armored Division, fires during a live-fire exercise at Rodriguez Live-Fire Complex, South Korea, Aug. 5, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) The M1A2T tanks feature a jungle green camouflage tailored to the island's environmental conditions, differing from the desert camouflage of Abrams tanks used by the United States and other nations. Dozens of Taiwanese instructors who recently returned from training in the U.S. are preparing the military to integrate these tanks. A second phase of hands-on training, scheduled for February 2025 after the Lunar New Year, will include live-fire exercises targeting both stationary and moving objectives. The tanks will be deployed gradually, with 38 units expected by the end of 2024, followed by 42 in 2025 and an additional 28 in 2026. Approved by the United States in 2019, this acquisition aims to modernize Taiwan’s military capabilities, particularly to strengthen coastal defenses in the north of the island and counter potential threats from the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The M1A2T is a modified version of the M1A2 SEP V2 and includes specific upgrades for Taiwan. Armed with a 120mm M256 smoothbore cannon, these tanks can penetrate 850mm of armor while resisting projectiles from most enemy main battle tanks. They provide improved firepower and protection compared to older models like the M60A3 Patton and CM-11 Brave Tiger still in service. These enhanced capabilities are considered critical for countering a possible ground invasion, especially given their ability to fire from elevated positions. The tanks’ arrival coincides with growing regional tensions. China has increased its military activities near Taiwan, conducting exercises such as 'Joint Sword-2024A' in May and 'Joint Sword-2024B' in October, simulating the encirclement and invasion of the island. Additional drills are anticipated, further raising concerns. Concurrently, Beijing has strongly criticized a recent U.S. military aid package for Taiwan worth $385 million, which includes spare parts for F-16 aircraft and advanced radars. China views these sales as a violation of its sovereignty and the 'One China' principle, accusing Washington of turning Taiwan into a potential flashpoint for conflict. As the first M1A2T Abrams tanks prepare to join Taiwan's military, their delivery underscores the United States' commitment to supporting the island's defense. While the modernization of Taiwan's military is a strategic step forward, it also intensifies regional tensions, presenting increasingly complex geopolitical challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/taiwan-prepares-to-receive-first-m1a2t-abrams-tanks-amid-rising-tensions-with-china	2024-12-05T01:38:53-08:00	
Breaking News: Russian MiG-31I fighter jet with hypersonic missile in military exercise demonstrating new threats	On December 3, 2024, the Russian armed forces conducted significant military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean, showcasing the growing integration of hypersonic missile technology into their strategic arsenal. According to Russian Press Agency TASS reports, MiG-31I fighter jets from the Russian Aerospace Forces were deployed, carrying Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. This exercise demonstrates Russia’s commitment to enhancing its military capabilities and highlights the increasing role of hypersonic missiles in modern warfare. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian MiG-31I fighter jet armed with a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) participating in military exercises over the eastern Mediterranean. (Picture source: Russia Zvezdanews) The Kinzhal missile, which translates to 'Dagger' in Russian, is an air-launched hypersonic weapon designed to deliver unparalleled speed, precision, and power. Capable of traveling at speeds up to Mach 10 and performing evasive maneuvers during flight, the Kinzhal is a formidable weapon against both static and mobile targets. With a reported range of approximately 2,000 kilometers, it has the ability to strike critical assets such as aircraft carriers, command centers, and strategic infrastructure with minimal warning. The deployment of this missile on MiG-31I aircraft enhances Russia’s ability to project power across key regions, including the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The MiG-31I is a specialized variant of the MiG-31 interceptor, adapted to carry hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal. Compared to the original MiG-31, which was designed primarily for high-altitude interception of enemy aircraft, the MiG-31I has been optimized for carrying and launching large payloads, including hypersonic weapons. While retaining the original’s exceptional speed—capable of reaching Mach 2.8—the MiG-31I also benefits from enhanced avionics and missile integration systems tailored to the operational demands of hypersonic missile deployment. This transformation significantly expands the aircraft's combat capabilities, making it not only a high-speed interceptor but also a strategic strike platform. The operational integration of the MiG-31I and Kinzhal missiles is a continuation of Russia’s hypersonic strategy. In October 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that MiG-31 fighter jets equipped with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles would begin patrolling the Black Sea. This announcement underscored Moscow’s intent to establish a robust hypersonic deterrent in a region of heightened geopolitical tension, signaling Russia's readiness to counter perceived threats and assert its influence over contested areas. The Russian armed forces also operate another air-launched hypersonic missile system in limited service: the GZUR (Hypersonic Guided Airborne Missile). While less publicized than the Kinzhal, the GZUR is designed for tactical roles and can be deployed from multi-role fighter jets, expanding the operational flexibility of Russia’s hypersonic arsenal. Together, these two systems—the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and the GZUR—form the backbone of Russia’s air-launched hypersonic capabilities, ensuring both strategic and tactical coverage in modern warfare. Hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal and GZUR are revolutionizing modern warfare by challenging existing defense systems and reshaping strategic paradigms. The extreme speeds of hypersonic weapons drastically reduce the reaction time available to adversaries, making them difficult to intercept with conventional missile defense systems. Their ability to maneuver mid-flight further complicates defensive measures, effectively rendering many current systems obsolete. The proliferation of hypersonic weapons has also intensified the global arms race. As Russia advances its capabilities, other nations, including the United States and China, are accelerating the development of their own hypersonic systems. This technological race not only raises the stakes in global power competition but also introduces new risks, including the potential for miscalculation or unintended escalation in conflict zones. The deployment of hypersonic missiles in active theaters, such as the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, also poses emerging threats. The dual-use capability of hypersonic weapons, which can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, adds ambiguity to their deployment. This uncertainty increases the risk of misinterpretation, particularly in high-stakes confrontations, potentially triggering disproportionate responses. Furthermore, the spread of hypersonic technology raises concerns about its potential acquisition by non-state actors, amplifying the threat to global security. Russia’s demonstration of its hypersonic capabilities in the Mediterranean is a clear message to both regional and global adversaries. By integrating advanced weapon systems like the Kinzhal and GZUR into its strategic arsenal and pairing them with high-performance aircraft like the MiG-31I, Moscow is not only solidifying its position as a leader in hypersonic technology but also reshaping the future of warfare. As these weapons continue to evolve, their role in military strategy is poised to grow, heralding a new era where speed, precision, and unpredictability define the battlefield.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-russian-mig-31i-fighter-jet-with-hypersonic-missile-in-military-exercise-demonstrating-new-threats	2024-12-05T01:26:23-08:00
