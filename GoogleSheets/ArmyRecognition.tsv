India Showcases Rafale Jet Capability to Intercept High-Altitude Chinese Spy Balloons	The Indian Air Force (IAF) recently conducted an exercise to demonstrate its ability to intercept targets representative of Chinese spy balloons at very high altitudes. Deploying one of its thirty-six Rafale jets, the IAF successfully engaged a simulated target at over 55,000 feet or approximately 16.7 km altitude. According to a source cited by the Times of India, this operation marks a significant milestone for India, proving its air force’s capability to destroy such targets in previously unexplored flight zones for these types of missions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) India’s Rafale, first delivered in 2020 under a contract signed with France in 2016, is a versatile combat aircraft designed for high-altitude operations, extended range, and high payload capacity. With a maximum operational ceiling of 55,000 feet, the Rafale enables the IAF to maintain heightened vigilance against potential aerial incursions, including in upper airspace. Equipped for air-to-air and ground attack missions, the Rafale can carry a broad array of guided and unguided munitions, offering substantial flexibility. This operation comes as interest in very high-altitude security intensifies, particularly since the downing of a Chinese spy balloon by the US Air Force over American waters in 2023. This incident highlighted the strategic importance of this layer of airspace, which remains under-regulated due to a lack of consensus on the boundary between airspace and outer space. The Chinese balloon, measuring nearly 60 meters in diameter and equipped with a 900 kg payload, demonstrated high-altitude intelligence-gathering capabilities. However, US authorities stated that no significant data was collected during its passage. To prevent further intrusions, NORAD recalibrated its radars in March, enabling the interception of an aerostat at over 43,000 feet above Utah. Although this object posed no direct threat, vigilance remains essential, and other Chinese balloons have been observed near Taiwan. Given its own tensions with China, particularly concerning the Arunachal Pradesh region, India has been preparing for potential incursions of Chinese balloons into its airspace, though no official comment was made on a similar sighting over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 2022. During this recent operation, the Indian Rafale was armed with Meteor and MICA missiles, capable of striking targets at ranges of 200 km and 80 km, respectively. No details were disclosed on the tactics employed to intercept the target at such a high altitude, which represents the Rafale’s operational ceiling. This demonstration echoes the capabilities affirmed by General Stéphane Mille, Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force, in 2022, who stated that France also possesses the capability to intercept such devices. Currently, India has a fleet of 36 Rafales, complementing a combat force that includes Su-30MKIs, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000s, and Tejas jets, each playing a strategic role in national defense. This mix of Russian, French, and indigenous technology enables the IAF to maintain diverse and robust intervention capabilities. India is also considering expanding its Rafale fleet, with plans to acquire an additional 26 aircraft, primarily for its navy, which would strengthen India’s maritime defense capabilities. This potential expansion demonstrates India’s confidence in the Rafale, which has proven effective in high-altitude exercises and national security scenarios. The international context underscores the growing importance of very high-altitude protection, a domain that major powers are actively exploring to ensure enhanced surveillance and counter emerging threats. Beyond the technical dimension, the IAF’s exercise shows India’s determination to defend its airspace from any form of unwanted surveillance, affirming its sovereignty and increasing control over an area of airspace that has so far been sparsely utilized.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/india-showcases-rafale-jet-capability-to-intercept-high-altitude-chinese-spy-balloons-2	2024-10-09T02:18:49-07:00

L3Harris Explores Maritime Version of Vampire Counter-Drone Defense System	Defense technology manufacturer L3Harris is exploring a maritime version of its Vampire counter-drone defense system to enhance naval protection against airborne threats. Initially designed as a truck-mounted platform to provide low-cost precision defense for ground forces, the Vampire gained recognition in 2022 as one of the first weapon systems supplied to Ukraine by the Pentagon. Simple and durable in design, the Vampire combines widely available 2.75mm Advanced Precision Kill Weapon Systems (APKWS) rockets from BAE Systems with an L3Harris Wescam MX-10D digital sensor equipped with a laser designator. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield (Picture source: L3Harris) L3Harris has announced the adaptation of this system into a version intended to provide an anti-drone solution for ships at sea. According to Jason Lambert, president of the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance division at L3Harris, demonstrations for maritime use are currently underway, with a version of the Vampire deployed on ships. These tests are taking place amid repeated drone and cruise missile attacks targeting U.S. warships in the Red Sea over the past year, described by Pentagon officials as the most intense naval combat involving the U.S. since World War II. Although combat vessels are equipped with multi-layered air defense systems, these systems primarily rely on costly missiles, of which ships can carry only limited quantities. Each Raytheon SM-2 missile used by the U.S. Navy costs approximately $2 million, while the larger SM-6 model exceeds $4 million. In contrast, the smaller and less expensive APKWS rockets used in the Vampire system offer a cost-effective option between long-range missiles and close-range defensive guns, optimizing cost per shot. The Vampire system could be directly installed on warships, but L3Harris is also investigating an innovative approach: mounting Vampire units on uncrewed vessels that would create a defensive perimeter around the main vessel, establishing an anti-drone shield. By deploying, for example, four such autonomous vessels equipped with numerous rockets around a single main ship, L3Harris envisions an additional layer of protection against attacks. These Vampire units would be remotely controlled from the primary vessel, with human operators managing targeting and rocket guidance. The company is also examining the possibility of incorporating autonomy into the system to facilitate target identification. The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks (Picture source: L3Harris) The land-based Vampire version deployed in Ukraine uses a magazine of four APKWS rockets, but the maritime concept anticipates a larger capacity to counter saturation drone attacks. Over the past year, U.S. warships have faced dozens of armed drone strikes conducted in saturation waves, which have been intercepted by naval air defenses and carrier-based fighters. Despite these efforts, civilian ships have been impacted, with some even sinking. Since deploying the Vampire in Ukraine, L3Harris has implemented several enhancements, including the addition of proximity fuses on APKWS rockets, eliminating the need for direct hits to neutralize targets. According to Lambert, feedback from Ukraine regarding the Vampire’s performance in combat has been 'extremely positive.' The Ukraine conflict has underscored the critical role of drones in modern warfare, with both sides deploying small drones extensively for reconnaissance, artillery adjustment, and anti-personnel and anti-armor strikes. Russia has also used waves of armed drones and cruise missiles to target Ukrainian civilian areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/l3harris-explores-maritime-version-of-vampire-counter-drone-defense-system	2024-10-09T01:30:49-07:00

Greece purchases 592 US-made Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions for Special Forces	According to Doureios on October 10, 2024, Greece plans to acquire 592 units of Switchblade 300 Block 20 and Switchblade 600 loitering munitions from the United States. The Hellenic Parliament’s Special Permanent Committee on Armaments and Contracts approved this procurement on September 17, 2024, as part of a broader defense enhancement initiative.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Most of these Switchblade loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. (Picture source: AeroVironment) Greece's decision follows a series of strategic evaluations that began in December 2023, when the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA) approved a related study for the acquisition, upgrade, and modernization of military equipment. Initial considerations involved two companies: the Israeli firm Aeronautics, which offered the Orbiter 1K, and the American company AeroVironment, which manufactures the Switchblade. However, in late 2023, Greece opted solely for the Switchblade, a choice influenced by a shift in funding priorities. The initial plan to procure used AAV7A1 amphibious armored vehicles from the United States was 'frozen,' with the allocated funds redirected to the loitering munitions program. Specifically, $25 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) credits, provided under the U.S. European Recapitalization Incentive Program (ERIP), were repurposed to cover part of the Switchblade procurement costs. This funding was initially available to support Greece's transition away from its BMP-1 armored vehicles of Soviet origin. Additionally, Greece received a further $30 million in FMF credits as part of U.S. assistance for Greece’s support of Ukraine. Combined, these credits amount to approximately two-thirds of the €75.2 million total cost of the loitering munitions procurement, reducing Greece’s direct financial outlay. The acquisition involves both the Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 models, which together total 592 units. Most of these loitering munitions will be allocated to Greek Special Operations and Special Forces units, with a smaller portion assigned to infantry units for operational familiarization. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 300 is a small, expendable loitering munition designed to provide platoon-sized infantry units with precision strike capabilities. This UAV assists units under enemy fire by engaging long-range targets, following a pre-programmed path, and allowing operators to redirect its course en route. It has been deployed to destroy light-armored vehicles and personnel, and it can detonate mid-flight if necessary. Utilizing a Ground Control Station (GCS) compatible with other AeroVironment UAVs, such as the Wasp, RQ-11 Raven, and RQ-20 Puma, the Switchblade 300 can be coordinated with other drones to locate and attack targets. Its forward-firing warhead minimizes collateral damage, with an option to adjust detonation height mid-flight. The system is considered a loitering munition rather than a UAV, as it is not recoverable and is controlled by a fly-by-radio frequency signal. Additionally, it has been paired with SRC Inc.’s software and counter-drone technologies, enhancing its capability to intercept hostile UAVs. The Switchblade 300 Block 20 variant extends the 300 model's operational capabilities, increasing flight time to 20 minutes and adding a panning EO/IR camera suite for continuous target identification. With a gross weight of around 8 pounds, it supports land, sea, and mobile platforms, allowing rapid deployment in under two minutes. The Block 20 also features an improved Digital Data Link (DDL) for secure, encrypted communication, reducing signal interception risks, enabling concurrent operations of multiple Switchblade systems, and supporting extended range operations through additional UAVs. The Block 20 includes a Multi-Pack Launcher (MPL), which can remotely launch several units in configurations from 2 to 20 rounds, with reloading times of under 30 seconds per round. This configuration supports base defense and facilitates 'sensor-to-shooter' operations by transmitting mission plans from other AeroVironment UAVs. The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. (Picture source: AeroVironment) The Switchblade 600 is a larger loitering munition intended for anti-armor missions, weighing 54.5 kilograms when loaded in the tube with the fire control system. It can travel up to 40 kilometers in 20 minutes, then loiter for another 20 minutes, giving it a total range of 80 kilometers. Its warhead is based on the Javelin anti-tank missile, and it operates at a speed of 185 kilometers per hour during the terminal phase of its flight. The Switchblade 600 is controlled through a tablet-based system with autonomous and manual modes, secured by encrypted data links and anti-spoofing GPS. It is also compatible with a pocket DDL module for longer-range engagements. As part of the Army's Single Multi-Mission Attack Missile development program, AeroVironment has been able to scale production to manufacture up to 6,000 Switchblade 600 units annually. This model can also be configured for a six-pack vehicle-mounted launcher or air-launch options, broadening its potential deployment scenarios. The agreement, valued at 3.47 billion euros, includes the procurement of 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters. (Picture source: US DoD) Greece’s procurement of these munitions is part of its larger ten-year defense spending strategy, which includes plans to acquire 20 F-35A Lightning II aircraft, with an option to order an additional 20 fighters, from the United States and a fourth Belharra frigate from France. The Switchblades are also intended to complement other weapons systems in Greece’s inventory, such as the Spike anti-tank missiles recently purchased from Israel, which will be stationed on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. In addition, Greece is developing its own drone and anti-drone technologies as part of a broader focus on modernizing its defense capabilities. The choice to procure Switchblade munitions directly from the United States rather than through domestic production has raised questions regarding the Greek defense industry’s capacity for developing similar technologies. While some efforts have been made to advance indigenous loitering munition projects, these remain at the initial design or early development stages. The Greek Armed Forces' reliance on foreign partners reflects current operational requirements that domestic capabilities have not yet met. This loitering munitions acquisition aligns with ongoing U.S.-Greece defense cooperation and has received approval from Greece's top foreign and defense decision-making body, the Government Council for Foreign Affairs and Defense (KYSEA). The decision situates Greece’s defense procurement within the context of its relations with NATO allies and broader strategic objectives, as well as ongoing regional tensions with Turkey over maritime boundaries, airspace, and resource rights in the Aegean Sea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-purchases-592-us-made-switchblade-300-and-600-loitering-munitions-for-special-forces	2024-10-09T00:01:53-07:00

The transmission typically operates in automatic mode but can switch to manual for specialized off-road conditions or in case of an automatic mode failure, providing versatile operational capabilities. The LTTV also boasts a theoretical range of 1,200 km, making it suitable for long-duration missions. Earlier this year, Jankel, which also manufactures the Fox RRV (Rapid Reaction Vehicle) used by the Belgian Special Operations Group, faced critical financial issues, initiating a judicial restructuring process on March 8 to resolve its financial situation. This raised concerns about the company’s ability to fulfill its 2018 commitment to the Belgian army, involving a €67 million contract for 199 light troop transport vehicles (LTTV) under the 'Wolf' designation. These vehicles are intended to replace aging Unimog models, contributing to enhanced transport and logistical capabilities within the Belgian armed forces. After securing a 2015 contract to supply the Belgian Ministry of Defense with over 100 Fox Rapid Reaction Vehicles (RRVs), Jankel obtained a second major contract to deliver a new fleet of specialized tactical vehicles under the LTTV program. Jankel’s engineers developed the LTTV to offer modular, mission-adaptable functionality through interchangeable mission modules that allow configuration changes based on operational needs (Picture source: Army Recognition) Jankel’s engineers developed the LTTV to offer modular, mission-adaptable functionality through interchangeable mission modules that allow configuration changes based on operational needs.

Psychologically, the incident demonstrates the reach and capabilities of Ukrainian military intelligence and special forces. This could lower morale within the Russian military and boost confidence among Ukrainian forces and their supporters. It reflects a shift towards asymmetrical warfare tactics, where unconventional methods are employed to target high-value assets, thereby altering the traditional dynamics of the conflict.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-baltic-fleet-minesweeper-disabled-in-ukrainian-sabotage-in-kaliningrad	2024-10-08T06:47:03-07:00	
Bundeswehr’s New Reconnaissance Vehicle Korsak Would Be Based on Piranha 6×6	The Bundeswehr is preparing to renew its fleet of reconnaissance vehicles for its military intelligence forces, with the Spähfahrzeug Next Generation project, or 'Korsak,' reportedly progressing on the Piranha 6×6 platform from General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS), as revealed by Hartpunkt. Selected over competitors including Rheinmetall’s Fuchs Evolution and KNDS’s Patria CAVS, the Piranha 6×6 outperformed its rivals during a rigorous bidding process. However, final vehicle approval will require the resolution of appeal periods followed by a parliamentary review of the '€25 million proposal.' If on schedule, the contract may be finalized by late 2024 or early 2025, marking it as a second Bundeswehr project involving the Piranha platform. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications (Picture source: GDELS) The Korsak project aims to partially replace the light, four-wheeled Fennek vehicles currently used by reconnaissance units. According to the Bundeswehr, up to 252 vehicles may be ordered, with an initial order of 92 units confirmed. The first two prototypes are anticipated by 2026, pending a swift contract conclusion. Production delivery of the remaining 90 vehicles would follow in 2027 and 2028, with an option for an additional 162 units. Though the 6×6 model of the Piranha has not been publicly unveiled, experts anticipate a modified version of the existing 8×8 platform, adjusted by one less axle to meet specifications. Compliant with Korsak project requirements, this version is expected to include amphibious capabilities, though it may reduce armored protection to STANAG 4569 Level 2, thereby optimizing mobility with a favorable power-to-weight ratio. The Piranha 6×6 features a unique engine configuration for a reconnaissance vehicle, placing the engine to the driver’s right, unlike the traditional rear placement. This design maximizes roof space for turret and sensor systems, enhancing weapon reach. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets, as showcased at Eurosatory 2024. This cannon provides variable firing modes and a rate of up to 600 rounds per minute. The initial version of the Piranha I 6×6 dates back to 1972, having been adopted by the Swiss Army and produced under license in Chile and Canada. The Canadian version is known as the AVGP and LAV I. Some Chilean Piranha I units were fitted with a 60 mm IMI HVMS (Hyper Velocity Medium Support) gun acquired in 1980, while Swiss Army models included the NM142 turret, capable of launching TOW anti-tank guided missiles. The Bundeswehr plans to equip the Korsak with a 25 mm KBA automatic cannon from Rheinmetall, integrated into a stabilized turret by Valhalla Turrets (Picture source: Swiss MoD) The latest model, Piranha V, was introduced in the early 2010s. Designed to protect against medium-caliber ballistic threats, it includes a modern electronic architecture for integrating various weapon systems, from medium-caliber automatic cannons to large-caliber fire-support guns. The Piranha V meets current mobility demands on challenging terrain, equipped with a powerful motor and independent suspension, allowing a top speed of 100 km/h and a range of 1,000 km.

(Picture source: Japanese MoD) India and Japan share growing concerns about the Chinese Navy's increasing presence in both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. These concerns are driven by China's aggressive territorial expansion, notably in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and its broader strategy to extend its influence across the Indo-Pacific region. For India, China's 'String of Pearls' strategy, which involves building partnerships and establishing naval facilities in countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Myanmar, is seen as an effort to encircle India and limit its influence in the Indian Ocean. China's increasing naval deployments, including submarines, in the Indian Ocean further fuel India's apprehensions. In response, India has been strengthening its maritime surveillance and increasing cooperation with allies, particularly Japan, to counter China's activities. Japan, similarly, faces direct threats from China, particularly concerning the disputed Senkaku Islands (known as Diaoyu in China). China’s assertive actions in the East China Sea and its growing military capabilities have led Japan to bolster its defense, particularly in its southwestern islands, and strengthen its security partnerships, notably through the Quad alliance, which includes India, Japan, the United States, and Australia. Both countries have responded to these threats by enhancing military cooperation. India and Japan recently signed a 10-year military pact that allows for greater coordination between their armed forces, particularly in naval operations. This pact is seen as a strategic move to counter Chinese assertiveness and is part of a broader effort to strengthen the Quad as a counterbalance to China in the region. The two nations regularly conduct joint naval exercises, such as the 'Malabar' exercises, to improve interoperability and readiness against potential Chinese threats. UNICORN India and Japan have recently strengthened their naval defense cooperation, focusing on key technology transfers and joint development projects. At the heart of these efforts is Japan’s decision to export the 'UNICORN' stealth antenna system to India, marking a significant step in their defense relationship. The UNICORN system, officially known as the Unified Complex Radio Antenna, integrates various communication and radar functions to enhance the stealth capabilities of naval vessels. This equipment, initially used on Japan’s Mogami-class frigates, will be installed on select Indian Navy ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-js-ariake-and-indias-ins-shakti-conduct-joint-naval-exercise-in-bay-of-bengal	2024-10-08T05:30:14-07:00

France Tests New Anti-Air Shield with Aster 30 B1NT to Strengthen Future SAMP/T-NG Defense System	On October 8, 2024, France conducted a pivotal air defense test within the Direction générale de l'armement (DGA) base in Biscarrosse. This strategic trial, part of Operation Mercure, marks the first launch of the Aster 30 B1NT missile against aerial targets simulating a complex threat scenario. The event was attended by French Minister of Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu and the General Delegate for Armaments, Emmanuel Chiva, underscoring the importance of this new generation missile for both French and Italian defense.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Aster 30 B1NT, a new-generation missile, is designed to upgrade the French-Italian SAMP/T NG air defense system and will also be used in naval defense within the PAAMS framework (Picture source: French MoD) The Aster 30 B1NT, referred to as 'new Technology,' is specifically designed to enhance the SAMP/T (Surface-to-Air Medium Range Land-based) NG ( New Generation) air defense system, a French-Italian collaboration. Additionally, it will be deployed in naval defense within the PAAMS (Principal Anti-Air Missile System) used by both nations. With this version, France aims to modernize its air defense capabilities to respond effectively not only to conventional aerial threats but also to more sophisticated ballistic missiles. During this test, targets were used to simulate a complex threat environment, demonstrating the system’s ability to react in high-stakes operational scenarios. The SAMP/T-NG marks an upgrade from the current SAMP/T, bringing enhanced interception capabilities for high-speed threats at ranges up to 150 kilometers and altitudes over 25 kilometers. Equipped with advanced radar and sensor systems, the SAMP/T-NG enables rapid detection and interception of threats, particularly hypersonic missiles, which pose specific challenges due to their high speed and maneuverability. This system is a critical component in European defense against modern missile threats. On September 23, 2024, France’s Air and Space Force announced an expedited timeline for the SAMP/T-NG’s deployment, now scheduled to begin in 2026. Developed in partnership with Italy, this advanced system reflects a joint commitment to counter evolving global security threats, including ballistic and hypersonic missiles. As part of the Eurosam consortium, defense companies MBDA and Thales played key roles in the project, supported by a €400 million contract awarded by the DGA in 2015 to develop the Aster 30 B1NT under the coordination of the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR). Alongside this new missile, the contract also included an upgrade to the SAMP/T system to improve its capabilities against ballistic missiles, aligning with NATO’s ballistic missile defense program. The SAMP/T-NG marks an upgrade from the current SAMP/T, bringing enhanced interception capabilities for high-speed threats at ranges up to 150 kilometers and altitudes over 25 kilometers (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) The Aster missile family comprises two versions: the Aster 15, with a range of up to 30 kilometers for short and medium distances, and the Aster 30, capable of reaching targets over 100 kilometers away for short and long-range engagements. These missiles are now integral to France's air defense. Earlier this year, the French Navy demonstrated the Aster’s efficacy by intercepting Houthi drones and ballistic missiles in the Red Sea. In March, the air-defense frigate Alsace successfully intercepted three Houthi ballistic missiles mid-flight, marking a first for the Aster 30 system. The Alsace thus took over the role from the Languedoc in Operation Aspides, protecting maritime traffic. The Aster 30 Block 1NT missile is equipped with a radar seeker operating in the Ka band, allowing it to focus energy into a narrower beam than its predecessor, the Block 1, which uses the Ku band. This enhancement grants the missile increased long-range detection capabilities and the ability to intercept much faster targets, particularly longer-range ballistic missiles. Additionally, the Ka band seeker provides superior angular precision, enabling more accurate tracking of target movements and significantly increasing the probability of target destruction through direct impact. This Aster 30 B1NT test in Biscarrosse represents a milestone in European defense, solidifying France and Italy’s military cooperation under the Eurosam project. The joint program not only aims to shield military forces from increasingly sophisticated threats but also seeks to fortify European territory with a solution compatible with NATO’s integrated air and missile defense systems. Enabling European forces to respond to complex, multi-layered attacks, this new generation of missiles is set to become a cornerstone of European anti-air capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-tests-new-anti-air-shield-with-aster-30-b1nt-to-strengthen-future-samp-t-ng-defense-system	2024-10-08T04:44:08-07:00	
South Korea Commissions Cheongwang Its Most Modern Laser System to Counter Aerial Threats	The Republic of Korea Armed Forces has marked a significant advancement in air defense capabilities with the official announcement of the commissioning of the 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system for military use, which was officially integrated into active service on October 4 during the KADEX 2024 exhibition in South Korea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hanwha displays its 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system at the Defense Exhibition KADEX 2024. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Developed as a state-of-the-art anti-aircraft solution, the 'Cheongwang' system uses high-energy lasers to intercept a variety of aerial targets, including drones, missiles, and potentially other airborne threats. By employing directed energy rather than conventional munitions, the system offers a rapid, precise, and cost-effective means of neutralizing targets. With the increasing prevalence of unmanned systems and low-cost drones in global military engagements, the integration of such systems is becoming essential for maintaining robust air defenses. Hanwha Aerospace, South Korea’s leading defense and aerospace company, played a pivotal role in the unveiling and presentation of this system. Alongside the 'Cheongwang,' Hanwha Aerospace introduced an array of mobile and fixed high-energy laser solutions at KADEX 2024. These systems aim to provide adaptable and responsive defense options, aligning with the Republic of Korea Armed Forces' broader objective to achieve a multi-layered air defense network. The commissioning of the 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system is critically important for South Korea as it enhances the country's defense capabilities against emerging threats from North Korea. The HEL system provides a sophisticated means to detect, track, and neutralize aerial threats such as drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and potentially even artillery shells or low-flying missiles. North Korea has been increasingly investing in drone technology and advanced missile systems, which pose significant challenges to South Korea's security. By deploying the 'Cheongwang' system, South Korea can effectively counter these threats with precision and speed, strengthening its defensive posture and deterrence capabilities. Moreover, the high-energy laser system offers a cost-effective and efficient solution compared to traditional missile defense systems. Laser weapons have a virtually unlimited magazine, as they rely on electricity rather than physical ammunition, allowing for continuous operation against multiple incoming targets. This is particularly important in scenarios where North Korea might employ swarm tactics or saturation attacks to overwhelm conventional defenses. The 'Cheongwang' system's ability to engage numerous threats rapidly reduces the risk of successful attacks on South Korean territory and minimizes potential damage and casualties. In essence, the deployment of the HEL system is a strategic move to address the evolving nature of threats from North Korea, ensuring that South Korea remains resilient and prepared in the face of regional security challenges. The development of the 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system began as part of South Korea's efforts to bolster its defense capabilities against evolving aerial threats.

The Cheongwang HEL system represents a significant technological advancement in South Korea's defense arsenal, addressing the need for rapid and effective responses to modern warfare challenges posed by adversaries like North Korea. In terms of operational capability, the 'Cheongwang' high-energy laser is engineered for both precision and efficiency. Utilizing high-frequency laser beams, it delivers a rapid response against fast-moving threats with minimal collateral impact. The decision to opt for laser technology enables the system to operate effectively even in urban or high-density areas, where traditional interception methods might pose additional risks. The Block-I Cheongwang is a container-sized, land-based laser weapon system developed by South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) since 2019, with a budget of $63 million. Measuring 9 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 3 meters high (29.5 x 9.8 x 9.8 feet), it utilizes a 20 kW optical fiber laser capable of generating approximately 700°C heat during 10-20 second impulses. The system has an effective range of up to 3 kilometers and includes an integrated radar mast for target detection and tracking. Designed to counter small to mid-sized drones, multicopters, and UAVs, it operates silently and invisibly, requiring only electricity without the need for separate ammunition. Each shot costs about $1.45 (2,000 Won), making it a cost-effective solution for air defense. Deployment is scheduled to begin in 2024, with future versions potentially capable of neutralizing larger targets like aircraft and ballistic missiles. The 'Cheongwang' (Sky Light) high-energy laser (HEL) system is a cutting-edge defense technology commissioned by South Korea to enhance its capability against aerial threats, particularly drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Unlike traditional weapons, it does not utilize a conventional warhead; instead, it employs a powerful laser beam as its means of interception. The laser's high-energy output allows it to effectively disable or destroy the electronic components of incoming targets, neutralizing them without the need for explosive force. This directed-energy approach provides a rapid response to threats and reduces the risk of collateral damage. In terms of range and guidance, the Cheongwang HEL system is equipped with advanced sensors and tracking systems that detect and monitor aerial targets at significant distances. While specific range details are classified, high-energy laser systems typically engage targets within several kilometers. The system uses precise targeting algorithms to focus the laser beam on critical parts of the threat, such as guidance systems or propulsion units. The guidance system continuously adjusts for target movement and atmospheric conditions, ensuring high accuracy and effectiveness. This combination of advanced detection, tracking, and directed-energy interception makes the Cheongwang HEL a vital asset in countering modern aerial threats posed by adversaries like North Korea.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-commissions-cheongwang-its-most-modern-laser-system-to-counter-aerial-threats	2024-10-08T03:40:43-07:00	
Royal New Zealand Navy ship grounds off Samoa Coast	According to information published by the New Zealand Ministry of Defence on October 8, 2024, a Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) ship, HMNZS Manawanui, ran aground near the southern coast of Upolu, Samoa, while conducting a reef survey. The grounding incident has triggered a comprehensive rescue and environmental response, with the safety of all personnel successfully ensured.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The multi-role offshore support vessel HMNZS Manawanui sailed in formation alongside other ships during Exercise RIMPAC 2020. (Picture source: Dvids) The 75 crew members and passengers aboard the vessel evacuated safely using life rafts and sea boats. They were supported by several vessels that responded to the incident and are currently receiving assistance in Samoa. The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) worked in close coordination with Maritime New Zealand’s Rescue Coordination Centre (RCCNZ) to manage rescue efforts. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-8A Poseidon aircraft was deployed to assist in the operation. HMNZS Manawanui sank in waters approximately 30 meters deep. RNZN divers began assessing the wreck at first light the following day to evaluate environmental impacts and determine the necessary clean-up measures. A light oil sheen was observed on the water, though it is being naturally dispersed by wind and waves. The site of the sunken ship has since been declared a prohibited area by Samoan authorities. The primary cause of the grounding remains unclear, with investigations ongoing. Initial reports suggest challenging conditions, such as strong currents and winds, may have contributed to the ship's inability to recover after striking the reef. The incident highlights vulnerabilities in RNZN fleet readiness, as the loss of Manawanui—a vital hydrographic and dive-support vessel—leaves the fleet with only eight operational ships, further straining a force already dealing with maintenance and crew shortages. A formal Court of Inquiry is being established to investigate the incident in detail, aiming to identify any procedural or technical failures that contributed to the accident. New Zealand The recent sinking of HMNZS Manawanui intersects with New Zealand's evolving geopolitical environment, especially as the country navigates a complex relationship with China and the broader Indo-Pacific security landscape. New Zealand has historically balanced its economic reliance on China with its security relationships, primarily with Western allies like Australia and the United States. However, rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, particularly concerning China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea and broader regional influence, are pressuring New Zealand to re-evaluate its foreign and defense policies. The loss of Manawanui not only weakens New Zealand’s naval capabilities but also occurs at a time when the country is increasingly involved in regional security frameworks, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) and discussions around joining Pillar II of AUKUS. This signals a potential shift toward deeper defense cooperation with Western allies, which may strain its relationship with China—a critical trading partner. New Zealand has sought to diversify its trade relationships to reduce its dependency on China, reflecting the need for strategic flexibility amid growing U.S.-China rivalry.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-new-zealand-navy-ship-grounds-off-samoa-coast	2024-10-08T03:10:27-07:00

The anti-drone cages, initially perceived as improvised defenses, have become standard protective measures across military forces worldwide, offering a significant advantage by deflecting drone strikes and mitigating potential damage from FPV drone attacks. For China, incorporating these defenses on the Type 15 signals a strategic shift in addressing emerging threats. The tank’s design—lightweight and mobile, suitable for high altitudes and dense forests—makes it particularly effective in diverse terrains, bolstering the Chinese army’s resilience against aerial attacks. Meanwhile, India faces growing challenges in defending its positions along the China-Pakistan border, especially in the elevated regions of Kashmir. Tensions with China in these mountainous areas prompt New Delhi to reassess its strategies and bolster its military capabilities against an increasingly assertive Chinese force. This need for strategic modernization is mirrored by other nations, such as Japan, where China’s advancing military capabilities necessitate strengthened deterrence measures.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-adapts-to-new-battlefield-threats-by-equipping-type-15-tanks-with-anti-drone-cages	2024-10-08T01:49:38-07:00

This year’s festival saw participation from several nations, including China, which sent its Type 54A frigate CNS Xuchang. The arrival of the Neustrashimy, a Baltic Fleet frigate, and the Chinese warships is seen by some as a signal of deepening naval cooperation among BRICS nations. However, the participation of the Russian warship has stirred diplomatic controversy, particularly in light of Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine. Critics, including the Ukrainian Association of South Africa, expressed concerns that such invitations implicitly support Russia’s military actions. BRICS Naval cooperation within the BRICS group, particularly between China, Russia, and South Africa, has grown significantly in recent years, reflecting a broader trend of military collaboration among BRICS nations. This cooperation is primarily focused on joint naval exercises, enhancing maritime security, and extending influence across key strategic waterways. For example, China and Russia have regularly conducted joint naval drills, which have expanded in scale. These exercises are not just limited to bilateral engagements but often include other BRICS members like South Africa. One notable instance is the Mosi series of naval exercises, where China, Russia, and South Africa conduct operations aimed at improving maritime security and operational interoperability. The latest iteration occurred off South Africa's coast. Additionally, China and Russia’s naval engagements extend to collaborations with non-BRICS nations like Iran, conducting large-scale drills in the Gulf of Oman. These exercises showcase their growing ability to project power across the Indian Ocean, particularly in regions critical to global shipping routes. The focus of these drills has often been on anti-piracy operations, search and rescue missions, and broader maritime security.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-navys-frigate-neustrashimy-joins-south-african-navy-festival	2024-10-07T03:49:49-07:00	
US Army's 34-year-old unique ARES close air support aircraft still active for classified tests	On October 6, 2024, TaskForce23 observed a new flight of the unique Scaled Composites ARES (Agile Responsive Effective Support) aircraft near the Mojave Air and Space Port. This Close Air Support (CAS) concept demonstrator continues to serve as a research test bed for the US Army. Remarkably, it has done so for 34 years since its initial flight on February 19, 1990. The ARES maintains several features from its original design, including metallic leading edges, fairings, and a distinct patch of coating on the right tail.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link 34 years since its initial flight, the mysterious ARES maintains several features from its original design, including metallic leading edges, fairings, and a distinct patch of coating on the right tail. (Picture source: TaskForce23) The ARES (Agile Responsive Effective Support) was developed in response to a US Army request in the early 1980s for a Low Cost Battlefield Attack Aircraft (LCBAA), designed to fulfill roles requiring low-altitude, anti-tank battlefield support with long endurance and the ability to operate outside improved airfield environments. US Army aviators Jim Kreutz and Milo Burroughs initiated a study in 1981 to develop an aircraft with high maneuverability at low altitudes and stall resistance. Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites joined this effort, resulting in the development of the ARES under Model No. 151. The aircraft has a canard configuration, with a foreplane that provides pitch control. This foreplane is designed to stall before the main wings, enhancing safety during low-altitude operations. Although initially planned for a turboprop engine, the design was updated to use a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D-5 turbofan engine, producing 13.12 kN of thrust. This change addressed potential issues with debris ingestion during takeoffs and landings on unimproved surfaces. One notable feature of the ARES is its asymmetrical design. It mounts a GAU-12/U Equalizer 25 mm rotary cannon on the right side of the nose, with the engine intake located on the left. This layout minimizes the impact of the cannon's recoil on performance and prevents exhaust gases from entering the engine intake. The cannon is positioned in a concave recess beneath the cockpit to trap exhaust gases and balance recoil forces during firing. One notable feature of the ARES is its asymmetrical design, as this aircraft mounts a GAU-12/U Equalizer 25 mm rotary cannon on the right side of the nose, with the engine intake located on the left. (Picture source: Flickr/Corporate Flight Management) First flown on February 19, 1990, by Scaled Composites test pilot Doug Shane, the ARES has completed over 430 flight hours with the tail number/aircraft registration number N151SC. In November 1991, the ARES tested the GAU-12 Equalizer five-barrel 25 mm Gatling-type rotary cannon under a US Air Force contract, validating its Close Air Support (CAS) capabilities. This testing led to the cannon’s integration into various aircraft, such as the AC-130U Spooky gunship, the AV-8 Harrier II ground attack aircraft, and the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter. Despite its successful demonstrations, the ARES remained a private project as the military did not adopt it for operational use. However, it continues to function as a research test bed. After being stored in December 2000 at the Mojave Spaceport, the aircraft returned to flight on March 7, 2008, following Scaled Composites' acquisition by Northrop Grumman. The ARES remains active as a research test bed, providing services in conceptual design, aerodynamic analysis, structural design, systems integration, and experimental flight testing. In 2020, the ARES was observed flying alongside its successors, the Model 401 'Son of Ares' jets, over the Mojave Desert, showcasing a reflective metallic-like surface coating. This aligns with previous tests involving reflective coatings, possibly related to research on aircraft signatures against sensor systems such as infrared search and track technologies. The Proteus testbed platform by Scaled Composites has also conducted similar flights, equipped with large pods believed to house electro-optical systems.

Observations of aircraft, such as F-15s equipped with infrared spectrum data-collection test pods, suggest research into infrared search and track systems or low-power laser technologies. Additionally, the ARES has also played the role of a fictional German jet, the ME-263, in the film 'Aces: Iron Eagle III' released in 1992. Specifications for the ARES include a length of 8.97 meters, a wingspan of 10.67 meters, and a height of 2.99 meters. Its wing area is 17.5 square meters, with an empty weight of 1,308 kilograms and a maximum takeoff weight of 2,767 kilograms. Equipped with a single Pratt &amp; Whitney JT15D turbofan engine, the ARES reaches a maximum speed of 750 kilometers per hour at 7,620 meters and has a service ceiling of 10,668 meters. Its combat range is 1,110 kilometers, with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.43 at maximum weight. The ARES is capable of carrying a 25 mm GAU-12/U Gatling cannon and has provisions for air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder or AIM-92 Stinger, as well as unguided rockets and other air-to-ground weapons. Its design emphasizes low-altitude performance and the ability to operate from unimproved airfields, meeting the goals of the original LCBAA program. The aircraft features twin boom-mounted vertical fins for directional stability and uses a canard for pitch control. The structure is composed primarily of fiberglass composite over a foam core, a fabrication technique developed by Scaled Composites. The flight controls are mechanical, and the engine includes a backup mechanical fuel control to maintain control in the event of electrical system failure.

Armenia Eyes South Korea's K2 Main Battle Tank Adapted for Mountainous Terrain	According to an article by the South Korean media outlet Chosun Biz, dated October 4, 2024, Armenian Defense Minister Suren Papikyan visited South Korea in September 2024 to explore the possibility of acquiring K2 Black Panther main battle tanks developed by Hyundai Rotem. This visit also allowed the Armenian minister to attend the 2024 High-Level Meeting on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence (REAIM), organized by South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 9 and 10.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: South Korea MoD) According to the Armenian Military Portal, Papikyan also used this visit to initiate discussions on the supply of South Korean weapons, with a particular interest in the K2 tank. Furthermore, the Armenian media outlet Caliban reports that Armenian Security Council Secretary Armen Grigoryan also traveled to South Korea on September 6 to hold several meetings focused on weapons procurement issues. The K2 main battle tank, currently used by the South Korean Army, features a semi-active pneumatic suspension system, an advanced technology that is especially well-suited to mountainous terrains. In Armenia, where nearly 86% of the territory is mountainous, this capability could provide a significant strategic advantage by enhancing the mobility and precision of troops in combat. Additionally, the tank is equipped with a sensor that automatically adjusts the suspension based on the terrain, further improving accuracy and crew comfort. Currently, according to Military Balance 2024, Armenia’s armored fleet comprises older models, including approximately 109 main battle tanks: 3 T-54s, 5 T-55s, around 100 T-72A/Bs, and 1 T-90A, all inherited from the Soviet era and modernized by Russia. However, it is important to note that these figures may be subject to caution due to losses sustained in the fighting since 2020 in Nagorno-Karabakh. Although these tanks remain in service, the acquisition of the K2 would enable Armenia to acquire state-of-the-art equipment to address persistent tensions with Azerbaijan, a neighboring country with which it has experienced repeated conflicts during the 2020s. In Europe, the K2 tank is already being deployed in Poland, where Hyundai Rotem has become a strategic defense partner. In August 2022, Poland reportedly signed a contract for the delivery of 180 K2 tanks, of which 46 have already been delivered this year, and a new agreement to supply an additional 180 units is under discussion. Romania is also reportedly considering the acquisition of this tank as part of a military modernization program. In competition with the German Leopard 2A8, the K2 has a price advantage, estimated at 26.2 billion won, compared to approximately 60 billion won for the Leopard 2A8, according to available estimates. South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: South Korea MoD) The K2 Black Panther tank was developed in South Korea to achieve self-sufficiency in defense production, replacing the aging M48 Patton tanks. Launched in 1995, this project aimed to create a tank suitable for fast, network-centric maneuver warfare. Hyundai Rotem spearheaded its development, and the tank officially entered service with the South Korean Army (ROKA) in 2014 after extensive testing and prototyping phases. To date, approximately 410 units have been produced across multiple production batches, securing the K2’s place in South Korea’s national defense framework. The K2 is armed with a 120mm 55-caliber smoothbore gun, capable of firing various munitions, including APFSDS rounds and HEAT shells. Thanks to its autoloading system, it can achieve a firing rate of 10 rounds per minute, with a total capacity of 40 rounds. It is also equipped with a Korean-developed munition, the KSTAM (Korean Smart Top-Attack Munition), designed for top-attack strikes against targets within a range of 2 to 8 kilometers. Secondary armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun and a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, enhancing its capabilities against both armored and soft targets. Powered by a water-cooled 12-cylinder diesel engine generating 1,500 horsepower, the K2 can reach a maximum speed of 70 km/h on roads and 50 km/h on rough terrain. It has an operational range of approximately 450 kilometers and can accelerate from 0 to 32 km/h in 7 to 9 seconds, depending on the engine model. Its advanced in-arm suspension unit (ISU) allows it to adjust its height and posture, improving its handling over various terrains and expanding its gun elevation range. The K2’s passive protection includes composite armor made of MIL-12560H steel and silicon carbide ceramic plates, supplemented by modular Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) and Non-Explosive Reactive Armor (NERA) packages. Additionally, the tank is equipped with an overpressure system to defend against chemical and biological threats, an automatic fire suppression system, and neutron shielding to protect the crew from radiation exposure. For active defense, the K2 is equipped with radar and laser warning receivers that detect threats such as anti-tank guided missiles. Upon detection, it can release multispectral smoke grenades, which obscure its position from enemy targeting systems. Under the K2 Product Improvement Program (PIP), future upgrades are planned, including a hard-kill active protection system capable of intercepting incoming projectiles before impact. Primarily operated by the South Korean Army, the K2 has also been acquired or adapted by countries such as Poland and Türkiye. Variants such as the K2GF, customized to Polish military specifications, and the Altay, developed for Türkiye with South Korean technological support, demonstrate this international expansion. Other proposed models, like the K2EX for global export, the K2ME for the Middle East, and the K2NO for Norway, offer specific modifications to meet regional conditions and operational requirements. South Korean K2 Black Panther Main Battle Tank (Picture source: Army Recognition) According to Military Balance 2024, Armenia has significantly increased its defense budget, allocating USD 1.28 billion for 2023, marking a 46% rise from the previous year. This budget is expected to reach approximately USD 1.4 billion in 2024. Historically dependent on Russia for its military equipment, Armenia is now diversifying its suppliers, partly due to Moscow’s inability to fulfill deliveries agreed upon in 2021, as Russia has redirected resources to meet domestic needs driven by the conflict in Ukraine. To address this shortfall, Armenia has signed several major contracts with India, including the purchase of 90 ATAGS 155mm towed howitzers, an undisclosed number of Pinaka multiple-launch rocket systems, and Akash air defense systems. Armenia is also transitioning to Western defense standards, incorporating NATO-standard artillery, adopting Western military training methods, and embracing advanced command-and-control structures. As part of this shift, Defense Minister Suren Papikyan attended the Paris Air Show in June 2023, signaling Armenia’s growing interest in sourcing defense equipment from the West. France, in particular, has expressed openness to arms sales to Armenia. Before the escalation of hostilities with Azerbaijan in 2023, Armenia had already begun distancing itself from Russia as its primary security guarantor. This shift became evident in 2022 when Moscow declined to intervene during a significant border clash between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In response, Yerevan invited an EU monitoring mission while rejecting a similar proposal from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). The EU Mission in Armenia currently consists of 103 civilian personnel deployed until January 2025, with a possible extension. Furthermore, Armenia has effectively frozen its participation in CSTO activities, underscoring its move away from Russian-led security arrangements.

This agreement covers onshore and offshore exploration blocks in Somalia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Turkish President Erdogan salutes the departure of the research ship Oruc Reis in Istanbul. (Picture source: Turkish presidency) Accompanying this vessel are two G-class frigates, TCG Gediz and TCG Gokova, which are providing vital naval protection throughout the mission. These frigates, modernized versions of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class, have been extensively upgraded with advanced systems, including the GENESIS combat management system, to enhance their operational capabilities in complex maritime environments. This deployment underscores Turkey's strategic interests in the Horn of Africa, where it has secured exploration rights in a 15,000-square-kilometer maritime zone off Somalia. The mission, expected to last around seven months, will see the Oruc Reis carrying out 3D seismic surveys in multiple license areas. The collected data will be critical in identifying potential drilling sites for future extraction operations. The presence of Turkish naval forces highlights Ankara’s commitment to safeguarding its energy interests, particularly in regions where security risks, such as piracy or regional conflicts, remain high. This operation not only supports Turkey's expanding influence in Africa but also demonstrates the country's broader ambitions to secure energy resources beyond the Mediterranean, where the Oruc Reis previously conducted controversial explorations. Background The Oruc Reis research vessel has been at the center of several contentious explorations, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey's energy ambitions have brought it into direct conflict with neighboring countries such as Greece and Cyprus. The disputes largely stem from overlapping claims to Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) in the resource-rich waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's controversial exploration missions began in 2020, when the Oruc Reis was deployed in areas around the Greek island of Kastellorizo, a region claimed by both Greece and Turkey under competing interpretations of maritime boundaries. Turkey argues that islands should not have full EEZs, a stance that diverges from the positions held by Greece and Cyprus, which rely on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Turkey is not a signatory to UNCLOS and insists on a more flexible interpretation of maritime boundaries to secure its interests in the region These operations escalated tensions between Turkey and Greece, prompting responses such as naval deployments, diplomatic protests, and calls for EU sanctions against Turkey. Several near-miss military encounters occurred during this period, including confrontations between Turkish and Greek naval vessels. The situation became so heated that NATO intervened to establish a deconfliction mechanism to prevent accidental clashes between the two NATO allies​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/turkish-president-sends-off-oruc-reis-seismic-research-ship-on-mission-to-somalia	2024-10-07T02:22:05-07:00

Leidos Successfully Tests Launch of Black Arrow Low-Cost Small Cruise Missile from AC-130J Ghostrider Gunship	On October 3, 2024, Leidos, an American company specializing in defense and advanced technology, unveiled the 'Black Arrow,' a small cruise missile designed to meet the growing needs for flexibility and versatility on the battlefield. Designed for both kinetic and non-kinetic missions, this new system stands out for its low cost and adaptability, offering a wide range of military applications. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Leidos Black Arrow Low-Cost Small Cruise Missile (Picture source: Leidos) Launched in 2021, this program builds on Leidos' experience with small munitions such as the GBU-69, used on AC-130 aircraft, as well as the X-61 Gremlins program developed in partnership with the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA). This project allowed Leidos to test an air vehicle capable of being launched from a C-130 and then recovered mid-flight, demonstrating its expertise in integrating innovative technologies on existing platforms. In 2022, Leidos signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) to advance the development of the Small Cruise Missile (SCM). The SCM is designed to be an economical, modular platform suited to the missions of various branches of the armed forces, with an architecture that facilitates future updates and responds to both kinetic and non-kinetic objectives. According to Leidos, this flexibility allows for a variety of launch options, including ramps, pallets, or conventional systems, depending on tactical needs. As part of its development, the Black Arrow recently completed a series of separation and captive-carry tests aboard an AC-130J Ghostrider, a support aircraft renowned for its firepower. These tests confirmed the weapon’s ability to safely detach from its launcher, as well as the reliability of its trajectory, flight software, navigation, and safety systems. These favorable results pave the way for guided flight tests scheduled for this fall, which will be critical for validating the Black Arrow's flight behavior under real conditions and finalizing necessary technical adjustments before its deployment. The competitive landscape also plays a role in the development of this missile, as other companies, such as Anduril Industries, are also working on low-cost, large-scale cruise missile solutions. This dynamic underscores the importance for Leidos to offer innovative, competitive solutions by integrating components from diverse sources to maintain its leading position in the defense industry. The growing popularity of munitions launched from transport aircraft, such as the AGM-158 JASSM and the Rapid Dragon system, also highlights the strategic interest in this launch type, an approach that could transform the projection capabilities of the U.S. Air Force. Indeed, projection capabilities are radically transformed by the introduction of small cruise missiles like the Black Arrow. Traditionally, missile strikes relied on specialized fighter aircraft, limited in number and range. However, with systems like the Black Arrow, transport aircraft can now serve as launch platforms using ramps or pallets. This innovation allows transport aircraft, such as the C-130 and C-17, to be converted into offensive platforms, significantly increasing the number of military vehicles capable of carrying out precision strikes. Adding this capability provides valuable tactical flexibility. Unlike fighter jets, often too visible in heavily monitored environments, transport aircraft can discreetly deploy missiles in high-tension areas. This gives military forces greater autonomy to strike remote targets quickly, even in the absence of forward bases. This flexibility is particularly strategic for close support missions or operations where surprise and speed are essential. Finally, this approach creates uncertainty for the adversary, who must now consider the possibility that transport aircraft may also be equipped for missile strikes. This new dynamic complicates enemy defense strategies, as it forces opposing forces to rethink their targeting priorities, knowing that an apparently harmless transport aircraft can also carry formidable strike capabilities. Consequently, small cruise missiles like the Black Arrow not only redefine military logistics but also the strategic projection of forces in contested environments, while optimizing engagement costs and flexibility. However, some analysts believe that, in the event of a major conflict, transport aircraft could be primarily mobilized for logistics missions, limiting their use for missile strikes. Mark Miller, Leidos’ Vice President of Missile and Aviation Solutions, highlighted that the rapid development of the Black Arrow benefited from the company’s experience with previous projects, such as the GBU-69 and the DARPA X-61 Gremlins program. These projects illustrate Leidos’ commitment to innovative initiatives, with a particular focus on agility and operational performance. With the Black Arrow, Leidos offers a small, versatile cruise missile designed to meet the modern requirements of the armed forces. By focusing on technological innovation and an open architecture, Leidos continues to enhance military capabilities by providing rapidly deployable solutions suited to various missions. If guided flight tests proceed as planned, the Black Arrow could become a strategic tool of choice, providing the military with enhanced operational flexibility and optimal efficiency in the coming years.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/leidos-successfully-tests-launch-of-black-arrow-low-cost-small-cruise-missile-from-ac-130j-ghostrider-gunship	2024-10-07T01:11:22-07:00

His Majesty’s Canadian Ships (HMCS) Shawinigan and Charlottetown tracked a Russian submarine and several surface vessels across different maritime zones.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Charlottetown and Russian Improved Kilo-class submarine. (Picture source: Canadian DoD) The HMCS Charlottetown (FFH 339) is one of twelve Halifax-class frigates designed for multi-role operations, particularly excelling in anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Technically, this frigate is equipped with advanced sonar systems and weapons that are critical for tracking submarines like the Russian Improved Kilo-class (Project 636.3). The Charlottetown utilizes the SQS-510 Hull-mounted sonar and SQR-501 CANTASS (Canadian Towed Array Sonar System), both of which allow for long-range passive detection of underwater threats. The ship also deploys the AN/SQR-19 towed array sonar, enhancing its capability to detect low-frequency noise emitted by submarines. Supporting these systems is the RUM-139 VL ASROC (Anti-Submarine Rocket) system, which delivers a lightweight torpedo via rocket to a target submarine's location, providing immediate engagement capabilities. The ship can also engage with Mk 46 torpedoes, fired from its twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo launchers. A critical advantage is the CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, which operates off the frigate's deck, extending its ASW range through the deployment of sonobuoys and its own dipping sonar. This combination makes the Charlottetown a formidable opponent in underwater tracking. On the other hand, the Improved Kilo-class submarine (Project 636.3) is among Russia’s most advanced non-nuclear submarines, known for its ultra-quiet operation, especially in shallow or coastal waters. This submarine’s stealth characteristics are enhanced by its MGK-400EM sonar suite and low-noise propellers. Equipped with six 533mm torpedo tubes, it can launch both standard torpedoes and Kalibr cruise missiles, giving it significant strike capabilities. The Kilo-class is designed for multiple mission profiles, including anti-shipping and intelligence-gathering, making it a considerable challenge for ASW forces. Despite the submarine's advanced quieting technologies, the Charlottetown’s towed array sonar and airborne ASW systems allow for a higher chance of detection, even when the Kilo-class is operating in stealth mode. The Charlottetown's ability to coordinate with other NATO assets, including satellite and maritime patrol aircraft, further enhances its operational effectiveness in tracking these submarines across vast distances. The frigate’s command and control systems integrate seamlessly with NATO’s maritime networks, allowing for real-time data sharing and enhancing situational awareness across the task force.

(Picture source: US DoD) The company, which has over 30 years of experience manufacturing submarine propulsors, expressed its commitment to delivering advanced propulsion systems to the Navy. Brent Butcher, vice president and general manager of Weapon Systems at BAE Systems, highlighted the company's expertise in producing complex, heavy structures for the submarine fleet. He emphasized BAE Systems' ongoing dedication to providing reliable and high-quality submarine components to meet U.S. Navy shipbuilding needs. BAE Systems will produce these critical submarine components at its Submarine Center of Excellence in Louisville, Kentucky, where it has already delivered 33 forward assemblies for the Virginia-class program. The company’s Minneapolis facility will continue to provide expert engineering and business support. In addition to its work on the Virginia-class submarines, BAE Systems is contributing to the construction of the Columbia-class submarine program by building a heavy propulsor structure at its Louisville facility. The same site is also responsible for producing Virginia Payload Module launch tubes, allowing Virginia-class submarines to deploy Tomahawk missiles and other future payloads. About the propulsors The propulsors used in the Virginia-class submarines are a key component of their advanced stealth capabilities. Unlike traditional submarines that utilize open-bladed propellers, Virginia-class submarines are equipped with pump-jet propulsors. This modern propulsion system minimizes noise by reducing cavitation, the phenomenon where vapor bubbles form and collapse due to rapid changes in pressure around the blades of traditional propellers. These pump-jet systems are quieter because they operate with a ducted fan inside a nozzle, which shields the blades from direct contact with the water, preventing the loud popping sounds caused by cavitation. This makes the Virginia-class more effective in covert operations and in environments requiring stealth, both in deep-ocean and littoral (coastal) areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/bae-systems-secures-us-navy-contract-for-virginia-class-submarine-propulsors	2024-10-04T02:43:20-07:00

The LOA2 recommendations emphasize the need for heavier armored vehicles for the Army to replace the current fleet of MOWAG Piranha armored personnel carriers by 2030, as well as improvements in coastal radar surveillance and the replacement of three older vessels in the Irish Navy’s fleet. The government is also in the process of replacing two ex-UK Royal Navy offshore patrol vessels with decommissioned inshore patrol vessels from the Royal New Zealand Navy. Personnel support remains a key priority, with €329 million allocated for Defence Forces veterans' pensions and their dependents. There is also €6 million set aside for the Tribunal of Inquiry established to investigate allegations of sexual abuse and bullying within the Defence Forces. The inquiry, which stems from the Independent Review Group’s report, will continue its work through 2025 with this funding.

(Picture source: Irish MoD) The budget also provides for the recruitment of civilian specialists to address staffing shortages, particularly within the Naval Service. A total of €6 million is allocated for civilian recruitment and the use of external expertise and services. Other defense priorities include the regeneration of the Reserve Defence Force, along with additional funding for Civil Defence recruitment, which will focus on appointing Assistant Civil Defence Officers and Health and Safety Officers. While the increased budget represents a financial commitment to defense, Ireland’s overall defense spending remains low compared to other EU countries when measured as a percentage of GDP. Sinn Féin’s defense spokesperson, Matt Carthy, raised concerns about the government’s ability to achieve its recruitment targets, describing the planned increase of 400 personnel as unlikely given the ongoing trend of personnel leaving the Defence Forces. The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (Raco) expressed cautious optimism regarding the increased funding but emphasized that retaining existing personnel remains critical. According to Raco, improvements to working conditions and pension arrangements, as well as the application of the working time directive to the Defence Forces, will be essential for stabilizing recruitment and retention efforts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/irish-air-force-to-receive-new-airbus-c295w-transport-aircraft-under-irelands-largest-ever-defense-budget	2024-10-04T01:03:58-07:00

Ukraine reveals new towed Bohdana-B 155mm howitzer to meet high demand for artillery systems	On October 4, 2024, Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defense, Dmytro Klimenkov, presented for the first time a towed version of the 2S22 Bohdana self-propelled howitzer, mounted on the carriage of a Soviet 152mm 2A36 Giatsint-B howitzer. This version lacks certain features of the self-propelled model, such as a protective shield, but includes modifications to the artillery guidance system. The presentation occurred during a Ministry of Defense event, where new Ukrainian-made weapons, tested in combat, were showcased to foreign partners. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Bohdana-B lacks certain features of the self-propelled model, such as a protective shield, but includes modifications to the artillery guidance system. (Picture source: Ukrainian MoD) The presentation also featured the Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system, several armored vehicles, several unmanned systems including ground-based kamikaze drones and demining machines. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were highlighted, ranging from small FPV drones to large attack UAVs capable of deep operations in enemy territory. Klimenkov emphasized the importance of foreign investment in Ukraine’s defense sector, noting that these developments had been tested in battle and further refined for operational use. During discussions between the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and foreign representatives, cooperation in defense was a central theme. Foreign partners expressed interest in Ukrainian defense capabilities, and plans were discussed for joint projects to strengthen Ukraine’s defense industry. Klimenkov highlighted Ukraine’s desire to collaborate with international arms manufacturers and investors to enhance its defense capabilities, focusing on the systems demonstrated. On August 2, 2024, Army Recognition reported that Ukraine was developing a 155mm towed artillery system, sometimes referred to as the Bohdana-B, using the artillery unit from the 2S22 Bohdana mounted on Soviet-era howitzer carriages. The aim behind this development is to provide a simpler, less expensive alternative to self-propelled systems. The towed Bohdana is designed to supplement Ukraine’s artillery capabilities, offering a more easily producible option amid a significant demand for artillery systems. The Bohdana 4.0, now mounted on a Czech Tatra 158 Phoenix 8x8 chassis, retains the 155mm NATO-caliber gun and includes survivability enhancements. (Picture source: Ukrainian 32nd Separate Artillery Brigade) The Ukrainian defense industry has ramped up the production of artillery systems in response to battlefield needs. Ukraine currently produces between 15 and 20 Bohdana self-propelled artillery units per month on various chassis. However, the demand for artillery remains high, partly due to losses and wear during the ongoing conflict. The decision to develop a towed version of the Bohdana reflects the need for simpler, more cost-effective solutions that can be produced quickly to meet Ukraine’s defense requirements. The towed version offers certain advantages, such as reduced production costs and increased reliability, despite lacking the mobility and protection of self-propelled systems. The 2A36 Giatsint-B carriage was identified as the most suitable platform for the 155mm Bohdana artillery unit due to its compatibility with the gun’s size and energy. Other Soviet-era systems, like the Msta-B and D-20, have also been considered for similar configurations, with potential for reusing old Soviet howitzer carriages to further reduce production costs. In addition to developing towed artillery, Ukraine continues producing self-propelled Bohdana howitzers. Production has increased to 15 to 20 units per month as of 2024, compared to six units reported in December 2023. First introduced in 2018, the Bohdana self-propelled howitzer is based on a KrAZ 6×6 truck chassis and has gone through several iterations, including the Bohdana 2.0 and 4.0 versions. These later versions feature modifications such as an armored cabin and a semi-automatic loading system.

(Picture source: Militarnyi) Ukraine’s production of both towed and self-propelled artillery systems is part of a broader effort to meet its defense needs as Russia increases its weapons production. Ukraine has also partnered with Slovak defense company Konštrukta Defense to develop a new self-propelled gun based on the Slovak Zuzana system, aiming to further strengthen its artillery capabilities. The Bohdana systems have seen combat, notably during the 2022 battle for Snake Island, where they were used alongside French Caesar howitzers. This performance led to additional orders from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and increased production. Despite setbacks, such as the destruction of production facilities due to missile strikes, Ukraine’s defense industry has continued developing these systems by relocating factories and restoring equipment. The latest variant, the Bohdana 4.0, is a 155mm howitzer with a 52-caliber barrel. It is equipped with a semi-automatic loading system and has a maximum rate of fire of 5 rounds per minute. The system has a firing range of up to 48 km with high-explosive fragmentation projectiles and up to 60 km when using rocket-assisted projectiles. It can traverse 30 degrees to the left and right, with a basic load of 20 rounds. The minimum firing range is 780 meters, and the howitzer is compatible with all standard NATO 155mm ammunition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/ukraine-reveals-new-towed-bohdana-b-155mm-howitzer-to-meet-high-demand-for-artillery-systems	2024-10-04T00:10:44-07:00

HMS Agamemnon: newest Astute-class submarine launched by Royal Navy	According to information published by the UK MoD on October 3, 2024, the Royal Navy's newest hunter-killer submarine, HMS Agamemnon, has officially taken to the water following her launch at BAE Systems' shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's Astute-class submarine Agamemnon. (Picture source: British MoD) The 7,400-tonne vessel, nicknamed 'Awesome Aggie,' is the sixth of seven Astute-class submarines being constructed for the UK’s Silent Service. Named after the legendary Greek king who led the siege of Troy, HMS Agamemnon is designed to operate at the forefront of the Royal Navy’s operations well into the latter half of the 21st century. Equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles and advanced intelligence capabilities, she will play a critical role in protecting the UK’s nuclear deterrent and carrier strike groups from hostile threats while also being able to carry out precision strikes on land when necessary. The launch, which coincides with the 123rd anniversary of the nation’s first submarine being completed at the same Barrow shipyard, is a significant milestone for all involved in the Astute programme. With construction still underway on the seventh and final Astute-class submarine, HMS Agincourt, and the first of the next-generation nuclear deterrent submarines, HMS Dreadnought, the Barrow facility remains a hub of vital naval engineering. HMS Agamemnon enters the final phases of testing and commissioning. Royal Navy The Royal Navy is currently facing a multitude of challenges, driven by both external threats and internal limitations. One of the most pressing issues is the aging fleet, compounded by difficulties in introducing new vessels and technologies quickly enough. Although progress is being made with the construction of new ships like the Type 31 frigates and the Dreadnought-class submarines, these projects face significant delays and logistical bottlenecks. As a result, older ships must remain in service longer than anticipated, which increases maintenance costs and risks operational readiness​. Another critical challenge is funding. While the UK government has committed to expanding the fleet, a significant budgetary shortfall remains. For example, many programs, including the development of new frigates and support ships, are still unfunded. This creates a scenario where the Navy must carefully balance immediate needs with long-term investments, often leading to compromises that prioritize cheaper options over operationally optimal solutions​. The Navy also faces substantial workforce challenges. Recruitment and retention of skilled personnel have become increasingly difficult, particularly in technical fields. This problem is exacerbated by the push towards lean crewing and automation, which, while improving efficiency, also introduces cyber vulnerabilities and places additional strain on the workforce​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/hms-agamemnon-newest-astute-class-submarine-launched-by-royal-navy	2024-10-03T06:08:48-07:00

US Open to Selling F-15 Fighter Jets to Türkiye: A Possible Alternative if the Eurofighter Deal Fails	According to information from TurDef on October 3, 2024, defense relations between Türkiye and the U.S. could take a significant turn with the potential sale of F-15 fighter jets to Ankara. When asked about the possibility of Türkiye acquiring Boeing F-15C Eagle or F-15EX Eagle II fighters, U.S. sources expressed openness to the idea, stating, 'We would love to sell our jets to Türkiye.' However, the same sources clarified that no meetings or official requests have taken place regarding the potential sale of F-15s.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-15C Eagle assigned to the 44th Fighter Squadron returns from a training sortie at Kadena Air Base, Japan, Dec. 20, 2022 (Picture source: US DoD) Interest in the F-15s has emerged as Türkiye explores alternatives to its previous plans to acquire Russian fighter jets and its more recent focus on the Eurofighter Typhoon, a deal supported by the United Kingdom. However, reports indicate that Germany, a partner in the Eurofighter program, may oppose the acquisition behind the scenes, raising concerns that the deal could fail. In such a scenario, the F-15s could become a viable option for Türkiye. While the U.S. is open to the sale of these aircraft, any such transaction would likely be contingent on resolving the ongoing issue surrounding the S-400 air defense system, which Türkiye purchased from Russia in 2019. This acquisition led to the imposition of CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) sanctions and Türkiye’s removal from the F-35 program. Under U.S. law, specifically the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021 and Section 1241 of CAATSA, sanctions can only be lifted if Türkiye relinquishes the S-400 systems, removes Russian personnel involved in their maintenance, and guarantees that it will not attempt to reacquire them in the future. Without these assurances, progress in negotiations for F-15 sales would remain stalled. The S-400 issue continues to be a major obstacle in U.S.-Turkish defense relations. Recently, Greek media reported that the U.S. proposed stationing the S-400 systems at Incirlik Air Base in Türkiye to bypass the impasse. This suggestion was firmly rejected by Ankara, which refuses any relocation of the S-400 systems. U.S. sources confirmed that this idea would not resolve the underlying issue, as the U.S. requires full compliance with CAATSA and NDAA provisions to lift the sanctions. An F-15EX Eagle II from the 85th Test and Evaluation Squadron, 53rd Wing, takes flight for the first time out of Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., April 26, 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) Despite these challenges, there is cautious optimism about a possible post-CAATSA era in U.S.-Turkish defense relations. U.S. sources believe that, once sanctions are lifted, opportunities for cooperation could expand, particularly in the defense industry. 'There is a lot of potential for deeper cooperation in this field, as we know Turkish defense companies employ highly skilled engineers and produce excellent equipment,' one source noted. The source also mentioned potential interest in exploring the integration of Turkish products into U.S. platforms, depending on how the situation evolves. In the meantime, negotiations are underway for a $23 billion deal between Türkiye and the U.S. as part of a modernization program for the Turkish F-16 fleet.

The Army’s Logistics Support Command (MALE) managed the contract through a negotiated procedure without public notice, which allows for the direct selection of a company without publishing tender documents. The Army justified this approach by stating that 'the contract can only be executed by a specific economic operator due to the lack of competition for technical reasons.' The contract formalization is expected in the second half of October, with mounted mortar deliveries extending until December 2027, in line with the project timeline. The vehicle-mounted mortar system is one of the flagship projects of the Ministry of Defense's new investment cycle. This announcement was made by the Secretary of State for Defense, Amparo Valcarce, during the third edition of Feindef in May 2023. The Eimos system, also known as Dual Eimos, is a solution developed by Rheinmetall Expal as part of an R&amp;D program of the Ministry of Defense, in response to the requirements of the Marine Infantry and the Spanish Army. The system features automatic fire control and 360° aiming without requiring repositioning or reorientation of the vehicle, and without deploying additional components, enabling a highly effective 'shoot and scoot' capability—a tactical method where artillery fires and relocates quickly. The Vamtac ST5, which hosts the Dual Eimos system, is capable of crossing deep waters up to 1.5 meters without prior preparation. The vehicle is also equipped with a stress absorption system to enhance performance. The mortar system includes a new-generation Inertial Navigation Unit (INU), providing increased precision in aiming. It also integrates Talos, the Army's command and control system for artillery. The Eimos system is part of the equipment that the Spanish Army aims to integrate under the Fuerza 35 project, which seeks to modernize the capabilities of cavalry units in the coming years. The Spanish Navy's Marine Infantry has already been operating the Rheinmetall Expal Eimos system for two years, while the Spanish Army received its first units in late 2023, as reported by Infodefensa.com. These systems are already in service with the Paratrooper Brigade.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/spanish-army-acquires-eimos-mortars-from-rheinmetall-expal	2024-10-03T02:16:50-07:00

South Korea and Japan resume joint maritime resource talks after 40-year hiatus	According to information published by The Korea Herald on September 26, 2024, Seoul and Tokyo are set to reignite discussions on joint maritime resource development in the East China Sea, marking the first such dialogue in nearly 40 years.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The talks focus on undersea resource exploration beneath the continental shelf south of Jeju Island, an area that has long been contested for its untapped reserves of petroleum and other minerals. This significant development comes just months before Japan could potentially issue a termination notice for their 1974 agreement, which established a joint development zone (JDZ) covering 82,557 square kilometers of the East China Sea. The agreement, which was designed to mitigate disputes over maritime boundaries, is set to expire in June 2028 unless one party opts out with three years’ notice. The last formal discussions were held in 1985, with negotiations stalling due to economic and legal challenges. Japan, citing concerns about the viability of the resources in the JDZ, had resisted further engagement. However, pressure from South Korea and the looming deadline for potential termination have brought Japan back to the table. In this latest round of talks, both countries are expected to reassess the economic potential of the area and explore possibilities for new joint research initiatives. The discussions, however, will remain centered on the implementation of the existing agreement, rather than on its potential extension. The talks will be led by high-level representatives from both countries' foreign and energy ministries, with South Korea expected to emphasize the importance of continued exploration efforts, despite past setbacks. While Japan's stance remains uncertain, the resumption of dialogue signals a cautious willingness to revisit the long-dormant collaboration. The outcome of these talks could shape the future of resource development in the East China Sea, as both nations weigh their options ahead of the agreement’s possible termination. South Korea - Japan relations Naval relations between South Korea and Japan have seen notable improvement in recent years, largely driven by shared security concerns, particularly North Korea's growing nuclear threat. Both countries, along with the United States, have been increasingly involved in trilateral military exercises, which serve to enhance cooperation and interoperability among their naval forces. One key development has been the institutionalization of joint exercises, such as the 'Freedom Edge' drills, which involve complex, multi-domain operations spanning naval, air, and cyber domains. These exercises not only improve operational coordination but also signal a unified stance against regional threats, especially from North Korea, whose missile tests have escalated regional tensions. These trilateral exercises often involve advanced assets, including aircraft carriers and Aegis-equipped destroyers, underscoring the seriousness of the security environment. However, the historical tension between South Korea and Japan, stemming from Japan's colonization of Korea (1910-1945), continues to be a sensitive issue. Efforts to improve relations, such as resolving incidents like the 2018 patrol aircraft dispute, have been crucial for the countries to move forward in their defense cooperation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/south-korea-and-japan-resume-joint-maritime-resource-talks-after-40-year-hiatus	2024-10-03T01:13:58-07:00

Iranian Media Alleges Destruction of Israeli F-35 Fighters in Missile Strike	On October 2, 2024, a series of reports and videos began circulating on social media, particularly on Telegram and X, claiming that Iranian missiles had successfully targeted and destroyed Israeli airbases, including entire squadrons of Lockheed Martin F-35I Adir fighters. These claims, mostly propagated by Iranian state media, quickly gained traction among pro-Iranian supporters. The claims followed Iran’s largest missile attack on Israel to date, with more than 180 missiles launched. The strikes, involving Fattah-1 and Kheybarshekan missiles, were said to be larger and more complex than those carried out in April.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35I is a customized version of the F-35A, featuring Israeli-made modifications to its avionics, electronic warfare systems, and weapons. (Picture source: Israeli Air Forces) Israel was the first country to select the F-35 through the U.S. government's Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program after signing a Letter of Agreement in October 2010. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) named the F-35 'Adir,' meaning 'The Mighty One' in Hebrew. On June 22, 2016, the IAF received its first F-35 Adir. The Israeli F-35 fleet was declared operational in December 2017, marking the end of an intensive integration and training effort at Nevatim Airbase, Israel. Israel’s procurement of the Lockheed Martin F-35I 'Adir' began with a formal agreement in 2010, making it the first country to acquire this aircraft via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. The first batch of nine F-35Is became operational with the IAF in December 2017. By November 2022, Israel had 36 F-35Is in service, including a unique testbed version for integrating Israeli-made systems. These aircraft, based at Nevatim Airbase, are part of three operational squadrons. The F-35I is a customized version of the F-35A, featuring Israeli-made modifications to its avionics, electronic warfare systems, and weapons. The stealth capabilities, advanced sensor systems, and versatility of the F-35I provide Israel with significant advantages in situational awareness, precision targeting, and combat effectiveness. In May 2018, Israel became the first country to use the F-35 in combat, demonstrating its operational capabilities. Despite these speculations, Israeli authorities quickly claimed that most of the missiles had been intercepted and destroyed, minimizing damage and avoiding any casualties in Israel. Iranian propagandists, however, insisted that significant damage was inflicted, particularly at Nevatim Airbase, home to two F-35I squadrons, claiming it had been completely destroyed. Videos showing missiles targeting Tel Aviv and footage purportedly showing damage to F-35s in Gaza further fueled the controversy. Satellite image of Nevatim Air Base before the Iranian strikes on September 19, 2024. (Picture source: Esry) The Israeli military acknowledged that some of its airbases were hit during Iran’s massive ballistic missile attack but clarified that the strikes did not impair the operational capacity of the IAF. Missiles caused minor damage to offices and maintenance areas at the bases, but critical infrastructure and aircraft remained unaffected. The attack involved about 200 ballistic missiles, but most were intercepted by Israeli and U.S. defense systems, limiting the damage. Several experts pointed out that these claims lack verifiable evidence. According to Dr. Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of public communication at American University, while it is possible that some missiles struck Israeli airbases, the claim that dozens of F-35s were destroyed appears to be fabricated. Braddock also referenced reports of a protest by Palestinian activists at a factory producing F-35 components, though this seemed to have little impact on production. Despite doubts, disinformation continued to spread on social media. Exaggerated claims of Iranian success were widely shared, lending further credibility to the initial reports. This resulted in a mix of misinformation and disinformation. According to Braddock, misinformation occurs when individuals share images or videos believing them to be true without critically evaluating the content. In contrast, disinformation involves a deliberate effort to spread false information for strategic purposes. Satellite image of Nevatim Air Base after the Iranian attacks with the various visible impacts, October 3, 2024 (Picture source: X Channel @ClashReport) In this case, it is likely that Iranian state media and its operatives engaged in a coordinated campaign to present a fictional narrative, using false or exaggerated claims to reinforce the perceived success of the missile strikes. Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor at the University of New Haven, emphasized that these campaigns aim not necessarily to convince the public of outright lies but to create confusion by flooding the media with contradictory information. This tactic aims to overwhelm individuals with data, making it harder to discern truth from falsehood. Even if Israeli authorities were to counter these claims by providing evidence of minimal damage, such as photos of largely intact airbases, there is a risk that this too would be dismissed as misinformation. In this way, Tehran could gain a short-term advantage by casting doubt on Israel's defensive capabilities and downplaying the ineffectiveness of its missile attack. In reality, reports indicate that while not all Iranian missiles were intercepted, those that reached their targets caused minimal damage, with no casualties in Israel. This outcome is likely embarrassing for Iran, whose missile attack failed to achieve the level of destruction it may have intended. However, by spreading exaggerated claims about the effectiveness of the attack, Iranian propagandists seek to shift the narrative in their favor, creating the perception that the strikes were far more successful than they actually were.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iranian-media-alleges-destruction-of-israeli-f-35-fighters-in-missile-strike	2024-10-03T00:47:11-07:00

This contract, valid through 2027, aims to optimize engine performance while improving durability and cost efficiency. The support work planned under this agreement will be conducted at several sites in the United States, including Charleston, South Carolina, Long Beach, California, and Robins Air Force Base in Georgia, as well as undisclosed international locations to support C-17 operators worldwide. The C-17 Globemaster III is a military transport aircraft designed to transport troops and various cargo types to primary bases around the world. It is distinguished by an impressive loading capacity of 45,360 kilograms (100,000 pounds), which allows it to carry vehicles, heavy equipment, or humanitarian supplies in large quantities. With a range of over 8,334 kilometers (4,500 nautical miles), it can perform long flights without refueling, making it essential for rapid deployment missions or supply operations in remote areas. One of the C-17’s key strengths is its ability to land on short and narrow runways, thanks to its steep descent capabilities and slow approach speed. These features allow it to operate in underdeveloped airports or isolated airstrips, often inaccessible to other aircraft of its size. This versatility makes it a crucial tool for missions in remote regions, war zones, or emergency humanitarian interventions where airport infrastructure is limited.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-dod-awards-boeing-major-maintenance-contract-for-c-17-globemaster-iii-transport-aircraft-fleet	2024-10-03T00:22:54-07:00

This forces the F135 engine to operate 'beyond its design parameters,' leading to increased engine wear and high maintenance costs. Over the projected 58-year lifespan of the F-35 program, these costs could reach up to $38 billion. Collins Aerospace, another company under RTX, has proposed an alternative solution with its Enhanced Power and Cooling System (EPACS). The company stated in 2022 that it would be ready to enter an engineering and manufacturing development phase for EPACS by mid-2024 if a tender was launched. Although Collins seems prepared to take on the challenge, the JPO's direction in selecting the new PTMS system remains to be seen. At the same time, the Pentagon made a significant decision regarding the future of F-35 propulsion. It opted not to adopt the engines developed under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) by Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE Aerospace. While these engines promised a 30% performance improvement over the F135 engine, they were not compatible with the F-35B variant used by the Marine Corps, which requires short take-off and vertical landing capabilities. Adapting them to the Navy's F-35C variant would have also posed technical challenges. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall expressed his regret last year that the service could not include the development and production of the AETP engines in the fiscal year 2025 budget request. However, the Pentagon insisted on maintaining compatibility among all F-35 variants for both U.S. and international users, leading to the choice of the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) as the preferred solution. Despite the abandonment of the AETP program, Pratt &amp; Whitney claims that the ECU will incorporate many innovations developed under AETP. A company spokesperson emphasized that 'over 1,200 F135 engines have been produced, with over 900,000 flight hours logged.' These figures highlight the significance of this engine for the global F-35 fleet. The PTMU program and the decisions surrounding the future of the F-35’s energy and cooling management system will play a crucial role in optimizing the aircraft’s performance and reducing long-term maintenance costs. Fall 2024 will mark a pivotal moment with the contract award and the start of the next development phase for the F-35, one of the most costly and strategic armament programs in the United States.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/lockheed-martin-given-authority-to-choose-contractor-for-f-35-fighter-jets-power-and-thermal-management-system-program	2024-10-02T03:30:38-07:00	
India set to finalize deal for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets after major price cut	According to information published by Times of India on September 30, 2024, India is on the verge of sealing a deal with France for the acquisition of 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets, which are expected to enhance the Indian Navy's operational capabilities aboard its aircraft carriers.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Rafale-M fighter aircraft. (Picture source: Dassault) After a series of negotiations spanning over a year, a final price has been reached, marking a considerable reduction from initial estimates. The agreement, anticipated to be signed soon, is closely modeled on the 2016 contract that saw the Indian Air Force acquire 36 Rafale jets. Discussions around the deal have gained momentum ahead of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval's visit to Paris, where talks will likely cover both the fighter jets and a separate order for three additional Kalvari class submarines to be constructed in Mumbai. These discussions are set within the framework of India and France's robust defense partnership. The Rafale Marine jets are intended to operate from India's aircraft carriers, addressing a critical requirement for 26 carrier-borne fighters. Following extensive evaluations of both Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and Dassault's Rafale M, the Indian Navy opted for the Rafale on technical grounds. The aircraft is seen as a suitable complement to the Air Force's fleet, and will be equipped with advanced anti-ship weaponry and long-range fuel tanks optimized for maritime operations. Additionally, the Rafale Ms will come equipped with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, one of the most advanced systems of its kind in the region. The acquisition is being conducted through the government-to-government route, similar to the previous deal for the Air Force. Recent amendments by the Defence Acquisition Council, led by Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, streamlined the process. This included the removal of plans to integrate Indian radar and weapon systems into the naval jets, a decision made due to the high costs and an estimated eight-year timeline for completion. While this purchase of Rafale Marine jets is seen as a temporary solution, it bridges the gap until India's Aeronautical Development Agency completes its indigenous twin-engine deck-based fighter project.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/india-set-to-finalize-deal-for-26-rafale-marine-fighter-jets-after-major-price-cut	2024-10-02T02:29:03-07:00	
Imminent Stationing of Nearly 100 Leopard 2 A8 Tanks in Lithuania: A New Force Against Russian Threat	On October 1, 2024, Lithuanian Minister of National Defense, Laurynas Kasčiūnas, reaffirmed in an interview with the television channel LRT the government's intention to order Leopard 2 main battle tanks by the end of the year. This statement marks a crucial step in a project that has been ongoing since the beginning of the year, initiated under the leadership of Arvydas Anušauskas, the previous Minister of Defense. Anušauskas had previously announced the formation of a Lithuanian tank battalion designed to be fully interoperable with German forces. During initial discussions, it was determined that the Leopard 2 A8 was the most efficient and suitable tank to meet the requirements of the Lithuanian Army.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) The Leopard 2A8 is the latest evolution in the Leopard 2 family of main battle tanks, developed by German companies KMW and Rheinmetall. This modern tank is equipped with a 120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun, capable of firing a variety of munitions, including the programmable DM11 for precise strikes. The Leopard 2A8 also features an advanced protection system, integrating next-generation multi-layered armor and the Israeli Trophy Active Protection System (APS), providing an effective defense against anti-tank missiles and rockets. The tank boasts impressive mobility thanks to its 1,600-horsepower engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 70 km/h and overcome various obstacles, with an operational range of 450 kilometers. In terms of crew protection and safety, the Leopard 2A8 is equipped with reinforced armor, particularly around the turret and hull, to enhance its resistance to mines and other modern threats. Its advanced fire control system allows for exceptional precision, even while on the move, and its optical systems, such as third-generation thermal imaging, ensure increased visibility in adverse conditions. Additionally, this tank is equipped with an NBC protection system against nuclear, biological, and chemical threats, ensuring the survival of the crew in hostile environments. Lithuania aims to build a powerful land division capable of addressing the region's growing security needs. In July, Kasčiūnas spoke about strengthening the heavy combat capabilities of the Lithuanian army, mentioning the possible acquisition of a tracked infantry fighting vehicle in addition to the Leopard 2. However, he also noted that the number of combat vehicles to be ordered would depend directly on available financial resources, indicating that the extent of the project would be contingent on the budget. The Leopard 2 A8, the latest version of the renowned German battle tank, was first presented to the public during the Eurosatory 2024 exhibition. Minister Kasčiūnas confirmed that the platform selected for equipping Lithuanian forces would undoubtedly be the Leopard. At the same time, Lithuania seeks to enhance its military arsenal with the acquisition of other vehicles and systems, including Boxer armored personnel carriers (known as Vilkas in Lithuania) and air defense systems. However, the current priority remains the establishment of this tank battalion, in close cooperation with Germany. Negotiations on the contract for these tanks are progressing rapidly. Kasčiūnas indicated that the Lithuanian National Defense Council would meet by the end of October to finalize decisions related to this acquisition project. The minister also hinted that negotiations with the KNDS consortium, responsible for producing the Leopard, were already well advanced. If the Council gives the green light, the contract could be signed as early as November 2024. Protection features of the Leopard 2A8 include multi-layered armor combining steel, tungsten, composite filler, and ceramic components, along with the EuroTrophy Active Protection System (APS) for 360-degree coverage against projectiles. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Cooperation with Germany involves two major aspects. Firstly, the Lithuanian tank battalion will be structured similarly to that of the German army, with 44 tanks divided into three companies. With a small reserve added, Lithuania's order would amount to around 50 tanks, a number previously discussed during preliminary talks. Secondly, Lithuania will acquire the same modernized version of the Leopard 2 A8, identical to the one that will equip the German tank battalion. On the German side, the tank battalion of the combat forces brigade, which is expected to reach full operational capacity by 2027, will also be equipped with Leopard 2 A8 tanks, with deliveries starting in 2025. This battalion will be outfitted with 44 Leopard 2 A8 tanks, ensuring a formidable strike force. Thus, by 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces. This strategic deployment is particularly critical in a sensitive area: the Suwalki Corridor, a narrow strip of land linking the Baltic states to the rest of Europe and separating Belarus from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. This region represents a crucial point in NATO's defense against potential threats from Russia. By strengthening its military capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment such as the Leopard 2 A8, Lithuania aims to increase its defense autonomy while reinforcing its integration into NATO's military framework. This project reflects the country's commitment to adapting to new security realities and being ready to respond effectively to any potential escalation of regional tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/imminent-stationing-of-nearly-100-leopard-2-a8-tanks-in-lithuania-a-new-force-against-russian-threat	2024-10-02T02:06:36-07:00	
US Air Force retires last KC-10 Extender tanker aircraft after 44 years of service	On September 26, 2024, a ceremony at Travis Air Force Base in California marked the decommissioning of the last U.S. Air Force KC-10 Extender after 44 years of service. The event was attended by military personnel, veterans, local community leaders, and base members. The KC-10, used primarily for air refueling operations, was formally retired in a ceremony led by Col. Jay Johnson, commander of the 60th Air Mobility Wing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The KC-10 Extender was developed during the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program following logistical challenges during the Vietnam War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which highlighted the need for long-range refueling and cargo support. (Picture source: US DoD) The KC-10, based on the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, entered service in 1981 and supported various missions, including combat and humanitarian operations, as well as fostering partnerships with allied forces. It played a role in enabling the U.S. Air Force to conduct long-range air refueling operations globally. In a video message, Gen. David W. Allvin, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, noted the KC-10's contribution to air refueling and its role in maintaining the U.S. military’s global reach. The aircraft served from its time in Strategic Air Command to its more recent operations. The U.S. Air Force began retiring the KC-10 fleet in 2020, with the last aircraft completing its final mission on September 26, 2024, marking the end of the KC-10’s service. Following retirement, the KC-10 will be sent to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. This facility is responsible for the storage, parts reclamation, and preservation of aircraft for the U.S. military, government agencies, and allied forces. The KC-10 will be replaced by the KC-46A Pegasus, with 88 of the new aircraft delivered by September 2024. The McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender, a tanker and cargo aircraft, served the U.S. Air Force for over four decades. Developed from the civilian DC-10 airliner, the KC-10 expanded the Air Force's refueling capabilities, supplementing the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet. The KC-10 was developed during the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program following logistical challenges during the Vietnam War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which highlighted the need for long-range refueling and cargo support. The US Air Force began retiring the KC-10 fleet in 2020, with the first KC-10 Extender ever produced arriving at Dover Air Force Base on April 26, 2022, for its retirement and display at the Air Mobility Command museum. (Picture source: US DoD) A total of 60 KC-10s were produced between 1979 and 1987, and the aircraft entered service in March 1981. The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) also operated two modified KDC-10s, converted from DC-10s. These tankers supported U.S. military operations worldwide, including missions such as the 1986 bombing of Libya, the Gulf War, and operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The KC-10’s fuel and cargo capacities made it suitable for both refueling and strategic airlift missions. The KC-10’s design included modifications for military use, such as additional fuel tanks that increased its capacity to 161,478 kilograms—nearly double that of the KC-135. The aircraft was equipped with both a boom-and-drogue refueling system, allowing it to refuel a range of aircraft, including those of the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and allied forces. The refueling boom, positioned at the rear, delivered fuel at a rate of 4,180 liters per minute. The KC-10 could carry up to 170,000 pounds (77,110 kilograms) of cargo, transporting 25 pallets and 16 passengers, or 17 pallets and 75 passengers over a range of 7,040 kilometers without needing to refuel. The Royal Netherlands Air Force used KDC-10s for both refueling and transport missions, including humanitarian, peacekeeping, and military operations. These aircraft were eventually replaced by Airbus A330 MRTT tankers, and the remaining KDC-10s were sold to Omega Aerial Refueling Services, a civilian contractor that continues to operate similar aircraft. As a reminder, the McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender is a three-engine aircraft with a length of 55.35 meters, a wingspan of 50.41 meters, and a height of 17.7 meters. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 267,619 kilograms. Powered by three General Electric F103 (GE CF6-50C2) turbofan engines, each providing 234 kilonewtons of thrust, the KC-10 reaches a top speed of 866 kilometers per hour (Mach 0.89) and has a range of 7,100 kilometers with passengers and cargo. It has a ferry range of 18,500 kilometers and operates at a service ceiling of 13,000 meters with a rate of climb of 34.9 meters per second.

French Navy deploys frigate from Toulon amid Middle East conflict escalation	According to information published by Nicolas Cuoco in JDD on October 1, 2024, France has mobilized naval forces, including the departure of a frigate from Toulon, in response to the escalating conflict in the Middle East.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Navy's La Fayette-class frigate Guépratte. (Picture source: US DoD) France's recent deployment of a frigate from Toulon as tensions rise in the Middle East presents two possible vessel options: the FS Guépratte, a La Fayette-class frigate, or one of the advanced FREMM (Frégate Européenne Multi-Mission) frigates. The FS Guépratte, a vessel with a legacy rooted in French naval tradition, exemplifies a design optimized for specific operational scenarios. Typically, ships like the Guépratte are engineered with a focus on anti-submarine warfare and surface combat, reflecting the strategic priorities during the periods they were commissioned. Their technical specifications often include a balanced mix of armaments, such as torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, alongside sophisticated sonar systems tailored for detecting and neutralizing underwater threats. The propulsion systems in such frigates are designed to offer a combination of speed and endurance, enabling sustained operations in varied maritime environments. In contrast, the FREMM class represents a more contemporary approach to frigate design, embodying advancements in technology and multi-mission flexibility. These vessels are characterized by their modular design, which allows for rapid reconfiguration to suit different mission profiles, whether it be anti-aircraft, anti-surface, or humanitarian operations. The FREMM frigates are equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and weaponry, including vertical launch systems capable of deploying a range of missiles for air defense and land attack roles. Their propulsion systems are often more efficient, providing enhanced speed and range, which is crucial for global deployments and extended missions far from home bases. Adding another layer to France's maritime strategy, the deployment of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship underscores the multifaceted nature of the French Navy's current operations. The Mistral class, renowned for its ability to project power and provide humanitarian assistance, has been tasked with supporting the approximately 20,000 French nationals in Lebanon. This deployment highlights the French Navy's commitment not only to strategic military objectives but also to the protection and evacuation of its citizens in regions experiencing instability. The Mistral's capabilities in transporting troops, vehicles, and equipment, combined with its extensive medical facilities and helicopter operations, make it an indispensable asset in crisis scenarios	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navy-deploys-frigate-from-toulon-amid-middle-east-conflict-escalation	2024-10-02T01:36:38-07:00	
Israel Under Iranian Fire: How Air Defense Withstood Wave of Ballistic Missiles	On October 1, 2024, Israel was the target of a massive attack by Iran, which launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles in retaliation for the elimination of senior leaders from Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. This assault, considered one of the largest ballistic missile strikes against a nation-state, tested Israel's air defense system. Despite intercepting many missiles, videos circulating on social media show some reaching the ground, raising questions about the effectiveness and limitations of Israel's air defense capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Various screenshots from videos showing the multiple strikes carried out by Iran on Israel (Picture source: X Channel @ELINTNews) Functioning of Israel's Air Defense System Israel's air defense is a multilayered system that intercepts various aerial threats at different altitudes and ranges. This system primarily consists of three elements: Iron Dome: Deployed since 2011, this system is designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells (ranging between 4 and 70 kilometers). The Iron Dome uses radar to identify threats and assess if they are likely to hit populated areas. If a threat is confirmed, a Tamir interceptor is launched to neutralize it. The cost per interception is estimated between $40,000 and $50,000. IRON DOME, the most deployed air defense system, has intercepted 5000+ rockets with an over 90% success rate since 2011. (Picture source: Rafael) David’s Sling: This more advanced system covers medium to long ranges, intercepting short-range ballistic missiles and large-caliber rockets. Its Stunner interceptor can neutralize targets up to 300 kilometers away. Unlike the Iron Dome, the Stunner does not carry an explosive warhead but destroys its target through direct impact, increasing interception accuracy. However, the cost per interception is significantly higher, around $1 million per missile. Arrow 2 and Arrow 3: These systems are designed to intercept medium- to long-range ballistic missiles, including those reaching the exo-atmosphere. Arrow 3, in particular, can intercept missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere, neutralizing potential threats equipped with weapons of mass destruction. The cost of intercepting a missile with the Arrow 2 or Arrow 3 can reach up to $3.5 million per missile. Each layer of the system is designed to address specific types of threats, providing in-depth defense. Sophisticated radars and command and control centers coordinate efforts to ensure maximum coverage. David's Sling, developed by Israel in 2006 and operational since 2017, forms the middle layer of defense against cruise and lower-tier ballistic missiles, while the Arrow-3 interceptor, deployed the same year, protects against long-range ballistic missile threats (Picture source: MDA/IDF) Analysis of Effectiveness during the Iranian Attack During the attack on October 1, Israel successfully intercepted a significant portion of the Iranian missiles using its multilayered defense system. However, videos circulating show missiles hitting the ground, raising several questions: System Saturation: Iran launched nearly 200 missiles in a single wave over a few hours, potentially attempting to overwhelm Israel's defenses. Even with an advanced system, there is a limit to how many threats can be addressed simultaneously. Evolving Threats: Iran may have used hypersonic Fattah missiles, capable of maneuvering and traveling at speeds up to Mach 13-15, which present a significant challenge for current interception systems. These missiles are designed to be difficult to detect and intercept. While Arrow 3 is intended to counter such threats, hypersonic technology complicates early detection and interception efforts. Engagement Strategy: Israel’s defense systems prioritize threats based on their trajectory. If a missile is predicted to land in an unpopulated area, it may be left unintercepted to preserve costly interceptors for more critical threats. Operators may choose not to intercept certain missiles to conserve resources, especially if they do not directly threaten lives or critical infrastructure. However, reports of missiles hitting a military base in Nevatim may suggest otherwise. Video of the missile impacts in Israel pic.twitter.com/OZPLMe5zEn Cost and Logistics: Intercepting each missile carries a significant financial cost. In the context of a massive attack, decision-makers must balance the use of available resources with the need to protect the most sensitive areas. The presence of Iranian missiles that reached Israeli soil does not necessarily indicate a failure of the defense system. It may reflect the physical limitations of the system, which can only handle a certain number of missiles at a time due to reaction times and available interceptors. The Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, highlighted the challenges faced by Israel’s air defense system. While largely effective in intercepting the majority of the missiles, the system is not foolproof. The saturation effect from a large number of missiles, the introduction of new adversary technologies, and logistical and financial constraints are all factors that can allow certain threats to pass through the defense network. This situation underscores the importance for Israel to continue investing in research and development to improve its defense capabilities while adapting its strategies to evolving threats. Ongoing cooperation with international partners, such as the United States, also remains crucial to maintaining a technological and operational advantage, as well as participating in joint defense efforts during such events.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-under-iranian-fire-how-air-defense-withstood-wave-of-ballistic-missiles	2024-10-02T01:36:10-07:00	
Philippines Strengthens Its Defense with Indian BrahMos Supersonic Missiles and Twin-Missile Launchers	On September 25, 2024, BrahMos Aerospace unveiled for the first time at the ADAS event a model of the mobile BrahMos launcher that will be operated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). This model, which displays missiles mounted on a Czechoslovakian Tatra 6x6 vehicle, highlighted the twin-missile launcher specifically chosen by the Philippines. This configuration contrasts with the three-missile launchers used by the Indian Armed Forces. The displayed model also featured jungle camouflage, adopted by the AFP for its tropical operations. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BrahMos Supersonic Missile and its Twin-Missile Launcher (Picture source: Philippines MoD) According to the Twitter account Noise Alerts, the first batch of BrahMos supersonic missiles was delivered to the Philippines on April 19, 2024. Transported by an Indian Air Force IL-76TD aircraft, these missiles were delivered to the Philippine Marine Corps in Manila, accompanied by ground launch systems. This delivery, part of a $375 million agreement signed in 2022, marks the first time India has exported the BrahMos missile system. The Philippine Marine Corps confirmed that each BrahMos missile battery would consist of only two missile launchers. The BrahMos cruise missile, named after the Brahmaputra River in India and the Moscow River in Russia, is the result of a joint development between India and Russia. Based on the Russian SS-N-26 (3M55 Oniks/Yakhont/Bastion) missile, this supersonic missile is designed to engage land and sea targets with remarkable precision. BrahMos Aerospace, the company responsible for its development, was established in 1998 as a joint venture between India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyeniya. The BrahMos missiles will be operated by the Coastal Defense Regiment of the Philippine Marines. A BrahMos Aerospace representative stated to AMR that all deliveries are expected to be completed by next year. He also highlighted that India is considering replacing the imported Tatra vehicles with Indian-origin models for future deliveries. The BrahMos missile is equipped with a conventional warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kg, capable of delivering impact energy nine times greater than that of subsonic cruise missiles. The BrahMos missiles can be fitted with either a high-explosive semi-armor-piercing warhead or a submunition payload weighing between 200 and 300 kg. They can be launched from vertical or ramp launch systems, or in the case of the submarine version, from submerged vessels. In 2013, the missile was successfully tested from a submerged barge, demonstrating its capability to be deployed on missile-armed submarines. The Philippines announced the agreement with BrahMos Aerospace in January 2022 for the acquisition of three missile batteries. This contract, valued at $375 million, also includes operator and maintenance training as well as an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package. The requirement for this advanced weapon system was formally conceptualized in 2017 and approved by the Office of the Philippine President for inclusion in the Horizon 2 Priority Projects in 2020. In India, BrahMos Aerospace was also selected to supply next-generation long-range mobile coastal maritime batteries to the Indian Navy under an agreement signed in March 2023, valued at $200 million. The BrahMos missile, also designated as PJ-10, is a joint military project between India and Russia, combining the expertise of DRDO and NPO Mashinostroyeniya. In service since 2001, it can be launched from various platforms, including submarines, ships, fighter jets, and land-based mobile launchers. It can reach supersonic speeds between Mach 2 and Mach 3. Since India's induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 2016, versions of the BrahMos missile have achieved increased ranges of up to 900 km, compared to 290 km for the export version. With its stealth capabilities, advanced guidance system, and fire-and-forget mode, the BrahMos represents a major asset in modern arsenals. This phase of BrahMos deliveries to the Philippines not only strengthens military cooperation between India and Southeast Asian countries but also boosts the Philippines' coastal defense capabilities in the face of growing regional threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/philippines-strengthens-its-defense-with-indian-brahmos-supersonic-missiles-and-twin-missile-launchers	2024-10-02T00:58:37-07:00	
What Missiles Were Used in Iran's Strike on Israel?	On October 1, 2024, a large-scale attack orchestrated by Iran hit Israeli soil, marking a significant turning point in the ongoing conflict between the two nations. As part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' Iranian forces deployed a vast arsenal, including 120 ballistic missiles (including Emads), 170 drones, and 30 hypersonic missiles, among them the Fatah-2.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images of Emad MRBMs launched at Israel during Operation True Promise 2. (Picture source: Iranian Media) The 120 ballistic missiles used in this attack notably included the Emad, a medium-range missile capable of striking targets nearly 1,700 kilometers away with improved accuracy. Thanks to its terminal guidance system, these missiles can adjust their trajectory in the final phase of flight, thus increasing their effectiveness. This coordinated attack also saw the use of 170 drones, another crucial component of Iran’s military strategy. Drones have become indispensable weapons in modern warfare, and Iran’s attack on Israel featured a significant number of them. However, the most concerning aspect of this offensive lies in the deployment of 30 hypersonic missiles, a first in this conflict. Among them, the Fatah-2 was used for the first time in a conflict. This hypersonic missile, capable of flying at a speed of Mach 13, stands out due to its ability to evade conventional defense systems thanks to its high-speed maneuverability. With an estimated range of 1,400 kilometers, the Fatah-2 can not only reach its targets in record time but it is also designed to change course during flight, making interception extremely difficult. Its payload, tailored for precision strikes, makes it a formidable weapon for attacks on critical infrastructure. This coordinated offensive severely tested Israeli defense systems, notably the Iron Dome and Arrow anti-missile batteries. While these systems successfully intercepted part of the ballistic missiles and drones, the threat posed by hypersonic missiles like the Fatah-2 remains a significant concern. Current anti-missile defense systems struggle to keep up with these ultra-fast weapons, giving Iran a clear strategic advantage in its pursuit of deterrence against Israel. So far, no precise figures have demonstrated how effectively the Fatah-2 was intercepted, but Iranian officials have claimed that 90% of the means employed in the attack reached their targets. The October 1 attack thus marks an escalation in hostilities between Iran and Israel, not only due to the impressive quantity of weaponry deployed but also because of the advanced quality of these attack systems. Iran has demonstrated its ability to carry out a complex offensive, integrating drones, precision ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles, thereby pushing the limits of Israeli defenses. The drones disrupted detection systems and weakened rapid response capabilities, while Emad ballistic missiles and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles targeted infrastructure. The Emad-1, in particular, is a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) developed by Iran and used since 2015 by the Aerospace Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGCASF). It represents an important milestone in Iran’s ballistic capabilities, being one of the first weapons of its kind to incorporate an advanced guidance system, thus improving its accuracy compared to previous models. The Emad-1 missile is powered by liquid fuel, a technology that, while older than solid propellants, allows for greater flexibility in adjusting parameters before launch. With a diameter of 1.25 meters, the Emad is designed to carry a single warhead, enabling it to strike targets up to 1,700 kilometers away. This range allows it to hit targets across much of the Middle East, including Israel, with notable precision. Indeed, the missile boasts a circular error probable (CEP) of 50 meters, meaning its margin of error at impact is relatively small, a significant improvement over older ballistic systems. This makes the Emad a formidable weapon for targeted strikes on strategic infrastructure. The October 1, 2024, attack symbolizes a rise in tensions between Iran and Israel, with the use of a sophisticated and varied arsenal, including ballistic missiles, drones, and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles. This offensive, carried out as part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' highlights the evolution of Iranian military capabilities and raises new questions about Israel’s defense systems' ability to cope with these threats. While the international community calls for calm, this escalation serves as a reminder of the fragility of the situation in the Middle East and the inherent risks of increasingly technological warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/what-missiles-were-used-in-irans-strike-on-israel	2024-10-02T00:35:27-07:00	
Breaking News: US Navy aids Israel in missile defense amid major Iranian attack, Pentagon confirms	According to information published by the US DoD on October 1, 2024, the Pentagon has confirmed that the U.S. military coordinated closely with Israeli forces during a significant missile attack launched by Iran against Israel earlier. In a press briefing, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder detailed that Iran fired approximately 200 ballistic missiles, targeting various locations across Israel. In response, the U.S. provided critical defense assistance to its ally.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US Navy's Arleigh-Burke class destroyer firing RIM-161 Standard Missile 3. (Picture source: Dvids) U.S. Navy destroyers deployed in the region, including the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, actively participated in the missile defense operation. These ships launched a dozen interceptors in an effort to neutralize the incoming threat, offering key support to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The specifics regarding the type of interceptor ordnance used were not disclosed, despite questions about whether the Navy utilized SM-3 missiles, a standard defense against ballistic missiles. Maj. Gen. Ryder emphasized the close coordination between the U.S. military and Israeli forces during the attack but refrained from providing further details on the defense measures. The attack underscores the ongoing tensions in the region and the U.S.'s commitment to defending its allies. Technical analysis The coordination between the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole during the recent missile defense operation highlights the sophisticated capabilities of modern naval platforms and their integration with advanced missile systems like the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3). Both vessels, being Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, which serves as the cornerstone for their multi-mission versatility, particularly in ballistic missile defense (BMD). The Aegis system integrates powerful radar suites, such as the AN/SPY-1D multi-function radar, which provides the necessary detection, tracking, and discrimination of incoming ballistic threats. These destroyers leverage the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability, enabling them to engage and intercept ballistic missiles during various phases of their trajectory. The USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, outfitted with the Aegis BMD configuration, possess the requisite command and control infrastructure to process complex threat environments and coordinate defensive measures in real-time. The SM-3 is a key component of the Aegis BMD system, designed to engage short to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their midcourse phase outside the Earth’s atmosphere. The missile employs a hit-to-kill kinetic warhead, relying on precise guidance and propulsion systems to achieve successful interception. Its flight trajectory allows it to engage targets at ranges extending beyond several hundred kilometers, providing a robust defensive envelope against diverse missile threats. The propulsion and guidance systems of the SM-3 are engineered for high maneuverability and accuracy, essential for countering agile ballistic missiles. The missile’s two-stage design comprises a solid rocket booster for initial propulsion and a second stage equipped with a thrust vector control system, enhancing its ability to adjust flight paths dynamically during interception. Additionally, the SM-3’s active radar seeker provides terminal guidance, allowing for precise targeting and minimizing the risk of collateral damage. The interoperability between the U.S. Navy destroyers and Israeli defense systems likely involved the sharing of real-time data and coordinated engagement strategies. Such collaboration enhances the overall defensive posture, enabling both forces to leverage their respective technological strengths and operational expertise.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-us-navy-aids-israel-in-missile-defense-amid-major-iranian-attack-pentagon-confirms	2024-10-02T00:25:14-07:00

US Army Orders Retired M60 Machine Guns: Mystery Surrounds Recipient	This week, the U.S. Army Contracting Command in Newark, New Jersey, awarded a $14.96 million contract to U.S. Ordnance, a company based in Sparks, Nevada, for an unspecified number of M60E4 and M60E6 machine guns. The contract also includes spare parts, accessories, conversion kits, and training services, raising many questions within the defense community. The U.S. Army largely phased out the M60 machine gun decades ago, prompting speculation about the recipient and the operational needs for these weapons.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A United States Navy SEAL pictured holding a M60E4 machine gun. (Picture source: US DoD) The M60 machine gun, chambered in 7.62x51 mm, was developed in the late 1940s and entered service in the 1950s. Inspired by the German MG-42 and FG-42 automatic rifles from World War II, the M60 was widely used during the Cold War and became iconic during the Vietnam War. Over the years, several variants were introduced, adapted for infantry, vehicles, aircraft, and naval platforms. However, the M60 was gradually replaced by the M240B in U.S. Army service. The M60E4 and M60E6, also known as the MK43, are modernized versions of the original machine gun. These newer variants are lighter, shorter, and feature improvements such as accessory rails and an upgraded gas system for better reliability. Despite these enhancements, they have not been widely adopted by the U.S. Army and are primarily used by foreign forces, such as the Danish Army, which became the first user of the M60E6 in 2014. Some U.S. special forces and training units still utilize these models. Danish Army soldier armed with M60E6 general-purpose machine gun (Picture source: Danish MoD) The contract awarded to U.S. Ordnance does not specify the exact number of machine guns or conversion kits to be delivered, and the Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about the details. This secrecy has led to speculation that these weapons could be intended for a foreign ally, such as Ukraine, as part of military aid. The U.S. has already mentioned the possibility of using the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program to transfer surplus military equipment to partner countries, especially given the depletion of funds for new aid packages. It is also possible that the M60s are destined for other U.S. government entities or foreign allies. The origins of this contract remain unclear, but it reflects a renewed interest in a weapon that had largely been retired from active service in the United States. As the defense community speculates about the final destination of these machine guns, more details may emerge in the coming months, shedding light on the motivations behind this unexpected acquisition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-orders-retired-m60-machine-guns-mystery-surrounds-recipient	2024-10-01T04:49:52-07:00

The four Mark VI boats will offer advanced capabilities for unconventional warfare, ideal for the Aegean's island-dense environment. Greece already operates four Mark V boats, delivered by the U.S. in 2020, which have proven highly effective as force multipliers in amphibious operations. The Mark VI, measuring 25.8 meters in length, can carry a crew of 10 plus eight additional personnel. For special operations, the crew size can be reduced to accommodate fully equipped commandos. With modern systems, including infrared and thermal cameras, the Mark VI boats can serve as mini-command centers, ideal for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. These patrol boats come armed with two remotely operated Mk 38 Mod 2 25mm guns and can carry up to six M2 .50 caliber machine guns, along with M240 and M134 machine guns, and Mk 19 grenade launchers. Their aluminum hull allows them to reach speeds of 45 knots (over 80 km/h) with a range of up to 750 nautical miles (1,400 km) at cruising speeds of 25 knots. The vessels also have the capacity to carry small rubber boats and drones, such as the Switchblade 600, which Greece plans to acquire soon. Aegean Sea The Aegean Sea is dotted with over 2,000 islands and islets, many of which are located near Turkey’s coastline. This creates a challenging operational landscape for the Hellenic Armed Forces, particularly for patrolling, defense, and logistical support. The islands vary in size and infrastructure, complicating efforts to defend them and respond to emergencies or threats. The scattered nature of these islands also presents difficulties in maintaining a rapid and coordinated military presence, especially in remote areas. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes in the Aegean over territorial waters, airspace, and the continental shelf. Turkey's frequent military provocations, including airspace violations and naval exercises near Greek islands, continuously challenge Greece’s sovereignty. The need to defend Greek airspace and territorial waters from encroachments requires constant vigilance, with the Hellenic Air Force and Navy often engaging in intercept missions. The Aegean is a vital maritime corridor, not only for Greece but for Europe. The region faces threats from illegal activities such as smuggling, human trafficking, and illicit fishing operations. The Aegean has also been a key route for migrants and refugees, putting additional pressure on the Hellenic Coast Guard and Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/greek-military-to-acquire-four-mark-vi-patrol-boats-for-special-operations-in-aegean	2024-10-01T04:44:30-07:00	
South Korea's new Hyunmoo-V monster missile promises nuclear-like destruction with nine-ton warhead	On October 1, 2024, South Korea unveiled its latest strategic missile, the Hyunmoo-V, during the Armed Forces Day parade commemorating the 76th anniversary of the military's founding. The event featured approximately 5,000 troops and nearly 100 pieces of heavy military equipment, marching through downtown Seoul. Streets were closed to accommodate tens of thousands of spectators, and a U.S. B-1B Lancer bomber made a rare flight over the capital, highlighting the close military ties between South Korea and the United States.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hyunmoo-V missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) Described by Seoul as a retaliatory weapon aimed at countering threats from North Korea, the Hyunmoo-V (nicknamed the 'monster missile' due to its capabilities) is capable of carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons. This substantial warhead is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. With a total weight of 36 tons and a thrust of 75 tons, the Hyunmoo-V follows a 'lofted trajectory,' flying through the exosphere to enhance its penetration capability before descending upon its target at speeds ten times faster than the speed of sound. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, noted that the missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. The missile employs a unique cold-launch system, using compressed gas to propel it before ignition. This technique minimizes damage to the launcher and increases operational stability due to the missile's powerful solid propellant. Referred to as 'High Power Missiles' (HPM) by Seoul, both the Hyunmoo-IV-1 and Hyunmoo-V are designed to penetrate deeply buried command centers by detonating above underground facilities, effectively burying them. The exact maximum range of the Hyunmoo-V remains undisclosed, but experts speculate it could potentially reach distances of up to 3,000 kilometers or more, placing it in the category of intermediate-range missiles. Comparisons have been drawn to the U.S. Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile in terms of warhead weight and thrust, although the Hyunmoo-V is believed to be a two-stage missile. Carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons, the Hyunmoo-V is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. (Picture source: South Korean MoD) Hanwha Aerospace is the manufacturer of the Hyunmoo missiles, which are all equipped with evasion systems to counteract enemy air defense systems. The South Korean Strategic Command plans to have more than 200 Hyunmoo-V missiles alone. In addition to the V-series, new variants of the Hyunmoo-II, III, and IV missiles are being developed and mass-produced. South Korea refers to these missiles as 'Extreme Precision, High Power Missiles' or 'Ultra-powerful ballistic missiles,' rather than using conventional designations like Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile or intercontinental ballistic missile. There are also plans to mount the Hyunmoo-V missiles on the Joint Support Ship, which is described as the world's first arsenal ship. In early 2024, South Korea announced that it had successfully tested the Hyunmoo-V missile. Information about missile tests is often disclosed through Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), which are notifications issued to ensure airspace safety during missile-related activities. Analyses of NOTAMs suggest that the Hyunmoo-V tests likely took place on December 26 or 27, 2023, near Jeongjuk-Ri village on the west coast. The tests targeted a group of islands approximately 185 kilometers south of the launch point, a distance comparable to that between Seoul and Pyongyang. The public unveiling of these missiles aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. This system comprises three components: the 'Kill Chain,' the Korean Air and Missile Defense system (KAMD), and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan (KMPR). The public unveiling of both the Hyunmoo and L-SAM missile launchers aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) The 'Kill Chain' component focuses on swift detection and engagement of North Korean missile threats, aiming to target nuclear and missile facilities before they can launch. It is said to have the capability to target mobile missile launchers within 30 minutes. The KAMD system is responsible for intercepting incoming missiles, providing a multi-layered defense for critical facilities and population centers. It employs the domestically produced Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) as an upper-tier interceptor capable of intercepting projectiles at altitudes up to 60 kilometers. The Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan serves as a deterrent strategy, assuming that a North Korean attack has already been initiated. In such an event, South Korea would retaliate with a combination of precision missiles, advanced aircraft, and potentially special operations forces. The objectives would include countervalue and counterforce targets, as well as leadership decapitation strikes. These defense systems integrate capabilities across different branches of the South Korean military. The Army's Strategic Missile Command operates the Hyunmoo family of missiles in both the 'Kill Chain' and retaliation roles. The Air Force employs PAC-3 systems, F-35A jets, and Global Hawk surveillance aircraft. The Navy utilizes 3,000-ton submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles and KDX-III Aegis destroyers with SM-2 missiles. Future plans include integrating military surveillance satellites, cyber warfare units, space-focused forces, and special forces units into the defense network.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-koreas-new-hyunmoo-v-monster-missile-promises-nuclear-like-destruction-with-nine-ton-warhead	2024-10-01T04:30:57-07:00

Netherlands signs contract with Naval Group for four Barracuda-class submarines in major defense deal	According to a PR published by Naval Group on September 30, 2024, the Netherlands Ministry of Defense has signed a contract with Naval Group for the delivery of four Barracuda-class expeditionary submarines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Dutch Barracuda-class submarine. (Picture source: Naval Group) The agreement, formalized by Dutch State Secretary for Defence Gijs Tuinman and Naval Group CEO Pierre Eric Pommellet, took place at the Directie Materiële Instandhouding (DMI) in Den Helder, marking the official launch of the Orka-class program, which will replace the Royal Netherlands Navy’s aging Walrus-class submarines. The contract follows a rigorous evaluation and bidding process conducted by the Materiel and IT Command (COMMIT), which determined that Naval Group’s Orka-class submarines were the best solution for the Netherlands' future underwater capabilities. The program will enhance the Netherlands' strategic autonomy and deepen cooperation between the Dutch maritime industry and Naval Group, particularly in the development and maintenance of submarine systems over the next two decades. About the program Before Naval Group was selected, the Dutch government extensively evaluated the proposals from TKMS and Saab Kockums. TKMS, a German company, offered a design based on its Type 212/214 submarines, which are widely regarded for their advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. These submarines are noted for their ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing, making them ideal for covert operations in shallow waters such as the Baltic Sea. Saab Kockums, on the other hand, presented a modified version of its A26 submarine, which is designed with modularity in mind and includes an AIP system. The A26’s strength lies in its versatility, allowing it to be configured for a wide range of missions, including intelligence gathering, anti-submarine warfare, and special forces operations. Saab Kockums also promised to heavily involve Dutch industry in its proposal, which was a crucial requirement for the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Both TKMS and Saab Kockums had strong offerings, and their submarines are well-regarded in the global market. However, Naval Group's proposal was ultimately deemed to offer superior capabilities for the Netherlands’ specific needs. One of the decisive factors was the ability of Naval Group to deliver a blue-water, ocean-going submarine capable of extended missions far from Dutch waters, while also ensuring long-term cooperation with Dutch industry. From a strategic standpoint, the Dutch government viewed the Naval Group’s Barracuda-class submarines as the best fit for NATO’s broader requirements. The Barracuda design is well-suited to both high-end warfare and intelligence operations in distant waters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/netherlands-signs-contract-with-naval-group-for-four-barracuda-class-submarines-in-major-defense-deal	2024-10-01T00:04:14-07:00	
Taiwan warns of escalating Chinese military drills in Taiwan Strait	According to information published by Liberty Times Net September 30, 2024, the Chinese military has been conducting increasingly frequent exercises around Taiwan, with military aircraft and naval vessels regularly intruding near the island.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Tuo Chiang-class corvette Tuo Chiang. (Picture source: Taiwanese Ministry of Defense) In a recent report from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, officials warn that China aims to 'internalize' the Taiwan Strait by combining military actions with law enforcement operations, such as deploying Chinese coast guard vessels to patrol Taiwan's eastern waters. The report outlines four key tactics China has employed to pressure Taiwan. These include joint readiness patrols, gray zone tactics, large-scale targeted military drills, and coordinated training operations. Among these tactics, joint readiness patrols have been a recurring feature, with Chinese forces conducting combined air and naval operations three to four times a month. These actions, according to the Ministry of Defense, are intended to intensify the military threat against Taiwan. Following an incident in the waters near Kinmen and Xiamen earlier this year, Chinese coast guard patrols have also increased in the areas surrounding Taiwan's outlying islands, such as Kinmen and Matsu. Notably, during large-scale military drills held on May 23-24, China organized coast guard patrols in Taiwan’s eastern waters under the guise of law enforcement, furthering its goal of asserting control over the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese defense officials also foresee the integration of China's new 'Coast Guard Law,' which authorizes the use of force by Chinese coast guard units during maritime operations. They predict that China will increasingly resort to a combination of legal, cognitive, and gray zone warfare tactics to harass Taiwan. The report also highlights recent activities involving China's aircraft carrier Shandong, which completed its 36th training mission from June 22 to July 23, traversing the South China Sea and Western Pacific. The Shandong was accompanied by various warplanes, including the H-6K bomber, conducting joint training across the island chains stretching to Taiwan’s southwest and the Western Pacific. These activities are part of China’s effort to demonstrate its capabilities in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies through planned joint training. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has concluded that China is testing its ability to both invade Taiwan and counter potential foreign intervention by combining conventional and unconventional tactics. In response, Taiwan's military remains on high alert, employing intelligence and surveillance systems to monitor Chinese military movements.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-warns-of-escalating-chinese-military-drills-in-taiwan-strait	2024-09-30T07:22:01-07:00	
South Korean Intelligence Warns North Korea Capable of Building Double-Digit Nuclear Arsenal	According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), North Korea has accumulated enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to build a 'double-digit' number of nuclear bombs, as reported by Reuters. This information, revealed during a closed-door parliamentary briefing, has heightened concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities. The briefing followed recent public statements by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un regarding the expansion of his nuclear arsenal, as well as the rare disclosure earlier this month of a secret uranium enrichment facility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States (Picture source: KCNA) The intelligence report estimates that North Korea possesses around 70 kilograms of plutonium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons, along with a significant, though unspecified, amount of weapons-grade uranium. Combined, these materials would be sufficient to produce at least ten nuclear bombs. These developments align with North Korea’s broader goal of 'exponentially' increasing its stockpile of nuclear weapons, as recently stated by Kim Jong-un. North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic programs continue to advance, with significant improvements in terms of accuracy and power. The South Korean intelligence agency also highlighted North Korea’s progress in missile technology, particularly in developing more precise and powerful systems capable of targeting South Korea. The NIS has not ruled out the possibility of a seventh nuclear test, speculating that such an event could take place after the U.S. presidential election in November. Kim Jong-un’s visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute in September underscored North Korea’s ambitions to further expand its nuclear arsenal. This visit, which included an inspection of facilities producing military-grade nuclear materials, reinforced the regime’s commitment to strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities. These actions come despite long-standing international sanctions and diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. South Korea and its allies are closely monitoring these developments, concerned about the growing threat posed by North Korea’s expanding nuclear capabilities. This concern is heightened by Pyongyang’s continued missile testing and development, including those designed to carry nuclear warheads. In response to the increasing obsolescence of its conventional military capabilities, North Korea has focused for decades on developing asymmetric capabilities and weapons of mass destruction, including long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The country has a range of short- and medium-range missiles, such as the Scud and No-Dong missiles, along with more modern systems like the KN-23 and KN-25. Significant advancements include the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-14, with a range of 10,400 km, and the Hwasong-15, still in development, with an estimated range between 8,500 and 13,000 km. North Korea has also made progress in miniaturizing its nuclear weapons, allowing them to be integrated into its ballistic missiles. The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States. Continued development of ballistic missile and nuclear technologies remains central to Pyongyang’s strategy to deter external intervention and ensure the regime’s survival. The latest intelligence assessments suggest that North Korea now has the capacity to produce a significant number of nuclear weapons, with further advancements expected in the near future. As the regime continues to progress in both nuclear and missile domains, regional security dynamics are likely to face increasing pressure. The possibility of further nuclear tests and the expansion of North Korea’s arsenal remain key concerns for South Korea and the international community.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korean-intelligence-warns-north-korea-capable-of-building-double-digit-nuclear-arsenal	2024-09-30T06:56:03-07:00	
Taiwan adopts non-lethal ammunition to strengthen maritime law enforcement against gray zone tactics	According to information published by Liberty Times Net on September 28, 2024, Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) is adopting new measures to improve maritime law enforcement, in response to increasing gray zone tactics employed by Chinese forces, which include frequent incursions into Taiwan's air and maritime zones as well as the deployment of Chinese Coast Guard vessels.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Anping-class offshore patrol vessel. (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) Senior government officials have confirmed that the Executive Yuan has approved a three-year pilot program to procure non-lethal ammunition and equipment, aiming to boost enforcement capabilities. Starting in fiscal year 2025, the program will trial the use of non-lethal munitions, such as high-decibel shock rounds, which will be compatible with the Zhenhai rocket system aboard the CGA’s 600-ton vessels. These vessels are currently equipped with domestically produced 2.75-inch rockets capable of launching high-explosive, armor-piercing, and cluster munitions—powerful weapons deemed unsuitable for standard law enforcement operations in Taiwan's waters. The new non-lethal options, designed to deter rather than destroy, are intended to be safer alternatives during such operations. According to military sources, these shock rounds will emit a loud noise upon detonation, creating a psychological deterrent. Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology will work with the CGA to produce and supply these rounds according to the approved annual plan. The project has an allocated budget of NT$86.24 million (approximately USD 2.7 million) and is scheduled to be implemented over the next three years. Besides shock rounds, the procurement plan also includes 40mm flashbangs, single-shot 40mm grenade launchers, and other non-lethal firearms. Depending on the results of the trial, the program may be expanded in future years. The Zhenhai rocket system, developed by Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute, is a remotely controlled weapon platform with six launchers capable of firing various 2.75-inch rockets with an effective range of up to 5 kilometers and a maximum range of 10 kilometers. Currently, the system is configured to launch high-explosive, armor-piercing, cluster munitions, and flares for search and rescue operations. About the Anping class The Anping-class offshore patrol vessels have a displacement of 750 tons and measure 65.4 meters in overall length, with a waterline length of 60.7 meters. The vessels have a beam of 14.8 meters and a draft of 2.1 meters. Powered by two MTU 20V4000M93L engines driving four Hamilton HT900 waterjet propulsion systems, the ships produce a total output of 8,600 kW.

They carry a crew of 30 personnel and are equipped with two electro-optical fire control systems, as well as X-band and S-band navigation radars. The vessels are also fitted with a FLIR SeaFLIR 280-HD infrared camera for surveillance.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-adopts-non-lethal-ammunition-to-strengthen-maritime-law-enforcement-against-gray-zone-tactics	2024-09-30T06:23:18-07:00	
New stage in US military support for Taiwan $567 million to counter Beijing	U.S. President Joe Biden has approved $567 million in new support to strengthen Taiwan's defense, the White House announced. This decision aligns with Washington's commitment to support the self-governed island in response to growing tensions with China. Although the United States does not officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, it remains its most important international ally and arms supplier, a point of frequent contention with Beijing. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly demanded that Washington stop selling arms to Taipei, accusing the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Taiwanese Army's Third, Fourth, and Fifth Operational Zones conducted heavy artillery firing exercises in August 2024 (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) In a brief statement, the White House indicated that Biden had delegated authority to the Secretary of State 'to direct the provision of defense articles and services from the Department of Defense, as well as military education and training, for assistance of up to $567 million for Taiwan.' No further details were provided about the specific nature of this latest aid package. This initiative follows a previous military assistance package approved in April 2024, during a period when China intensified its political and military pressures on the island. That multi-billion-dollar aid aimed to bolster Taiwan’s defense capabilities amid increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing. Although U.S. support for Taiwan is informal diplomatically, it represents a major source of friction in U.S.-China relations. Taiwan has repeatedly expressed concerns over delays in the delivery of certain military equipment from the United States, including modernized F-16 fighter jets. Nevertheless, Washington continues to provide significant military aid to the island to enhance its ability to face a potential Chinese invasion. The approval of this new $567 million assistance reaffirms the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Taiwan's defense amid growing challenges posed by China. Before the approval of the $567 million aid package in September 2024, the United States had already sent several significant military deliveries to Taiwan. One of the most notable was a $345 million package approved in 2023, which included air defense systems such as Patriot PAC-3 missiles aimed at strengthening the island’s missile defense capabilities. In addition to these systems, Washington also provided munitions, including AGM-88 HARM missiles designed to target enemy radar, as well as long-range artillery munitions. The U.S. also delivered M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, which offer enhanced mobility on the battlefield, allowing Taiwan to improve its response to ground attacks. These deliveries are part of the ongoing efforts to bolster Taiwan's defense capabilities amid increasing military threats from China.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/new-stage-in-us-military-support-for-taiwan-567-million-to-counter-beijing	2024-09-30T05:23:57-07:00

AUKUS advancing Indo-Pacific security with nuclear submarines and emerging tech, Austin reports	According to information published by the US DoD on September 26, 2024, the trilateral security alliance known as AUKUS, consisting of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, is rapidly advancing military capabilities and deterrence strategies in the Indo-Pacific region, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. During a recent meeting in London with his counterparts, British Defense Secretary John Healey and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles, Austin emphasized the progress made under the partnership.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Australian Minister for Defence Richard Marles, the UK Ministry of Defence John Healey and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. (Picture source: US DoD) One of AUKUS's key objectives is to equip Australia with conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Austin highlighted that over the past year, efforts have been accelerated, with more Australian sailors receiving specialized training at U.S. and U.K. nuclear reactor schools. Additionally, a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine made a port visit to Australia, marking an early milestone toward establishing Australia's sovereign submarine capability. Austin also outlined plans for a rotational deployment of U.S. submarines to Australia, which could begin as early as 2027. He reiterated the United States’ commitment to assisting Australia in developing the skilled workforce needed to operate and maintain these advanced submarines. The AUKUS partnership is structured around two main pillars. The first aims to ensure that Australia acquires nuclear-powered submarine capability by the early 2030s. The second pillar focuses on accelerating cutting-edge military technologies such as uncrewed maritime systems, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and hypersonics. Japan has committed to contributing to the development of maritime autonomy, while discussions with Canada, South Korea, and New Zealand are ongoing regarding their potential involvement in these emerging technologies. In addition to these advancements, the AUKUS nations have committed to easing export controls to enhance secure trade within the partnership. This includes the sale of U.S. Virginia-class submarines to Australia. Recent legislative changes under the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act have amended export regulations, providing exemptions for Australia and the United Kingdom, further facilitating defense cooperation. Background From a geopolitical perspective, China has been vocal in its opposition, framing AUKUS as a destabilizing move that exacerbates regional tensions and threatens to spark an arms race. This has added fuel to the existing rivalry between China and the U.S. over influence in the Pacific, with Beijing accusing the pact of adopting a 'Cold War mentality' that undermines the nuclear non-proliferation regime. This sentiment resonates with some Pacific nations, many of which are wary of nuclear-powered submarines in their waters, especially given the region's history of nuclear testing and its commitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone. Countries like Fiji and the Solomon Islands have expressed concerns, suggesting that the presence of such vessels contradicts the ideals of peace in the Pacific, raising further diplomatic hurdles for Australia in maintaining regional relations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/aukus-advancing-indo-pacific-security-with-nuclear-submarines-and-emerging-tech-austin-reports	2024-09-30T02:14:00-07:00

Following the completion of these trials, the Auguste Techer will set sail for its home port in Port des Galets, located on the island of La Réunion.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Felix Eboue class (POM) offshore patrol vessel Auguste Techer. (Picture source: French MoD) France's naval strategy in the Indo-Pacific is anchored in its significant territorial presence, sovereignty interests, and its broader geopolitical goals. With 1.65 million French citizens living in the region and vast territories in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, France sees itself as an Indo-Pacific power. Its strategy focuses on several key areas: maintaining territorial integrity, ensuring freedom of navigation, and promoting regional stability through multilateralism and alliances. One of the primary objectives is to protect France's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the second largest in the world, from threats like illegal fishing and maritime crime. To do so, France has permanently deployed about 7,000 military personnel along with 20 naval vessels and 40 aircraft, spread across bases in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and La Réunion. These forces are tasked with defending France’s sovereignty, providing disaster relief, and supporting international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which ensures freedom of navigation across global waters. Given the rising tensions between major powers like the United States and China, France has increased its naval deployments, regularly sending frigates and surveillance ships through strategic waterways like the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. French forces also collaborate with key regional allies, including India, Japan, Australia, and the United States, participating in major maritime exercises such as RIMPAC and strengthening diplomatic and defense ties. The French Navy also plays a critical role in countering narcotics trafficking and illegal fishing, using advanced maritime domain awareness tools like satellite imagery and electronic surveillance to monitor its waters. Despite this, France faces challenges in sustaining its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific due to resource constraints. Its naval assets in the region are often stretched thin, and many of its vessels require modernization. Efforts are underway to address these issues, including the procurement of new patrol vessels and the upgrade of surveillance frigates, but there remains a gap between France’s strategic objectives and its current capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navys-offshore-patrol-vessel-auguste-techer-completes-first-sea-trials	2024-09-30T00:35:01-07:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Azerbaijan conducted a military operation on September 19, 2023, to gain control over the remaining parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a territory mainly inhabited by Armenians but located within Azerbaijan’s borders. The operation raised concerns about potential broader violence and led to a significant displacement of Armenians fearing reprisals. Russian peacekeepers were killed during the fighting, but Russia did not intervene. Azerbaijan's economic position, partly influenced by the Ukraine war's effects on natural gas exports to the European Union, has allowed it to expand its military capabilities. The country has acquired military equipment from Turkiye, such as upgrading Su-25 combat aircraft, and from Israel, acquiring a remote-sensing satellite and additional Barak air defense systems. Azerbaijan plans to increase military spending by around 6% in 2024, reaching approximately USD 3.8 billion. Armenia has also increased its defense spending, with a budget of USD 1.28 billion in 2023, a 46% rise compared to the previous year, and plans to expand it to about USD 1.4 billion in 2024. Due to delays in Russian arms deliveries, affected by Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, Armenia has sought alternative suppliers, including India, signing contracts for 155mm ATAGS towed howitzers, Pinaka multiple-launch rocket systems, and Akash air defense systems. Additionally, Armenia is transitioning toward NATO-standard artillery, incorporating Western military education systems and command approaches. Armenia has distanced itself from Russia's security role, as Moscow did not intervene during the 2022 border conflict with Azerbaijan. This led Armenia to invite an EU monitoring mission, comprising 103 civilian members, while Armenia has effectively halted its participation in CSTO activities. Azerbaijan's armed forces, consisting of 64,050 active personnel (57,800 in the Army, 1,750 in the Navy, and 8,650 in the Air Force) and 300,000 reservists, focus mainly on territorial defense. Azerbaijan maintains a conscript-based system, with service terms of 18 months (12 for graduates). The country has shifted from reliance on Russian military support to establishing defense ties with Israel, Turkiye, and Pakistan, signing agreements such as the 2021 'Shusha Declaration' with Turkiye and engaging in joint exercises like the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk-2023 in October 2023. Additionally, Azerbaijan signed bilateral defense cooperation agreements with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 2023 and has developed limited but expanding domestic defense-industrial capabilities through its Ministry of Defence Industry. Azerbaijan has acquired various military equipment from Israel, including dozens of Plasan Sandcat armored vehicles, a remote-sensing satellite, and Barak air defense systems.

Heavy Air Transport: DARPA Seeks a Drone with Twice Lifting Power of CH-53K King Stallion	The U.S. Department of Defense, through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), has recently launched an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing heavy air transport. This initiative, named 'Cost Efficient Cargo,' explores the design of an autonomous drone capable of carrying up to 31.75 tons of cargo, which is double the lifting capacity of the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter, currently in service with the U.S. Marine Corps. Unlike the King Stallion, this drone would not be designed for long-range missions but rather for moving heavy loads between ships and beaches or crossing rivers and other natural obstacles inland.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marines with Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron (VMX) 1 transport a Light Armored Vehicle 25 with a CH-53K King Stallion helicopter over Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, April 27, 2022 (Picture source: US-DoD) DARPA recently issued a Request for Information (RFI), seeking innovative proposals for uncrewed heavy-lift systems capable of carrying a 70,000-pound payload (around 35 tons). This RFI specifies that the drone must utilize existing engine and transmission technologies while deviating from systems currently employed by traditional helicopters. The intended operational range for this drone would be 25 miles (40.23 km), flying at an altitude of 500 feet between the cargo pickup point and its destination, with a return trip to the base. This project is driven by the growing logistical needs of the U.S. military, particularly in high-intensity conflict scenarios against adversaries with significant anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, such as China. Amphibious and airborne operations, where troops and equipment must be rapidly moved from sea to land, increasingly face natural or artificial obstacles such as ravines, rivers, or destroyed bridges. Currently, these barriers are often overcome through engineering solutions like floating bridges or amphibious vehicles, but these methods are time-consuming and provide adversaries with the opportunity to mount counterattacks. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project aims to address the urgent need for faster and more efficient heavy-lift transport, particularly in scenarios where swift execution is critical to establishing a beachhead or crossing contested areas. Although the CH-53K can lift an impressive 36,000 pounds (16.33 tons), it remains costly, with a unit price of approximately $118 million. Additionally, current solutions, while effective, are limited in range, cost, and vulnerability to enemy defenses. The CH-53K King Stallion prepares for take-off during sea trials in June 2020 on the USS Wasp (LHD-1) (Picture source: US DoD) DARPA is considering a variety of configurations for this future heavy-lift drone, including hybrid propulsion systems powered by internal combustion engines, electric motors, or a combination of both. While autonomous capabilities are desired, they are not the immediate focus of this RFI. The main goal is to identify groundbreaking concepts and mitigate risks through scaled-down prototypes before investing in full-scale development. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the importance of overcoming obstacles and rapidly maneuvering forces, underscoring the vulnerabilities of static infrastructure like temporary bridges, which are often exposed to precision strikes and real-time surveillance. Similarly, in a potential conflict with adversaries like China, U.S. amphibious capabilities could be hampered by anti-ship missiles, limiting the proximity of landing ships to shore. The heavy-lift drone proposed by DARPA is designed to overcome these challenges by facilitating the rapid transfer of cargo from ships at sea to land or across obstacles such as rivers and canyons inland. The concept includes the possibility of transporting 40-foot ISO containers (12.19 meters) or even armored vehicles like the M2 Bradley. However, while the Bradley's combat weight is approximately 80,000 pounds (36.29 tons), which slightly exceeds the drone’s projected capacity, DARPA anticipates that these vehicles could be transported empty, without ammunition or fuel, reducing their weight. The logistical challenges facing the U.S. military, particularly in the rapid transport of heavy equipment in contested environments, have prompted the exploration of solutions such as this drone project. DARPA acknowledges that this program could significantly change how the U.S. military deploys its forces and equipment, especially in distributed operations at sea and on land, where flexibility and speed are essential. While questions remain about the actual efficiency of a fleet of high-lift drones, particularly in terms of cost and their ability to meet operational demand, this project reflects the growing need for innovative logistical solutions in the U.S. armed forces. In the long term, this drone could integrate into the future air mobility ecosystem of the U.S. military, addressing increasingly complex operational requirements. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project marks a significant step in the development of the U.S. military’s heavy-lift air transport capabilities. This drone, capable of lifting twice the load of the King Stallion, offers an opportunity to enhance military maneuvers by increasing the speed, flexibility, and resilience of U.S. ground and amphibious forces in the face of increasingly sophisticated adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/heavy-air-transport-darpa-seeks-a-drone-with-twice-lifting-power-of-ch-53k-king-stallion	2024-09-30T00:24:17-07:00

China Unveils Cutting-Edge ZTZ-99 Tank Upgrade with Advanced Active Protection System	The ZTZ-99 is the latest generation of Chinese main battle tanks, representing the most advanced armor technology produced domestically by China. It stands as a symbol of China's military modernization, equipped with cutting-edge systems for firepower, mobility, and protection. A recent development, as shared by 'David Wang' on X (formerly Twitter) on September 19, 2024, reveals that China is currently developing a variant of the ZTZ-99 outfitted with an advanced Active Protection System (APS). This APS includes two projectile launchers and four fire control radars, similar to the GL-6 system, first revealed in 2022.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New Chinese-made ZTZ-99 MBT Main Battle Tank fitted with APS Active Protection System. (Picture source: X account David Wang) The ZTZ-99 main battle tank, also named Type 99, was developed in the 1990s by China as part of its broader effort to modernize its armored forces. Its design was influenced by earlier Soviet tank models, particularly the T-72, but it incorporates advanced technologies, making it one of the most sophisticated tanks in China’s arsenal. Development of the ZTZ-99 began in the late 1980s, and the first prototype was completed by 1993. After rigorous testing and refinements, the ZTZ-99 officially entered service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1999. It made its public debut during the National Day parade in 1999, signaling China’s commitment to fielding a modern, competitive armored force. Regarding combat capabilities, the ZTZ-99 is equipped with a 125mm smoothbore cannon, capable of firing APFSDS rounds, HEAT shells, and ATGMs, enabling it to engage heavily armored vehicles at various ranges. The tank is protected by advanced composite armor and explosive reactive armor (ERA), designed to defend against high-explosive and kinetic threats. Recent variants of the ZTZ-99 have integrated an Active Protection System (APS), like the GL-6, which offers hard-kill protection by intercepting incoming missiles or projectiles. The tank is powered by a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 80 km/h, ensuring excellent mobility on diverse terrain. This combination of firepower, protection, and speed solidifies the ZTZ-99's role as a highly capable and modern main battle tank​. The GL-6 Active Protection System (APS) is a hard-kill defense system developed by China, primarily designed to protect armored vehicles from incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. It is similar in function to other APS like Israel's 'Iron Fist.' The GL-6 system is integrated into vehicles such as the VT-4A1 main battle tank and offers advanced interception capabilities. It uses radar to detect and neutralize threats by launching countermeasures that destroy or deflect incoming missiles before they can strike the vehicle. The GL-6 is a significant upgrade over earlier models like the GL-5, offering better performance and modular features that allow it to be adapted to various platforms. The system effectively counters anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and high-explosive projectiles, making it a valuable asset in modern armored warfare. In terms of performance, the GL-6 can intercept multiple types of threats from various angles, adding a layer of survivability for vehicles like the VT-4A1 and potentially the VN-22 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), although its functionality on the latter is still debated and may be limited to experimental or demonstration purposes Adding the APS to the ZTZ-99 tank is a game-changer for its defensive capabilities. An APS is designed to provide 'hard-kill' protection, which means it actively intercepts and destroys incoming anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and other high-velocity projectiles before they can hit the tank. The two APS projectile launchers and radar system work in tandem to detect and neutralize threats, providing 360-degree coverage. This level of protection enhances the tank's survivability in both offensive and defensive operations, especially in environments where advanced anti-tank weaponry is deployed. By adding this advanced APS, the ZTZ-99 becomes far more resistant to modern anti-armor threats, ensuring it can remain operational on the battlefield even when facing the latest missile and projectile systems. The GL-6 system, in particular, is known for its efficiency in intercepting multiple threats simultaneously, further increasing the tank's durability in combat. These improvements make the ZTZ-99 not only a powerful offensive machine, with its 125mm smoothbore gun capable of firing various munitions, but also a highly resilient vehicle, able to withstand a wide range of battlefield threats. This development aligns with China's strategic focus on enhancing the survivability and effectiveness of its armored forces, allowing the ZTZ-99 to maintain its cutting-edge position among global main battle tanks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-unveils-cutting-edge-ztz-99-tank-upgrade-with-advanced-active-protection-system	2024-09-27T10:18:47-07:00

Kachin Independence Army attacks Myanmar Navy vessel on Irrawaddy River	According to information published by Clash Report on September 26, 2024, a Myanmar Navy convoy traveling along the Irrawaddy River was ambushed by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Myanmar Navy vessel hit by recoilless rifles. (Picture source: Twitter account of Clash Report) KIA forces reportedly hit at least two naval vessels, halting them temporarily before they were towed to the nearby area of Tigyaing. The assault occurred as the convoy, consisting of several ships, was making its way upriver, likely to transport supplies and military equipment to junta-controlled territories further north. This recent attack is part of an ongoing pattern of guerrilla warfare tactics employed by the KIA, one of Myanmar’s largest ethnic armed groups, which has been engaged in an armed struggle against the military for decades. The KIA's involvement in the current conflict intensified following the February 2021 military coup, which led to widespread civil unrest and armed resistance across the country. Ethnic armed groups like the KIA, once focused primarily on local autonomy, have since aligned more closely with anti-junta forces, including the People’s Defense Forces (PDF), in opposition to the regime. The Irrawaddy River, Myanmar’s largest and most vital waterway, has become a key battleground in this struggle. Control of the river allows the military to transport troops, supplies, and weapons to remote areas, and in turn, it has become a target for anti-regime groups seeking to disrupt these movements.
