Croatia begins live fire training on US-supplied M2A2 Bradley fighting vehicles to increase combat readiness	As reported by the Croatian Ministry of Defense on March 7, 2025, the Croatian Army’s 1st Armoured Mechanised Battalion, nicknamed Sokolovi, conducted live-fire exercises with US-supplied M2A2 ODS Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles at the Gašinci Military Training Grounds near Đakovo. These exercises were part of a multi-week training cycle involving daytime and nighttime firing. The Croatian crews operated the vehicles using the 25x137 mm M242 Bushmaster chain gun and the 7.62x51 mm M240 coaxial machine gun. According to information released by the Croatian Ministry of Defence, accuracy was maintained under both lighting conditions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link As demonstrated in Ukraine, the Bradley's M242 Bushmaster chain gun is able to engage a range of targets, including Soviet-designed BMPs and modern Russian T-90M tanks. (Picture source: Croatian MoD) The training followed the delivery of the first four M2A2 ODS Bradley vehicles to Croatia on January 14, 2025. These vehicles were received at the Našić barracks as part of a $196.4 million acquisition agreement, which includes a $51.2 million contribution from the United States. A further four vehicles were scheduled to arrive by the end of January. The program includes a total of 89 vehicles, with deliveries planned to conclude by 2026. The allocation comprises 62 vehicles for operational units, primarily for the Sokolovi Battalion of the Guards Armored Mechanized Brigade, five vehicles for training, and the remaining vehicles intended for spare parts. The vehicles provided to Croatia are based on the baseline M2A2 ODS variant, which lacks some systems included in the more advanced ODS-SA version, such as second-generation forward-looking infrared sensors and the Driver’s Vision Enhancer. Nonetheless, Croatian Bradleys have undergone refurbishments at the Đuro Đaković facility. These include overhauls of drivetrains, integration of weapon systems, application of protective coatings, and upgrades to engines, transmissions, electronic components, and communication systems. TOW anti-tank missile launchers were also installed to enhance anti-armor capability. Croatia initiated the Bradley procurement program in 2022 to replace its BVP M-80 infantry fighting vehicles. The BVP M-80, a Yugoslav-designed vehicle developed in the 1970s, entered service in 1979 following the completion of its prototype in 1974. It is based on a BMP-1-style design and features a 20mm M-55 autocannon, a coaxial 7.62mm machine gun, and a launcher for 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank missiles. It has a three-person crew and can carry seven dismounted troops. Powered initially by a 260-horsepower French engine and later by a 320-horsepower Daimler-Benz engine in the M-80A version, it can reach 65 km/h on land and 8 km/h in water, with a range of approximately 500 kilometers. The M2 Bradley was developed in the United States during the Cold War to address the Soviet BMP series. Introduced in the early 1980s, the M2 IFV and M3 CFV variants were designed to transport infantry while operating alongside M1 Abrams main battle tanks. The vehicles are armed with a 25mm M242 Bushmaster autocannon, a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, and TOW anti-tank missiles. The ODS-SA variant features upgraded armor to withstand 30mm armor-piercing ammunition and RPGs, a 600-horsepower engine, GPS-based navigation, 360-degree camera coverage, an eye-safe laser rangefinder, and a combat identification system. These systems are intended to improve performance in close-quarters and urban combat. In recent conflicts, including in Ukraine, Bradleys have been used to engage a range of targets, including Soviet-designed BMPs and modern T-90M tanks. The delivery of Bradleys is part of Croatia’s broader military modernization plan, which also includes other major acquisitions. In April 2024, Croatia received the first six of twelve Dassault Rafale multirole fighters from France to replace its MiG-21s, with the remaining six expected by 2025. The country is also pursuing the acquisition of up to 50 Leopard 2A8 tanks from Germany, while donating M-84 tanks, RAK-SA-12 multiple launch rocket systems, and two AN-32B transport aircraft to Ukraine. Additionally, the procurement of eight U.S.-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) is underway. These programs are part of Croatia’s alignment with NATO standards and are supported by long-term cooperation with the United States, including equipment transfers and bilateral programs such as the Minnesota–Croatia National Guard Partnership.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/croatia-begins-live-fire-training-on-us-supplied-m2a2-bradley-fighting-vehicles-to-increase-combat-readiness	2025-03-21T04:31:13-07:00	
Breaking News: British Navy Marks Major Step in Submarine Modernization with Keel-Laying of HMS Dreadnought	According to a statement published by the British Royal Navy of the United Kingdom on March 20, 2025, the British Royal Navy has marked a major milestone in the renewal of the nation’s nuclear deterrent with the keel-laying of HMS Dreadnought, the first in a fleet of four next-generation nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. The event, held at BAE Systems’ state-of-the-art submarine facility in Barrow-in-Furness, represents a significant step forward in what is the UK’s most advanced and complex naval program to date.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer leads the ceremonial keel-laying of HMS Dreadnought at BAE Systems’ Devonshire Dock Hall in Barrow-in-Furness, marking a major milestone in the UK’s next-generation nuclear submarine program. (Picture source: British Royal Navy) The symbolic ceremony, attended by British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, senior military leaders, and shipbuilding personnel, represents the official 'birth' of the vessel. Although modern submarine construction no longer follows traditional shipbuilding stages due to modular techniques, keel laying remains a ceremonial tradition that acknowledges the start of the vessel’s final assembly phase. HMS Dreadnought has been under construction in modular form for nearly a decade, with large sections already completed and now being integrated. The Dreadnought-class submarines will replace the Vanguard-class boats that have been in service since the 1990s. These new submarines will be larger, more stealthy, and significantly more advanced. Displacing over 17,000 tonnes—making them the largest submarines ever built for the Royal Navy—Dreadnought-class boats will measure around 153 meters in length, roughly the size of 14 double-decker buses. In terms of capabilities, the Dreadnought class introduces several technological enhancements over the current Vanguard-class, including improved stealth features enabled by next-generation acoustic quieting technologies, reducing detectability and enhancing survivability. They will also incorporate a new-generation PWR3 nuclear reactor, providing enhanced safety, reduced maintenance needs, and extended service intervals. The Dreadnought-class submarines will be equipped with digital command systems and a higher degree of automation, streamlining operations and reducing crew workload. For the first time in British Royal Navy submarines, adaptive lighting will simulate day-night cycles to improve crew well-being during extended underwater patrols. Each Dreadnought-class boat is expected to serve for over 30 years, ensuring the UK’s Continuous At-Sea Deterrent remains effective well into the 2060s. Compared to the Vanguard-class—comprising HMS Vanguard, Victorious, Vigilant, and Vengeance, which have been in service for between 27 and 33 years—the Dreadnought class represents a generational leap in submarine design and capability. Not only will the new boats offer greater survivability and endurance, but they also benefit from decades of operational experience and advancements in naval engineering. The Dreadnought program officially began following British Parliamentary approval in July 2016, and construction of the lead submarine started on October 6, 2016. It is being executed under a long-term contract led by BAE Systems, the UK’s leading defense contractor, in partnership with Rolls-Royce, which is providing the advanced PWR3 nuclear propulsion system. The British Ministry of Defence awarded a series of contracts for the program, with the most recent being a landmark £9 billion agreement signed with Rolls-Royce in January 2025. Known as the Unity contract, this eight-year deal covers design, manufacturing, and support for the nuclear reactors that will power the Dreadnought-class boats. The program is one of the most strategic and complex defense investments in British history, projected to exceed £30 billion, and is expected to create over 1,000 new jobs while safeguarding another 4,000 across the supply chain. The class will include four submarines in total: HMS Dreadnought, Valiant, Warspite, and King George VI. Each vessel is being built in 16 modular sections, which are then grouped into three massive 'mega units' and assembled within the Devonshire Dock Hall. The first mega block of HMS Dreadnought was delivered in late 2023, reflecting the scale and precision of the construction process. The lead submarine is expected to enter operational service in the early 2030s, with the remaining vessels delivered at intervals of no more than 36 months. To honour Barrow’s 150-year legacy of shipbuilding—125 years of which have been dedicated to submarine construction—His Majesty King Charles III has granted the honorary title Royal Port of Barrow. This recognition celebrates the town’s enduring role at the heart of the UK’s naval industrial base and its contribution to national defense. During the keel-laying ceremony, Prime Minister Starmer also met with crew members from HMS Agamemnon, the sixth Astute-class nuclear-powered attack submarine nearing completion. These submarines will form part of the multi-layered protection system for the UK's strategic deterrent, operating alongside RAF Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, Merlin Mk2 helicopters, Type 26 frigates, and a growing array of unmanned underwater vehicles and sensor networks. Earlier in the week, the Prime Minister, joined by the British Defence Secretary John Healey and First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key, boarded a returning Vanguard-class submarine at HM Naval Base Clyde for a 'Day Zero' visit. This high-level engagement served to express national gratitude to the submarine crew for their months of silent patrol and to thank their families for their strength and sacrifice. As HMS Dreadnought moves toward final assembly, the British Royal Navy is preparing to usher in a new era of strategic deterrence. These submarines represent the pinnacle of British naval innovation and commitment, combining cutting-edge technology, industrial strength, and a legacy of excellence to ensure the nation’s nuclear deterrent remains secure and effective for decades to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-british-navy-marks-major-step-in-submarine-modernization-with-keel-laying-of-hms-dreadnought	2025-03-21T04:14:25-07:00	
Saab delivers new Loke counter-drone system in record time to protect Swedish forces from low-cost threats	On 17 March 2025, the Swedish Air Force, the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), Saab, and associated partners completed a full evaluation of the Loke concept, a Counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (C-UAS) developed and tested in 84 days. This initiative was intended both to address evolving threats posed by unmanned aerial systems and to explore new methods for accelerating defence capability development. The project began as an industrial demonstration and transitioned into a time-limited development cycle to deliver a functional, scalable, and mobile system to Swedish Air Force combat units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Within the Swedish Armed Forces, the Loke will complement existing systems used for drone detection and disruption at the individual soldier level, particularly around airbases. (Picture source: Saab) Unmanned aerial systems have introduced new challenges to air defence due to their low cost, small size, autonomous operation, and ability to fly at low altitude with minimal signatures. These features enable them to evade traditional air defence systems, which are optimized to target manned aircraft and guided missiles. Deploying high-cost air defence assets to intercept low-cost commercial drones is economically unsustainable, which has resulted in an operational capability gap. This gap is addressed by dedicated C-UAS systems, which must adapt rapidly to technological developments in drone design and usage. The Loke consists of a modular, mobile C-UAS system that spans the full kill chain, from detection and classification to command, control, and engagement. The detection and surveillance component is based on the Giraffe 1X radar. This 3D multi-mission radar performs air surveillance, ground-based air defence (GBAD) target acquisition, and counter-rocket, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) warning functions. It is designed to detect and track low, slow, and small (LSS) aerial targets, including small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and distinguish them from birds with a reduced false alarm rate. Giraffe 1X supports the Drone Tracker capability, which allows for UAV detection and classification. The Giraffe 1X system weighs under 150 kilograms in total, with a topside weight of 100 kilograms. It can be mounted on mobile platforms such as pickup trucks or trailers, towed, or transported by helicopter. It can also be installed on fixed structures such as buildings or masts. Giraffe 1X performs 360-degree airspace scanning every second and can operate either remotely or locally. It can be integrated into larger GBAD systems or function as a gap-filler or standalone C-UAS system. The radar’s automatic tracking function supports simultaneous surveillance, target acquisition, and early warning without performance degradation. It can also be equipped for sea surface surveillance and full command, control, and communication (C3) capability. The engagement component of the Loke system uses the Trackfire Remote Weapon Station (RWS). Trackfire is installed on various military platforms, including naval vessels like the Combat Boat 90. It includes a Stabilised Independent Line of Sight (SILOS) system, which decouples the sensor module from the weapon’s axis, allowing the operator to maintain line of sight during weapon recoil and engagement. This setup enables target lasing throughout the engagement process, supporting real-time ballistic calculations with 3D prediction capability. Trackfire is remotely operated and includes a Director Unit (DU), Sensor Module (SM), Human Machine Interface (HMI), Gunners Display (GD), Fire Control Panel (FCP), Control Handle (CH), and Video Tracker (VT). All primary functions are displayed ergonomically via the HMI, which allows for near-instantaneous surveillance and target acquisition without requiring the operator to look away from the GD. Target and sensor data can be shared across platforms or transmitted within a single vehicle or vessel. Dual command capabilities reduce response time and sensor-to-shooter cycles. The system can be integrated with Battlefield Management Systems (BMS), Combat Management Systems (CMS), Navigation Systems, Defensive Aide Suites (DAS), and Video Distribution Systems (VDS). The Trackfire can carry and fire a wide range of weapons, including the M2 heavy machine gun (12.7 mm), FN MAG58 (7.62 mm), Mk19 (40x53 mm), and H&amp;K GMG (40x53 mm). (Picture source: Saab) The operator of the Trackfire can switch between mounted weapons via the HMI. Indirect fire capability is supported when using 40 mm grenade launchers. The system also allows the integration of non-lethal effectors and functions such as smoke grenade launchers, dazzlers, spotlights, loudspeakers, lightweight medium-caliber cannons, and missiles. The Trackfire RWS supports operation from under armor or deck, reducing crew exposure. A reversionary mode is included in case of battlefield damage or malfunction. The Trackfire’s elevation range is from -20° to +55°, with azimuth rotation of nx360°. Its angular velocity and acceleration are up to 120 degrees per second and 400 degrees per second², respectively. Environmental specifications include operational temperatures from -30°C to +55°C, and compliance with MIL-STD-461F and MIL-STD-810G standards. The director unit weighs approximately 280 kg, excluding weapons and ammunition, with dimensions of approximately 950 mm in height and 1050 mm in width. The IR sensor operates in the 3–5 µm spectral band, and the system also includes a day camera with 40°–2° optical zoom and a Class 1 eye-safe laser rangefinder effective beyond 4000 meters with an accuracy of ±5 meters. Saab has delivered Trackfire systems to Sweden and Finland for naval and amphibious use, including integration into both new and existing platforms. The Trackfire can engage air targets using a moving-3D mode, continuously measuring range to targets such as incoming UAVs or moving ground targets. The Loke system is capable of operating while being redeployed between locations, such as moving from one air base to another. It can also be scaled with additional sensors or weapon stations. Within the Swedish Armed Forces, Loke will complement existing systems used for drone detection and disruption at the individual soldier level, particularly around airbases. The development of Loke was managed jointly by Luftstridsskolan (Air Warfare School), Ledningsstridsskolan (Command and Control Warfare School), and Flygstaben (Air Force Staff), with support from the Markstridsskolan (Ground Warfare School). Personnel from Norrbotten Air Wing, F 21, participated from the beginning to incorporate operational input. The objective is to fully implement the system into combat units by the end of 2025. Major General Jonas Wikman, Chief of the Swedish Air Force, stated that this effort demonstrates the armed forces’ intent to build required capabilities and depart from standard processes when needed to address current threats quickly. He also emphasized the need for continuous development and fast, competent solutions to strengthen the Air Force. Carl-Johan Bergholm, Senior Vice President and Head of Saab’s business area Surveillance, commented that the accelerated development was made possible by repurposing existing products and integrating new technologies outside the typical multi-year product cycle. The Giraffe 1X radar’s automatic tracking function supports simultaneous surveillance, target acquisition, and early warning without performance degradation.

Canada Plans to Acquire American HIMARS MLRS Despite Tensions with Washington	The Canadian government is preparing to finalize a contract for the acquisition of HIMARS multiple rocket launcher systems from the United States, a decision that falls within the framework of the Long-Range Precision Strike project aimed at strengthening the country’s defense capabilities. According to industry sources cited by the Canadian media outlet Ottawa Citizen, this acquisition would be carried out through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) mechanism, a program that allows U.S. allies to purchase military equipment directly from the U.S. government. The Canadian Department of National Defence, through its spokesperson Kened Sadiku, confirmed that the project is underway and that further announcements are expected in the coming months. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Adapted for modern combat requirements, HIMARS features an armored cabin that shields the crew from small arms fire and shell fragments, enhancing protection in operational environments (Picture source: US DoD) The budget allocated for this program amounts to $5 billion, covering the procurement of HIMARS launchers, fire control software, ammunition, and spare parts. However, this initiative has drawn criticism from military analysts and representatives of Canada’s defense industry, who view it as increasing the country’s reliance on the U.S. for military equipment. Concerns over this dependence are heightened by ongoing bilateral tensions, particularly following recent statements by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and threatened the country’s automotive sector. The M142 HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) is a multiple rocket launcher system mounted on a 6x6 FMTV tactical truck chassis, designed to provide mobile and precise firepower. It can fire six MLRS-series rockets or a single ATACMS tactical missile, reaching targets at a maximum range of 300 km. Its advanced fire control system and autonomous operation capability enable it to be operated by a three-person crew. Its high mobility allows for rapid repositioning after firing, minimizing exposure to counterattacks and enhancing survivability on the battlefield. Adapted for modern combat requirements, HIMARS features an armored cabin that shields the crew from small arms fire and shell fragments, enhancing protection in operational environments. Its integration with advanced command and navigation systems significantly improves accuracy and operational effectiveness, making it a key asset in long-range artillery strategies. C-130 transportable, it can be rapidly deployed across various operational theaters, supporting ground forces or executing precision strikes. Its performance has been demonstrated in recent conflicts, where its flexibility and firepower have made it a key element in modern artillery operations. Despite ongoing political and economic tensions, Canada continues to allocate the majority of its defense contracts to U.S. companies. In 2023, Ottawa committed nearly $30 billion to military acquisitions, with a significant portion awarded to U.S.-based firms. These included an $8 billion agreement with Boeing for reconnaissance aircraft and a $2.5 billion drone procurement deal. This strategy further solidifies the U.S.'s dominant role in equipping the Canadian Armed Forces and raises concerns about Canada’s defense policy independence. One major issue is the technological control exercised by Washington over key Canadian military assets. The F-35 fighter jets and newly commissioned warships are equipped with U.S.-controlled technologies, meaning that critical software updates and maintenance depend entirely on the United States. Analysts argue that such dependence could restrict Canada’s ability to operate these systems independently in the event of diplomatic disputes or disruptions in bilateral relations. In light of these concerns, several observers have pointed to the historical closeness between Canadian and U.S. military leadership, suggesting that Canada has been reluctant to explore European or domestic alternatives for diversifying its defense procurement. Representatives of the Canadian defense industry argue that Ottawa’s acquisition policies provide little benefit to national firms, which struggle to compete with major U.S. contractors. Additionally, former Chief of the Defence Staff General Rick Hillier has publicly advocated for even closer ties between Canada and the U.S.. On social media, he has expressed support for proposals aimed at strengthening economic and border integration between the two countries, fueling further debate on Canadian military sovereignty. In this context, Canada’s decision to acquire HIMARS from the U.S., despite recent political and economic tensions, highlights the complexity of Ottawa’s relationship with Washington. While Canada seeks to modernize its military capabilities to address contemporary security challenges, it must also contend with a growing industrial and technological dependence on its principal ally. This factor is likely to play a decisive role in future defense decisions, raising questions about the balance between capability enhancement and the preservation of strategic autonomy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/canada-plans-to-acquire-american-himars-mlrs-despite-tensions-with-washington	2025-03-21T03:56:24-07:00

North Korea Tests a New Surface-to-Air Missile System as Military Ties with Russia Strengthen	North Korea conducted a test launch of its latest surface-to-air missile system on March 20, an initiative supervised by leader Kim Jong Un and reported by the official KCNA news agency. This test, aimed at evaluating the reliability and combat performance of the system, comes amid growing regional tensions and a strategic rapprochement between Pyongyang and Moscow. The event marks a new step in North Korea’s efforts to modernize its air defense capabilities while consolidating its military alliances. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The test comes shortly after the conclusion of an annual joint military exercise between South Korea and the United States, an initiative that Pyongyang regularly condemns as a direct threat to its security (Picture source: KCNA) The test, conducted by North Korea’s Missile Administration, sought to verify the effectiveness of a weapon system that has already entered mass production. According to KCNA, the results confirmed a high level of reliability and advantageous adaptability in combat situations. Kim Jong Un, accompanied by members of the Central Military Commission of the Workers’ Party of Korea, attended the event and expressed his satisfaction, stating that the North Korean army would soon be equipped with a major strategic defense weapon with proven performance. The leader also extended his congratulations to the research group involved in developing the system and to the military industry enterprises that contributed to its production. This public recognition highlights the importance Pyongyang places on this program, which aligns with its clear objective of strengthening national defense capabilities. The test comes shortly after the conclusion of an annual joint military exercise between South Korea and the United States, an initiative that Pyongyang regularly condemns as a direct threat to its security. North Korea, perceiving these maneuvers as rehearsals for an invasion scenario, appears to have chosen this moment to demonstrate its retaliatory capability by showcasing advancements in its weapon systems. This missile test also coincides with the visit to Pyongyang of Russia’s Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, further fueling speculation about a possible transfer of military technology between the two countries. Several experts suggest that North Korea could be receiving technical assistance from Russia to enhance its air defense systems, an increasingly plausible hypothesis given recent military exchanges between Moscow and Pyongyang. Photographs released by KCNA show a column of smoke marking the missile’s launch, as well as an in-flight explosion, illustrating the key phases of the test. Kim Jong Un is seen observing the operation before smiling, signaling his satisfaction with the results. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, citing a senior officer from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that Seoul had anticipated a possible missile launch and closely monitored the event. The test ultimately took place around 9 a.m. local time, once again demonstrating North Korea’s ability to conduct missile tests despite international scrutiny. The presumed involvement of Russia in developing this missile system is part of a broader framework of military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, which appears to be strengthening as the war in Ukraine continues. Several analysts believe that North Korea, in exchange for military or technological aid, could supply weapons to Russia, potentially for use on the Ukrainian battlefield. Ahn Chan-il, a North Korea specialist, suggested that this test could be directly linked to the production of weapons destined for export to Russia. If confirmed, this would mark a new stage in the reciprocal military support between the two nations, in direct violation of international sanctions. These speculations arise as Russia increases its diplomatic engagements with North Korea. Earlier this month, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko visited Pyongyang to meet with his North Korean counterpart, Choe Son Hui, in an exchange that underscores the ongoing strategic rapprochement. Last year, South Korean officials stated that Moscow had provided North Korea with air defense systems in exchange for the deployment of North Korean troops to support Russian military operations. According to South Korean intelligence services, more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers have reportedly been sent to Russia, particularly to the border region of Kursk, where some have allegedly been redeployed to the front lines. These developments indicate an intensification of military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, involving the exchange of equipment and resources that could have repercussions beyond the Korean Peninsula. This new missile test highlights the increasing sophistication of North Korea’s military capabilities and its potential integration into a broader network of military exchanges with Russia (Picture source: KCNA) The missile tested by North Korea on March 20, 2025, could be an improved version of an existing system, such as the Pyongae-5 or KN-06 (Pongae-6), which are already in service and heavily influenced by Soviet and Chinese models. The Pyongae-5, based on the S-125, may have been upgraded with improved guidance and extended range, while the KN-06, derived from China’s HQ-9 and Russia’s S-300, may have received enhancements to better counter stealth aircraft and cruise missiles. The objective would be to strengthen North Korea’s ability to defend its airspace against increasingly sophisticated threats, particularly from U.S. and South Korean forces equipped with advanced technology. Another possibility is that Pyongyang tested a new system developed in cooperation with Russia, incorporating elements of the S-300PMU, S-350, or even Pantsir-S1. With deepening military relations between the two nations, it is plausible that North Korea has acquired technology enabling the production of a more advanced air defense missile, capable of handling multiple incoming threats and resisting electronic countermeasures. Such a development would significantly bolster North Korea’s capabilities against potential aerial incursions and ballistic threats. Finally, the Pyolijji-2 is a strong candidate, as it is a recently unveiled system likely inspired by the Russian S-400 or the Chinese HQ-22. It is designed to counter modern threats such as stealth F-35 fighters and South Korean and U.S. cruise missiles, featuring multi-target tracking and advanced radar interoperability. The fact that the missile tested is already in mass production, as reported by KCNA, aligns with the characteristics of the Pyolijji-2, strengthening the possibility that this was the system tested during the March 20 launch. If this assumption proves correct, it will mark a significant advancement in North Korea’s air defense capabilities.

(Picture source: KAI) Shield AI’s Hivemind Enterprise will be used by KAI to support the development of its proprietary AI pilot, referred to as 'K-AILOT,' which will be integrated into a scaled version of KAI’s multipurpose unmanned aerial platform (AAP). According to Shield AI’s Chief Technology Officer, Nathan Michael, the suite is intended to reduce the complexity and cost typically associated with autonomy development by offering software tools and architecture that enable developers to accelerate the creation of AI pilot systems. Developed to deploy autonomous behaviors at scale, the software suite is designed to help establish, evaluate, and verify autonomous flight capabilities, including basic navigation, obstacle avoidance, and target recognition. Hivemind Enterprise, developed by Shield AI for organizations and developers involved in building and deploying intelligent unmanned systems, has previously been applied to platforms such as the F-16 (X-62 VISTA), GA-ASI MQ-20 Avenger, Kratos MQM-178 Firejet, V-BATs, and quadcopters, with a focus on enabling autonomous operations in GPS- and communications-denied environments. Hivemind Enterprise is structured around three primary components: Hivemind Edge, Hivemind Design, and Hivemind Commander. Hivemind Edge is deployed onboard unmanned systems to execute autonomy functions such as perception, action, and cognition in environments with limited or no access to GPS or communications. It is based on an open and modular architecture and is designed to be compatible with multiple platforms. Hivemind Design provides tools for developers to design, configure, analyze, and test AI capabilities using local and cloud computing environments. Hivemind Commander supports human interaction with autonomous systems by offering interfaces for mission planning, real-time command and control, operator training, and simulation-based testing. The system includes a modular catalog of mission behaviors, an integrated autonomy factory for developing and refining autonomous functions, a production-grade middleware layer for system integration, and a high-fidelity simulation environment that supports testing, validation, visualization, and replay of both synthetic and real-world missions. The agreement follows Shield AI’s earlier integration of Hivemind on the V-BAT vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft in a simulation setting under a U.S. Air Force STRATFI (Strategic Funding Increase) contract with AFWERX. That project demonstrated the software’s ability to execute a wide range of mission types with autonomous coordination, such as air defense breach, Scud missile hunting, zone reconnaissance, and operations in communications-contested environments. In one simulation, a team of three V-BATs monitored a 10 × 10 km region with designated areas of interest under conditions simulating the presence of friendly or hostile forces. As part of the partnership, KAI engineers will visit Shield AI’s headquarters in San Diego in April 2025 to receive training and coordinate the application of Hivemind Enterprise in ongoing test programs, as the simulation environment used for development and testing is proprietary to the U.S. company. The software will be used to verify KAI's internally developed AI pilot systems and shorten development timelines through simulation and prototype testing. KAI aims to complete the integration of K-AILOT into the operational multipurpose unmanned aerial platform (AAP), which is currently scheduled for rollout later in the year. Shield AI’s exclusive technology partner in South Korea, Quantum Aero, will assist with the integration process and facilitate cooperation among domestic aerospace stakeholders.

Breaking News: US Fighter Jet Destroys Houthi Drones in Red Sea Using Advanced Laser-Guided Rockets	On March 19, 2025, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) released a video on their X (formerly Twitter) account showcasing U.S. fighter aircraft intercepting and destroying Iran-backed Houthi one-way attack drones using the AGR-20 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) laser-guided 2.75-inch rockets. This engagement underscores the U.S. military's commitment to employing cost-effective solutions to counter aerial threats in the Middle East. The increasing use of one-way attack drones by the Houthis, often supplied or influenced by Iranian technology, has necessitated a responsive and economically viable countermeasure. The APKWS provides an efficient solution, allowing the U.S. Air Force and Navy to neutralize drone threats without depleting expensive missile stockpilesFollow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Video footage from U.S. Central Command shows a Houthi one-way attack drone moments before its destruction by a U.S. fighter aircraft using an AGR-20 APKWS laser-guided rocket over the Red Sea. (Picture source: X U.S. Central Command) The AGR-20 APKWS is a precision-guidance kit developed by BAE Systems that transforms standard 2.75-inch (70 mm) Hydra 70 unguided rockets into laser-guided munitions. The system integrates a Distributed Aperture Semi-Active Laser Seeker (DASALS), a mid-body guidance unit that allows the rocket to lock onto a laser-designated target with high precision. Unlike traditional unguided rockets, which have a limited probability of direct hits, the APKWS converts them into an effective and precise air-to-ground or air-to-air weapon. One of the main advantages of the APKWS is its cost-effectiveness. Each unit costs approximately $35,000, significantly less than standard air-to-air missiles like the AIM-9 Sidewinder or AIM-120 AMRAAM, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per missile. This makes it an ideal weapon for engaging small, low-cost aerial threats such as drones, which can be mass-produced by adversaries at minimal expense. The APKWS is also compatible with a wide range of platforms, including fixed-wing aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and AV-8B Harrier, rotary-wing platforms such as the AH-1Z Viper and UH-60 Black Hawk, and even unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). The APKWS has demonstrated its effectiveness in counter-drone operations. During tests conducted at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, the APKWS achieved a 100% success rate against drones moving at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour. This capability allows for precise engagements against small, fast-moving threats that traditional missile systems may find challenging to track and destroy. Additionally, its lightweight nature and smaller warhead reduce collateral damage, making it a suitable weapon for operations in congested areas or over maritime environments. The deployment of U.S. naval forces against the Houthi threat in the Red Sea and surrounding waters is a key component of U.S. strategy to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. The U.S. Navy's involvement in countering Houthi aggression began intensifying in late 2023 when Iran-backed Houthis launched a series of missile and drone attacks targeting commercial vessels and military assets in the Red Sea. In response, the U.S. Navy increased its presence in the region, with destroyers like the USS Carney (DDG-64) and USS Gravely (DDG-107) intercepting multiple Houthi-launched missiles and drones in late 2023 and early 2024. In December 2023, the U.S. formally launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational naval coalition aimed at protecting commercial shipping in the Red Sea from Houthi attacks. The coalition included naval forces from the United Kingdom, France, and regional allies. The operation was designed to counter the growing threat of Houthi drone and missile attacks, which disrupted global shipping routes and threatened maritime trade. By early 2024, the U.S. Navy had reinforced its presence in the region, deploying additional assets, including the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group (CSG) to operate alongside existing naval forces. The USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group (CSG) was later dispatched to the Red Sea, bringing significant offensive and defensive capabilities to the region. As a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) serves as a mobile airbase, deploying Carrier Air Wing 1 (CVW-1), which includes F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye early warning aircraft. These assets provide air superiority, electronic warfare support, and extended situational awareness for operations in the region. The carrier strike group is further reinforced by guided-missile cruisers and destroyers. The Ticonderoga-class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) and the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Stout (DDG-55) and USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109) are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, which enhances their ability to conduct integrated air and missile defense. These warships are capable of launching Standard Missile (SM-2 and SM-6) interceptors, Tomahawk cruise missiles, and other advanced weapons to counter aerial, surface, and ballistic missile threats. The primary objectives of these deployments have been to safeguard international shipping lanes, protect allied maritime assets, and deter Houthi aggression. The U.S. Navy's presence in the region serves as a deterrent against potential threats to commercial and military vessels, ensuring the free flow of commerce through vital waterways such as the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Suez Canal. The USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group’s combination of airpower, missile defense systems, and electronic warfare capabilities ensures a multi-layered defense strategy, allowing U.S. forces to preemptively strike Houthi targets while maintaining defensive coverage against potential retaliatory drone and missile strikes. The effectiveness of the APKWS in recent operations underscores its growing importance in modern asymmetric warfare. As the Houthi threat continues to evolve, U.S. forces will likely rely on a combination of advanced surveillance, precision-guided munitions, and strategic naval deployments to maintain operational dominance in the region. The adaptability of the APKWS, along with the formidable capabilities of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, ensures that the U.S. remains well-positioned to neutralize emerging threats while minimizing costs and collateral damage. The ongoing naval presence in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden further reinforces U.S. commitment to regional stability and the security of maritime trade routes.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-us-fighter-jet-destroy-houthi-drones-in-red-sea-using-advanced-laser-guided-rockets	2025-03-20T12:13:54-07:00

Spanish Leopard 2E Tanks Will Soon Be Equipped with Trophy APS to Counter Modern Threats	On March 20, 2025, General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) announced its readiness to upgrade the Spanish Army's LEOPARD 2E fleet. GDELS-SBS and KNDS Deutschland, the original equipment manufacturer and design authority of the LEOPARD 2 Main Battle Tank, have signed an agreement, which was already signed at the end of last year, to collaborate on the potential upgrade. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In addition to the upgrades, the Spanish Army's Leopard 2E fleet is highly likely to be equipped with the Trophy Active Protection System (APS), a proven technology that offers advanced defense capabilities (Picture source: Army Recognition) GDELS-SBS, as the leading Spanish system house for tracked and wheeled armored vehicles, combines its technological and industrial expertise to offer comprehensive modernization solutions for the Leopard 2E fleet of the Spanish Army. This modernization is designed to ensure the continued operational effectiveness and interoperability of Spain's Leopard 2E tanks with key European Leopard 2 users and NATO allies. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, GDELS-SBS aims to enhance the capability of these armored vehicles, ensuring that they meet both current and future battlefield demands. In addition to the upgrades, the Spanish Army's Leopard 2E fleet is highly likely to be equipped with the Trophy Active Protection System (APS), a proven technology that offers advanced defense capabilities. This upgrade is the result of a strategic partnership between KNDS, GDELS, and Israeli defense manufacturer RAFAEL, who together established EuroTrophy GmbH, a German-based joint company dedicated to producing the Trophy APS. The Trophy Active Protection System (APS) has already become a core feature of the German Army’s Leopard 2A8 configuration, and its inclusion in the Spanish Leopard 2E fleet will significantly improve survivability against emerging threats, solidifying the vehicle's status as one of the most advanced in the world. The system has proven its effectiveness in a variety of platforms, including the Merkava Mk 4, the main battle tank of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), which was the first tank to be equipped with Trophy APS. Additionally, the U.S. Army has deployed Trophy APS on its M1 Abrams tanks, particularly in upgraded variants such as the M1A2 SEPv3, while the UK’s Challenger 2 main battle tank is also in the process of being equipped with this advanced protection system. This widespread adoption further underscores the Trophy APS’s proven capabilities in enhancing armored vehicle defense against modern anti-tank threats. The growing trend of upgrading main battle tanks with Trophy APS demonstrates a clear shift in military strategy towards prioritizing quality over quantity. This shift is particularly evident when compared to Russia's approach, which has historically favored numerical superiority over technological advancements. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the limitations of relying on sheer quantity, as modern warfare increasingly favors advanced technologies that enhance the survivability and effectiveness of military platforms. Western defense firms, have gained valuable experience from recent conflicts and ongoing development efforts, and are now well-positioned to lead this transition. With a greater focus on integrating advanced systems like Trophy APS, Western forces are demonstrating a commitment to ensuring that their armored vehicles remain at the forefront of battlefield innovation and resilience.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/spanish-leopard-2e-tanks-will-soon-be-equipped-with-trophy-aps-to-counter-modern-threats	2025-03-20T08:00:59-07:00	
Patria presents Finland's first 8x8 155mm self-propelled howitzer named ARVE for modern artillery operations	As reported by Corporal Frisk on March 20, 2025, Patria introduced the ARVE, Finland's first wheeled 155mm self-propelled howitzer, during its Arctic Event held in Rovaniemi, Finland, from March 17 to 19. This development is part of the company’s broader efforts to enhance Finland’s artillery capabilities. The ARVE prototype integrates the 155K98 155mm howitzer onto a SISU E13TP 8x8 truck chassis, aiming to improve mobility and survivability in operational environments. The event also featured another prototype and provided an overview of Patria’s defense systems, with a focus on sub-arctic operational conditions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Patria's new ARVE 8x8 self-propelled howitzer is based on the Finnish 155 K 98 towed howitzer, which has been in service since 1998. (Picture source: Twitter/Corporal Frisk) As previously reported by Army Recognition, the ARVE is based on the Finnish 155 K 98 towed howitzer, which has been in service since 1998. This artillery system features a 52-caliber barrel and can fire conventional high-explosive fragmentation shells up to 40 kilometers. It is equipped with a semi-automatic wedge breech mechanism and can achieve a firing rate of 6 to 10 rounds per minute, including a rapid burst capability of three rounds in 12 seconds. The 155K98 includes an auxiliary motor, similar to the British FH-70 howitzer, allowing for short-distance independent movement at speeds of up to 15 km/h. This capability has been relevant in recent conflicts, where artillery mobility is crucial for avoiding counterfire and drone detection. Patria has stated that it retains the capability to restart production of the 155K98, originally developed in 1997 and manufactured until 2005 in Finland and under license in Egypt at Abu Zaabal Engineering Industries. The company has continued to maintain its artillery manufacturing expertise, supplying spare parts and implementing upgrades, including barrel improvements and structural modifications. Patria has performed regular ultrasonic inspections of the barrels to determine their remaining service life and maintain operational readiness. The concept of mounting the 155K98 on a wheeled platform was first presented by Patria to Finland’s Defense Committee in 2015 as an alternative to acquiring new artillery systems. Finland initially procured the South Korean K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzer, but the importance of a domestically produced system has gained renewed consideration following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Finnish Ministry of Defense has revisited the idea of developing a national artillery platform to ensure logistical independence and facilitate rapid deployment. Patria had previously developed a self-propelled artillery system in 2005, designated the 155GH52-SP-T55, which combined the 155K98 with a T-55 tank chassis for potential export to Egypt. The ARVE prototype integrates the 155K98 onto the SISU E13TP 8x8 truck, a vehicle in service with the Finnish military since 2008. This truck features an armored cabin with mine protection, accommodates two crew members, and is powered by a 445hp Caterpillar C13 engine coupled with a six-speed Allison 4500 automatic transmission. It has a maximum speed of 90 km/h, an operational range of 900 km, and can carry a payload of up to 20,000 kg. The truck is utilized for multiple military applications, including radar and missile system transport, making it a suitable platform for the ARVE self-propelled howitzer. The ARVE maintains the firing capabilities of the towed 155K98 but provides increased mobility and reduced setup time. At a firing position, the weapon is lowered to match the height of the towed version, allowing operation without additional training for crews accustomed to the 155K98. The system is manually operated for both gun laying and reloading. The ARVE can fire its first round within 90 seconds of arriving at a position and leave within 45 seconds after the final shot. The truck-mounted system carries 24 complete rounds. Patria has scheduled test firings of the ARVE prototype for the summer. The company anticipates potential orders from the Finnish Defence Forces for conversions of existing 155K98 howitzers. While the current version retains manual operation, Patria has indicated that future variants could include electrical gun laying if requested. The company has also stated that it is open to integrating other artillery systems onto the truck platform, though the market for such systems is limited due to the decreasing number of towed 155mm howitzers in service in Europe. In addition to domestic applications, Patria is assessing export opportunities for the ARVE. The company has stated that it can resume full-scale artillery production if required, including manufacturing new 155mm barrels. While the last 155GH52 APU was produced in 2005, Patria has continued to maintain expertise through maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities, including the manufacture and supply of spare barrels. The ARVE provides an alternative to fully automated and armored self-propelled howitzers. Given ongoing efforts in European defense planning to expand artillery forces, the ARVE could be considered by armed forces looking to increase artillery numbers without investing in heavier, more complex systems. The system’s mobility, compatibility with existing platforms, and cost considerations may contribute to its adoption for both national and international requirements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/patria-presents-finlands-first-8x8-155mm-self-propelled-howitzer-named-arve-for-modern-artillery-operations	2025-03-20T07:58:14-07:00	
Power Move: Indian Army set to acquire 250 BrahMos Missiles for Enhanced Defense	On March 19, 2025, reports indicated that the Indian Army and Indian Air Force were on the verge of a defense acquisition, with plans to purchase 250 BrahMos missiles. The deal, valued at approximately $2.4 billion USD, is currently under consideration by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), which is chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. The deal represents a portion of India's overall military budget for 2024, which is estimated to be around USD 72 billion. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BrahMos missile, developed by the Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace, is based on the Russian P-800 Oniks missile. It is among the most advanced systems in its category (Picture source: BrahMos) While there has been no official confirmation from the Ministry of Defence regarding the military deal as of yet, the move to acquire such a massive consignment of BrahMos missiles underscores India’s commitment to strengthening its defense capabilities, particularly in light of increasing regional security challenges. The decision is expected to enhance both the offensive and defensive capabilities of the Indian Armed Forces, reinforcing India’s position as a major player in global defense strategy. The BrahMos missile, developed by the Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace, is based on the Russian P-800 Oniks missile. It is among the most advanced systems in its category. Capable of reaching speeds of up to Mach 2.8 and ranges between 300 and 500 kilometers depending on the variant, it stands out for its precision, stealth capabilities, and striking power. Powered by a liquid-fueled ramjet engine with a solid-propellant booster, the missile can be launched from land, sea, air, and even underwater. It carries a payload of 200 to 300 kilograms, comprising high-explosive or submunition warheads, and employs an inertial navigation system with active/passive radar guidance for terminal targeting. Since its induction into India’s armed forces in 2007, the BrahMos has become a cornerstone of its strategic arsenal while drawing interest from international buyers. As previously reported by Army Recognition Group, India has sold three batteries of BrahMos missiles to the Philippines for its Marines, with talks of additional purchases. Philippines' Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo hailed the acquisition as a major step in strengthening bilateral defense ties. Further strengthening India's position as a key player in the global defense sector, discussions around the BrahMos missile technology have expanded, with India poised to strengthen its missile exports. Notably, India is also in discussions with Vietnam for a potential BrahMos deal, and India and Indonesia are exploring defense cooperation, signaling growing interest in the BrahMos system across the region. The acquisition of 250 BrahMos missiles by India, with a range between 300 and 500 km, has significant strategic implications, particularly for its regional security dynamics with China and Pakistan. Geopolitically, the enhanced missile capabilities would give India a stronger deterrent against both nations, particularly in terms of its ability to strike key military and infrastructure targets at medium ranges, enhancing its power projection and defense posture. Against China, it counters growing military influence in the Indo-Pacific and disrupts logistical networks. With Pakistan, the deal escalates the arms race, potentially prompting increased military spending and nuclear development in response.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/power-move-indian-army-set-to-acquire-250-brahmos-missiles-for-enhanced-defense	2025-03-20T07:50:08-07:00

Franco-Italian Horizon-class destroyers to receive new hypersonic and ballistic missile interception capability	On March 17, 2025, the European Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement (OCCAR) detailed its Business Plan for 2025, outlining its continued management of defense programs with a focus on cost efficiency, performance, and schedule adherence. OCCAR's main programs for 2025 include the Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) of the Horizon-class destroyers and the Franco-Italian FREMM (Fregata Europea Multi-Missione) program, both aimed at modernizing European naval capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The mid-life upgrades include new weapon systems, command and control improvements, and enhanced electronic warfare suites to counter evolving threats, including hypersonic and ballistic missiles, UAVs, and supersonic cruise missiles. (Picture source: French Navy) The Horizon-class destroyer program originated from the Common New Generation Frigate (CNGF) project, a joint effort initiated in the early 1990s by France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The goal was to develop a new class of air-defense warships to replace older vessels in their respective navies. However, due to differing operational requirements, workshare disagreements, and program delays, the UK withdrew in 1999 to pursue its own Type 45 destroyer project. France and Italy proceeded with a revised design, finalizing an agreement in 2000 to construct four Horizon-class destroyers—two for each navy. The vessels were built by a partnership between Fincantieri and Naval Group, with the PAAMS missile system integrated under the responsibility of Eurosam. The first ships, Forbin for France and Andrea Doria for Italy, were commissioned between 2007 and 2009. Designed primarily for fleet air defense, the Horizon-class is equipped with Aster missiles, EMPAR multi-function radar, and advanced electronic warfare systems to counter aerial threats, including high-speed and low-altitude missiles. The mid-life upgrade program now seeks to modernize these ships to address emerging threats, ensuring their continued operational relevance. The Horizon-class MLU program is intended to address system obsolescence and integrate updated Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) and Electronic Warfare Systems (EWS). The upgrade includes national modifications for specific combat and platform systems. An Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) system will be established for all upgraded equipment. The program’s development phase includes key milestones such as the completion of the System Design Review (SDR) in 2024 and the Critical Design Review (CDR) in 2025. Integration of the upgraded systems on the first Italian vessel is scheduled for mid-2026, followed by the second in late 2027. The first French ship will undergo integration from mid-2028, with the second in the second half of 2029. The program is expected to be completed, including the guarantee period, by the end of 2030. The MLU contract, valued at €1.5 billion, was awarded to Naviris and Eurosam on July 28, 2023. These contractors, in collaboration with Fincantieri, Naval Group, MBDA Italy, MBDA France, and Thales LAS France, are responsible for developing and integrating the upgraded AAW and EWS components. The upgrades include new weapon systems, command and control improvements, and enhanced electronic warfare suites to counter evolving threats, including hypersonic and ballistic missiles, UAVs, and supersonic cruise missiles in high-intensity conflict scenarios. The Horizon MLU program applies to the four Horizon-class vessels: Andrea Doria, Caio Duilio, Forbin, and Chevalier Paul. The upgrades focus on AAW and EW systems while optimizing ISS and cooperative procurement advantages. Delivery timelines include the first Italian ship in 2027, the second in mid-2029, the first French ship by late 2029, and the second by the end of 2030. Originally commissioned between 2007 and 2009, these Franco-Italian-developed ships serve as key air defense assets. The Horizon-class destroyers, constructed by Fincantieri and Naval Group, are equipped with PAAMS, Aster missiles, EMPAR radars, and electronic warfare systems. The vessels measure 153 meters in length, have a displacement exceeding 7,000 tonnes at full load, a range of 7,000 nautical miles at 18 knots, and a maximum speed of 29 knots. France and Italy proceeded with a revised design, finalizing an agreement in 2000 to construct four Horizon-class destroyers—two for each navy. (Picture source: French Navy) The Franco-Italian FREMM program involves the construction of eight frigates for the French Navy and 12 for the Italian Navy. These multi-mission frigates include variants for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-air warfare (FREDA), and general-purpose (GP) missions. The program, managed by OCCAR since 2005, continues efforts to modernize naval surface fleets. The last French FREDA variant was delivered in November 2022, while the Italian Navy is scheduled to receive its final two 'Evolution' variants in 2029 and 2030. By 2025, eight Italian FREMM frigates will have been delivered, with two additional ASW variants expected that year. The FREMM program operates under a joint contract between France's Naval Group and Italy's Orizzonte Sistemi Navali. The Evolution configuration includes enhanced automation and an optimized human-machine interface to increase operational flexibility. The program's estimated total cost, based on 2005 economic conditions, is €12.8 billion, while the Evolution variant, calculated under 2024 conditions, amounts to €3 billion. Development and production activities for the FREMM program in Italy are expected to continue until 2040. The FREMM frigates range from 142 to 144 meters in length, have a displacement of 6,000 to 6,700 tonnes, a maximum speed of 27 knots, and an operational range of 6,000 nautical miles. For 2025, key milestones include the completion of CDR 1 for the Horizon MLU program, deliveries of the Italian FREMM GP 6 and 7, the establishment of a new In-Service Support (ISS) framework for Italian FREMM vessels, and the system-level CDR for the Italian FREMM Evolution variant. Beyond 2026, the second phase of the Horizon MLU System Design Review will be conducted for French-specific components, alongside sustainment initiatives for Italian FREMM ships and the production of the first two FREMM Evolution units. OCCAR also oversees European missile defense programs through the FSAF-PAAMS program, which includes the Aster missile family. The SAMP/T NG (New Generation) system is undergoing upgrades for the French Air Force, Italian Army, and Italian Air Force. The UK is participating in modernization efforts by integrating Aster 30 B1 missiles into its Sea Viper system for Type 45 destroyers. OCCAR is also managing the production of the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile Extended Range (CAMM-ER) for the Italian Army and Air Force, with the first fire unit scheduled for delivery in 2025. The PAAMS and Long-Range Radar (LRR) Mid-Life Upgrade for Franco-Italian Horizon-class frigates will enhance naval Aster missiles and the Vertical Launch System (VLS), with the first Aster MLU deliveries to France and Italy occurring in 2024. The program is set to enter a new phase in 2026, with the Operational Readiness Review (ORR) for SAMP/T NG and the first test engagements against ballistic targets. Further development and qualification activities will continue for Aster 30 B1NT and the VLS. The Italian Army is expected to conduct operational evaluations of the GRIFO CAMM-ER fire unit. The continued modernization efforts aim to enhance European nations' air and missile defense capabilities. The FREMM multi-mission frigates include variants for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-air warfare (FREDA), and general-purpose (GP) missions.

Germany Takes a Historic Turn with a Massive Budget for its Defense and Europe	According to BBC, the Bundestag approved on March 18, 2025, a measure that will redefine the landscape of European defense by easing budgetary restrictions to allow substantial investment in Germany’s armed forces and infrastructure. This vote, taking place at a pivotal moment for European security, underscores the urgency of adapting to uncertainties surrounding U.S. commitments and Russia’s continued advances in Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The plan allocates €500 billion to modernize infrastructure and strengthen military capabilities while lifting constitutional limits on borrowing (Picture source: German MoD) The initiative, backed by Friedrich Merz, the likely future German chancellor, along with his potential coalition partner, the SPD, was adopted following a last-minute agreement with the Greens. The plan allocates €500 billion to modernize infrastructure and strengthen military capabilities while lifting constitutional limits on borrowing. This measure significantly increases Germany’s defense budget, with potential implications for the entire European Union. Out of this total, €100 billion will be specifically dedicated to climate policies, a condition set by the Greens in exchange for their support. The budget also includes an additional €3 billion in military aid to Ukraine, reinforcing Germany’s support in the ongoing conflict. Friedrich Merz described the decision as a 'first major step toward a new European defense community.' This shift reflects a strategic realignment as Germany takes a more assertive stance on security matters. The reform is a direct response to global strategic shifts, particularly following statements from the Trump administration that cast doubt on U.S. engagement within NATO. At the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sent a clear signal that Europe could no longer rely solely on American protection. This reality has led European policymakers to explore alternative solutions, including the potential expansion of France’s nuclear deterrent to cover more European nations. The Bundestag passed the measure with 513 votes in favor and 207 against, exceeding the required threshold of 489 votes. The timing was crucial to avoid a potential deadlock in the new parliament, where opposition from the far-right AfD and the far-left Die Linke could have obstructed the initiative. However, the speed of the approval process has drawn criticism. Alice Weidel, co-leader of AfD, called the decision an 'unprecedented electoral fraud' and warned that the resulting debt burden could undermine Germany’s economy in the long run. Beyond strengthening Germany’s armed forces, the budget aligns with a broader European initiative. The European Commission, under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen, recently announced the creation of the 'ReArm Europe' fund, amounting to €800 billion, aimed at addressing the continent’s growing defense needs. The German measure represents a first step toward unlocking new financing mechanisms at the European level. The initiative has received support from European leaders. Ursula von der Leyen described it as 'very good news,' while NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte emphasized that it demonstrated Germany’s commitment to European security. French President Emmanuel Macron also welcomed the decision during a visit to Berlin. With this move, Germany is shifting its defense policy, departing from the budgetary caution of past decades. This transformation reflects broader changes in European security strategy as Russia maintains a war-focused economy and power dynamics on the continent continue to evolve. The proposal must still be approved by the Bundesrat, Germany’s upper house of parliament, where it will require a two-thirds majority to take effect.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/germany-takes-a-historic-turn-with-a-massive-budget-for-its-defense-and-europe	2025-03-20T07:01:52-07:00	
US Army selects Boeing for the next phase of Indirect Fire Protection Capability mid-range interceptor program	As reported by AirPower 2.0 on March 20, 2025, Boeing has been selected by the U.S. Army to advance to the next phase of the Indirect Fires Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2 Second Interceptor competition, which is focused on developing a medium-range interceptor to enhance the defense of fixed and forward operating bases. The program aims to fill the capability gap between short-range and long-range air defense systems against low-flying, mid-range threats, including cruise missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The IFPC Increment 2 is a mobile, ground-based air defense system developed to provide 360-degree protection for fixed and semi-fixed sites by integrating multiple interceptors, sensors, and fire control systems. (Picture source: US Army) Boeing's proposal incorporates a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) to allow rapid technology integration. The company has stated that its design provides increased magazine depth, greater speed to target, extended range, and improved maneuverability. The proposal leverages expertise from multiple missile programs, including the PAC-3 interceptor, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, Avenger, Harpoon, and SLAM-ER. Boeing has described its bid as featuring a 'novel all-up-round solution,' but has not disclosed specific technical details due to competition sensitivity. The Indirect Fires Protection Capability (IFPC) program was initiated in 2004 to address the growing threat posed by cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), and rocket, artillery, and mortar (RAM) attacks against critical military infrastructure. The program was designed to provide a mobile, ground-based air defense system capable of bridging the capability gap between short-range air defense (SHORAD) systems and higher-tier missile defense systems such as the Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). Over time, the IFPC has evolved to incorporate multiple variants, including kinetic interceptors, high-energy lasers, and high-power microwave systems, with the goal of offering a layered and adaptable defense solution for fixed and semi-fixed sites. The IFPC Increment 2 is a mobile, ground-based air defense system developed to provide 360-degree protection for fixed and semi-fixed sites by integrating multiple interceptors, sensors, and fire control systems. The system consists of a modular launcher capable of firing different types of interceptors, an engagement control unit, and sensors that enable the detection and tracking of incoming threats. It is designed to be interoperable with the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) and Sentinel radar, allowing for coordinated engagements with other air and missile defense assets. The program emphasizes a modular open systems approach (MOSA) to facilitate future upgrades and integration of new interceptor variants as threats evolve. In September 2021, the U.S. Army awarded a contract to Dynetics for 16 prototype launchers and 60 interceptors, valued at approximately $240 million, including associated all-up-round magazines. The Army’s FY2025 budget proposal allocates approximately $660 million to advance the program. Additionally, a contract worth up to $4.1 billion was awarded to Dynetics in November 2024 for low-rate initial production, full-rate production, and support services, initially covering 18 launchers with $204 million allocated in an undefinitized contract order, of which $99 million was obligated upon award. A January 2025 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report identified three IFPC variants under development: the Increment 2 Interceptor, a High Energy Laser (HEL) variant, and a High-Power Microwave (HPM) variant. These systems are at different stages of development and are expected to operate in a complementary manner. The Army has also been integrating PAC-3 MSE, Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), and Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) into its broader missile defense strategy while pursuing a second interceptor to enhance engagement capabilities against low-flying supersonic cruise missiles. Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army’s Program Executive Officer for Missiles and Space, has stated that NASAMS does not fully meet the Army’s requirements for magazine depth and countering supersonic cruise missiles. The Army is considering a second interceptor with an AIM-120D-like capability but in a smaller form factor compatible with the IFPC Increment 2 launcher. Development is expected to continue through 2029–2030 before transitioning to production. The Army has conducted tests demonstrating the IFPC system’s ability to engage cruise missiles and UAS threats. A risk-reduction test involving a Raytheon AIM-9X Sidewinder interceptor launched from the IFPC launcher confirmed integration with IBCS and Sentinel A3 radar. The new interceptor is required to integrate with the IFPC launcher’s all-up-round magazine, meet cybersecurity standards, feature an engagement calculator linked to IBCS, and incorporate electronic warfare countermeasures. The Army has explored multiple technologies for the second interceptor, including air-augmented rocket designs, high-energy propellant formulations, and miniaturized missile guidance systems. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Israeli firms have presented potential solutions, such as the Tamir 2 interceptor. The Army's research includes multi-pulse propulsion, seeker enhancements, and networked datalink architectures. The next phase involves advancing selected companies to the prototype development stage in 2025, with full-scale demonstrations scheduled for 2026–2027. The broader IFPC strategy includes developing laser and microwave-based defense systems. The IFPC HEL variant is expected to feature a 300-kilowatt-class laser mounted on tactical vehicles, while the HPM variant is designed to provide short-range protection against drone swarms. The Army’s FY2025 budget adjustments have affected HEL development, prioritizing kinetic interceptors instead. The IFPC Increment 2 program is a key element of the Army’s air and missile defense modernization strategy, aimed at enhancing battlefield survivability and protecting critical infrastructure. The Army's approach to developing a second interceptor focuses on improving performance while maintaining adequate magazine depth. A competitive selection process is planned to determine the next stage of IFPC Increment 2 missile development.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-selects-boeing-for-the-next-phase-of-indirect-fire-protection-capability-mid-range-interceptor-program	2025-03-20T06:38:11-07:00

Its inertial guidance system, with in-flight trajectory correction, ensures high precision, while its multifunction radar can track up to 100 targets simultaneously and engage ten at once. Already in service with France, Italy, Singapore, and Ukraine, the system is evolving with the NG version, incorporating a rotating AESA radar, an improved Aster 30 Block 1NT missile, and enhanced connectivity to strengthen its performance, particularly against emerging ballistic threats. The strategic relevance of the SAMP/T NG is increasing amid shifting geopolitical dynamics, particularly concerning the role of the United States in European defense. Following Donald Trump’s election and the subsequent changes in U.S. foreign policy, Europe is reassessing its missile defense strategy. The announced reduction in U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and uncertainties surrounding Washington’s commitment to NATO highlight the need for European nations to strengthen their own air defense capabilities and reduce reliance on American technology. Against this backdrop, Denmark’s choice between the SAMP/T NG and the U.S.-made Patriot system carries significant strategic implications. While the Patriot system has an extensive operational history and proven effectiveness against ballistic missiles, particularly with the PAC-3 MSE variant, the SAMP/T NG offers a European alternative with full coverage and interoperability within European forces. The decision extends beyond technical considerations, reflecting a broader geopolitical shift as Europe seeks to enhance strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty. In response to these developments, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom have accelerated the production of Aster missiles and increased investment in the SAMP/T NG to secure supply chains and ensure the effectiveness of their armed forces. While concerns have been raised regarding the SAMP/T’s ability to intercept ballistic missiles, particularly in Ukraine, ongoing technological advancements are addressing these limitations. The integration of the Aster 30 Block 1NT missile and the rotating AESA radar is expected to enhance interception capabilities and position the system as a viable alternative to the Patriot. As Europe navigates an evolving security landscape, strengthening independent defense production is becoming increasingly urgent—not only to reinforce military resilience but also to ensure coherence in industrial and operational decision-making. The development of the SAMP/T NG aligns with this objective, offering European nations an advanced air defense system designed to address emerging threats while consolidating the continent’s defense industry. The selection of air defense systems is no longer solely a technical decision but a key factor in shaping Europe’s strategic posture amid global security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/samp-t-ng-air-defense-system-at-the-core-of-european-air-defense-with-first-gf300-mri-radar-validated	2025-03-20T06:02:16-07:00	
France considers purchasing Polish Piorun missiles and Baobab mine-laying systems	As reported by Defence 24 on March 17, 2025, Polish Minister of Defense Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz announced that France has expressed interest in acquiring the Polish-developed Piorun man-portable air-defense system (MANPADS) and the Baobab-K scatterable mine-laying system during the Paris Defense and Strategy Forum. This follows discussions with French Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu, who had previously visited Poland, where potential acquisitions from the Polish defense industry were discussed. Kosiniak-Kamysz stated that he will visit France in early April, accompanied by representatives of Poland's defense sector, to continue discussions on these potential procurements.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Each Baobab-K vehicle is equipped with six mine-launching modules, each containing 20 barrels capable of holding five mines per barrel, allowing for the deployment of up to 600 anti-tank mines before reloading. (Picture source: PGZ) The announcement took place within the E5 format, a multilateral defense dialogue involving France, Poland, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. The Polish defense minister stated that among the participating countries, Poland has the most pressing need to expand its defense production capabilities. He also noted several areas of potential cooperation, including the procurement of submarines under the Orka program. Regarding France’s interest in the Piorun and Baobab systems, Kosiniak-Kamysz stated that while France currently possesses very short-range air defense missiles with similar performance to the Polish Piorun, its domestic Mistral system is a larger, non-shoulder-fired platform. Integrating Piorun into the French inventory would provide additional operational flexibility, allowing mobile air defense teams to engage aerial threats without pre-deployed firing positions. If acquired, the Piorun system would increase the capabilities of French air defense units by providing a shoulder-launched system. This would allow for a more flexible engagement of targets compared to the fixed or vehicle-mounted Mistral system. The interest in the Baobab-K system suggests potential integration with a French wheeled or tracked chassis, as the French military does not currently operate a comparable scatterable mine-laying capability. The conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated the role of minefields in delaying or halting enemy armored advances, highlighting the operational use of such a system. The Piorun MANPADS, developed by Mesko in collaboration with CRW Telesystem-Mesko and the Military University of Technology, is an improved version of the earlier Grom system.

Piorun is currently in service with Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Norway, the United States, Georgia, and, in the future, Slovakia. Ukraine has deployed the system in combat, where it has been used to engage enemy aircraft and UAVs. The Baobab-K scatterable mine-laying system was developed by a Polish defense consortium led by Huta Stalowa Wola (HSW), with participation from Jelcz, BZE Belma, and the Military Institute of Engineering Technology. The program advanced with an agreement signed on December 28, 2018, leading to the development of a prototype based on the Jelcz 662D.43 military truck. The system enables rapid deployment of anti-tank minefields of varying densities. The automated deployment process allows mines to be placed from within the vehicle, with an onboard computer calculating vehicle speed, launcher settings, and mine release intervals. The system is capable of deploying a minefield up to 1,800 meters long within approximately 22 minutes, with mine dispersion ranging from 30 to 90 meters. Each Baobab-K vehicle is equipped with six mine-launching modules, each containing 20 barrels capable of holding five mines per barrel, allowing for the deployment of up to 600 anti-tank mines before reloading. The digital interface records the placement of mines on a digital map, with data transmittable to higher command levels via radio. The vehicle's two-person crew operates from an armored cabin equipped with a fire control system, GPS navigation, and a communication suite that includes the Fonet internal communication system and the RRC 9311AP VHF radio. The vehicle is also equipped with the Obra self-protection system, which integrates eight threat-detection sensors and eight smoke grenade launchers. Mines deployed by Baobab-K can be programmed with self-neutralization or self-destruction timers. The Polish Ministry of National Defense has signed a contract for 24 Baobab-K vehicles, valued at over 500 million PLN, with deliveries scheduled between 2026 and 2028. Poland currently operates a limited number of ISM Kroton vehicles for scatterable mine deployment, making the introduction of Baobab-K a significant increase in capacity.

These modifications align with Japan’s updated National Security Strategy, which emphasizes enhanced deterrence and interoperability with allied forces. The ASEV's development underwent significant modifications since its initial proposal. Early designs suggested a much larger vessel, exceeding 200 meters in length with a displacement of 22,000 tons. However, considerations related to cost, maneuverability, and operational integration resulted in a more compact design. Nevertheless, the ASEV will remain larger than existing Japanese destroyers in terms of displacement, such as the latest Maya-class. Japan's Ministry of Defense has allocated substantial funding for the ASEV program, with the budget increasing beyond initial estimates. Originally, the cost for the two vessels was projected at approximately 392 billion yen ($2.63 billion) each, but rising material costs and currency fluctuations have raised the total projected cost to 783.9 billion yen ($5.25 billion). The fiscal year 2025 budget includes 86.5 billion yen ($579.55 million) for expenses related to various tests, including demonstration and live-fire tests, as well as radar integration. Additional funding is anticipated for continued construction and system enhancements. Construction of the ASEV is assigned to two major Japanese shipbuilders. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries secured the contract for the first vessel in August 2024, while Japan Marine United Corporation was awarded the contract for the second in September 2024. The first ASEV is scheduled for commissioning in fiscal year 2027, with the second following in 2028. Once operational, these will be the largest surface combatants in Japan’s fleet since World War II. The ASEV will be operated by approximately 240 personnel, with accommodations designed for extended deployments, significantly enhancing Japan’s air and missile defense capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. The ASEV program was initiated after Japan canceled the land-based Aegis Ashore system in June 2020 due to concerns over falling interceptor components and public opposition. (Picture source: US DoD) The two ASEVs will enable the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) to maintain continuous missile defense patrols without overburdening existing Aegis destroyers, allowing them to focus on broader maritime security operations. The JMSDF plans to integrate the ASEVs into a networked defense architecture, coordinating with both land-based and allied forces to provide comprehensive missile interception coverage against regional threats, particularly North Korea’s missile advancements. The ASEV will be equipped with a radar array installation similar to the Spanish Álvaro de Bazán-class and the Australian Hobart-class, with the AN/SPY-7 AESA multifunction radar replacing the AN/SPY-1 system used on Japan’s existing Aegis destroyers. Developed by Lockheed Martin, the SPY-7 radar has five times the tracking capability of the existing SPY-1, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, and is capable of handling multiple simultaneous ballistic missile threats. The ASEV will also feature three AN/SPG-62 X-band radar illuminators, like previous Japanese Aegis destroyers, to provide guidance for air defense missiles using semi-active radar homing. Additionally, the AN/SPQ-9B radar will enable scanning for low-flying anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), surface threats, and slow-moving aerial targets such as drones and helicopters. To improve survivability, the ASEV is expected to integrate the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 2 AN/SLQ-32(V)6 modules, making it the first Japanese destroyer to incorporate this system. It will also feature the NOLQ-2 ECM intercept and jammer and four Mk 137 chaff and decoy launchers, enhancing its electronic warfare capabilities by detecting and countering electronic threats. The radar and sensor suite is designed for long-range target acquisition, contributing to Japan’s broader missile defense network and interoperability with allied forces. The ASEV's armament configuration makes it one of the most heavily armed destroyers globally. The vessel will feature 64 vertical launch system (VLS) cells at the bow and another 64 at the stern, totaling 128 cells—matching the highest number of VLS cells found on any existing destroyer, alongside South Korea’s Sejong the Great-class. These launchers will carry SM-3 and SM-6 surface-to-air missiles for defense against ballistic and hypersonic threats. The ASEV will also be equipped with Glide Phase Interceptors (GPI), a system under development to counter hypersonic weapons and cruise missiles. The ASEV's armament configuration makes it one of the most heavily armed destroyers globally, and will include armements such as two sets of quadruple Type 12 anti-ship missile launchers positioned between the chimneys. (Picture source: MHI) For offensive capabilities, the Aegis System Equipped Vessel (ASEV) will be armed with a Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TWCS) to operate Tomahawk cruise missiles, allowing for long-range land attacks. It will also carry two sets of quadruple Type 12 anti-ship missile launchers positioned between the chimneys. To reduce radar cross-section (RCS) and enhance stealth characteristics, these launchers are partially enclosed within the ship’s structure, with only the upper section exposed for missile deployment. A Mk45 Mod 4 127mm (5-inch) naval gun at the bow provides additional firepower for surface engagements and shore bombardment. Additional armament includes two small gun turrets amidships, likely Mk46 30mm Gun Weapon Systems (GWS) for close-range defense, and two Phalanx Block 1B Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS) positioned near the bridge and above the helicopter hangar. The ASEV will feature a twin helicopter hangar designed to accommodate two SH-60 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and surveillance operations. Its ASW capabilities will be further enhanced by two triple short-range torpedo tubes, possibly the Mk.32, and a hull-mounted sonar system. The vessel is also expected to integrate next-generation systems such as a high-power laser for countering drone saturation attacks, scheduled for introduction after 2032. Most modern destroyers, including the Arleigh Burke and Type 055, use gas turbines in a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) or combined gas turbine and gas turbine (COGAG) arrangement, such as the South Korean Jeongjo the Great-class. The ASEV will employ a COGLAG (Combined Gas turbine-electric and Gas turbine) propulsion system, integrating two Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines with electric motors to enhance fuel efficiency for extended deployments and reduce operational costs. This hybrid system generates approximately 100,000 horsepower, allowing the vessel to reach speeds of around 30 knots. This system, paired with its advanced radar and missile suite, positions the ASEV as one of the most specialized ballistic missile defense platforms in service while retaining multi-role combat capabilities, as the vessel’s design includes provisions for future upgrades in weaponry and electronic warfare systems. Compared to other destroyers such as the Russian Severomorsk, the ASEV stands out as one of the largest and most capable ships in its category. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s Maya-class destroyers, the latest Aegis-equipped ships before the ASEV, measure 170 meters in length, 21 meters in width, and have a displacement of 8,200 tons. The ASEV is significantly larger in all dimensions, with a 12,000-ton displacement and a length of 190 meters. In contrast, the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class Flight III destroyers, which serve as a benchmark for modern multi-role destroyers, measure 155 meters in length, with a displacement of 9,700 tons. The ASEV, at 190 meters in length and 12,000 tons in displacement, is larger than Japan’s Maya-class and the U.S. Arleigh Burke-class Flight III destroyers but smaller in displacement than the Zumwalt-class, which, despite sharing the same length, has a full-load displacement of 15,995 tons. Among global counterparts, the Chinese Navy’s Type 055 Renhai-class cruiser is one of the few comparable ships, with a length of 180 meters and a displacement of approximately 13,000 tons at full load. While the Renhai-class features 112 vertical launch system (VLS) cells, the ASEV exceeds this with 128 VLS cells, placing it among the most heavily armed destroyers in service. The South Korean Navy’s Sejong the Great-class destroyers, at 165 meters in length and a displacement of 10,000 tons, also have 128 VLS cells, making them similar in firepower to the ASEV but smaller in size. Unlike most of these platforms, the ASEV prioritizes ballistic missile defense (BMD) as its primary role, incorporating the AN/SPY-7 radar, which Lockheed Martin states provides superior tracking performance compared to the AN/SPY-1 and AN/SPY-6 systems used by other Aegis-equipped ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/focus-japans-future-asevs-to-surpass-all-modern-destroyers-as-the-most-powerful-class-ever-built	2025-03-20T02:30:30-07:00

Taiwanese F-16V Fighter Locks Onto Chinese Military Drone While Regional Tensions Surge	On March 17, 2025, a Taiwanese F-16V fighter jet, supplied by the United States, targeted a Chinese military drone over the contested waters surrounding the self-governing island of Taiwan. This incident occurred amid escalating tensions as China increased its military activities around the island, reaffirming its territorial claims. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Wing Loong-2 UCAV was photographed by a Taiwanese F-16V’s Sniper ATP targeting pod. Taiwan’s Military News Agency referred to this drone as the 'Type 2 Attack UAV' and the Wing Loong-10 as the 'Wuzhen-10 UAV.' (Picture source: ROC) China considers Taiwan an integral part of its territory, despite never having exercised control over the island. The Chinese government has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification and applies continuous military pressure, notably through frequent aerial and naval incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ). These shows of force have intensified in recent years, with large-scale military exercises around the island reflecting a strategy of coercion aimed at deterring any pro-independence moves and testing the responsiveness of Taiwan’s armed forces. During recent drills in which 59 Chinese aircraft encircled Taiwan, a Wing Loong-2 and a Wing Loong-10 drone were explicitly identified and photographed for the first time by the Taiwanese military. The Republic of China Air Force (RoCAF) released images of these Chinese drones, captured using electro-optical systems onboard their F-16V Viper fighters and P-3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft. The interception took place as China conducted extensive naval and aerial exercises around the island, with Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) tracking 59 PLA aircraft and nine PLAN vessels between March 17 and March 18. In previous incursions, Taiwanese reports had identified BZK-005 ISR and TB-001 reconnaissance-strike drones entering Taiwan’s ADIZ, but this was the first time that the Wing Loong-2 and Wing Loong-10 (also known as Wuzhen-10 or WZ-10) were reported in such operations. Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense rarely specifies the types of Chinese military aircraft it tracks or intercepts, often referring to them generically as 'aircraft' and 'drones.' While these drones may have been used in previous operations, this marks the first occasion that they have been explicitly identified and photographed. An image of the Wing Loong-10, captured by the P-3C Orion’s electro-optical system, shows it from a side-rear angle, with its two exhausts visible. These exhausts, concealed within the fuselage between canted vertical stabilizers, identify the drone as the 'Wind Shadow' variant, equipped with two turbofan engines. In contrast, the 'Cloud Shadow' variant has a single engine with a simpler exhaust nozzle. The Wing Loong-10 had previously been spotted over the western Pacific, and open-source aircraft tracking data recorded its presence north of the Taiwan Strait’s median line in February and March. The Wing Loong-2 UCAV was photographed by a Taiwanese F-16V’s Sniper ATP targeting pod. Taiwan’s Military News Agency referred to this drone as the 'Type 2 Attack UAV' and the Wing Loong-10 as the 'Wuzhen-10 UAV.' The Wing Loong-2 is a medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) combat drone developed by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group. It can conduct reconnaissance, surveillance, and strike missions and carry a payload of up to 480 kg, including air-to-ground missiles and guided bombs. It has an endurance of approximately 32 hours and a maximum speed of about 370 km/h. Its design resembles that of the American MQ-9 Reaper, featuring a high-wing configuration and a rear-mounted propeller engine. The Wing Loong-10, on the other hand, is a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) stealth drone powered by jet engines. It can fly at altitudes exceeding 12,000 meters and reach speeds of around 620 km/h. Primarily designed for electronic intelligence (ELINT) and electronic warfare (EW) missions, it can also be equipped with precision-strike weaponry. Its advanced aerodynamic design, including canted stabilizers and a fuselage optimized for low observability, enhances its survivability against air defense systems. Additionally, political uncertainty in the United States, particularly with the potential re-election of Donald Trump, adds another layer of unpredictability to the regional power balance. While the Biden administration has maintained consistent military support for Taiwan, Trump’s more transactional and unpredictable approach to international relations could call into question the stability of U.S. commitments. A potential strategic shift in Washington’s policy could have direct implications for Beijing’s posture, possibly leading to an increase in Chinese military actions against the island. In this uncertain environment, each PLA incursion and each Taiwanese response contribute to the growing risk of a regional conflict with global ramifications.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/taiwanese-f-16v-fighter-locks-onto-chinese-military-drone-while-regional-tensions-surge	2025-03-20T01:18:09-07:00

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) The agreements were signed by Patrick Mason, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, and Rear Admiral Ian Murray, head of the Australian Defence Staff in Washington. Their completion underscores the deep-rooted military and industrial cooperation between the two nations, reflecting a partnership that extends far beyond diplomatic ties. The United States and Australia have shared decades of military collaboration, intelligence-sharing, and joint operations, dating back to World War II. This enduring alliance has played a crucial role in shaping regional stability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, where both nations face growing strategic challenges. These new agreements further cement the U.S.-Australia security partnership by enhancing Australia’s self-reliance in munitions production and improving the collective deterrence posture in the region. The first MOU focuses on the co-production of 155 mm artillery ammunition, a move designed to bolster Australia’s sovereign defense industry while securing a stable and reliable supply of critical munitions. By localizing production, Australia strengthens its ability to respond to evolving security challenges and contributes to the broader global munitions supply chain. This step is vital given the increased demand for artillery rounds worldwide, particularly in light of evolving geopolitical threats. Ensuring a secure, domestic source of ammunition not only enhances Australia’s defense capabilities but also reinforces the broader U.S.-led security framework in the Indo-Pacific. The second MOU lays the groundwork for co-assembly of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) for HIMARS, a transformative step in Australia’s efforts to develop an advanced domestic missile industry. HIMARS has proven to be a highly effective and sought-after system in modern warfare, providing rapid, long-range precision firepower. Establishing a local assembly capability for GMLRS strengthens Australia’s long-range strike options and ensures compatibility with U.S. and allied forces in joint operations. This initiative significantly enhances military coordination between the two nations, making the Australian Defence Force (ADF) a more agile and interoperable partner in future conflicts or crisis response scenarios. Australia’s commitment to HIMARS has been steadily increasing. The U.S. State Department initially approved the sale of 20 HIMARS launchers to Australia in May 2022, a deal that was later expanded to a total of 42 systems, which are scheduled for delivery starting in 2026. This expansion underscores Australia's long-term investment in advanced strike capabilities and its alignment with U.S. and allied force structures. Further strengthening this collaboration, on March 10, 2025, the U.S. State Department approved a potential Foreign Military Sale to Australia of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System-Alternate Warhead (GMLRS-AW) rounds and related equipment, valued at an estimated $91.2 million. This latest approval highlights the continued deepening of the defense procurement relationship between the two nations, ensuring that Australia not only possesses advanced missile systems but also the necessary ammunition to sustain high-intensity operations. 'These agreements go beyond formal commitments—they represent a new era of joint defense manufacturing,' Mason emphasized. 'The United States and Australia share a deep history of collaboration, and this initiative reinforces our unwavering commitment to maintaining a secure and stable Indo-Pacific region.' This latest step reflects the strong foundation of trust and shared strategic interests between the two nations. The agreements align with the objectives outlined in the Australia-United States Ministerial Consultation (AUSMIN) Joint Statement of 2024, which set forth a roadmap for expanding production and sustainment under Australia’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise. These MOUs are the first tangible outcomes of that commitment, demonstrating significant progress in Australia’s efforts to establish a self-sufficient defense manufacturing sector. The significance of these agreements extends beyond just Australia and the U.S.; they are a critical development for the entire Oceania region. As geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific continue to evolve, the ability of Australia to produce its own munitions and missile systems enhances not only its own security but also that of its regional allies. The Indo-Pacific is a strategically contested area, with growing competition among major global powers. By increasing its defense manufacturing capabilities, Australia strengthens its role as a key security partner in Oceania, ensuring that regional allies have a more robust and independent defense infrastructure. This move also helps to reduce reliance on overseas suppliers, mitigating risks associated with supply chain disruptions in times of crisis. The signing of these agreements follows a high-level meeting in February 2025 between U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Richard Marles. During their discussions, both officials reaffirmed their commitment to expanding defense collaboration, particularly in the domain of guided weapons and explosive ordnance production.

These images, shared by the X account @RupprechtDeino, provide further insights into the aircraft’s design and performance after its first public appearance in December 2024. The J-36, developed by the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation, serves as China’s prototype for a sixth-generation fighter, and while official details remain sparse, this second flight marks a significant milestone in its progress.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link China's J-36 Stealth Fighter in its Second Test Flight: A glimpse of the cutting-edge technology and rapid development driving China’s sixth-generation fighter program. (Picture source: Chinese Social Network) The J-36’s tailless, diamond-shaped design is central to its stealth capabilities. This configuration reduces the aircraft's radar cross-section, making it harder to detect by enemy radar. This is a key area where the J-36 competes with the latest fighter programs from the U.S., Russia, and European countries, including the U.S. Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, Russia's Su-57, and the European FCAS and Tempest programs. The J-36's stealth design, supported by radar-evading materials and an aerodynamic shape, could rival the stealth performance of U.S. fighters like the F-35 and F-22. Unlike Russia’s Su-57, which retains some traditional design elements, the J-36 represents a more modern and radical approach to stealth, which could make it more challenging to detect by advanced radar systems. The J-36 is also speculated to offer multi-role capabilities, potentially functioning as a 'supercruising launching platform' for long-range missiles or as a command hub for coordinating other aircraft. This multi-role flexibility is becoming increasingly important in future conflicts, where air superiority fighters must also be capable of carrying out a range of other operations, including precision strikes and mission coordination. The U.S. NGAD program, which is expected to incorporate similar multi-role capabilities, is also focused on creating a versatile fighter capable of operating in various combat scenarios. However, the J-36’s potential to serve in such diverse roles could give China a strategic advantage in terms of operational flexibility and adaptability across multiple theaters of combat. One of the standout features of the J-36 could be its supercruise capability — the ability to fly at supersonic speeds without using afterburners. This would allow the aircraft to maintain high speeds over long distances without the fuel penalties typically associated with afterburner use. Both the U.S. F-22 and the upcoming NGAD are expected to feature supercruise capabilities, and Russia’s Su-57 and European fighter programs are working toward fully integrating this feature as well. If the J-36 incorporates supercruise, it could significantly enhance its range and mission endurance, allowing for greater operational flexibility in high-speed intercepts and long-range strikes. As a sixth-generation fighter, the J-36 is also expected to integrate advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous systems, potentially offering capabilities far beyond those of current fifth-generation fighters. AI could enhance decision-making, target identification, and mission management, and the J-36 may be able to operate alongside unmanned aircraft in a networked combat system. This would position the J-36 alongside the U.S. NGAD and European Tempest programs, both of which are focused on integrating AI into their next-generation fighters. The ability to incorporate autonomous capabilities could give the J-36 an edge in future combat scenarios where human decision-making is augmented by AI. Another critical aspect of the J-36 is its advanced avionics and sensor fusion. The aircraft is likely equipped with cutting-edge radar and sensor systems that would allow it to operate effectively in contested airspace. By integrating data from multiple sensors, the J-36 could create a comprehensive picture of the battlefield, enabling it to detect and track adversary aircraft in various conditions. This capability is crucial for future air combat, and China’s development of advanced sensor fusion systems for the J-36 could make it competitive with U.S. and European systems like those in the NGAD and Tempest programs. While the J-36’s tailless design might initially suggest limitations in terms of maneuverability, the aircraft has already demonstrated impressive agility in recent flight tests. This suggests that the J-36 is optimized for high-performance agility, enabling it to engage in both close-range dogfights and long-range missile engagements. The Su-57, Russia’s advanced fighter, was designed with a focus on agility and aims to outperform its adversaries in close combat. The J-36’s combination of stealth, speed, and maneuverability could make it a versatile competitor in both dogfights and strategic engagements. In terms of weaponry, the J-36 could be designed to carry and deploy hypersonic missiles, a key area of interest for many nations. Hypersonic weapons are seen as the next frontier in precision strike capabilities, and their integration into the J-36 would give China a significant edge in terms of long-range precision strikes. The U.S. and Russia are also working on hypersonic missiles, but if China can successfully integrate such weapons into the J-36, it could elevate the aircraft's strategic value. One potential advantage the J-36 may offer over its Western and Russian counterparts is cost and production efficiency. China has a well-established infrastructure for mass-producing advanced military hardware, which could allow the J-36 to be produced in large numbers at a lower cost compared to more expensive Western or Russian aircraft. If China can scale production effectively, the J-36 could be deployed in large fleets, potentially overwhelming more limited-supply and costly fighters from other nations. This could be particularly advantageous in regional conflicts where air superiority is key. In conclusion, the J-36’s advanced stealth capabilities, potential supercruise, AI integration, and multi-role flexibility make it a formidable competitor to the latest fighter programs from the U.S., Russia, and European countries. Its capabilities in sensor fusion, autonomous operations, and hypersonic missile integration could position it as a game-changer in future air combat scenarios. While the U.S. NGAD, Russia’s Su-57, and European programs like Tempest are also expected to offer similar capabilities, the J-36’s design and advanced technologies position China as a serious contender in the global race for sixth-generation fighter superiority. It is important to note that much of the J-36’s capabilities remain speculative at this stage, and official details are yet to be fully confirmed. As the aircraft continues to undergo flight tests and development, further information may shed light on its actual performance and how it compares to its Western and Russian counterparts. However, based on the current available data and expert analysis, the J-36 appears to be a highly promising aircraft that could reshape the future of air combat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-second-test-flight-of-chinas-latest-j-36-stealth-fighter-highlights-rapid-advancements	2025-03-19T06:31:44-07:00

Indonesia explores acquiring Italy’s decommissioned aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi for naval drone operations	According to the Rivista Italiana Difesa (RID) on March 11, 2025, Indonesia is considering acquiring the decommissioned Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi. Discussions on this potential deal have been ongoing for some time, with the possible intention of using it as a drone carrier in line with Indonesia’s agreement with the Turkish company Baykar to locally produce 60 navalized TB-3 drones and nine Akinci UAVs. Naval cooperation between Indonesia and Italy has expanded in recent years, particularly through ship acquisitions and defense industry collaboration.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Giuseppe Garibaldi was commissioned in 1985 as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier. It was Italy’s first ship with a full-length flight deck, officially classified as an aircraft-carrying cruiser to comply with national aviation regulations at the time. (Picture source: Marina Militare) The Giuseppe Garibaldi was developed by Fincantieri at the Monfalcone shipyard and commissioned in 1985 as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier. It was Italy’s first ship with a full-length flight deck, officially classified as an aircraft-carrying cruiser to comply with national aviation regulations at the time. Initially restricted to helicopter operations, the ship was later modified to deploy AV-8B Harrier II short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) fighter jets after a 1989 legislative amendment allowed fixed-wing aircraft in the Italian Navy. Over its service life, the vessel underwent extensive upgrades, including a 2003 modernization that removed Otomat Mk 2 surface-to-surface missile launchers to enhance air operations and a 2013 overhaul aimed at extending its operational lifespan. The ship has a standard displacement of 10,100 tons and a full-load displacement of 14,150 tons after modifications. It is 180.2 meters long, has a beam of 33.4 meters, and a draught of 8.2 meters. The flight deck, measuring 174 meters in length and featuring a 4-degree ski-jump ramp, enables STOVL aircraft operations by improving takeoff efficiency under heavier loads. The propulsion system consists of four General Electric/Avio LM2500 gas turbines, delivering 60,400 kW (81,000 hp), propelling the vessel to a top speed of over 30 knots. The operational range is approximately 7,000 nautical miles at a sustained cruising speed of 20 knots. The ship accommodates up to 830 personnel, including 550 crew members, up to 180 aviation personnel, and 100 command and control staff. The carrier is equipped with multiple electronic and defensive systems. It features a Selenia MM/SPS-768 long-range radar for air and surface detection, an AN/SPS-52C early warning radar for airborne threats, and a Selenia SPS-702 CORA surface search radar. For electronic warfare, it includes the Elettronica SLQ-732 jamming system and two OTO Melara SCLAR decoy launchers for countermeasures. The ship’s air defense consists of two Mk.29 octuple launchers for Aspide surface-to-air missiles, while close-in protection is provided by three Oto Melara Twin 40L70 DARDO systems. It also carries two triple 324mm torpedo launchers for anti-submarine warfare. Initially fitted with four Otomat Mk 2 surface-to-surface missile launchers, these were removed in 2003 to optimize air operations and communications infrastructure. The vessel has an aviation capacity of up to 18 aircraft, with configurations varying based on mission requirements. It typically carries AV-8B Harrier II fighter jets and AgustaWestland AW101 or SH-3D helicopters, which perform anti-submarine warfare, airborne early warning, and logistical transport missions. The ski-jump ramp is designed to increase aircraft takeoff efficiency, enabling operations with heavier payloads. The ship's command and control capabilities are enhanced by advanced communication and data-sharing systems, including Link 11, Link 14, and Link 16 tactical data links, as well as a satellite communication network for fleet integration and interoperability with NATO and allied forces. Throughout its operational history, the Giuseppe Garibaldi was deployed in various military and humanitarian missions. It participated in NATO’s Operation Allied Force during the Kosovo conflict in 1999, conducted air operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001, and was involved in strike missions in Libya in 2011 under Operation Unified Protector. The carrier also played a role in maritime security and humanitarian operations, including Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean, aimed at countering human trafficking and conducting search-and-rescue missions. Following nearly four decades of service, the ship was officially decommissioned on October 1, 2024. It was replaced by the Trieste-class landing helicopter dock (LHD), which took over as the Italian Navy's flagship and expanded the fleet’s amphibious and aviation capabilities. A proposed role for the Garibaldi within the Indonesian Navy includes its conversion into a drone carrier, as Indonesia has recently expanded its defense cooperation with Türkiye, including the local production of 60 navalized TB-3 drones. (Picture source: Baykar) Indonesia's potential acquisition of the carrier aligns with its Minimum Essential Force (MEF) plan, which calls for the expansion of naval assets, including helicopter-capable vessels. The Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy, Admiral Muhammad Ali, has outlined plans to procure an aircraft carrier for non-combat military operations, alongside the acquisition of two frigates from Italy and multiple fast missile-armed patrol boats from Türkiye. Additionally, the Indonesian Parliament (DPR) has approved a grant from Japan, supplying two patrol vessels to be stationed at Balikpapan Naval Base, strengthening security near the country’s future capital, Nusantara. A proposed role for the Garibaldi within the Indonesian Navy includes its conversion into a drone carrier. Indonesia has recently expanded its defense cooperation with Türkiye, leading to a joint venture between Baykar and Indonesian company Republikorp. This agreement includes the local production of 60 navalized TB-3 drones and nine Akinci UAVs for Indonesia's armed forces. The TB-3, which completed its first takeoff and landing on the Turkish carrier Anadolu in November 2024, features folding wings, reinforced landing gear, and the capability to utilize a ski-jump ramp for improved takeoff performance. If acquired, the Garibaldi could serve as a launch platform for these UAVs. Italy and Indonesia maintain close defense relations, as demonstrated by Indonesia’s acquisition of two former Italian Navy Multipurpose Combat Ships (PPA/MCS). Originally named Ruggero di Lauria and Marcantonio Colonna, these vessels were renamed Brawijaya 320 and Prabu Siliwangi 321, respectively. A formal renaming ceremony was held on January 29, 2025, at Fincantieri’s Muggiano shipyard, attended by senior naval and industry officials from both countries. These ships are scheduled for delivery later in 2025. If the deal for the Garibaldi moves forward, it may also include a transfer of AV-8B Harrier II STOVL aircraft from the Italian Navy. However, Indonesia has not confirmed any final agreement, and alternative proposals remain under evaluation. PT PAL Indonesia has proposed constructing an amphibious assault ship or helicopter carrier domestically, potentially in collaboration with a foreign partner such as Fincantieri or Hyundai Heavy Industries of South Korea. The decision will depend on strategic considerations, financial assessments, and ongoing negotiations. Indonesia’s naval expansion efforts occur amid evolving security challenges, particularly in the South China Sea. With territorial concerns in the Natuna Islands and the necessity for rapid-response capabilities across its extensive archipelago, Indonesia is working to modernize its fleet. The Indonesian Navy plans to operate at least four amphibious helicopter carriers as part of its long-term force development strategy. Financial and strategic considerations may affect the feasibility of acquiring an aircraft carrier. Analysts have drawn comparisons to Thailand’s experience with HTMS Chakri Naruebet, a carrier that has seen limited operational use due to budgetary constraints and logistical challenges. Some experts argue that Indonesia’s requirements might be better met with additional landing helicopter docks (LHDs) or multi-role support ships rather than a conventional aircraft carrier.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indonesia-explores-acquiring-italys-decommissioned-aircraft-carrier-giuseppe-garibaldi-for-naval-drone-operations	2025-03-19T02:53:00-07:00	
Belgium And Its Remus Submarine Drone in Action off the Coast of Greece	In collaboration with NATO allies on March 17, 2025, the Belgian Very Shallow Water (VSW) team took part in the annual Ariadne exercise in Greece to combat mines in shallow waters.

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Belgian VSW team joined NATO allies in the annual Ariadne exercise in Greece, focusing on mine detection in shallow waters. (Picture source: Belgian MoD) On March 17, 2025, the Belgian Very Shallow Water (VSW) team joined NATO allies in the annual Ariadne exercise in Greece, focusing on mine detection in shallow waters. The team deployed advanced technology, including the Remus underwater drone, off the coast of Crete to identify and analyze potential threats on the seafloor. As part of the exercise, the Belgian VSW team once again led Ariadne's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) segment. According to First Petty Officer Brecht, an AUV operator with the team, this was a unique experience: 'The goal of this exercise is not only to detect mines but also to strengthen cooperation between the participating countries. We work closely with Romanian divers, who use the Remus' imagery to physically inspect the suspicious objects.' First Petty Officer Brecht elaborated on the operational procedure: 'We designate a specific area for the Remus to cover. Once deployed, the drone autonomously begins its mission, descending to the set depth, just a few meters above the seafloor. We monitor it continuously and retrieve it afterward. If unforeseen obstacles interfere with its navigation, we can dive to recover it.' The effectiveness of this operation lies in the combination of cutting-edge technology and the practical expertise of the allied NATO units. The Remus drone plays a pivotal role by providing detailed sonar images. In times of crisis, it facilitates the rapid deployment of teams to remote areas, enhancing the overall efficiency of mine detection and neutralization operations. One of the key advantages of the Remus drone is its ability to scan areas that are otherwise inaccessible to ships. Deployed from a safe distance in dangerous zones, it allows for mine detection and demining operations to be conducted without the need for a ship to navigate deeply into a minefield, significantly improving safety. Thanks to the continuous integration of cutting-edge technologies like the Remus, the Belgian VSW team remains at the forefront of anti-mine operations. The team is committed to shaping the future of maritime security through innovative solutions and unmatched expertise.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/belgium-and-its-remus-submarine-drone-in-action-off-the-coast-of-greece	2025-03-19T02:25:49-07:00	
US Navy Enhances F-16 Viper’s Anti-Ship Strike Capabilities with Stealthy LRASM Missiles	According to a procurement notice published by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) on March 18, 2025, the US Navy officially announced its plan to integrate the AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) into the F-16 Viper fighter. This development represents an expansion of the aircraft's anti-ship capabilities. It is part of a broader initiative aimed at increasing the number of platforms capable of deploying the LRASM, particularly in anticipation of a potential large-scale conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The AGM-158C LRASM is a subsonic cruise missile designed for contested environments where reconnaissance and GPS navigation systems may be compromised (Picture source: US DoD) The procurement notice confirms that NAVAIR intends to enter exclusive negotiations with Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control for a contract covering the development and testing of the missile’s integration onto the F-16. This effort will focus specifically on the AGM-158C-1, the primary version currently in production, while a C-3 variant, featuring an almost doubled range, is in development. The LRASM is derived from the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) family, already integrated into the US Air Force’s F-16C/D. Adding the LRASM to the F-16 marks a substantial upgrade, as the aircraft’s existing anti-ship capability is limited, primarily relying on the AGM-84 Harpoon missile. However, the extent to which Air Force F-16 units currently operate the Harpoon remains unclear. Additionally, while the Air Force has begun acquiring the Joint Strike Missile (JSM) for its F-35A fleet, this missile has not yet been designated for F-16 integration. The AGM-158C LRASM is a subsonic cruise missile designed for contested environments where reconnaissance and GPS navigation systems may be compromised. Developed by Lockheed Martin in collaboration with DARPA, it builds on the JASSM-ER architecture while incorporating advanced sensors and autonomous targeting systems. Equipped with a passive sensor developed by BAE Systems, it can independently identify and engage naval targets even without real-time data link communication. Its low-altitude flight profile and reduced radar signature enhance its survivability against modern air defense systems. The missile carries a 450 kg fragmentation-explosive warhead, designed to inflict severe damage on surface vessels. The LRASM is currently deployed on platforms such as the B-1B Lancer and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as from naval vessels equipped with the MK 41 Vertical Launch System. Its integration onto the F-16 and other aircraft, along with an increase in production, aligns with US efforts to maintain an operational advantage in maritime warfare, particularly in the Pacific. The missile’s range exceeds 200 nautical miles, allowing it to engage targets from a safe distance beyond the reach of enemy defenses. One of LRASM’s main advantages over the Harpoon lies in its stealth characteristics and advanced autonomous navigation. The missile features an electronic support measures (ESM) system that enables it to adjust its trajectory in response to emerging threats. It also employs an imaging infrared seeker in its terminal phase, making it resistant to radio-frequency jamming and allowing it to target specific areas of a vessel based on pre-loaded data. Additionally, its two-way data link enables in-flight target updates and coordinated strikes with other missiles. The announcement of LRASM’s integration on the F-16 follows a recent demonstration by the US Air Force’s 53rd Test and Evaluation Group of a new communications gateway designed to accelerate weapons integration onto the Viper. In the test, a Harpoon Block II+ missile was used as a demonstrator to assess the F-16’s ability to recognize and guide weapons through this interface. While not specifically designed for LRASM, this system could facilitate its integration into the aircraft. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand the range of US military platforms capable of deploying LRASM. Currently, only the US Navy’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and the US Air Force’s B-1 bombers are certified to carry the missile. However, efforts are underway to integrate it into P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, as well as the B and C variants of the F-35. In January, NAVAIR also issued a procurement notice for integrating the missile into the F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15EX Eagle II. The US military is actively working to enhance its air-launched anti-ship strike capabilities amid increasing tensions in the South China Sea and the broader Pacific region. Production of LRASM and its predecessor, JASSM, has accelerated, with Lockheed Martin recently receiving an additional $122.6 million contract for increased manufacturing. However, concerns remain regarding the availability of long-range standoff munitions and the ability to replenish stockpiles in a sustained conflict. The unit cost of LRASM, estimated at around $3 million, along with the complexity of its production, has also driven interest in lower-cost alternatives. Beyond strategic considerations, integrating LRASM into the F-16 could also open new export opportunities. With numerous countries operating different variants of the F-16, the possibility of equipping them with an advanced anti-ship strike capability may appeal to potential buyers. While no precise timeline has been disclosed for the missile’s operational deployment on the F-16, this program represents a notable expansion of the aircraft’s maritime strike capabilities, enhancing its effectiveness against modern naval threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-navy-enhances-f-16-vipers-anti-ship-strike-capabilities-with-stealthy-lrasm-missiles	2025-03-19T02:22:20-07:00

The contract includes an option for 11 ambulance modules. More than 40 Australian companies are involved in the production and sustainment of the Boxer CRV, with local industry securing two-thirds of the total $15.7 billion investment over the fleet’s lifecycle, including $10.2 billion allocated for sustainment. The project is expected to create up to 1,450 jobs across Australia. The Australian government has allocated $235 million for infrastructure upgrades at Puckapunyal and Bandiana (Victoria), Adelaide (South Australia), and Townsville and Enoggera (Queensland) to support Boxer CRV operations. The Boxer armored vehicle program originated as a multinational effort in the 1990s, initially involving Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. The program focused on a modular design with separate drive and mission modules for flexibility across multiple roles. France withdrew from the project in 1999, while the Netherlands joined in 2001. The UK left the program in 2003 but later rejoined in 2018 to acquire Boxer vehicles for the Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) program.

With this perspective, the company has the potential to grow in Brazil and beyond. The main project of EDGE is the MANSUP project (National Surface Anti-Ship Missile). The goal is to manufacture missiles capable of traveling up to 70 km at sea. To this end, the company invested in the SIATT factory near São José dos Campos. The investment could create 250 jobs and include an academic partnership with the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA) after its inauguration in September. With its capabilities, SIATT is positioned to compete with the French company Exocet, a market leader in anti-ship missiles. Exocet missiles have proven their effectiveness in multiple conflicts, such as the Falklands War against British ships. The company has since gained such a monopoly that it can dictate pricing. Given this context, countries seeking anti-ship missiles are increasingly open to alternatives. The Brazilian Navy is a key partner in the project and is working with EDGE to break Exocet's monopoly. The partnership with EDGE Group is worth $163 million. As part of the first contract, 16 missiles will be delivered, to be mounted on four Tamandaré-class frigates, with the first delivery scheduled for the end of the year. Furthermore, SIATT will export MANSUP missiles to the United Arab.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/uae-and-brazil-join-forces-to-compete-in-anti-ship-missile-market-at-international-level	2025-03-18T07:18:10-07:00	
British Navy Receives Thales New Autonomous Mine Hunting System to Boost Sea Mine Threat Neutralization	March 14th, 2025, marks the history of naval military technology as Thales, the global leader in advanced technologies for the Defence, Aerospace, and Cyber/Digital sectors, has delivered the first remotely controlled mine hunting system to the British Royal Navy. This set-up included several integrated subsystems fostering flexibility and adaptability from an operational perspective, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), a last-generation towed sonar (TSAM) accompanied by an updated, new-generation multivision sonar (SAMDIS), a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), and a lightweight operations center (e-POC), all supported by a secure command and control system and operated at distance from a Mothership. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USV serves as the primary platform for the mission, offering the flexibility to deploy other systems such as the towed sonar and ROV (Picture source: MMCM) The objective behind this technological breakthrough was to increase the security of the operating and commanding staff during mine hunting operations whilst maintaining or even increasing the efficiency of these lasts. The remotely controlled aspect of this system not only protects the lives of the staff but also the security of the mothership and any other vessels in proximity. The utilization of the mine hunting system relies on the co-dependent functioning of the different components of the system. The normal unfolding of a mission would imply the deployment of the Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) equipped with either a TSAM and a SAMDIS or with a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) meant to identify and neutralize submarine mine threats. The operating staff prepare, follow, control and evaluate mission developments from a Portable Operations Center (e-POC) or from a Shore Operation Center (e-SOC). The USV serves as the primary platform for the mission, offering the flexibility to deploy other systems such as the towed sonar and ROV. It operates autonomously or under remote control, utilizing GPS and onboard sensors for navigation and mission execution. The USV can be customized to carry different payloads depending on the specific requirements of the mission, and it is built to endure harsh maritime conditions. It provides a stable platform for launching various MCM systems and plays a critical role in the integrated operation. The towed sonar system (TASM) is an essential tool for detecting underwater threats, particularly mines on the seabed or floating in the water. Towed behind the USV, the system uses a multi vision sonar technology (SADMIS), such as side-scan sonar, forward-looking sonar, and synthetic aperture sonar (SAS), to provide detailed, high-resolution images of the underwater environment. This combination of sonar modes allows for the detection of mines even in cluttered or noisy environments, covering large areas quickly and effectively. Once mines are detected, the ROV plays a crucial role in identifying, manipulating, and neutralizing these threats. Controlled remotely, the ROV is equipped with high-definition cameras, sonar, and robotic arms, which allow it to interact directly with underwater mines. The ROV’s precision and ability to operate in challenging underwater conditions make it a key asset in mine countermeasure operations, whether it's for disarming a mine or placing explosive charges for neutralization. The lightweight operations center, or e-POC, is a mobile and compact command and control center that integrates and manages the operations of all deployed systems. The e-POC allows operators to oversee and control the USV, ROV, and towed sonar, all from a single, centralized location. The system is designed to be portable, making it possible to set it up in various operational environments such as ships, boats, or land-based facilities. Through real-time data integration, the e-POC ensures that operators have access to critical mission information, with interfaces designed for intuitive control and monitoring. Furthermore, the secure command and control system is the backbone of the entire operation, ensuring that all communication between the various subsystems remains encrypted and secure. This system enables the fusion of data from all deployed assets and provides real-time feedback, allowing operators to make rapid decisions based on the evolving operational environment. Together, these integrated components — the USV, towed sonar, ROV, e-POC, and secure command and control system — create a comprehensive and highly effective solution for modern mine countermeasures. The integration of autonomous platforms, advanced detection systems, and precise intervention tools enables the successful detection, identification, and neutralization of underwater threats, enhancing the safety and operational efficiency of naval forces. The elaboration of such a system is the frutuous result of years of research and testing undertaken by the joint collaboration of the French and British governments within the context of the Maritime Mine Counter Measures program (MMCM), comprising unmanned systems operating remotely as stressed earlier. The MMCM evolves under the jurisdiction and supervision of the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) and in the long term, it aspires to present itself as a replacement option for Mine Counter Measures Vessels when they retire from service. Its production dates back to the formal agreement between France and the United Kingdom in late 2010 and the awarding of a demonstration phase contract by OCCAR, set to be divided in 4 stages: A definition and design stage , followed by the manufacture of only two systems, then an evaluation and qualification stage, and finally a support stage including the optional assistance by the French Marine Nationale and the British Royal Navy in assessing the system’s performance over a 2-year period. Nevertheless, the real commercial production of the systems did not start until October 2020. Needless to say, the implementation and distribution of such systems are accompanied by a necessary shore operation and training center. Overall, the new MMCM system will not only protect the lives of the operational navy staff and preserve the soundness of fleets around the world, but it will also protect the continuity of economic growth and international trade by securing the availability of maritime commercial routes worldwide. It is also a step forward towards the robotization of military equipment, and thus the future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/british-navy-receives-thales-new-autonomous-mine-hunting-system-to-boost-sea-mine-threat-neutralization	2025-03-18T06:49:43-07:00

Commissioned on January 22, 2025, at Qingdao, the Luohe, bearing hull number 545, is the lead ship of the Type 054B class.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Commissioned on January 22, 2025, at Qingdao, the Luohe, bearing hull number 545, is the lead ship of the new Type 054B class of frigates. (Picture source: Chinese social media) The training exercise involved the Dongpinghu, a Type 903A replenishment ship, and the Xining, a Type 052D destroyer. The exercise included visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations, navigation in simulated complex weather conditions, and search-and-rescue drills. The Luohe took position alongside the Dongpinghu for refueling, while the Xining was stationed at the rear of the replenishment ship. The PLAN conducted this exercise as part of broader efforts to develop 24-hour operational capability across multiple domains. During the training, the Luohe conducted live-fire exercises, including engagements with its 100mm main gun and Type 1130 close-in weapon system (CIWS), which was observed using an overhead engagement method to intercept simulated threats. The ship also conducted trials of its vertical launch system. These tests were designed to verify the functionality of its onboard weapon systems and sensor integration. Previously, the Yellow Sea has been used for PLAN trials and evaluations, providing controlled conditions for the crew to perform key combat operations with new naval assets. The Type 054B frigate, developed as a successor to the Type 054A, emerged as part of China’s broader naval modernization strategy, which aims to enhance the PLAN’s multi-mission capabilities. The first hull was laid down in 2022 at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard, followed by another unit at Huangpu Shipyard. Official reports and open-source intelligence indicate that multiple ships are under construction, with the second Type 054B frigate, the Qinzhou, already undergoing sea trials. This suggests an intent to expedite the deployment of the Type 054B, which is expected to be produced in numbers comparable to its predecessor, the Type 054A, which has over 40 units in service. As the first Type 054B, the Luohe’s performance in initial trials will set benchmarks for subsequent vessels of the class. Analysts anticipate that as additional units enter service, they will be incorporated into PLAN surface formations for escort, anti-submarine warfare, and regional defense operations. Reports suggest China is planning to expand its fleet with additional Type 054B units, further developing its surface combatant capabilities.

Canada Plans to Acquire New Helicopters to Support the Deployment of Its Future Fighters in Arctic	During the International Military Helicopter Conference held in the United Kingdom in February 2025, the Royal Canadian Air Force announced its intention to acquire new helicopters to support the deployment of its future fighters in the Arctic. According to local media, this investment, expected to exceed 18 billion Canadian dollars, also aims to replace the CH-146 Griffon helicopters that have been in service since 1992. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Until the arrival of the new helicopters, Canada will continue operating its current fleet of 82 CH-146 Griffon helicopters (Picture source: Canadian MoD) The Canadian military is working on establishing protocols and acquiring the necessary capabilities to respond to potential incidents involving the F-35 in this extreme environment. Since discussions began regarding the aircraft's acquisition, concerns have been raised about the reliability of a single-engine aircraft for operations in polar regions compared to the twin-engine CF-18s currently in service. Nevertheless, Canada is increasingly questioning the F-35 acquisition due to the unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration and the strategic implications of technological dependence on the United States. Although the 19 billion Canadian dollar contract signed in 2023 provides for the purchase of 88 F-35s to replace the aging CF-18 fleet, Ottawa is now considering alternatives from other manufacturers, fearing that its relationship with Washington could compromise the sovereignty and long-term viability of its air modernization program. Canada has several options for replacing its helicopter fleet and supporting F-35A operations in the Arctic, each offering specific capabilities suited to the challenges of this demanding region. The Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone, already in service, stands out for its endurance and maritime performance but is primarily designed for naval missions. The Leonardo AW101 (CH-149 Cormorant), used by the Royal Canadian Air Force for search and rescue operations, benefits from three engines that enhance safety in case of failure and provide significant range, though its operational cost remains high. The Boeing CH-47F Chinook, with its exceptional transport capacity, would be well-suited for logistical missions in remote areas, but its size and fuel consumption could present challenges where infrastructure access is limited. The Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, known for its durability and versatility, could be adapted to Canadian requirements, particularly with modifications for extreme temperatures, but being a single-engine helicopter, it raises concerns in the event of a failure in a remote area. Other potential options include the Airbus H225M Caracal, which has strong capabilities in polar and maritime environments while being more compact than the Chinook, though its adoption in Canada would require adjustments to local requirements. The Bell 525 Relentless, featuring modern technology and extended range, is an interesting alternative, but its lack of proven military service makes it a less certain choice. Finally, Canada could opt for a custom solution, either developing a model specifically designed for Arctic operations or modifying an existing helicopter to enhance its resilience to extreme conditions. This option would provide greater flexibility but would extend acquisition timelines and increase development costs. The final decision will depend on balancing performance, reliability, acquisition and operational costs, and the adaptability of platforms to the Royal Canadian Air Force’s specific Arctic missions. The new helicopter acquisition plan is part of a long-term strategy. The Royal Canadian Air Force has indicated that the procurement process could extend over 20 years and require infrastructure improvements in the northern regions. Discussions with the aerospace industry will begin this year to assess the capabilities of different suppliers and their proposals, with the goal of achieving initial operational capability by 2033. Until the arrival of the new helicopters, Canada will continue operating its current fleet of 82 CH-146 Griffon helicopters. A contract with Bell Textron Canada Limited was signed in January 2024 to ensure their maintenance until the mid-2030s, with an investment of nearly 2 billion dollars. This amount is in addition to the 800 million dollars already committed in 2022 to modernize the fleet and extend its service life. With this acquisition, Canada is preparing to address the logistical and operational challenges associated with deploying the F-35 in the Arctic. However, debates over the relevance of this investment and the country’s overall defense strategy are expected to continue in the coming years as the initial phases of the program are implemented.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/canada-plans-to-acquire-new-helicopters-to-support-the-deployment-of-its-future-fighters-in-arctic	2025-03-18T06:10:38-07:00

It brings together ground forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand to evaluate emerging capabilities in robotics, air defense, and communications. This large-scale experiment serves as a testing ground for collaborative combat and aims to strengthen interoperability among allied forces. As part of this exercise, the 6th Light Armored Brigade (6e BLB), which oversees the 13e DBLE, has been integrated as a subordinate unit to the US Army’s 82nd Airborne Division to enhance joint operational coordination. During Capstone 5, the 13e DBLE’s SRRI introduced two prototypes of automated 'hives' designed to facilitate the transport and deployment of drone swarms. Integrated into a Griffon and a Masstech vehicle, these systems enable the rapid launch of multiple reconnaissance drones and ensure seamless connectivity with a command-and-control (C2) system. The Bordeaux-based company IcarusSwarms, which supplies these systems, highlights that a single operator can deploy a swarm of four to twenty drones in under five minutes. The 6e BLB command has emphasized the operational benefits of these technologies, stating that they allow for the rapid three-dimensional modeling of an area within approximately 20 minutes, providing detailed intelligence to both French and allied forces. The increasing use of drone swarms in military operations reflects an ongoing transformation in operational tactics, where automation and artificial intelligence are reshaping battlefield strategies. The 13e DBLE’s participation in this initiative highlights the acceleration of autonomous technology integration within the French Armed Forces. The deployment of drone swarms expands battlefield situational awareness and enhances responsiveness to emerging threats. The involvement in Capstone 5 and similar innovation programs demonstrates the commitment of ground forces to adapting to evolving military challenges, where technology environment with high precision, detecting any movement in the area and providing a significant tactical advantage. The operator could track adversary movements and quickly identify potential threats, improving battlefield intelligence collection. Beyond reconnaissance, drone swarms offer additional operational applications, such as target marking, deception tactics against adversary forces, and electronic plays a decisive role in operational effectiveness.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/french-and-us-army-test-drone-swarms-and-automated-hives-to-shape-future-of-warfare	2025-03-18T03:40:45-07:00

Will US policy change on Greenland push Denmark to bet on European air defense systems over American counterparts?	As reported by Hans Tino Hansen on March 14, 2025, Denmark has officially narrowed its selection for a long-range ground-based air defense (GBAD) system to the American Patriot and the Franco-Italian SAMP/T NG. The country is also considering NASAMS, IRIS-T SLM, VL-MICA, and IFPC for its short-to-medium-range air defense program. Current assessments indicate that SAMP/T NG and NASAMS are the leading candidates for Denmark’s long-range and short-range GBAD requirements, respectively. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The European SAMP/T NG is equipped with the Aster 30 B1NT missile, which has an interception range of up to 150 km, while the American Patriot uses the PAC-3 MSE missile, with a range of up to 160 km. (Picture source: Army Recognition and US DoD) The selection of a long-range air defense system comes at a time when American defense products, including the Patriot, are facing increased scrutiny in Denmark. Tensions between Denmark and the United States, particularly over U.S. policies regarding Greenland, have led Copenhagen to reassess its defense procurement strategy. Statements by U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance regarding European allies have further raised concerns about the long-term reliability of American defense commitments. In response to these developments, the Danish government has allocated 14.6 billion kroner ($2.05 billion) to its Arctic defense budget. This investment aims to strengthen Denmark’s military presence in Greenland and the surrounding region and includes funding for three new Arctic naval vessels and enhanced surveillance capabilities to secure Greenland’s territorial waters and airspace. The decision follows renewed tensions with the United States after former President Donald Trump reiterated interest in acquiring Greenland, reinforcing Denmark’s focus on maintaining control over its Arctic territories and addressing broader security concerns in the region. Therefore, European defense manufacturers have reported increased inquiries from European governments exploring alternatives to U.S.-made defense systems. Companies such as MBDA have indicated that recent political developments have contributed to European militaries seeking to diversify their procurement strategies. In this context, French President Emmanuel Macron has publicly advocated for European nations to prioritize European defense equipment over American alternatives. In a recent statement, Macron said, 'Those who buy Patriot should be offered the new-generation Franco-Italian SAMP/T. Those who buy the F-35 should be offered the Rafale.' He has consistently emphasized that European countries should develop and procure their own defense systems to reduce dependency on non-European suppliers, including the United States. However, the Danish Defense Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) has specified that its selection process prioritizes NATO interoperability, security of supply, operational performance, and delivery schedules. Given the urgency of the acquisition, Denmark is pursuing a two-step approach: securing an initial solution deliverable between 2025 and 2026 while simultaneously planning for a long-term air defense system to be deployed by 2028. The projected timeline for SAMP/T NG availability, which is expected to be operational starting in 2026, may influence the selection process if earlier deliveries are required. Discussions are also ongoing regarding the possibility of Denmark receiving a NASAMS battery on loan from Norway. The procurement process is divided into two phases: an immediate acquisition with deliveries expected between 2025 and 2026 and a long-term acquisition aimed at full implementation by 2028. Denmark is a participant in the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), which was launched by Germany in 2022 within NATO’s framework to establish a multilayered air defense system. The initiative is centered on joint acquisitions of the IRIS-T SLM, Arrow 3, and Patriot PAC-3 systems. The SAMP/T NG was not included in ESSI, leading France and Italy to remain outside the initiative. Despite Denmark’s participation in ESSI, its decision to consider both the Patriot and SAMP/T NG independently reflects a broader approach to evaluating its long-range air defense options. The selection of a long-range air defense system comes at a time when American defense products, including the Patriot, are facing increased scrutiny in Denmark. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen has stated that strengthening Denmark’s ground-based air defense is a priority. He emphasized that both short- and long-term solutions must be identified to ensure the country meets its NATO commitments. He further outlined that the selection process must determine the most suitable system for national defense while maintaining interoperability with allied forces. Poulsen expects a final political decision by mid-2025, allowing for the contract to be signed and deliveries to proceed accordingly. Denmark’s air defense acquisition is among the country’s most substantial military procurement programs, with an estimated cost ranging from 19 to 25 billion Danish kroner. This budget could increase if NATO requests additional systems beyond the planned one long-range and two short-range GBAD units. Denmark has committed to increasing its defense spending, allocating 3.2 percent of its GDP to military expenditures by the end of 2025. To expedite procurement, the Danish government has opted to bypass standard tendering procedures, granting military leadership greater decision-making authority. Poulsen acknowledged that accelerating acquisitions would likely lead to increased costs, estimated to be 10 to 15 percent higher than standard procurement processes, but justified the approach as necessary to meet immediate security requirements. Both the SAMP/T NG and Patriot offer advanced long-range air defense capabilities, but their combat records and configurations differ. The Patriot has been used in multiple conflicts, including the Gulf War, the Syrian Civil War, and Ukraine, where it has been deployed against cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and aircraft. The SAMP/T NG has recorded over 100 live engagements in Ukraine and the Red Sea, including interceptions of drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic threats. Reports indicate that its interception rate exceeds 90 percent, similar to the effectiveness reported for the Patriot in comparable engagements. The two systems also differ in missile configurations, mobility, and launcher capabilities. The Patriot uses the PAC-3 MSE missile, which has an interception range of approximately 35 km for ballistic missiles and 160 km for aircraft. The SAMP/T NG is equipped with the Aster 30 B1NT missile, which has an interception range of up to 150 km and is designed for maneuvering targets. The Patriot system is mounted on semi-trailers, which require additional logistical support and longer deployment times. In contrast, the SAMP/T NG is mounted on 8x8 military trucks, allowing for greater mobility. The SAMP/T NG battery can carry up to 48 ready-to-fire missiles, whereas a Patriot battery typically carries fewer missiles per launcher, requiring more frequent reloading during sustained operations. These technical factors will be central to Denmark’s final decision on its long-range air defense procurement. In a recent statement, French President Emmanuel Macron said, 'Those who buy Patriot should be offered the new-generation Franco-Italian SAMP/T. Those who buy the F-35 should be offered the Rafale.'

Hanwha Ocean becomes first South Korean shipyard to complete major US Navy ship repair on USNS Wally Schirra	As reported by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command on March 13, 2025, a Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ship, the USNS Wally Schirra (T-AKE 8), has completed a seven-month maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) process at Hanwha Ocean’s shipyard in Geoje, South Korea. This marks the first large-scale maintenance effort of a U.S. naval vessel in a South Korean shipyard, aligning with the U.S. Navy’s strategy of conducting ship repairs within the Indo-Pacific region to minimize downtime and operational costs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Like other dry cargo ships of the Lewis and Clark-class, the USNS Wally Schirra was designed to operate with a mixed civilian and military crew, resupplying naval vessels at sea with ammunition, food, spare parts, and other essential materials. (Picture source: U.S. Indo-Pacific Command) Hanwha Ocean, which secured a Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) certification from the U.S. Navy in July 2024, was awarded the contract for this overhaul, making it the first South Korean shipbuilder to provide MRO services for an American military vessel. The USNS Wally Schirra entered the shipyard in September 2024, and while initial projections estimated a three-month turnaround, the work ultimately took seven months due to additional identified repairs. The vessel underwent extensive dry-docking, addressing hull corrosion, a complete rudder replacement, and over 300 specific maintenance tasks. Rear Admiral Neil Koprowski, Commander of U.S. Naval Forces Korea, stated that conducting large-scale maintenance within the Indo-Pacific theater demonstrates the strategic partnership between the Republic of Korea and the United States. He noted that this initiative enhances operational readiness by ensuring vessels can return to duty faster and at reduced costs. Additionally, Military Sealift Command (MSC) officials acknowledged Hanwha Ocean’s ability to reverse-engineer critical components, including the ship’s rudder, despite the absence of original blueprints. As a component of the U.S. Navy’s Combat Logistics Force, USNS Wally Schirra provides supplies to American and allied naval forces, including ammunition, food, spare parts, and fuel. The completion of its MRO in South Korea ensures its continued ability to sustain fleet operations. According to Commander Patrick Moore, commanding officer of MSC Office-Korea, the addition of ROH capabilities at South Korean facilities provides an alternative option for maintaining U.S. military logistics vessels while reducing reliance on U.S. shipyards. The completion of this project has broader implications for South Korea’s shipbuilding industry. Hanwha Ocean, which acquired Philly Shipyard in the U.S. in a $100 million deal in mid-2024, aims to further integrate into the U.S. naval shipbuilding and maintenance market. South Korea’s shipbuilding sector, particularly through Hanwha Ocean and Hyundai Heavy Industries, ranks second globally after China. This development aligns with American policymakers’ efforts to diversify their shipbuilding and maintenance capabilities amid ongoing shipyard delays in the U.S. The USNS Wally Schirra’s MRO is part of a broader U.S. initiative to expand maintenance partnerships across Indo-Pacific shipyards. India’s Mazgaon Dock Shipbuilders and Larsen &amp; Toubro gained MSRA certifications in 2023, while similar agreements have been explored with shipyards in Japan and the Philippines. Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hanwha’s main domestic competitor, secured its MSRA certification in mid-2024, further expanding South Korea’s involvement in U.S. Navy ship maintenance. Beyond the USNS Wally Schirra, Hanwha Ocean has also been awarded a contract for the scheduled maintenance of the USNS Yukon, a replenishment oiler assigned to the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet. The company has stated its intention to secure five to six additional U.S. Navy MRO contracts in 2025. Hanwha executives view this development as strengthening the shipbuilder’s role in naval logistics vessel repairs and expanding South Korea’s presence in the global naval MRO sector. Hanwha Ocean proved its effectiveness during the maintenance process by identifying maintenance needs that had not been recognized at the time of the initial contract, leading to a revised agreement with the U.S. Navy. (Picture source: Hanwha Ocean) The global naval maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) market, currently valued at approximately $8 billion, continues to expand as nations seek reliable maintenance options for their naval fleets. Hanwha Ocean has indicated plans to extend its MRO business beyond the United States, targeting markets in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The overhaul of the USNS Wally Schirra represents an expansion of South Korea’s shipbuilding sector into military vessel maintenance on an international scale. Hanwha Ocean leveraged its technical expertise to prove its effectiveness during the maintenance process by identifying maintenance needs that had not been recognized at the time of the initial contract. This led to a revised agreement with the U.S. Navy, significantly increasing the project's scope and value. The contract modification allowed Hanwha Ocean to showcase its ability to handle unplanned repairs efficiently, reinforcing its standing as a capable partner in military ship maintenance. The broader context of this development reflects a shift in U.S. policy toward greater engagement with allied shipbuilders. With China's shipbuilding industry growing rapidly, Washington has been seeking partnerships with South Korean, Japanese, and Indian shipyards to strengthen its naval logistics and maintenance network. Recent legislative efforts in the U.S. Senate, such as the Ensuring Naval Readiness Act and the Ensuring Coast Guard Readiness Act, indicate a willingness to deepen cooperation with foreign shipbuilders, including potential future construction projects. Hanwha Ocean’s acquisition of Philly Shipyard is part of this larger strategy, as the company plans to invest heavily in U.S.-based shipbuilding to support Washington’s goal of modernizing its fleet. The U.S. Navy has allocated $146.8 billion through 2028 for new shipbuilding initiatives, including replenishment oilers, salvage vessels, and guided-missile destroyers. Hanwha Ocean’s growing presence in the American defense market positions it as a key player in these developments. The Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ships were developed to replace older combat support ships in the U.S. Navy’s fleet, consolidating logistics support into a standardized platform. Built by General Dynamics NASSCO, these ships were designed with a focus on extended operational endurance, increased cargo capacity, and the ability to support carrier strike groups and other naval forces. The class consists of 14 vessels, each named after notable American explorers and pioneers, with construction spanning from 2001 to 2012. The vessels are operated by Military Sealift Command’s Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force to ensure logistical support for deployed forces. The USNS Wally Schirra (T-AKE 8) is one of these dry cargo ships, named after U.S. Navy Captain Walter Marty 'Wally' Schirra Jr., a Korean War veteran and one of NASA’s original Mercury Seven astronauts. The ship was built by NASSCO and launched in March 2009 before entering service with the U.S. Navy in September of the same year. Like other vessels in its class, Wally Schirra was designed to operate with a mixed civilian and military crew, resupplying naval vessels at sea with ammunition, food, spare parts, and other essential materials. The ship measures 210 meters in length, with a beam of 32.3 meters and a displacement of approximately 40,000 tons when fully loaded. It is powered by an integrated electric propulsion system with Fairbanks-Morse/MAN Diesel generators, driving a single fixed-pitch propeller for a top speed of 20 knots. The vessel has a range of 14,000 nautical miles at full speed and can carry up to 5,910 tons of dry cargo, 2,350 tons of fuel, and 783,000 cubic feet of cargo volume. It features a flight deck for vertical replenishment operations using helicopters such as the Sikorsky MH-60S Knighthawk, enabling rapid resupply operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/hanwha-ocean-becomes-first-south-korean-shipyard-to-complete-major-us-navy-ship-repair-on-usns-wally-schirra	2025-03-18T01:56:25-07:00

USS Ohio nuclear submarine returns to the Pacific with more firepower than all bombs in World War II combined	On March 13, 2025, the US Naval Sea Systems Command announced that the USS Ohio (SSGN 726), the first nuclear-powered guided-missile submarine of its class, had completed its three-year Major Maintenance Period (MMP) at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS &amp; IMF). The maintenance availability concluded on February 24, 2025, with Naval Sea Systems Command (SEA 07) granting certification for unrestricted operations. This extensive overhaul ensures the submarine remains operationally capable for joint and combined missions, a crucial step in its return to the Indo-Pacific theater.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Ohio-class guided-missile submarine USS Ohio (SSGN 726) transited Puget Sound on December 19, 2024, during routine operations under the administrative oversight of Submarine Group 9 in the Pacific Northwest. (Picture source: US DoD) More than half of the U.S. Navy's submarine force is currently deployed in the Indo-Pacific to counter China's expanding naval capabilities in the region, including the forward deployment of Virginia-class fast-attack submarines, such as the USS Minnesota, to Naval Base Guam. Several other nations also deploy or plan to deploy submarines in the region. For instance, Australia, under the AUKUS partnership with the United States and the United Kingdom, plans to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, including future SSN-AUKUS-class vessels, to enhance its maritime capabilities. Singapore has commissioned Invincible-class (Type 218SG) submarines, while India is modernizing its fleet with Kalvari-class (Scorpène-class) submarines. China operates a substantial submarine force, including Jin-class ballistic missile submarines and Shang-class attack submarines, while Pakistan has received Hangor-class submarines, an export version of China's 039A model. The three-year Major Maintenance Period (MMP) of the USS Ohio (SSGN 726) involved over 512,000 resource days of work and included structural and mechanical upgrades such as shaft replacement, torpedo tube modernization, main ballast tank repairs, and superstructure preservation. Additional work addressed material obsolescence issues, requiring cross-program collaboration within NAVSEA. One specific issue involved replacing a difficult-to-access section of trim and drain piping with minimal wall thickness, which was resolved through the construction of a mock-up and a new reinforcement method that minimized interference removal time. Project Superintendent Josh Fleming of Code 326 USS Ohio Project Team noted that the alternating crew structure minimized disruptions, allowing the work schedule to remain stable throughout the docking period. Constructed by General Dynamics Electric Boat, the USS Ohio (SSGN 726) was originally commissioned as a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in 1981, becoming the first U.S. Navy submarine to carry 24 Trident C4 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. During its time as an SSBN, the USS Ohio played a critical role in nuclear deterrence under the U.S. Navy’s strategic fleet, operating from Naval Submarine Base Bangor, Washington. Each patrol lasted approximately 70 days, with Blue and Gold crews rotating to maintain operational readiness. Following the 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, which determined that 14 SSBNs would be sufficient for U.S. strategic needs, the U.S. Navy decided to convert four Ohio-class submarines into guided-missile submarines (SSGNs). The USS Ohio was selected for this transformation, beginning a three-year refit in 2002. The process involved removing the Trident missile launch system and retrofitting 22 missile tubes to house up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, while the remaining two tubes were modified into lockout chambers for special operations forces. The submarine also received enhanced communications and intelligence-gathering capabilities, making it an effective platform for conventional strike missions and special warfare support. The USS Ohio was originally commissioned as a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in 1981, becoming the first U.S. Navy submarine to carry 24 Trident C4 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. (Picture source: Commander, Submarine Group 9) Since rejoining the fleet as an SSGN in 2006, the USS Ohio has participated in numerous forward-deployed missions. In 2010, it was involved in a highly publicized deployment where three Ohio-class SSGNs surfaced simultaneously in different parts of the world in response to Chinese missile tests. Additionally, it played a role in supporting special operations forces and conducting Tomahawk missile strike training exercises. The submarine was also notable for integrating the first female officers into the U.S. submarine force in 2011 and received multiple awards, including the Battle Efficiency Award (Battle 'E'), which recognized its operational excellence. Rear Adm. Thomas Wall, commander of Submarine Group Nine, highlighted the importance of these four Ohio-class guided-missile submarines (SSGNs) in maintaining operational presence in the Indo-Pacific, where more than half of the U.S. Navy’s submarine force is deployed. However, while the USS Ohio has now returned to active service, its future remains uncertain. The U.S. Navy’s 30-year shipbuilding plan indicates that the first two Ohio-class SSGNs—USS Ohio and USS Florida—are slated for retirement in 2026, with USS Michigan and USS Georgia following in 2028. The retirement of these four submarines will significantly reduce the Navy’s vertical launch payload capacity, given that they currently constitute nearly half of the Submarine Force’s Tomahawk missile launch capability. To compensate for the reduction in guided-missile capability following the retirement of the SSGNs, the Navy is procuring Block V Virginia-class attack submarines equipped with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which will feature four large-diameter vertical launch tubes capable of deploying up to 28 Tomahawk missiles per boat. This accompanies the transition to the Columbia-class SSBNs, with the first expected to enter service in 2031. The Columbia class will carry 16 missiles instead of 24 but will feature advancements in stealth, reactor longevity, and survivability. The Ohio-class submarines were developed in the early 1970s as a successor to the '41 for Freedom' fleet of SSBNs, which had been in service since the late 1950s. Compared to the earlier Benjamin Franklin and Lafayette classes, the Ohio-class submarines are among the most destructive military platforms ever built, as a single Ohio-class SSBN could carry warheads totaling more destructive power than all the bombs used in World War II combined. SSGNs, on the other hand, have the firepower of an entire surface battle group, carrying up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles. Their ability to launch dozens of Tomahawks in quick succession allows them to neutralize strategic targets from thousands of kilometers away, making them invaluable in modern warfare. As the largest class ever built for the U.S. Navy, the Ohio-class submarines measure 170 meters in length, with a beam of 13 meters and a maximum draft of 10.8 meters. (Picture source: US DoD) The fleet of Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) consists of 14 units, each capable of carrying up to 24 Trident II D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN-730) was the only boat in the class not named after a U.S. state, honoring a senator instrumental in U.S. strategic policy. USS Alabama (SSBN-731) has been a key component of the Pacific-based deterrent force, while USS Alaska (SSBN-732) and USS Nevada (SSBN-733) have also operated in the Pacific, conducting extended deterrent patrols. USS Tennessee (SSBN-734) was the first in the class to be equipped with Trident II D5 missiles, setting the standard for subsequent boats. The USS Pennsylvania (SSBN-735) holds the record for the longest strategic deterrent patrol. USS West Virginia (SSBN-736) and USS Kentucky (SSBN-737) have conducted multiple deterrence missions in the Atlantic fleet. USS Maryland (SSBN-738) and USS Nebraska (SSBN-739) have been integral to both Atlantic and Pacific deterrent operations. USS Rhode Island (SSBN-740), USS Maine (SSBN-741), USS Wyoming (SSBN-742), and USS Louisiana (SSBN-743) continue to conduct deterrence patrols, ensuring a continuous at-sea presence for the U.S. nuclear deterrent force. As the largest class of submarines ever built for the U.S. Navy, the Ohio-class submarines measure 170 meters in length, with a beam of 13 meters and a maximum draft of 10.8 meters. They have a surfaced displacement of 16,764 metric tons and a submerged displacement of 18,750 metric tons. Built between 1976 and 1997, the class originally consisted of 18 submarines, with four later converted into guided-missile submarines (SSGNs). The propulsion system consists of a single S8G pressurized water nuclear reactor, powering two geared turbines that generate 26 megawatts (35,000 shaft horsepower). The submarines also include an auxiliary 242-kilowatt electric motor and a Fairbanks Morse diesel generator for emergency power. Ohio-class submarines are capable of speeds exceeding 37 km/h (20 knots) while submerged and have an endurance limited only by food and maintenance requirements. Equipped with advanced sonar and navigation systems, Ohio-class submarines utilize the BQQ-6 passive bow-mounted array, BQR-19 navigation sonar, and TB-16 or BQR-23 towed arrays. Their armament varies based on configuration: SSBNs are fitted with 20 Trident II D5 SLBMs, while SSGNs have 22 missile tubes, each capable of holding seven Tomahawk cruise missiles, totaling 154. All Ohio-class submarines are also equipped with four 533-mm torpedo tubes for Mk-48 torpedoes.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/uss-ohio-nuclear-submarine-returns-to-the-pacific-with-more-firepower-than-all-bombs-in-world-war-ii-combined	2025-03-17T06:43:00-07:00

US Navy receives 13th Ship to Shore Connector LCAC 112 for improved beach landings	On March 13, 2025, the U.S. Navy received the 13th Ship to Shore Connector (SSC) unit, the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) 112, from Textron Systems. This followed acceptance trials conducted by the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey, which evaluated the craft’s compliance with operational and technical requirements. LCAC 112 is part of the Ship to Shore Connector (SSC) program, developed to replace the existing fleet of Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) vehicles while maintaining compatibility with amphibious operations and incorporating updates in materials, propulsion, and onboard systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Ship to Shore Connector (SSC) program was initiated to replace the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) fleet, which had been in service since the 1980s. (Picture source: US Navy) LCAC 112 retains the same footprint and well deck compatibility as its predecessor fleet. It is designed to transport payloads ranging from 60 to 75 tons, including weapon systems, vehicles, cargo, and personnel from amphibious ships to shore. The craft can operate in diverse environmental conditions, including over-the-beach landings. The SSC is designed for integration with well deck-equipped amphibious ships such as the LHD-1, LPD-17, LSD-41, and LSD-49 classes, as well as Expeditionary Transfer Docks (ESDs). It can function in both displacement and air-cushion modes within well decks, ensuring compatibility with shipboard deployment and recovery procedures. The Ship to Shore Connector (SSC) program was initiated to replace the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) fleet, which had been in service since the 1980s. The original LCAC-class design facilitated high-speed over-the-beach operations but required increasing maintenance as structural fatigue and component wear accumulated over decades of use. Recognizing the need for a replacement craft that could fulfill the same role while addressing reliability and supportability concerns, the Navy issued a request for proposals in 2010. Textron Systems was awarded the contract in 2012 for detailed design and construction. The first test and training craft, Craft 100, was delivered in 2020 for evaluation and crew training. By 2015, the first Service Life Extension Program (SLEP)-modified LCAC units had reached their 30-year service mark, leading to a phased retirement process. The transition to the SSC began in 2019, and the first operational SSC unit, LCAC 101, was delivered in August 2020. Subsequent deliveries included LCAC 102 through LCAC 106 between 2021 and 2023, with additional craft scheduled for future production under serial procurement contracts. The Navy’s LCAC inventory declined until 2023, after which SSC production was expected to restore fleet numbers. The Navy has contracted for a total of 73 SSC units. As of 2012, 80 LCAC units remained in inventory, with 39 completed SLEP conversions, seven in progress, and four awaiting induction. The Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) was introduced into service in 1986 to enhance amphibious transport capabilities, enabling the movement of weapon systems, equipment, cargo, and personnel from amphibious ships to shore, including areas without developed port infrastructure. The LCAC program emerged from the JEFF A and JEFF B hovercraft prototypes. Bell Aerospace’s JEFF B design was selected for full-scale production, featuring two ducted rear propellers. The first LCAC was delivered in 1984, achieving Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 1986. Full-rate production followed in 1987, with Textron Marine &amp; Land Systems and Avondale Gulfport Marine as the primary manufacturers. A total of 91 LCAC units were built, with deliveries concluding in 2001. To ensure interoperability with existing naval assets, the SSC-class maintains the same size and structural parameters as the LCAC while incorporating modifications. Its hull structure is constructed from corrosion-resistant aluminum to mitigate long-term degradation. The propulsion system includes a revised drivetrain with fewer gearboxes to enhance mechanical reliability. The electrical distribution system has been redesigned from 400 Hz to 60 Hz, aligning with shipboard power standards and improving component compatibility for maintenance and sustainment. The SSC introduces improvements in payload capacity, system survivability, and operational range compared to the LCAC. It is configured for operations in diverse environments, including marshes, swamps, and ice.

This design facilitates movement across various terrains, including water, sand, ice, and tidal flats, where conventional landing craft may be restricted. The ability to operate independent of tides and water depth enables these hovercraft to reach shorelines without developed port infrastructure. These characteristics contribute to their use in military logistics and amphibious operations, as well as in disaster relief and humanitarian assistance missions requiring access to coastal areas.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navy-receives-13th-ship-to-shore-connector-lcac-112-for-improved-beach-landings	2025-03-17T01:40:27-07:00	
US Resumes GLSDB Missile Deliveries to Ukraine to Sustain Deep Strikes on Russian Infrastructure	Washington has decided to resume supplying precision-guided GLSDB (Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb) missiles to the Ukrainian army. This decision comes as Ukraine has reportedly exhausted its stock of ATACMS missiles, which were already limited in number, and seeks to maintain its capability for deep strikes against Russian military infrastructure. According to sources cited by Reuters, the new versions of these munitions have been upgraded to more effectively counter Russian electronic warfare measures, which had previously reduced their effectiveness. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The GLSDB is designed to neutralize various targets, including fortified command centers, logistical infrastructure, air defense systems, and lightly armored vehicles. (Picture source: Saab) GLSDB missiles have a range of approximately 160 kilometers, allowing them to strike strategic targets beyond the front line, including logistical centers and ammunition depots. They combine a GBU-39 precision-guided bomb with an M26 rocket motor, providing significant operational flexibility. Jointly developed by Boeing and Saab, these missiles were designed for launch from ground-based platforms, adapting an air-launched munition for ground use. This adaptation represents a major advancement in their operational deployment. The GLSDB is designed to neutralize various targets, including fortified command centers, logistical infrastructure, air defense systems, and lightly armored vehicles. Its warhead combines a dense metal penetrator, such as tungsten, with a fragmentation casing, ensuring effectiveness against both reinforced structures and open-area targets. Its guidance system incorporates GPS, inertial navigation, and a laser designator, providing high accuracy with a margin of error of less than one meter. It can reach speeds of Mach 5 and a maximum altitude of approximately 150 km, ensuring maneuverability suited to battlefield requirements. Recent reports indicate that these new munitions could arrive on the battlefield within days, as stockpiles are already in place in Europe. The Ukrainian army reportedly stopped using previous versions months ago due to their vulnerability to Russian electronic countermeasures. In this context, recent tests have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of modifications to these missiles, with 19 test firings carried out. Among the improvements, the internal connections of the weapon have been reinforced to enhance resistance to electronic jamming. The United States initially acquired these weapons through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a military support program for Kyiv. Since the beginning of the conflict, Washington has invested nearly $33.2 billion in direct arms purchases for Ukraine, in partnership with American and allied manufacturers. The resumption of deliveries comes at a critical moment, as Kyiv calls for longer-range weapons to compensate for the limitations of the U.S.-supplied GMLRS missiles, which have a range of 70 kilometers. The GLSDB was designed to address this need by offering significantly extended strike capabilities. Recent assessments by Western intelligence services have highlighted the effectiveness of Russian electronic countermeasures, which have disrupted the guidance systems of several precision weapons, including 155 mm Excalibur artillery shells. To mitigate this issue, the latest GLSDB versions incorporate modifications that enhance resistance to these interferences. These munitions could provide Ukraine with a renewed ability to conduct deep strikes, limiting the operational freedom of Russian forces on the ground. Relations between the United States and Ukraine have faced increasing tensions in recent months, particularly due to uncertainty surrounding U.S. military support for Kyiv. Amid domestic political opposition and budgetary concerns, Washington temporarily suspended certain arms deliveries, including long-range ATACMS missiles and other critical munitions. At the same time, the U.S. reduced its strategic intelligence sharing with the Ukrainian military, limiting its ability to anticipate and counter Russian movements. This suspension led to a climate of mistrust between the two allies, particularly as some political factions in the U.S. began advocating for reduced American involvement in the conflict. In this context, discreet negotiations emerged between Washington and Moscow, exploring a potential de-escalation of the conflict, although Kyiv expressed reservations about any discussions involving territorial concessions. However, after several weeks of uncertainty, the U.S. gradually restored its military and strategic support to Ukraine. The resumption of arms deliveries, including the modernized GLSDB missiles, reflects Washington's intent to maintain pressure on Russian forces while addressing Kyiv’s requests for deep-strike capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-resumes-glsdb-missile-deliveries-to-ukraine-to-sustain-deep-strikes-on-russian-infrastructure	2025-03-17T01:10:13-07:00

Flash News: Ukrainian President Confirms First Combat Use of Enhanced Neptune Cruise Missile with 1,000 km Range	On March 15, 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed via a Telegram post that the Ukrainian defense industry has successfully tested a new version of the Neptune anti-ship missile, now modified to strike ground targets with precision. This development marks a major leap forward in Ukraine’s missile capabilities, with the newly adapted Neptune missile reportedly capable of striking targets up to 1,000 km away.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Neptune is a land-based anti-ship missile system developed by Ukraine, designed to target and destroy naval warships and coastal infrastructure with precision strikes, now upgraded for ground target engagements at a range of 1,000 km. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Neptune cruise missile, which was initially designed as an anti-ship weapon, has long been a cornerstone of Ukraine's coastal defense strategy. Since its introduction, the missile has proven effective in protecting Ukraine's maritime borders. However, the recent adaptation extends the missile’s role well beyond its initial purpose. The modification enables the missile to engage land-based targets, including military infrastructure, command centers, and high-value assets, with remarkable accuracy, effectively expanding Ukraine’s strategic reach. The transition of the Neptune missile from an anti-ship weapon to a versatile multi-target strike system began to take shape in April 2023, when Ukrainian defense officials publicly revealed that efforts were underway to modify the missile’s guidance system and warhead. These modifications were designed to enhance the missile’s ability to hit both stationary and moving ground targets. Though details about the specifics of the upgrades remain limited, it is believed that the guidance system of the missile has been re-engineered to accommodate a wider array of target types, including military infrastructure, air defense systems, and logistical hubs. More significantly, the range of the missile has been extended to 1,000 kilometers, providing Ukrainian forces with the ability to strike deep into Russian-occupied territories, a game-changing development in the ongoing conflict. Originally, the Neptune missile was based on the R-360 cruise missile and was designed to target warships such as cruisers, destroyers, and tank landing ships. The missile system was designed to operate in challenging conditions, including under electronic countermeasures, and could defeat targets in both good and adverse weather. The modified missile now brings the added benefit of being able to target land-based military assets, giving Ukraine a dual-purpose weapon system capable of operating in both maritime and land-based combat scenarios. The successful combat deployment of the modified Neptune missile has significant strategic implications for Ukraine. Its ability to strike targets at such long ranges gives Ukraine a potent tool to disrupt Russian operations across a much larger geographic area. This expanded capability allows Ukraine to target critical Russian infrastructure, including supply chains, air defense systems, and logistics hubs, far beyond the frontlines. The missile’s 1,000-kilometer range gives Ukrainian forces a considerable advantage, enabling them to engage high-value targets deep within Russian-occupied territories and complicating Russian military operations by targeting their supply and reinforcement routes. By extending their operational reach, Ukrainian forces can place further pressure on Russian defenses, making it harder for Russia to maintain and reinforce its positions. This shift in tactics could prove pivotal in weakening Russian forces and forcing them to divert resources and focus away from the frontlines. The modification of the Neptune missile from an anti-ship system to a multi-target strike weapon is a testament to the ingenuity and resilience of Ukraine's defense industry. Despite facing ongoing external pressures and limited resources, Ukrainian engineers have quickly adapted existing technologies to meet the evolving needs of the conflict. This success demonstrates the defense sector's ability to innovate in the face of adversity.

Breaking News: Japan to Deploy Anti-Ship Missiles on Kyushu Island Amid Growing China and North Korea Threats	According to information published by the Japanese Press Agency Kyodo News on March 15, 2024, the Japanese government has announced plans to consider deploying long-range missiles on the southwestern island of Kyushu. This decision is part of Japan's broader efforts to enhance its 'counterstrike capabilities,' a crucial component of the country's defense strategy to respond more effectively to emerging threats in the region. The main reasons for this deployment include Japan’s increasing concern over China's growing military assertiveness, particularly regarding Taiwan, and the ongoing missile and nuclear threats posed by North Korea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan's upgraded Type-12 Anti-Ship Missile System, set to be deployed on Kyushu Island, featuring enhanced stealth and long-range precision to strengthen defense against growing threats from China and North Korea. (Picture source: Wikimedia) These developments have raised alarm about the security of Japan’s southwestern islands, which are strategically vital due to their proximity to Taiwan and key sea lanes. The deployment of long-range missiles on Kyushu is intended to reinforce Japan’s deterrence capabilities, ensuring it has the means to strike enemy targets swiftly and effectively in the event of an emergency or escalation of tensions in the region. The move is also designed to bolster the security of the country’s southwestern Nansei island chain, which plays a critical role in Japan's defense strategy against potential regional aggression. The deployment is expected to begin by the end of Japan's next fiscal year in March 2026. Kyushu, located in the southwestern part of Japan, lies within striking distance of both China and North Korea, making it a critical point in Japan's defense strategy. The island’s location near the Nansei Islands is vital, as these islands act as a crucial buffer zone against potential military threats from China and other regional adversaries. Japan's growing security concerns are linked to China’s increasing military assertiveness in the East China Sea, frequent incursions into Japanese airspace and waters, and its ongoing ambitions regarding Taiwan. Additionally, the North Korean regime continues to test missiles and expand its nuclear arsenal, adding a persistent and growing threat to Japan’s defense strategy. In response to these escalating threats, Japan has been re-evaluating its military capabilities, seeking to enhance its deterrence and counterstrike capabilities. One of the critical components of this strategy is the deployment of long-range missiles, specifically an upgraded version of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's (GSDF) Type-12 anti-ship missile system. Initially designed to defend Japan’s coastal areas, the Type-12 missile has undergone significant technological advancements to extend its range and enhance its overall combat effectiveness. The original Type-12 system had a range of approximately 200 km, but with the recent upgrades, the missile's range has been extended to 1,000 km, and future plans aim for a maximum range of 1,200 km. This increased range will allow Japan to target enemy ships and installations along the coastlines of both China and North Korea, significantly enhancing its defensive and offensive capabilities in the region. Beyond its extended range, the upgraded Type-12 missile features advanced modifications to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS), making it less detectable by enemy radar systems and improving its stealth capabilities. This makes the missile far more difficult to intercept, increasing its effectiveness in contested environments where radar detection and anti-missile systems are prevalent. The missile also incorporates sophisticated guidance systems, allowing for more precise targeting of enemy vessels, both on the surface and near-shore. The combination of extended range, improved stealth, and enhanced accuracy makes the Type-12 missile a formidable tool for Japan's defense forces, especially as tensions rise in the Indo-Pacific region. The planned missile deployment will likely occur at two key sites in Kyushu: the GSDF’s surface-to-ship missile regiment garrisons in Yufu, Oita Prefecture, and the city of Kumamoto. These locations have been identified as strategically advantageous, providing coverage of the southwestern approach to Japan and the critical maritime lanes that run through the East China Sea. However, Okinawa, a southern prefecture that is closer to mainland China, will not be considered as a deployment site due to concerns over escalating tensions with Beijing. The Japanese government is wary that placing the missiles in Okinawa could provoke a sharp reaction from China, further complicating Japan's already sensitive geopolitical position. This missile deployment plan reflects Japan's broader strategy to enhance its military deterrence and counterstrike capabilities in the face of evolving security threats. The Type-12's advanced combat capabilities will significantly improve Japan’s ability to respond to any aggression or military escalation in the region. By deploying these missiles on Kyushu, Japan will strengthen the defense of its southwestern islands, ensuring that the country can respond effectively to any emerging threats in the Indo-Pacific region. This move is part of a larger effort by Japan to modernize its defense forces, upgrade its military technology, and ensure the country is well-prepared to face the growing challenges posed by its neighbors. It also underscores Japan's determination to maintain peace and stability in the region, particularly by reinforcing its defense alliances with countries like the United States. The Type-12 missile system, with its extended range, enhanced stealth features, and advanced targeting capabilities, will play a crucial role in ensuring Japan's defense forces can effectively deter and, if necessary, respond to any military aggression near its borders.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-japan-to-deploy-anti-ship-missiles-on-kyushu-island-amid-growing-china-and-north-korea-threats	2025-03-16T03:18:17-07:00	
Flash News: Trump Administration Directs U.S. Military Forces to Explore Panama Canal Control Options	On March 13, 2025, NBC News reported that the White House had ordered the U.S. military to draft potential options to increase American troop presence in Panama as part of President Donald Trump’s goal of 'reclaiming' the Panama Canal. According to officials familiar with the planning, U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) is preparing a range of strategies, from deepening cooperation with Panamanian security forces to the more drastic measure of using military force to seize control of the vital waterway. The course of action will depend largely on the level of cooperation from Panama’s security apparatus, with military force being a last resort.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A tugboat assists the U.S. Navy littoral combat ship USS Independence (LCS 2) as the ship prepares to enter the Gatun Lock during a transit of the Panama Canal. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Panama Canal remains one of the world’s most critical and strategic waterway chokepoints, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its significance is not only economic but also military, as it plays a key role in global trade and logistics. Since the U.S. relinquished control of the canal in 1999, Panama has held sovereignty over this crucial asset. However, the possibility of renewed U.S. involvement or control of the canal is a matter of intense concern for both Panama and its neighbors. The U.S. military’s strategic interest in the canal is clear: it provides unmatched logistical advantages, allowing for swift movement of naval and military assets between the two oceans. If tensions rise, a disruption in the canal’s operations would have far-reaching consequences for global trade and security. The options being considered by U.S. military planners range from working more closely with Panama's security forces to full-scale intervention. The first option would involve enhanced cooperation in securing the canal. U.S. military personnel might provide expertise, specialized training, and intelligence-sharing to Panamanian security forces. Joint operations, especially in counterterrorism and maritime security, could be used to safeguard the canal and ensure that it remains operational. This strategy would likely involve the use of U.S. Navy assets, such as patrol boats and Coast Guard vessels, alongside Panamanian forces to maintain security in the region. However, if diplomatic efforts fail and Panama’s forces prove uncooperative or insufficient, the U.S. might resort to military force to take control of the canal. This would likely involve the rapid deployment of American ground forces, Navy SEALs, and Army Rangers to seize key canal infrastructure, such as locks, control towers, and strategic military installations. The U.S. would likely establish air superiority through the use of fighter jets, bombers, and surveillance aircraft, while maritime forces could deploy to blockade the canal or provide logistical support for ground operations. The speed and scale of such an operation would be critical, as the U.S. would need to maintain air and sea dominance to prevent any counteractions from Panama’s military forces or external actors. Cyber warfare would also play a critical role in any military intervention. Given the reliance of Panama's infrastructure on digital systems, U.S. forces could use cyber capabilities to disrupt communications, transportation networks, and military operations, further tipping the balance of power in favor of the U.S. before any kinetic military operations take place. This would allow the U.S. to cripple Panama’s ability to respond effectively, ensuring that military operations could be executed with minimal resistance. If military force is used, U.S. planners would likely draw on their extensive combat capabilities, ranging from advanced air and naval assets to elite special operations units. However, the risks of such an intervention would be considerable. Panama’s government would likely oppose U.S. intervention, which could lead to significant diplomatic fallout and regional instability. Neighboring countries, including Colombia and Venezuela, could view the U.S. actions as a violation of Panama’s sovereignty and respond with heightened tensions. Diplomatic efforts would almost certainly be required to mitigate backlash from Latin American nations and the broader international community. Panama’s military capabilities are limited, given that the country abolished its standing army in 1990. Instead, Panama relies on various security forces to maintain order and defend its borders. The National Border Service (SENAFRONT), along with the Panamanian National Police, is responsible for internal security and border control. Panama's security focus is primarily on the southern border with Colombia, an area that sees significant migration and drug trafficking. The National Police, which numbers approximately 20,000 personnel, handles general law enforcement duties, while the Border Service, with a force of around 4,000, is more specialized in handling border issues, such as smuggling, illegal immigration, and counterinsurgency efforts. The country has no heavy military equipment and focuses primarily on light patrol and surveillance capabilities. Panama’s military assets consist mostly of light transport vehicles, patrol boats, and surveillance aircraft. Its air and naval forces, specifically the National Aeronaval Service, are equipped with light aircraft and helicopters for transport and surveillance, such as Beechcraft King Airs, Cessna aircraft, and AW139 helicopters. While the Panamanian air force and navy play an important role in securing the country’s borders and maintaining maritime security, they would be largely outmatched by U.S. forces if the situation escalated to full-scale conflict. Panama's reliance on external training and support, particularly from Colombia and the United States, further highlights its limited military capabilities. While both countries have provided training for Panama’s security forces, especially in the areas of internal security and border control, the nation does not possess the military power to mount a significant defense against a major foreign intervention. Panama's security apparatus is designed to address internal and border security concerns rather than engage in conventional military operations. The Panamanian military’s primary assets include a small fleet of patrol boats and coastal combatants, such as Saettia-class vessels, and amphibious landing craft. These are suited for low-level coastal defense, but they would not stand a chance against U.S. naval and air superiority. In the air, Panama’s fleet consists of a mix of light transport aircraft and helicopters, such as the AW139, Bell 407, and Bell 212, which are more suited to domestic security and transport duties than combat operations. Additionally, Panama’s limited cyber defense capabilities would make it highly vulnerable to a cyberattack by a more technologically advanced adversary, such as the U.S. In the event of a conflict, the U.S. would likely use its significant cyber warfare assets to disable Panama’s communications, disrupt its military coordination, and cripple critical infrastructure. The potential for U.S. military intervention in Panama, particularly if Panama’s government resists increased American influence over the canal, presents significant challenges. While Panama’s security forces are trained to handle internal and border security operations, they lack the heavy military capabilities to engage in large-scale combat operations. The United States, with its advanced military assets and strategic importance of the Panama Canal, would likely have the upper hand in any direct confrontation. However, such an intervention would have substantial diplomatic and regional repercussions, requiring careful consideration of both military tactics and international diplomacy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-trump-administration-directs-u-s-military-forces-to-explore-panama-canal-control-options	2025-03-15T11:36:27-07:00	
Focus: What Could Be the Option for Canada to Replace F-35 Fighter Jet Acquisition After Political Tensions with US?	Canada is actively looking at potential alternatives to the U.S.-built F-35 stealth fighter and will hold conversations with rival aircraft makers, Canadian Defence Minister Bill Blair said late on March 14, 2025. This shift comes as concerns grow regarding the unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy under the U.S. President Trump administration, as well as broader strategic considerations regarding defense relationships and technological dependencies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The CF-18 Hornet fighter jet, which has been in service with the Royal Canadian Air Force since 1982, was planned to be replaced by the U.S.-built F-35 as part of Canada's defense modernization efforts. (Picture source: Canada DoD) Canada's contract for the U.S. F-35 fighter jets is valued at C$19 billion ($13.2 billion), with the deal finalized in 2023. The agreement, which aims to replace Canada’s aging fleet of CF-18 Hornets, involves the purchase of 88 F-35s. Lockheed Martin emerged victorious in the bidding process, beating out Saab AB and Boeing Co. The contract is divided into tranches, and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 jets. This deal marks a significant step in Canada's defense modernization efforts, ensuring the Royal Canadian Air Force remains capable of meeting contemporary security challenges. The current fighter jet in service with the Canadian Air Force is the CF-18 Hornet. Canada operates approximately 76 CF-18s, which have been in service since 1982. These aircraft were originally acquired to replace the aging fleet of CF-100 Canucks and were designed as multirole fighters capable of both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. Although the CF-18s have been modernized over the years with upgrades to avionics, radar, and weapons systems, they are nearing the end of their operational lifespan and are being replaced by the F-35 as part of Canada's ongoing defense modernization efforts. The F-35 program, led by the United States and developed by Lockheed Martin, has been a cornerstone of many NATO nations' defense strategies. Canada, which has been in negotiations to procure these advanced jets for several years, is now reassessing its commitment to the project. This re-evaluation is largely driven by a desire to reduce dependency on the U.S. military-industrial complex, especially as Washington’s foreign policy direction under the Trump administration has become increasingly unilateral and unpredictable. Canada’s longstanding military and defense alliance with the United States has been one of the cornerstones of its national security strategy. However, in recent years, particularly under President Donald Trump, there has been growing unease over Washington's approach to global security and defense commitments. The 'America First' doctrine and the U.S.'s increased focus on domestic priorities have led to a perceived erosion of the traditional partnership that has long defined North American defense. Minister Blair’s remarks signal Canada’s desire to explore other options that might offer greater control over its defense strategy, autonomy in procurement, and a more stable geopolitical environment. The F-35, with its high cost and reliance on U.S.-centric maintenance and logistics, represents a symbol of this dependency. Blair’s statement also points to broader concerns regarding technological sovereignty. As one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, the F-35 is a highly integrated system that relies on global logistics, intelligence-sharing, and technical support from its U.S. manufacturer. For Canada, the prospect of being locked into a system that is not only expensive but heavily reliant on U.S. infrastructure raises questions about long-term sustainability and security. The political and economic turbulence surrounding the Trump administration, coupled with increasing calls within Canada for more autonomous defense capabilities, has spurred the search for alternatives. The notion of reducing Canada’s reliance on foreign military technologies could lead the country to investigate options such as the French Rafale, Sweden’s Gripen, or even pursuing indigenous development projects. Canada’s current fleet of fighter jets consists of the CF-18 Hornet, which has been in service since the 1980s and is reaching the end of its operational lifespan. The CF-18 was originally designed as a multirole fighter, capable of both air superiority and ground attack missions, and has served Canada well in various international operations. However, its age and increasing maintenance demands are making it less viable for the future. As a result, Canada has been actively seeking to replace the CF-18 with a more modern and capable aircraft. The Swedish Saab Gripen fighter jet has long been regarded as a possible alternative to the F-35 for Canada. Known for its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and proven performance, the Gripen offers an appealing balance between modernity and operational independence. With Canada’s existing defense relationships with European countries, including Sweden, the Gripen could align with Canada's strategic vision of fostering closer ties with NATO allies outside the U.S. The Gripen is also designed to be a highly cost-effective solution for countries seeking a versatile and efficient platform for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. Its advanced avionics, combined with operational flexibility and the ability to operate from austere environments, make it an ideal candidate for Canada’s diverse defense needs. Another option under consideration is the French Dassault Rafale, a multi-role fighter jet used by several countries around the world. Its ability to perform a wide range of missions, from air superiority to strike and reconnaissance, makes it an attractive alternative. France’s military industry has a history of working closely with Canada, which may facilitate smoother negotiations for potential integration into the Canadian Armed Forces. The Rafale’s proven combat performance in various theaters, including its deployment in the Middle East and Africa, demonstrates its reliability in real-world combat conditions. Its combination of advanced radar, sensor systems, and multirole capabilities positions it as a highly capable platform for a wide range of operations. The Eurofighter Typhoon, a product of a European consortium involving the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain, is another possible alternative. The Typhoon is primarily an air superiority fighter, but it also offers multirole capabilities, making it a versatile platform for Canada’s needs. The Typhoon’s advanced AESA radar, superior maneuverability, and high-speed capabilities make it one of the most formidable air combat platforms in the world. It has proven its worth in NATO operations and is already in service with several European air forces. For Canada, the Typhoon represents a strong European alternative that could enhance interoperability with NATO allies while providing a highly capable air combat solution. The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, already in service with several NATO countries, represents another potential option for Canada. As a highly capable multirole fighter, the Super Hornet offers flexibility in both air superiority and strike missions. While Canada’s current fleet includes the older F/A-18 Hornet, transitioning to the Super Hornet could offer operational efficiencies, including shared parts and training systems. The Super Hornet is also known for its combat performance and versatility, having been deployed in numerous conflict zones. Its ability to operate from aircraft carriers, even though Canada does not currently operate carriers, adds an additional layer of flexibility in joint NATO operations. The Lockheed Martin F-16V Viper, a modernized version of the classic F-16, is another possible option. The F-16V offers advanced avionics, including the AN/APG-83 AESA radar, and provides a more cost-effective alternative to the F-35. The F-16V is highly capable in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions and is already used by numerous NATO allies. Its lower cost compared to the F-35 makes it an attractive option for countries looking to modernize their fleets without the high price tag. Its combat-proven performance and multirole capabilities ensure that it remains a relevant option in today’s modern battlefield. Finally, there is the possibility of Canada developing an indigenous fighter program, though this would be a far more complex and costly endeavor. With technological advancements in defense and aerospace, Canadian defense manufacturers could explore the creation of a homegrown fighter that would not only reduce reliance on foreign technology but also bolster Canada’s defense industry and innovation. An indigenous program could allow Canada to tailor its fighter jet to its specific needs, ensuring that it remains independent from foreign suppliers while strengthening its national defense capabilities. An additional potential option that could become relevant for Canada is the United Kingdom’s Tempest program. This next-generation fighter program, which is still in its developmental stages, is being led by the UK with participation from Italy and Sweden. The Tempest is designed to provide advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence, stealth, and autonomous systems, making it an attractive option for future combat needs. While still several years from its expected entry into service, the Tempest could offer Canada access to cutting-edge technology and the opportunity to partner with European allies in developing a next-gen fighter. However, as the aircraft is not expected to be ready until the 2030s, Canada would likely need an interim solution to replace its aging CF-18 fleet. Beyond the technical and geopolitical aspects, there are significant economic implications of such a decision. Canada’s defense budget has been under scrutiny for years, with advocates for increased spending arguing that the country needs to modernize its military assets to stay competitive on the global stage. The decision to pursue an alternative to the F-35 would not only involve procurement costs but also long-term maintenance, training, and operational expenses. The choice of a more independent system could result in a more manageable cost structure, reducing the financial strain that comes with the highly specialized nature of the F-35 program. Strategically, the decision to explore alternatives reflects Canada’s desire to assert more independence in its defense policy. As global military alliances shift, and with the unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy, Canada’s move to reconsider its reliance on American-made fighter jets signals a growing realization that the country’s security interests must be adaptable to changing political realities. Canada’s reassessment of the F-35 program is a sign of a larger trend toward reevaluating defense dependencies in an increasingly volatile world. With rising concerns over the direction of U.S. foreign policy, Canada seeks to diversify its defense capabilities and pursue options that better align with its national interests. While the F-35 remains one of the most advanced fighter jets in existence, the quest for alternatives—whether European or indigenous—reflects a desire for more control, more flexibility, and a stronger, self-reliant military future. The coming years will likely see Canada navigating a delicate balance between traditional alliances and new, independent defense partnerships.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-what-could-be-the-option-for-canada-to-replace-f-35-fighter-jet-acquisition-after-political-tensions-with-us	2025-03-15T04:52:07-07:00	
Exclusive | Belarus already produced several launcher systems for the Oreshnik ballistic missile to expand Russia’s strike capabilities	On March 13, 2025, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko stated that the Russian Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) has not yet been deployed in Belarus and confirmed ongoing work on related components. Speaking to reporters in the Kremlin, Lukashenko explained that while Belarus does not currently possess the missile, it has initiated manufacturing of several launchers, which are nearing completion. He specified that Belarus requires missiles supplied by Russia to complete the system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lukashenko explained that while Belarus does not currently possess the missile, it has initiated manufacturing of several launchers, which are nearing completion. (Picture source: Russian MoD/Illustrative image) Belarus is producing launchers for the Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile system and expects Russian missile deliveries at a later stage. During an official visit to Moscow, Lukashenko noted that the placement of the Oreshnik system in Belarus is progressing in accordance with bilateral agreements. Alexei Polishchuk, head of the second department of CIS countries at the Russian Foreign Ministry, previously stated that the deployment of these missile systems in Belarus would follow the security agreements ratified by both governments. Belarus has historically been involved in the production of transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) and missile launch platforms. During the Soviet era, the Minsk Automobile Plant (MAZ) developed several TEL systems, including the MAZ-547A, which was used for the RSD-10 Pioneer (SS-20 Saber) intermediate-range ballistic missile system. This launcher provided mobility, improving deployment capabilities. In the 1980s, Belarus contributed to the MAZ-7916, which was used as the TEL for the RT-2PM Topol (SS-25 Sickle) intercontinental ballistic missile. The mobility of these systems played a role in ensuring the survivability of Soviet missile forces. Production of missile launchers continues in Belarus through MAZ and the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant (MZKT). MAZ, founded in 1944, initially focused on heavy-duty vehicles before shifting to military applications, such as the MAZ-543, introduced in 1962 for the TEMP missile launcher. In 1991, the division responsible for military transport was separated from MAZ to form MZKT, which has continued producing specialized military transporters. The MZKT-79221, developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, serves as the chassis for the Topol-M missile system, while the MZKT-7930 'Astrolog,' introduced in the early 1990s, supports systems such as the Iskander ballistic missile and the Pantsir-S1 air defense system. Security cooperation between Belarus and Russia is formalized through several agreements. On February 26, 2025, the lower house of the Belarusian parliament ratified a draft law approving a security treaty with Russia within the framework of the Union State. Signed in Minsk on December 6, 2024, the agreement is awaiting approval from the upper house before being signed into law by Lukashenko. This treaty formalizes security cooperation and includes provisions for military base arrangements, facilitating the deployment of Russian military assets in Belarus. According to Russian sources, the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) has a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers, a speed exceeding Mach 10 (12,400 km/h), and a payload capacity of up to 1.5 tons. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that no existing missile defense systems are capable of intercepting the Oreshnik, and Russian analysts claim that the Oreshnik could only be intercepted by their S-500 air defense system. Reports suggest that the missile is derived from the discontinued RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile program. Some assessments have questioned its precision in conventional strikes, indicating it may be designed for nuclear payloads. Belarus has historically been involved in the production of several transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) and missile launch platforms for Russia, including the MZKT-7930 Astrolog used by the Iskander ballistic missile system. (Picture source: Russian social media) Discussions on Oreshnik deployment intensified after Lukashenko's request during a December 6, 2024, meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State. He cited NATO military activities in Poland and Lithuania as security concerns, stating that the missile system would serve as a deterrent. Putin responded that deployment could occur in the latter half of 2025, depending on production progress. He stated that while the missiles would be part of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Belarusian authorities would have a role in determining targeting parameters. The Oreshnik missile system was first used in combat on November 21, 2024, in a strike against a defense facility in Dnipro, Ukraine. The Russian government stated that the strike was a response to Ukraine’s authorization of long-range attacks inside Russian territory. Western defense officials, including from Estonia and the United Kingdom, assessed the missile launch as a strategic signal rather than solely a tactical operation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested the timing of the strike was politically motivated, potentially aimed at influencing U.S. policy under President Donald Trump’s administration. Belarusian officials state that security cooperation with Russia does not pose a threat to third countries. Speaking at the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on February 26, 2025, Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov stated that the presence of Russian nuclear and conventional missile systems in Belarus was a defensive measure. He referenced Belarus’s decision in the 1990s to relinquish its nuclear arsenal under the Budapest Memorandum and stated that Western security assurances had not been upheld. Ryzhenkov said the deployment of Oreshnik missiles would serve as a deterrent against NATO military activity in the region. Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin has stated that the deployment of the Oreshnik missile system and tactical nuclear weapons increases Belarus’s defense capabilities. While he did not specify a deployment timeline, he confirmed that work is ongoing. Russian officials have described the Oreshnik as a hypersonic system designed to penetrate advanced defenses. According to Russian sources, multiple Oreshnik missiles launched in coordination could generate destructive force comparable to nuclear weapons, without the radiation effects of traditional nuclear warheads. The possible deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus has drawn international attention. Western analysts view it as part of Russia’s broader strategy concerning NATO and Ukraine. U.S. intelligence assessments indicate that while Russia has started producing the missile, its full capabilities remain unverified. Belarusian authorities state that deployment decisions align with national security interests and the Union State agreement with Russia. As the treaty awaits final approval, discussions on Oreshnik deployment are expected to continue throughout 2025.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-belarus-already-produced-several-launcher-systems-for-the-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-to-expand-russias-strike-capabilities	2025-03-14T06:49:30-07:00	
US Announces Support for Japan’s Hypersonic Glider Program Against Growing Indo-Pacific Threats	The U.S. State Department has approved a potential Foreign Military Sale (FMS) to Japan, estimated at $200 million, for equipment and services supporting the development of the Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile (HVGP) program. Announced by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on March 10, 2025, this decision marks a further step in the technological and military cooperation between Tokyo and Washington. The project, overseen by Japan’s Ministry of Defense and the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency (ATLA), aims to equip Japan with a hypersonic glider designed to enhance the defense of its remote islands. The proposed sale is now awaiting final approval from the U.S. Congress. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On February 7, 2025, Japan Unveils New Flight Tests for Its Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (Picture source: Japan’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency) Japan’s initiative to develop hypersonic weapons dates back to 2018, when a program was launched to enhance the long-range strike capabilities of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). The HVGP, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), consists of a hypersonic glider carrying a high-explosive warhead, launched by a solid-fuel booster before traveling at extreme speeds toward its target. This system is primarily intended for the defense of the Ryūkyū Islands and other strategic territories, reinforcing Japan’s military posture amid regional security concerns. The HVGP program is structured in progressive phases. The initial version, referred to as Block 1, is based on existing technology and is expected to have a range of 500 to 900 kilometers. This first variant is planned for deployment in fiscal year 2026 to provide an operational capability in the shortest possible timeframe. Subsequent developments include Block 2A and Block 2B, which will incorporate more advanced technologies, including wave rider flight technology, enabling greater maneuverability and improved penetration against air defense systems. These versions are projected to have an extended range of 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers, allowing them to engage targets beyond Japan’s territorial waters, including moving naval assets such as aircraft carriers. These enhanced versions are scheduled for completion by 2027, with operational deployment expected in the 2030s. The Japanese Ministry of Defense has already conducted four successful test flights of the HVGP from a site in California: one in August 2024, two in November 2024, and another in January 2025. These tests validate progress in the program and the viability of the technology, although challenges remain, particularly in terminal guidance and heat resistance at hypersonic speeds. U.S. support for Japan’s hypersonic glider program includes the provision of key equipment and services. The proposed package encompasses test preparation, technical assistance, transportation of equipment, and coordination meetings between Japanese and U.S. experts. These services will be delivered directly by the U.S. government, with no offset agreement currently planned. If such an agreement is pursued, it would be defined in subsequent negotiations between Tokyo and Washington. The U.S. State Department justified the sale by stating that it aligns with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. The agreement is intended to strengthen Japan’s defense capabilities, given its status as a key U.S. ally and a major contributor to political and economic stability in the Indo-Pacific. According to the DSCA, the sale will enhance Japan’s ability to respond to evolving threats, particularly by improving the defense of its remote territories. The agency also emphasized that this transaction will not alter the fundamental military balance in the region, a statement likely aimed at addressing concerns from other regional powers, particularly China and North Korea. An important aspect of this transaction is that it will not require the deployment of additional U.S. government personnel or private contractors to Japan. Furthermore, the DSCA assured that this sale will not negatively impact U.S. defense readiness, meaning that the equipment provided will not be drawn from active U.S. military inventories. The HVGP program is advancing at a time of increasing investment in hypersonic technologies by major global powers, including the United States, China, and Russia. Hypersonic weapons are considered a key element in modern warfare due to their ability to strike targets rapidly while evading conventional defense systems. For Japan, acquiring this capability represents a significant strategic shift. Amid China's growing military presence in the East China Sea and continued security challenges posed by North Korea, Tokyo is working to enhance its defense capabilities with autonomous long-range strike options. This effort is also part of a broader initiative to reduce reliance on foreign navigation and intelligence systems, strengthening Japan’s independent surveillance and targeting infrastructure. With the U.S. State Department’s approval, the HVGP program moves forward toward a new phase. If the U.S. Congress approves the transaction, Japan will gain critical technical and logistical support to finalize its hypersonic glider development. This will provide Tokyo with an advanced deterrence capability, a significant factor in maintaining security in a region marked by ongoing strategic rivalries.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-announces-support-for-japans-hypersonic-glider-program-against-growing-indo-pacific-threats	2025-03-14T06:44:33-07:00	
Taiwan to equip new light frigates with XTR-102A2 20mm remote weapon systems for patrol missions in the Taiwan Strait	As reported by The Liberty Times on March 7, 2025, the Taiwanese Navy is set to receive the first vessel from its Light Frigate Program before October 2026. The program, which includes both air defense and anti-submarine variants, is progressing according to the schedule set at Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Company (JSSC). Military sources confirmed that the new light frigates will be equipped with the XTR-102A2 dual-tube 20mm remote weapon systems for side defense instead of previously considered remote-controlled 30mm autocannons.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan’s Light Frigate Program aims to deliver 12 ships to replace the six Jiyang-class frigates, as well as provide a platform optimized for operations in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters. (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) The XTR-102 is a close-range 20mm remote weapon system developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST). It integrates traditional weapon systems with optoelectronic targeting and remote operation. The system has two primary models: the XTR-101, a single-tube optoelectronic remote-controlled turret, and the XTR-102, a dual-tube variant. The latter has two derivatives: the XTR-102A1 for shore-based installations and the XTR-102A2 for ship-mounted applications. The XTR-102 has been installed across multiple platforms, including those operated by the Republic of China Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. The XTR-102A2 uses a dual-tube T-75 20mm machine gun, with a firing rate of 400 to 1,200 rounds per minute and a maximum effective range of 2,000 meters. The system features an independent optoelectronic targeting suite, allowing it to operate autonomously. It is designed for engaging small, fast-moving targets, including drones and speedboats. The turret is mounted on the light frigate’s port and starboard sides, providing short-range automated defense. The system is also integrated into the Coast Guard Administration’s 600-ton Anping-class offshore patrol vessels. The XTR-102A2 ship-mounted variant has been deployed on platforms including the Kuang Hua VI-class missile boat and Taiwan’s 4,000-ton Chiayi-class offshore patrol vessel. Taiwan’s Light Frigate Program was initiated in 2022 due to delays in the Zhenhai Project, one of the 12 shipbuilding plans of the Republic of China Navy which aimed to create a new class of frigates with a 4,500-ton displacement. The lack of sufficient medium and large ships to counter the People’s Liberation Army Navy led to the reallocation of the Zhenhai Project budget toward light frigate construction. The first ship was scheduled to begin construction in 2023, with two configurations: air defense and anti-submarine. The program aims to deliver 12 ships to replace the six Jiyang-class frigates, as well as fill a critical gap in Taiwan’s naval capabilities, providing a platform optimized for operations in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters. The new class of ships will function as versatile assets, capable of responding to gray zone threats, patrolling key maritime routes, escorting supply ships, and supporting military exercises. The initial design of a light frigate concept was presented at the 2018 Kaohsiung International Maritime and Defense Industry Exhibition. The concept included a 1,400-ton vessel designed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Taiwan International Shipbuilding. The ship measured 85 meters in length, 13.1 meters in width, and had a draft of 3.2 meters. It featured a displacement of approximately 1,400 tons, two diesel engines, a maximum speed of 30 knots, and a cruising range of 2,200 nautical miles at 12 knots. The vessel was armed with a rotating phased array radar, a 76mm rapid-fire gun, eight anti-ship missiles, and 16 medium- and short-range air defense missiles. It also included anti-submarine torpedoes and the XTR-102A2 twin-tube remote-controlled turret. The types of missiles were unspecified, but animations suggested the presence of Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles and Sea Sword II air defense missiles. The XTR-102A2 uses a dual-tube T-75 20mm machine gun, with a firing rate of 400 to 1,200 rounds per minute and a maximum effective range of 2,000 meters. (Picture source: NCSIST) In August 2022, Taiwan’s National Defense Budget confirmed that the planned 'new generation frigate' with four-sided fixed array radar would be replaced by a smaller 1,500-2,000 ton light frigate utilizing rotating array radar. The budget for the program remained at NT$24.549 billion, with no changes to the implementation schedule. A special report released in October 2022 outlined that the People's Liberation Army Navy's deployment of Type 053H3, Type 054A, and Type 056A missile frigates had necessitated the construction of a 2,500-ton light frigate. The plan called for the air defense prototype to be completed by 2025 and the anti-submarine prototype by 2026. Legislative discussions confirmed that an additional 10 light frigates would follow the two prototype ships. Following the project approval, a bidding process for the combat system and hull platform was launched. The combat system was entrusted to the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, while the hull construction was opened for domestic competition. The total budget for the two prototype ships was set at NT$20 billion, with NT$4.6 billion allocated for the air defense variant and NT$4.45 billion for the anti-submarine variant. Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Company (JSSC) was awarded the construction contract in May 2023, with the contract formally initiated on May 12. The program called for radar stealth design, an aluminum upper structure with a steel lower hull, and integration with the CMS-330 combat management system. By mid-2023, revisions were made to the ship's design following internal discussions regarding space limitations. The original specifications called for a vessel under 110 meters in length with a displacement of 2,500 tons. However, it was determined that this configuration would not allow for sufficient internal space for future capability enhancements. As a result, the design was adjusted to a displacement of nearly 3,000 tons with a total length approaching 120 meters. The exterior and interior design responsibilities were assigned to a foreign contractor, and Gibbs &amp; Cox was selected to design the hull. The final design resembles a scaled-down version of the U.S. Navy’s Constellation-class frigate. In the 1990s, the US agreed to transfer eight Knox-class frigates to the Taiwanese Navy, which were later renamed as the Chi Yang-class. (Picture source: Wikimedia/玄史生) Construction of the air defense variant commenced in November 2023, followed by the anti-submarine variant in January 2024. Additional ceremonies were held in November 2024 for the prototype’s structural assembly at the Xingao Shipyard in Kaohsiung City. The program remains on track for the first two ships to be delivered by the end of October 2026, after which a decision will be made regarding full-scale production of the remaining 10 light frigates. The ships' specifications include a standard displacement of 2,500 tons and a full load displacement of 3,500 tons. The overall length is 115 meters, with a beam of 15 meters. They utilize a Combined diesel-electric or gas (CODLOG) propulsion system, comprising one GE LM2500+G4 gas turbine engine and two electric propulsion motors. The maximum speed is over 30 knots, and the operational endurance exceeds 2,200 nautical miles at a speed of 12 knots. The crew consists of 90 personnel, with a lieutenant colonel as captain. Each light frigate is equipped with a Mk 75 naval gun, a Phalanx close-in weapon system, and two XTR-102A2 remote-controlled machine guns. The air defense variant has an eight-tube Huayang vertical launch system capable of deploying 32 Sea Sword II air defense missiles. It can carry up to 16 Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missiles or eight extended-range Hsiung Feng III missiles. The anti-submarine variant includes two eight-tube Sea Sword II missile launchers, up to 16 anti-ship missiles, and two triple-tube Mk 32 surface ship torpedo launchers. The electronic warfare suite consists of two Mk 36 SRBOC jammer launchers and an AN/SLQ-25 torpedo countermeasure system. The ships feature a Type 997 3D air search radar, a fire control radar, a navigation radar, and a TRAPS towed variable-depth sonar for anti-submarine detection. The combat management system is the CMS-330, integrated with the Xunlian Combat Management System and the Dacheng Tactical Digital Data Link System. The ships have a dedicated flight deck designed to operate an S-70C(M)-1/2 anti-submarine helicopter but do not include a hangar. A shipborne small boat is also part of the standard equipment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/taiwan-to-equip-new-light-frigates-with-xtr-102a2-20mm-remote-weapon-systems-for-patrol-missions-in-the-taiwan-strait	2025-03-14T06:17:30-07:00

Turkish Navy Strengthens its Underwater Power with Atmaca Missile Capable of Discreet Long-Range Strikes	The Turkish Navy has taken a step in developing its underwater strike capabilities with the successful test launch of the encapsulated variant of the Atmaca anti-ship missile. Conducted from the TCG Preveze submarine off the coast of Mersin in the Mediterranean Sea, this test represents a major milestone for Turkey’s defense industry and confirms the country's ability to equip its submarines with domestically developed weapon systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Atmaca missile is designed to replace the Boeing RGM-84 Harpoon currently in service with the Turkish Navy (Picture source: Turkish MoD) The announcement was made by Haluk Görgün, head of the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB), who highlighted the event as an important achievement in Turkey’s efforts to enhance its self-reliance in military technology. The missile, developed and manufactured by Roketsan, was launched from a 533 mm torpedo tube inside a watertight capsule equipped with a propeller. Once expelled from the submarine, the capsule released the missile, which then activated its propulsion system to proceed toward the designated target. Footage shared on social media indicates that the tested missile was not equipped with a live warhead, as no impact was observed. A key objective of this demonstration was to confirm the system’s compatibility with the torpedo tubes of Turkish submarines, particularly those of the Preveze and Gür classes. These submarines will gain this capability following their modernization with the MÜREN combat management system, developed by HAVELSAN. This upgrade enables Turkish submarines to integrate domestically produced weapons, including the AKYA heavyweight torpedo and now the encapsulated Atmaca missile. The Atmaca missile is designed to replace the Boeing RGM-84 Harpoon currently in service with the Turkish Navy. Already deployed on Ada-class corvettes and modernized Barbaros-class frigates, its submarine-launched version expands operational options by allowing Turkish submarines to engage surface targets from long range while maintaining a low detection profile. Developed by Roketsan since 2009, the Atmaca is an all-weather anti-ship cruise missile designed for high-precision strikes. It utilizes a navigation system combining GPS, an inertial navigation system, a barometric altimeter, and a radar altimeter. Its active radar seeker enables precise target acquisition, while its data link allows real-time course adjustments, including target updates, re-engagement, or mission cancellation. The missile's sea-skimming approach makes it more challenging to detect and intercept. With a length of 4.8 to 5.2 meters and a weight of less than 800 kg, the Atmaca is equipped with a high-explosive, penetration-type warhead weighing 250 kg. It has a range exceeding 220 km, while its land-based variant, the KARA ATMACA, can reach targets beyond 280 km. Its capabilities have attracted international interest, particularly in Southeast Asia. In November 2022, Indonesia signed a contract to procure 45 Atmaca missiles, while Malaysia intends to integrate the system into its three Littoral Mission Ships (LMS) Batch 2, based on the Ada-class corvette design. This successful test places Turkey among a limited group of nations with submarine-launched anti-ship missile capabilities, a technology currently deployed by the United States (UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon), France (SM-39 Exocet), and Russia (submarine-launched Kalibr variants). This capability significantly enhances a submarine’s operational reach, allowing it to engage distant targets without exposing its position, adding a new strategic dimension to naval warfare. Alongside the encapsulated Atmaca, Turkey is also developing the Gezgin cruise missile, intended for long-range land strikes from submarine platforms. With greater range and payload capacity, this system is expected to play a key role in Turkey’s naval deterrence strategy. Additionally, discussions have emerged regarding the development of a submarine-launched air defense missile, potentially derived from the Hisar system by ASELSAN, as presented during the 10th Naval Systems Seminar. The first successful underwater launch of the Atmaca missile reflects the progress of Turkey’s defense industry and its objective of achieving strategic autonomy in the naval domain. By focusing on indigenous technology, Turkey continues to enhance its submarine forces and strengthen its position as a key player in the development and production of advanced weapon systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/turkish-navy-strengthens-its-underwater-power-with-atmaca-missile-capable-of-discreet-long-range-strikes	2025-03-14T03:27:54-07:00	
John Cockerill Plans to Produce Light Armored Vehicles in Belgium to Align with Europe's Rearmament Strategy	As Europe moves forward with a large-scale €800 billion rearmament plan, the Belgian group John Cockerill is reaffirming its ambition to restart the production of armored vehicles on Belgian soil. Its CEO, François Michel, has confirmed the company’s interest in large-scale production, drawing on decades of expertise in manufacturing turrets for NATO light tanks. The stated objective is to reestablish domestic production in Belgium, an industrial challenge the country has not undertaken for more than a generation. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This initiative to relocate part of the armored vehicle production to Belgium is part of a broader European effort to strengthen its defense industry in response to an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. (Picture source: John Cockerill Defense) Among the potential sites for setting up an armored vehicle assembly line, the former Audi plant in Forest is being seriously considered. This site, currently seeking a new operator, could be repurposed to accommodate high-volume production, which François Michel sees as essential for Belgium to play a significant role in Europe's defense industry. However, no final decision has been made, and other industrial sites in Belgium are also under review. The CEO of John Cockerill highlights the possibility of repurposing existing facilities with experience in high-volume military vehicle production, a consideration that extends beyond Belgium, as other European countries explore similar initiatives. John Cockerill Defense (JCD) is a key player in land-based weapon systems, specializing in the design and manufacturing of turrets for armored vehicles. The company offers a range of modular solutions suited to light and medium armored vehicles, incorporating weapons of various calibers from 25mm to 105mm. One of its flagship products is the Cockerill 3000 series, a family of modular turrets that can be equipped with different weapon configurations to meet the specific requirements of armed forces. The Cockerill 3105 turret, fitted with a 105mm high-pressure cannon, provides armored vehicles with firepower comparable to that of battle tanks while maintaining greater mobility. Beyond turrets, JCD develops and integrates light armored vehicles designed to operate in various tactical environments. A notable example is the Cockerill i-X, a hybrid combat vehicle combining speed, stealth, and firepower, designed for reconnaissance and rapid intervention missions. This platform reflects JCD’s focus on mobility and combat effectiveness. The company also modernizes existing platforms by integrating advanced targeting, stabilization, and beyond-line-of-sight firing capabilities, enhancing the operational efficiency of equipped forces. The former Caterpillar site in Gosselies, Charleroi, is also being considered. François Michel has been in discussions with Thomas Dermine, the mayor of Charleroi, and has expressed interest in this alternative. The involvement of Belgium’s Minister of Defense has been noted in these considerations. However, the Liège province, where John Cockerill is headquartered, presents challenges in terms of available industrial space. While sites such as the former Chertal steel mill or facilities in Seraing have been mentioned, their condition requires long-term rehabilitation work, which does not align with the urgency of the planned industrial expansion. The limited availability of industrial land in Liège further complicates the situation, with designated industrial zones already at 95% capacity. This initiative to relocate part of the armored vehicle production to Belgium is part of a broader European effort to strengthen its defense industry in response to an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, European countries have recognized their dependence on external arms supplies and are accelerating the development of domestic defense industries to meet the growing demands of their armed forces. Belgium, which has not manufactured armored vehicles for decades, sees this project as an opportunity to regain a role in the defense sector. Additionally, this shift is driven by changes in U.S. defense policy toward Europe. With the prospect of a gradual reduction in American engagement on the continent, the European Union must enhance its strategic autonomy. Several initiatives have been launched to build a more robust defense industrial base, and John Cockerill’s project is aligned with this objective. If the Audi Brussels or Caterpillar site is selected, it would mark an important step in Belgium’s efforts to establish domestic production capacity and contribute to Europe's collective rearmament strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/john-cockerill-plans-to-produce-light-armored-vehicles-in-belgium-to-align-with-europes-rearmament-strategy	2025-03-14T02:50:23-07:00	
China tests new family of amphibious infantry fighting vehicles to replace the Type 05	As reported by OedoSoldier on March 13, 2025, China is developing a new generation of amphibious infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) to replace the existing Type 05 family. Recent imagery reveals a new platform that could feature an unmanned turret and an active protection system (APS). The vehicle, identified by hull number 003, appears to incorporate mobility and survivability improvements for amphibious operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The hull of the new amphibious IFV, identified by hull number 003, exhibits several changes compared to earlier models, including variations in the spacing of road wheels and modifications to the transom flap at the rear. (Picture source: Twitter/OedoSoldier) The new IFV’s turret, which lacks visible crew positions, suggests it is unmanned and automated. Reports indicate that the new amphibious IFV, identified by hull number 003, could integrate multiple sensor systems for target acquisition and active defense, likely forming part of a hard-kill APS. This approach differs from Western designs that use composite or NERA armor as layered passive armor, which increases weight. The Chinese model prioritizes active defenses, which are suited for light vehicles where conventional armor provides limited protection. The vehicle’s main armament appears to be a 30mm autocannon, similar to the ZBD-05. No anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher is visible, though it could be mounted on the opposite side of the turret. The hull exhibits several changes compared to earlier models, including variations in the spacing of road wheels and modifications to the transom flap at the rear. These changes indicate efforts to refine hydrodynamic performance and enhance amphibious maneuverability. China has also tested a potentially larger version of the Type 05, distinguished by changes to its road wheel spacing and hull structure. Observers have noted the redesigned turret of the vehicle, identified by hull number 005, and partially faceted barrel, suggesting changes in armament, as well as the expansion of an amphibious combat vehicle family that could include new assault tank or support variants. China’s current amphibious warfare strategy could involve securing air superiority before deploying these IFVs and amphibious tanks in an armored landing operation. China has also tested a potentially larger version of the Type 05, identified by hull number 005, distinguished by changes to its road wheel spacing, hull structure, and turret design. (Picture source: Twitter/OedoSoldier) The Type 05 amphibious combat vehicle family was developed in the early 2000s to replace older platforms such as the Type 63A amphibious tank. The People's Liberation Army required a high-speed amphibious vehicle capable of over-the-horizon deployment and increased firepower. Developed by Norinco, the Type 05 was designed to improve China’s amphibious assault capabilities. It entered service in 2005, and multiple variants have since been introduced to support different operational requirements. The Type 05, which seems to be inspired by the now-canceled U.S. Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program, remains in active use within China’s amphibious forces. The Type 05 incorporates a hydrodynamically optimized hull, an extendable bow, and a retractable suspension system, enabling speeds of up to 30 km/h in water. It is propelled by two rear-mounted water jets, while on land, it utilizes a diesel engine generating 1,500 hp in waterborne mode and 550 hp on land. The vehicle’s aluminum alloy construction reduces weight while providing limited protection against small arms fire and shell fragments. Additional composite armor plates enhance protection in specific areas, such as the turret. The fire-control system includes thermal imaging, a laser rangefinder, and independent sights for both the commander and gunner. These features contribute to target acquisition and engagement capabilities. The Type 05 is designed for rapid amphibious landings and operations in coastal environments. The Type 05 series consists of several variants designed for specialized roles that are used by the Chinese Navy's Marine Corps and Army's amphibious mechanized brigades. The ZBD-05 serves as the infantry fighting vehicle variant, equipped with a 30mm autocannon and anti-tank guided missiles to support dismounted infantry. The ZTD-05 functions as an amphibious assault vehicle, fitted with a 105mm rifled gun capable of firing kinetic and guided munitions. Additional versions include command and control vehicles, reconnaissance variants, armored recovery vehicles, and engineering support models. These adaptations enable the Type 05 platform to conduct a range of amphibious operations, including direct assault, logistical support, and battlefield coordination. The ZBD-05, the infantry fighting vehicle variant, is equipped with a ZPT-99 30mm autocannon capable of engaging ground and aerial targets. It is complemented by a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun and can be outfitted with HJ-73C anti-tank guided missiles. The turret is integrated with a fire-control system featuring a digital ballistic computer, thermal imaging, and a laser rangefinder. The vehicle accommodates a crew of three and can transport up to eight infantry personnel in the rear compartment. The retractable suspension system, combined with its engine power, facilitates seamless transitions between land and water operations, ensuring operational flexibility across diverse terrains.

Facing US Uncertainty Portugal Seeks European Alternatives to F-35 Fighter Jet	The evolution of U.S. policy toward NATO has led the Portuguese Ministry of Defense to reassess its combat aircraft acquisition strategy. This resulted in the abandonment of Lockheed Martin's fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter. Defense Minister Nuno Melo confirmed this decision in an interview with the Portuguese daily Público. This Decision reflects growing concerns about the reliability of U.S. commitments to European allies. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Due to U.S. political uncertainties and F-35 restrictions, Portugal is opting for European alternatives like the Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, and Gripen to replace its aging F-16 fleet (Picture source: Dassault/Eurofighter/US DoD/ Saab) Donald Trump's election and controversial statements on NATO, including threats to reduce U.S. funding for the alliance and criticism of European partners’ financial contributions, have raised doubts among member states. Trump has also suggested that the United States may no longer ensure Europe's security with the same level of commitment as in the past. As a result, several European nations, including Portugal, are reassessing their procurement strategies for U.S. military equipment to maintain greater defense autonomy. The F-35 had initially been identified as the ideal replacement for Portugal’s aging F-16 fleet, a transition that seemed logical given its adoption by several NATO members, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Poland, and Germany. In April 2024, the Chief of Staff of the Portuguese Air Force, General João Cartaxo Alves, stated that the transition to the F-35A was already underway. However, increasing geopolitical uncertainty and potential U.S. restrictions on foreign-operated F-35s have made this acquisition less viable. Beyond diplomatic concerns, the F-35’s high cost remains a significant obstacle. Each aircraft costs approximately $82 million, while operational costs reach $33,000 per flight hour. Maintenance expenses are four times higher than those of the F-16 currently in service. Additionally, Washington could impose operational restrictions on exported aircraft, particularly by controlling access to software updates and critical maintenance components. These potential restrictions, referred to by some as a 'kill switch,' raise concerns about Portugal’s autonomy in operating these fighters. Given these uncertainties, Lisbon is now exploring alternative solutions, particularly within Europe. While Defense Minister Nuno Melo declined to comment on a potential acquisition of the Dassault Rafale, it remains one of the leading contenders. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen E/F are also under consideration, offering options that are less dependent on U.S. constraints. Additionally, the Turkish-made KAAN stealth fighter, currently under development by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), could become a viable choice in the long term. The four aircraft being considered—F-35A Lightning II, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, and Eurofighter Typhoon—each offer distinct capabilities suited to different operational requirements. The F-35A, a fifth-generation aircraft, stands out for its stealth, advanced avionics, and data fusion capabilities, enabling operations in contested environments. However, its high costs and U.S. export restrictions impose significant constraints. The Rafale, developed by Dassault, is recognized for its multirole versatility, electronic warfare capabilities (SPECTRA), AESA radar, and operational autonomy. The Gripen, a lightweight and cost-effective fighter, emphasizes interoperability with NATO systems, simplified maintenance, and the ability to operate from austere airfields. Meanwhile, the Eurofighter Typhoon, developed through a European consortium, is highly capable in air superiority missions, featuring advanced sensors, high agility, and strong survivability, though it has higher operational costs. If Portugal seeks a balance between performance, autonomy, and cost, the Rafale appears to be the most suitable option. It offers a proven and scalable platform with fewer operational constraints than the F-35A. The Eurofighter Typhoon, while highly capable, is expensive and more specialized for air superiority missions. The Gripen, as a lower-cost alternative, could be viable for a smaller air force looking for a flexible and economical solution. Portugal will need to make a decision in the coming years as its F-16 fleet nears the end of its service life. The transition to a new aircraft could span a decade, with an estimated budget of €5.5 billion. This assessment is also part of a broader discussion on European strategic independence, as the EU considers expanding its defense cooperation initiatives.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/facing-us-uncertainty-portugal-seeks-european-alternatives-to-f-35-fighter-jet	2025-03-14T01:31:19-07:00

The Mk 19 has an effective range of 1,500 meters and fires 40×53mm high-velocity grenades, but it weighs 35.2 kg and is primarily used for sustained fire in static or vehicle-mounted roles. In contrast, the SuperSix weighs 5.96 kg and is operated by a single user, providing greater mobility in scenarios where dismounted personnel require a multiple-shot grenade launcher. While the Mk 19 has a higher sustained rate of fire, its use is limited to specific platforms due to its weight and mounting requirements. The SuperSix, by contrast, offers an alternative for infantry use where a tripod-mounted system is impractical. When compared to the M79 and M203, both of which are single-shot 40×46mm grenade launchers, the SuperSix has a significantly higher firing capacity. The M79 is a break-action, stand-alone launcher, while the M203 is designed as an under-barrel attachment for rifles. Both systems require manual reloading after each shot, limiting their rate of fire. The SuperSix, with its six-shot rotating cylinder and double-action firing mechanism, can fire all six rounds in under three seconds. Additionally, while the M79 and M203 have an effective range of 350-400 meters, the SuperSix can fire both low-velocity (400 meters) and medium-velocity (800 meters) rounds, providing extended reach. The ability to fire medium-velocity 40×51mm grenades allows the SuperSix to engage targets at greater distances compared to the M79 and M203, which are limited to 40×46mm low-velocity ammunition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/colombian-army-tests-milkor-supersix-40mm-grenade-launcher-as-an-alternative-to-us-systems	2025-03-14T01:19:39-07:00

The new systems will supplement the 61 M270 MLRS (Multiple Launch Rocket System) currently in service and the eight Repair and Recovery Vehicles (RRV) that are already on order with the U.S. Department of Defense, thereby bolstering the British Army's firepower and operational readiness. The M270 MLRS is a key component of the British Army’s long-range artillery, known for its precision and rapid-fire capabilities. Capable of launching a variety of guided rockets, including the M31 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Extended Range GMLRS (ER-GMLRS), the M270 offers the British Army significant operational flexibility. With a maximum range of up to 84 kilometers (52 miles) for the standard GMLRS and 150 kilometers (93 miles) for the ER-GMLRS, the system can deliver highly accurate strikes on enemy targets, making it an indispensable asset in both offensive and defensive operations. The ability of the M270 to launch multiple rounds in quick succession provides commanders with enhanced fire support capabilities, ensuring the British Army’s preparedness for high-intensity conflict zones and peacekeeping missions. The M270 MLRS provides several combat advantages in modern warfare, particularly in terms of precision, flexibility, and rapid responsiveness. In a modern conflict, the M270 offers exceptional adaptability to changing tactical situations. Its ability to launch a wide range of munitions, including guided rockets, gives commanders the option to engage targets with precision from a stand-off distance, minimizing exposure to enemy counterfire. This capability allows the British Army to conduct precision strikes on enemy infrastructure, command and control centers, artillery positions, and other high-value targets, significantly degrading the enemy’s operational capacity while minimizing collateral damage. One of the key features of the M270 is its ability to engage multiple targets in rapid succession, providing saturation firepower against enemy formations or defensive positions. This rapid-fire capability is particularly valuable in modern conflicts where rapid escalation can occur, and immediate response is often required. Additionally, the system's ability to deliver both conventional and extended-range rockets gives commanders the option to tailor their artillery responses based on the operational environment and mission requirements. The combination of precision and firepower makes the M270 an essential asset for both conventional and asymmetric warfare.

Exclusive: China Develops Advanced Barge System to Support Ship-to-Shore Operations in Potential Taiwan Invasion	Recent social media footage showcases a new Chinese barge system designed for efficient ship-to-shore transfer of supplies. With its potential military applications now under close scrutiny, this barge could play a pivotal role in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, particularly in establishing logistical support once an initial beachhead has been secured. This system is especially important in modern warfare, where mobility, speed, and the ability to move resources across the sea quickly can determine the success of a land invasion.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Chinese navy demonstrates new advanced barge system for efficient ship-to-shore operations, enhancing logistical support in amphibious assault scenarios. (Picture source: Social Network) The Chinese barge system, which resembles the British-made Mulberry Harbors used by Allied forces after D-Day during World War II, is engineered to provide a versatile solution for amphibious operations. The Mulberry Harbors were temporary portable harbors constructed on Normandy’s beaches, enabling the Allies to unload vast amounts of supplies, vehicles, and troops directly onto the beach, bypassing the need for traditional port infrastructure that was often too damaged or non-existent. This innovation drastically increased the speed and scale of operations following the initial landings and is often credited as a key enabler in the success of the D-Day invasion. Similarly, the Chinese barge system could be seen as a critical tool in a modern amphibious assault, enabling China’s military to quickly establish a logistical link between shipborne forces and land operations. The barges are designed to move a wide range of supplies from vessels offshore to the shore, including heavy equipment, food, medical supplies, ammunition, and potentially even troops. The system's flexibility allows it to be deployed in areas where traditional docking infrastructure is absent or destroyed, which could be a significant advantage in a conflict with Taiwan, given its heavily defended coastal defenses and limited suitable landing sites. Taiwan’s coastline, stretching across approximately 1,600 km, features both urbanized and rugged areas with few beaches large enough or accessible enough for large-scale amphibious landings. While this presents significant challenges for any invading force, the new barge system could provide a flexible solution for transferring supplies, bypassing the limitations of specific landing zones. The barges could be used in tandem with other amphibious assault vessels, ensuring that Chinese forces maintain a steady supply chain once a beachhead is established. In theory, this capability would allow China to rapidly increase its combat power on Taiwanese soil, delivering everything from fuel to tanks without requiring an intact port, which could be out of reach or heavily defended. The vulnerability of the barge system, however, cannot be overlooked. Taiwan’s coastal defenses are robust, featuring advanced missile systems, including long-range anti-ship missiles, coastal artillery, and radar-guided air defense systems. These defenses pose a substantial threat to any unprotected or slow-moving vessels, especially during the critical phases of amphibious assaults. During such operations, barges would need to traverse potentially hostile waters where precision-guided munitions could easily target them. Thus, any effective use of the barges would require Chinese forces to neutralize or suppress Taiwan’s missile and artillery systems, adding complexity and risk to their amphibious plans. Furthermore, Taiwan’s military is highly trained, with its forces equipped with advanced anti-ship and anti-air systems, including US-supplied equipment such as Harpoon missiles and the Patriot missile defense system. The risks posed to barges by such systems could limit their utility if Taiwanese forces are able to disrupt supply lines or target landing forces with precision strikes. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of combining the barge system with other offensive and defensive capabilities, including air superiority, naval escorts, and the suppression of enemy air defenses, to ensure safe and uninterrupted operations. This barge system is part of a larger Chinese effort to modernize and enhance its amphibious assault capabilities. Reports have indicated that China is constructing specialized amphibious assault vessels designed to land heavier vehicles, such as tanks, directly onto Taiwanese roads. This capability would allow China to bypass some of the natural barriers of Taiwan's coastline, using roads as quick transit routes for fast-moving mechanized units once an initial beachhead is established. The integration of this barge system into China’s broader amphibious strategy indicates a move toward more sophisticated and sustained operations. The barges could be used as part of a multi-phase operation, where, after the initial assault forces secure a beachhead, these barges would continue to deliver additional supplies and heavier equipment. Such operations would allow for the rapid buildup of forces on Taiwanese soil, supporting the advance of Chinese units deeper into the island, potentially faster than traditional port-based logistics could support. While these barges could play a crucial role in ensuring continued resupply operations, their effectiveness hinges on how China can protect them throughout the operation. In addition to the aforementioned threats posed by Taiwanese coastal defenses, these barges are also vulnerable to being disrupted by land-based attacks, such as missile strikes or drone assaults, making their safe operation highly dependent on China’s ability to maintain a strong air and naval presence over the operational area. Moreover, Taiwan's geography presents a unique challenge for amphibious forces, not just in terms of its beaches but also its dense urban areas and mountainous terrain. These factors would require China to plan for more than just a beach landing, factoring in rapid urban warfare and potentially significant resistance from Taiwanese forces. The combination of these challenges further complicates the operational role that these barges can play in an invasion scenario, as their ability to operate effectively in the face of a determined defense will be put to the test. The strategic importance of this new Chinese barge system lies in its potential to provide a reliable, flexible, and rapid means of resupply during a critical phase of an amphibious invasion. While Taiwan’s defenses are formidable, and the vulnerability of these barges remains a significant risk, their integration into broader military strategy could tilt the balance if China can mitigate those threats. The deployment of the barge system could allow for a more sustained, effective operation on Taiwan’s shores, giving China the logistical muscle to push further into the island once initial forces have secured key beachheads. While the new Chinese barges represent a significant tactical tool for military planners, their ultimate success will depend on how well they can be integrated into China's broader amphibious assault strategy, the ability to protect them against Taiwan's advanced defenses, and the overall coordination of the invasion effort. Their role in an invasion of Taiwan is still uncertain, but their introduction into China’s amphibious arsenal is a clear indication of the country's focus on improving its capacity for large-scale, rapid military operations on hostile shores. As the geopolitical situation in the Taiwan Strait continues to unfold, these barges, and the broader amphibious assault system they are part of, will remain a key point of interest for defense analysts and military strategists worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/exclusive-china-develops-advanced-barge-system-to-support-ship-to-shore-operations-in-potential-taiwan-invasion	2025-03-13T10:25:54-07:00

This mobility, combined with its automation, allows the Archer to operate in a hit-and-run mode, making it a formidable asset in both defensive and offensive operations. In addition to the technical capabilities, the Archer's self-propelled nature means it requires a reduced crew of just three operators—driver, commander, and gunner—compared to traditional towed artillery systems. This further enhances the system's efficiency and reduces the manpower needed for operation. The Arthur artillery location radar, developed by Swedish Company Saab, is an advanced system designed to detect and track incoming artillery projectiles. (Picture source Wikimedia) Sweden will also provide five Arthur artillery location radar systems alongside the Archer howitzers. Developed by Saab, the Arthur radar is a cutting-edge system used to detect the trajectory of incoming artillery projectiles and calculate their point of origin. This allows military forces to rapidly identify and neutralize enemy artillery positions before they can cause significant damage. The radar system is highly accurate and effective in real-time combat environments, enabling counter-battery operations to protect friendly forces from artillery fire. One of the key features of the Arthur radar system is its 360-degree coverage, allowing it to detect artillery shells in flight and compute their source location almost immediately. The system uses a combination of phased-array radar technology and advanced signal processing to track incoming projectiles, such as shells, rockets, and mortars, and determine their origin with high precision. This makes it possible for artillery forces to launch counterstrikes quickly, minimizing the effectiveness of enemy artillery. The radar can detect a wide variety of artillery systems, from short-range mortars to long-range artillery, and provides real-time targeting data to counter-battery systems. Arthur’s ability to detect artillery projectiles at distances of up to 40 kilometers (depending on the size and type of shell) makes it a powerful tool in modern artillery warfare. It is also equipped with advanced software for data analysis and integration with other battlefield management systems, ensuring that artillery units can respond swiftly and accurately to threats. Arthur has already proven itself in various conflict zones, with previous donations to Ukraine from Sweden and the United Kingdom enhancing Ukraine's artillery defense capabilities. The Swedish donation of five more Arthur systems to Ukraine will further bolster the country’s ability to combat Russian artillery and improve the overall battlefield intelligence and survivability of Ukrainian forces. Sweden’s military support package to Ukraine also includes financial assistance aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense industry. Through the Danish initiative, Sweden will contribute funds that could, for example, help Ukraine increase its domestic production of 155mm artillery ammunition, as well as potentially contribute to the production of the Ukrainian Bohdana artillery system. The goal is to improve Ukraine's self-sufficiency in producing critical military hardware while also ensuring a steady supply of ammunition for its artillery systems. Furthermore, Sweden’s participation in the artillery coalition under the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) will help coordinate international artillery support to Ukraine. The UDCG aims to increase Ukraine’s artillery capabilities and enhance interoperability with NATO forces. By participating in this coalition, Sweden will help Ukraine develop and strengthen its artillery capabilities in line with NATO standards, facilitating smoother collaboration in joint operations. Deliveries of the Arthur radar systems are expected to begin in 2025, while the Archer howitzers are scheduled to be delivered starting in 2026. Sweden’s contribution to Ukraine is significant, as it not only supplies advanced artillery and radar systems but also helps Ukraine strengthen its defense industry and its long-term military capabilities. Swedish Minister of Defense Pål Jonson emphasized the critical importance of artillery support for Ukraine, noting that artillery and ammunition have been among the highest priorities for Ukraine's defense since the escalation of the conflict.

Lockheed Martin develops a Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system mock-up on a Peterbilt 320 truck for Sniper Pod testing	As reported by The Dead District on March 7, 2025, Lockheed Martin has developed a replica of the Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system using a Peterbilt 320 garbage truck as its base platform. This mock-up, informally referred to by some as the 'Peter Pantsir,' was created for testing and evaluation. It is primarily used to assess the effectiveness of the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, a sensor suite deployed on aircraft such as the F-16 and F-18, designed to identify and classify objects resembling real-world threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mock-up target vehicles are used to evaluate targeting and engagement systems on fighter jets by replicating adversary air defense systems, enabling pilots and sensor operators to analyze the accuracy and reliability of aircraft targeting pods, radar, and weapons systems when detecting and classifying potential threats. (Picture source: Twitter/The Dead District) Mock-up target vehicles are used to evaluate targeting and engagement systems on fighter jets by replicating adversary air defense systems. These replicas enable pilots and sensor operators to analyze the accuracy and reliability of aircraft targeting pods, radar, and weapons systems when detecting and classifying potential threats. Testing with mock-ups allows for adjustments in detection algorithms, assessments of electronic warfare countermeasures, and pilot training under controlled conditions without direct engagement with operational enemy systems. This method provides data on the effectiveness of electro-optical targeting pods, radar-guided missiles, and electronic warfare suites in identifying and engaging targets, supporting the development of countermeasures and operational strategies. The purpose of this mock-up remains open to interpretation, with some sources suggesting it is also intended for Opposing Forces (OPFOR) training. OPFOR is well-established within U.S. Army training exercises, where specialized units replicate adversaries to create realistic combat scenarios. These units follow structured methodologies to simulate enemy tactics, doctrine, and equipment, often using modified vehicles and operational techniques to match potential threats. The U.S. military maintains dedicated OPFOR units at major training centers: the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California; the 1st Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Johnson, Louisiana; and the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) at Hohenfels, Germany. These units employ live, virtual, and constructive training environments to test military strategies, validate operational doctrines, and expose personnel to varied threat scenarios. OPFOR training incorporates information warfare, electronic warfare, and cyber elements to replicate modern battlefield conditions. The program operates under the U.S. Army’s Operational Environment &amp; Opposing Force Program (OE-OPFOR), which oversees OPFOR modernization, accreditation, and scenario development. OPFOR training is used in both national and multinational exercises, including joint operations such as Crocodile '03, which involved Australian-led OPFOR alongside U.S. Marine Corps forces. The Peterbilt 320 is a Class 8 low-cab forward (LCF) truck introduced in 1987, primarily designed for waste collection but also used in construction, tanker, and fire service applications. It succeeded the Peterbilt 310 and was available in left-hand, right-hand, and dual-drive configurations, including a right-hand stand-up option. The truck featured multiple engine options, including the Cummins ISX12, PACCAR PX-9, Westport ISX12 G, and compressed natural gas (CNG) variants, paired with Fuller manual or Allison automatic transmissions. The cab structure consisted of a zinc-coated steel sub-frame and an aluminum cab with bulkhead-style doors. The 320’s design included a lowered doghouse for improved visibility, removable panels, side storage compartments, and an optional cooling unit. In 2014, Peterbilt introduced the ProBilt interior with modifications to the dashboard, controls, and seating layout. The model remained in production until 2017, after which it was replaced by the Peterbilt 520, which retained the LCF layout while incorporating additional features for waste management operations. In 2020, a Russian Pantsir-S1 system, supplied by the United Arab Emirates to forces aligned with Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, was reportedly captured and transported by a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. (Picture source: Russian social media) The United States has actively acquired and analyzed foreign air defense systems to refine countermeasures and improve military tactics. A notable example occurred in 2020 when a Pantsir-S1 system, supplied by the United Arab Emirates to forces aligned with Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, was captured and transported by a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. While the official justification was to prevent the system from falling into militant hands, intelligence exploitation was likely a secondary objective. Examination of foreign systems such as the Pantsir-S1 allows U.S. defense analysts to assess vulnerabilities, enhance targeting accuracy, and develop suppression strategies. The Pantsir-S1 was conceived in the 1990s as a successor to the Soviet-era Tunguska system, incorporating both missile and autocannon capabilities to provide short-to-medium-range air defense. Developed by KBP Instrument Design Bureau, it was first introduced in the mid-2000s and has since been exported to multiple countries. The system is mounted on various wheeled and tracked chassis, depending on the operator. Designed to engage a range of aerial threats—including aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles—the Pantsir-S1 integrates radar and infrared tracking. However, operational experiences in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine have highlighted its limitations, particularly against coordinated drone and missile strikes. The threat posed by the Pantsir-S1 to fighter jets depends on the engagement scenario. The system’s 57E6 surface-to-air missiles have a reported range of approximately 20 km and can target aircraft flying at altitudes up to 15 km. While Pantsir-S1 units have successfully intercepted enemy airstrikes in some cases, they have also struggled against modern electronic warfare tactics and precision-guided munitions. In conflict zones such as Ukraine, Syria, and Libya, Pantsir-S1 units have been targeted by Turkish and Israeli drones, as well as Western-supplied munitions, exposing weaknesses in their detection and engagement systems. As a result, modifications and enhancements have been made to improve its tracking and targeting resilience in modern combat environments.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lockheed-martin-develops-a-russian-pantsir-s1-air-defense-system-mock-up-on-a-peterbilt-320-truck-for-sniper-pod-testing	2025-03-13T07:47:55-07:00	
Breaking News: Panama ends decades of neutrality with first acquisition of combat aircraft following US policy change	On March 12, 2025, Panama approved a $197 million procurement plan to acquire six aircraft for the National Aeronaval Service (Senan). This purchase includes four A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft from Embraer for over $78 million and two C-295 transport aircraft from Airbus Defense and Space for more than $109 million. The government states that the acquisition is intended to strengthen the country’s capabilities in aerial patrol, disaster response, and humanitarian assistance. The new aircraft will replace an aging fleet of 14 aircraft from the 1980s, which have an estimated annual maintenance cost of approximately $10 million. Officials insist that this procurement has no combat objective.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The acquisition of four A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft for over $78 million marks the first time Panama will operate aircraft with combat capabilities. (Picture source: Brazilian Air Force) Panama's decision to acquire the A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, marking its first operation of combat-capable planes, follows recent incidents involving the United States. In December 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to reclaim control of the Panama Canal, alleging that Panama charged excessive tolls and expressed concerns over potential Chinese influence. These assertions were met with protests in Panama and reaffirmations of sovereignty by Panamanian officials. Therefore, the heightened tensions may have prompted Panama to reassess its defense posture, leading to the procurement of combat aircraft to enhance its national security and assert control over strategic assets.​ Panamanian government representatives explain that the main purpose of acquiring these aircraft is to improve national surveillance, search and rescue operations, and responses to illicit activities such as drug trafficking and illegal fishing. The two C-295 aircraft will be used for logistical support, maritime surveillance, search and rescue, and aerial firefighting, while the A-29 Super Tucanos will focus on aerial patrol operations. Officials maintain that the aircraft will be used strictly for these purposes and that their acquisition aligns with national security priorities. The Cabinet authorized these purchases through an exceptional process. The government has stated that most of the financing will come from external sources, although the final financing structure has not yet been confirmed. Officials also highlight that Panama does not have a military force and that Senan is a security agency responsible for national maritime and aerial surveillance, not a combat force. The government claims that the procurement is necessary to replace outdated aircraft and maintain operational capacity. The acquisition of the A-29 Super Tucanos marks the first time Panama will operate aircraft with combat capabilities. Since the disbandment of the Panamanian military in 1989, the country has relied on security agencies such as Senan, the National Police, and the National Border Service. The increase in unauthorized flights and organized crime activity in Panamanian airspace has been cited as a reason for enhancing air patrol capabilities. This purchase is considered a measure to strengthen aerial security operations. The decision has been met with criticism from various social organizations and political commentators, who argue that the funds could have been allocated to other national priorities such as healthcare and education. Concerns have been raised regarding the financial implications of the purchase, given the lack of publicly available details on the final financing structure. Additionally, some critics question whether this move represents a shift in Panama’s traditionally demilitarized security policy. In response to these concerns, government representatives state that the aircraft will not be used for offensive military operations and that Panama remains committed to its demilitarized status. They emphasize that Senan functions as a security and emergency response agency rather than a military organization. The government argues that the aircraft are necessary for maintaining surveillance and operational readiness, particularly in addressing illicit activities within Panamanian territory. The addition of two C-295 transport aircraft is expected to restore Panama’s medium transport capability, which has been absent since the early 1990s, when the country’s only CASA CN-235 was sold. (Picture source: Airbus Defense and Space) Panama’s current air fleet consists of 24 aircraft, including light aircraft and helicopters used for patrol, transport, and training. Senan operates at least seven Beechcraft Cessna 208B Grand Caravans, three Piper PA-34 Seneca light transport aircraft, three Airbus C-212 Aviocar twin-engine transports, and one De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter for transport and reconnaissance. The service also has at least four MD Helicopters MD-500 utility helicopters, four Bell 412 helicopters, and one Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk. For training, Senan operates five Enaer T-35C Pillán aircraft. The addition of two C-295 transport aircraft is expected to restore Panama’s medium transport capability, which has been absent since the early 1990s, when the country’s only CASA CN-235 was sold. The A-29 Super Tucano was developed by the Brazilian company Embraer as an advanced version of the EMB-312 Tucano trainer. It was designed for counterinsurgency, reconnaissance, and pilot training missions. First introduced in 2003, the aircraft has been adopted by multiple countries for security and border surveillance operations. It was developed to operate in environments with minimal logistical support and can use unpaved runways. The aircraft has been used in various operational contexts, including counter-narcotics and air interdiction missions. The A-29 Super Tucano features a reinforced airframe designed to withstand high-stress operations and higher g-loads, with an operational fatigue life of 8,000 to 12,000 hours. Built to operate in harsh environments with minimal ground support, this light attack aircraft is equipped with Kevlar armor plating around the cockpit and engine to protect against small arms fire. It has two internally mounted FN Herstal M3P .50 caliber machine guns, each with 200 rounds, for defense against ground-based threats. The aircraft is also compatible with night vision goggles (NVGs) and features an integrated forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor for enhanced target acquisition and night operations. The landing gear is reinforced for rough-field operations, allowing takeoff and landing on unprepared runways, which increases its operational flexibility for reconnaissance, training, and surveillance missions. With five external hardpoints—two under each wing and one on the centerline—the A-29 Super Tucano can be armed with various weapons, including unguided Mk 81 (113 kg) and Mk 82 (227 kg) general-purpose bombs, as well as precision-guided munitions such as the Paveway II laser-guided bomb series and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). For close air support missions, it can be fitted with the Giat NC621 20mm cannon pod or MAA-1 Piranha air-to-air missiles. The aircraft is complemented by various targeting systems, including an integrated mission computer, a laser rangefinder, and a weapons management system that enables the use of advanced targeting pods for greater accuracy. It is also capable of deploying electronic countermeasures to disrupt hostile radar and missile guidance systems. In terms of performance, the A-29 Super Tucano has a maximum speed of 590 km/h, a combat range of approximately 550 km, and an endurance of up to eight hours.

US releases first-ever footage of AGM-114R-9X Flying Ninja bladed missile strike	On February 23, 2025, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted a precision airstrike in northwest Syria, killing Muhammed Yusuf Ziya Talay, a senior military leader of Hurras al-Din (HaD), an Al-Qaeda affiliate. The operation was part of CENTCOM’s ongoing efforts to disrupt terrorist activities in the region and marked the first time the U.S. government publicly released video footage of an AGM-114R-9X Flying Ginsu missile in action. General Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, stated that similar operations would continue as necessary.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The absence of an explosion, along with the observed damage pattern, was consistent with previous strikes using the AGM-114R-9X Flying Ginsu, a variant of the Hellfire missile designed to minimize collateral damage. (Picture sources: US CENTCOM and Open Source Munitions Portal) On March 1, 2025, CENTCOM released video footage documenting the airstrike. The footage showed a vehicle traveling on a road before being struck by a munition. The absence of an explosion, along with the observed damage pattern, was consistent with previous strikes using the AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile, a variant designed to minimize collateral damage. This assessment was supported by images from the strike site, which showed missile fragments with markings identifying them as AGM-114R-9X components. The observed damage to the vehicle, characterized by a star-shaped penetration pattern, aligned with the known effects of the R-9X variant. It is assessed that an MQ-9 Reaper drone conducted the strike, as this platform has been used for similar operations in the past. The AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile, dubbed the Flying Ginsu, Flying Ninja, R9X, or Ninja Missile, is a modification of the Hellfire family, developed to engage specific targets while reducing collateral damage. Unlike conventional Hellfire variants that employ explosive warheads, the R-9X relies on kinetic force and six deployable metal blades, which extend from the missile body before impact. The munition entered U.S. military service in 2017, with the first publicly documented use occurring in 2019. In 2022, it was reportedly used in an airstrike targeting the then-leader of Al-Qaeda, bringing further attention to its operational role. Official acknowledgment of the R-9X remains limited. A U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) spokesperson confirmed its presence in the U.S. inventory but provided no additional details regarding its use. No confirmed foreign sales have been reported, though, in theory, the weapon could be deployed by any system capable of launching standard Hellfire missiles. Reports in 2023 suggested that Israel may have used the missile in Gaza, but subsequent analysis indicated the munition in question was an illumination shell rather than an R-9X. The release of video footage showing the AGM-114R-9X in action for the first time suggests a shift in the availability of official information regarding its use. The Pentagon’s decision to share this material appears to be an effort to highlight the role of precision-guided munitions in counterterrorism operations. The footage depicts a targeting sequence with crosshairs fixed on the driver’s side of the vehicle, with damage limited to that area while the passenger seat remained mostly intact. This corresponds with previous accounts of the missile's capabilities. The targeting FLIR footage shows the missile locking onto a moving vehicle before impact, further illustrating its intended function. The AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile weighs approximately 49 kg and is designed as a kinetic impact munition with six long, retractable blades that deploy in the final moments before impact. (Picture source: Twitter/Status-6) The R-9X has been used in multiple operations targeting individuals traveling in unarmored vehicles, primarily in Syria and Lebanon. Its deployment has led to discussions on the strategic and legal implications of its use, particularly regarding intelligence accuracy and the operational limitations of non-explosive kinetic munitions. While it is designed to limit unintended casualties, its effectiveness depends on precise targeting data. The distinct damage pattern it leaves allows forensic analysts to identify its use at strike sites. The AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile weighs approximately 49 kg and is designed as a kinetic impact munition with six long, retractable blades that deploy in the final moments before impact. It retains the overall dimensions of a standard Hellfire missile, with a length of approximately 1.6 meters and a diameter of 180 mm, allowing it to be launched from platforms already configured for Hellfire missiles, including rotary-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as the MQ-9 Reaper, and ground-based launchers. The missile relies on a combination of inertial navigation and semi-active laser guidance to precisely engage designated targets. Unlike explosive warheads, the R-9X generates lethal effects through high-velocity kinetic energy and the cutting action of its six forward-deploying blades, which are designed to penetrate vehicle roofs and lightly armored structures while reducing collateral damage. The missile's accumulator and actuator mechanisms facilitate the controlled deployment of its blades, ensuring structural integrity until impact. The R-9X’s non-explosive design is intended for targeted eliminations where minimizing risk to nearby structures and bystanders is a priority. This design enables it to engage targets with a controlled impact radius. Other U.S. military low-collateral munitions include concrete-filled inert bombs and the carbon-fiber-body Mark 82 bomb, both of which similarly reduce fragmentation effects. Unlike explosive warheads, the R-9X generates lethal effects through high-velocity kinetic energy and the cutting action of its six forward-deploying blades, which are designed to penetrate vehicle roofs and lightly armored structure.

Flash News: US Air Force B-52H Bombers Conduct First-Ever Live Weapons Drop of GBU-38 Smart Bombs in Sweden	On March 11, 2025, the U.S. Air Force achieved a significant milestone in its ongoing efforts to enhance NATO capabilities by conducting the first live weapons drop of the GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) in Sweden, marking an important step since the country’s accession to NATO. This mission, part of Bomber Task Force Mission VIKING NEBULA, showcased the precision strike capabilities of the U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers, working in tandem with Swedish air and ground forces. It also demonstrated the growing interoperability between U.S. and Swedish forces, further strengthening NATO’s collective defense capabilities in the European theater.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress flies over Sweden during the Bomber Task Force 25-2 mission, VIKING NEBULA, on March 11, 2025. These operations highlight the ability to deploy strategic assets to support global stability swiftly. (Picture source: U.S. Air Force) The B-52H Stratofortress is a key asset in the U.S. Air Force's strategic bombing capabilities, capable of conducting long-range precision strikes, conventional bombing, and strategic deterrence. The B-52H is equipped to carry a wide array of precision-guided munitions (PGMs), including the GBU-38 JDAM, the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile (ALCM), and other advanced munitions. This versatility allows the B-52H to engage a broad spectrum of targets, ranging from hardened military installations to high-value, time-sensitive targets in complex environments. A key feature of the B-52H is its long endurance, capable of conducting missions lasting up to 12 hours and striking targets at ranges exceeding 8,000 km (about 5,000 miles) without refueling. This makes the B-52H one of the most effective strategic assets for projecting power across Europe and beyond, ensuring that NATO can respond to threats at any location in its area of responsibility. In a European context, the B-52H can reach key targets within Russia or Eastern Europe, adding strategic depth to NATO’s deterrence posture. It is an essential tool for countering modern, advanced threats, including those posed by peer adversaries with sophisticated air defense systems. The B-52H’s combat capabilities are enhanced by its avionics systems, which allow for precise targeting even in contested environments. It can operate alongside NATO partners, providing long-range strike capabilities that augment the conventional and nuclear deterrence forces of allied nations. The participation of two B-52H bombers in the VIKING NEBULA mission highlights the increasing integration of these aircraft into European defense exercises, underscoring NATO’s readiness and flexibility in responding to emerging threats. The GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a 500-pound, GPS-guided bomb designed to convert 'dumb' bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The GBU-38 is part of the JDAM family of munitions, which includes the GBU-31 and GBU-32 variants, and is widely used by NATO forces for its accuracy and versatility. Its GPS/INS guidance system allows it to strike targets with pinpoint precision, even in adverse weather conditions or GPS-jamming environments, making it a valuable tool for NATO’s precision strike capabilities. In terms of its combat performance, the GBU-38 can engage a wide variety of targets, including enemy command centers, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure, while minimizing collateral damage—an increasingly important factor in modern military operations. With a maximum range of up to 15 nautical miles (approximately 28 kilometers) when launched from high altitudes, the GBU-38 provides standoff capabilities that keep the launching aircraft out of harm’s way while still achieving a direct hit on target. The munition's ability to deliver high levels of destruction with minimal collateral damage makes it ideal for operations in urban or densely populated areas, where precision is critical. In the context of the Vidsel Test Range in Sweden, the live weapons drop of the GBU-38 allowed both U.S. and Swedish forces to refine their joint operational techniques, testing the effectiveness of these munitions in the European theater. This operation highlighted the importance of precision strike capabilities, allowing NATO forces to engage targets with enhanced accuracy and reduced risk to civilian infrastructure, which is crucial for maintaining strategic stability in Europe. The presence of U.S. Air Force bombers, such as the B-52H, in NATO exercises like VIKING NEBULA is of tremendous strategic significance. The ability of U.S. bombers to integrate seamlessly with NATO forces provides the alliance with a robust and flexible response capability to both conventional and hybrid threats. The joint exercises, conducted across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, strengthen NATO’s collective lethality, ensuring that the alliance can quickly deploy and coordinate across multiple domains—air, land, and sea. For example, the integration of Swedish JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft in the VIKING NEBULA mission demonstrated the interoperability of NATO’s air forces. The Gripen fighters, capable of operating in contested environments, provided a robust escort to the B-52H Stratofortresses as they conducted their live weapons drop. This coordination is vital in a high-intensity conflict scenario, where rapid response and the ability to execute joint operations across multiple nations can make the difference between success and failure. Additionally, the use of Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) during the exercise further reinforced NATO’s ability to synchronize ground and air assets in real-time. This coordination not only improves the operational effectiveness of precision strikes but also enhances the alliance’s overall capability to conduct integrated combat operations. For example, the U.S. and Swedish JTACs working together during the live drop ensured the munitions were accurately delivered and maximized their operational impact. The mission also included a low-formation flyover of the Swedish Parliament, celebrating the one-year anniversary of Sweden’s accession to NATO. This symbolic act underscored the strengthening bond between Sweden and NATO, highlighting the alliance’s commitment to ensuring the security of its newest member. The successful integration of Sweden into NATO’s air and ground operations, exemplified by this mission, is a critical step in enhancing collective defense capabilities in Northern Europe, particularly in light of increasing security challenges from potential adversaries in the region. Currently deployed with the 69th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron at RAF Fairford, England, the B-52H Stratofortresses continue to execute operations alongside NATO allies, enhancing the alliance's ability to project power globally. Their presence in Europe also serves as a powerful reminder of the U.S. commitment to collective defense, strengthening NATO's strategic reach and ensuring that the alliance remains capable of responding to any emerging threat. The live weapons drop of the GBU-38 JDAM by U.S. Air Force B-52H bombers in Sweden is more than just a demonstration of U.S. airpower; it is a reaffirmation of NATO’s strategic cohesion and operational readiness. The B-52H Stratofortress, with its long-range strike capability and integration of precision-guided munitions, plays a critical role in ensuring NATO forces are prepared for a wide range of operational scenarios. Exercises like VIKING NEBULA, combining the strengths of U.S. and Swedish forces, not only enhance NATO’s ability to operate effectively across multiple domains but also demonstrate the alliance’s readiness to face any challenges in the European theater. This live-fire mission is a clear signal that NATO remains a formidable force, capable of responding with precision and power to any threat, ensuring peace and stability in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-us-air-force-b-52h-bombers-conduct-first-ever-live-weapons-drop-of-gbu-38-smart-bombs-in-sweden	2025-03-13T04:39:14-07:00	
AKM Group CZ confirms uninterrupted US ammunition supply amid European security concerns	On March 13, 2025, the Czech company AKM Group-CZ confirmed to Army Recognition the regular and uninterrupted supply of ammunition from a US manufacturer, stating that deliveries are proceeding according to contractual obligations. This confirmation comes amid increasing concerns over European defense supply stability following recent policy shifts in the United States.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The logistics department of AKM Group CZ noted that multiple contracts with US manufacturers remain in place, with no reported disruptions linked to political decisions. (Picture source: AKM Group CZ) At the beginning of March 2025, US President Donald Trump announced the suspension of military assistance to Ukraine, ceasing supplies of ammunition, vehicles, and other defense equipment. This decision directly affects Ukraine’s defense capabilities and impacts European security, as many EU countries remain reliant on US defense exports. In response, EU nations are working to expand their defense budgets and domestic arms production. However, experts indicate that Europe is unlikely to reach full self-sufficiency in defense production before 2026-2027. Ukraine’s estimated annual ammunition requirement is around three million shells, while the European Union provided only 500,000 shells in 2023. In 2024, the EU increased its production capacity by 30%, allowing the delivery of one million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine. Despite these efforts, European production remains insufficient to fully meet its own defense requirements. The United States saw a 29% increase in arms and military equipment exports in 2024, reaching a record $318.7 billion, according to the U.S. State Department. The primary recipients of these exports were Turkey, Israel, Romania, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. While the European Union has expanded its production capacity, it still faces limitations in fulfilling its overall defense needs without external suppliers. In response to uncertainty regarding US defense support, AKM Group-CZ has reiterated that it continues to meet its obligations to European end recipients under established contractual schedules. Since the beginning of 2025, the company has completed multiple defense product deliveries from a US manufacturer. This was confirmed during the Enforce Tac 2025 international defense exhibition in Nuremberg, where AKM Group-CZ representatives met with American partners to discuss ongoing supply agreements. The head of AKM Group-CZ’s logistics department stated that the company maintains coordination with US regulatory authorities to ensure adherence to export control regulations and the stability of logistics chains. The company highlighted a contract signed in 2024 with a US arms manufacturer for the supply of defense products to Europe, valued at tens of millions of dollars. The logistics department noted that multiple contracts with US manufacturers remain in place, with no reported disruptions linked to political decisions. ‘We have more than one contract with American manufacturers in the works and do not anticipate difficulties with deliveries due to political processes,’ stated the head of AKM Group-CZ’s logistics department. Geopolitical developments suggest that defense-importing nations are increasingly prioritizing diversification in procurement strategies to mitigate dependence on a single supplier. As a result, international suppliers are expected to play a larger role in global defense markets. This shift requires companies to manage complex logistics, establish alternative supply channels, integrate technologies from multiple countries, and adapt products to meet the specific requirements of end users. AKM Group-CZ previously secured exclusive access to the full annual production capacity of US firearms manufacturer ZRODelta for the European market. This agreement, signed on November 14, 2024, is valued at tens of millions of dollars and follows a prior contract for ammunition supplies. ZRODelta, based in Connelly Springs, North Carolina, manufactures a range of firearms and accessories, including the Modulus Modular Handgun, Venator Precision Rifle, and the Ready Series line of Modern Sporting Rifles. AKM Group-CZ, founded in 2001, specializes in supplying military and dual-use goods, including armored vehicles, artillery systems, small arms, and ammunition. The company collaborates with multiple defense manufacturers, including Cadex Defence, AGM Global Vision, and ZRODelta. Under its latest contract, AKM Group-CZ has already delivered multiple consignments of ammunition and firearms, with shipments arriving at their destinations within 24 days—considerably faster than the standard 45-day transit time. The company attributes this to an organized logistics network and experienced personnel. Quality control is a key component of AKM Group-CZ’s operational procedures. The company conducts batch inspections to ensure all delivered products comply with contractual specifications. The process includes sample selection, testing, and verification before dispatch. According to the company, these measures ensure that all supplied products meet required performance and reliability standards.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/akm-group-cz-confirms-uninterrupted-us-ammunition-supply-amid-european-security-concerns	2025-03-13T04:04:19-07:00

According to International Defence Analysis on March 8, 2025, recent images circulating on social media suggest that the Chinese Armed Forces might have deployed the HQ-29 ballistic missile defense (BMD) system. The HQ-29 is one of several interceptors in China's missile defense strategy, alongside the HQ-9B, HQ-19, HQ-26, and kinetic interceptors such as the DN series. These systems are designed to counter threats ranging from short-range ballistic missiles to those in the exoatmospheric phase. While the HQ-9A air defense variant is well-documented, information on the HQ-29 remains limited, with available details primarily based on unofficial sources.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Chinese military assessments classify the HQ-29 as part of the third layer of the country's missile defense network, focusing on intercepting short- and medium-range threats within the atmosphere. (Picture source: Twitter/International Defence Analysis) The HQ-29 anti-ballistic missile defense (ABMD) system is reported to be functionally similar to the American PAC-3 MSE interceptor missile system, utilizing a kinetic kill vehicle equipped with lateral impulse thrusters for trajectory adjustment. Unlike Russia's 9M96 missile from the S-400 system, which positions its thrusters near the missile's center of gravity, the HQ-29 reportedly employs a system of 100 solid-state pulse thrusters arranged around the missile's head for maneuvering. Reports indicate that China initiated the HQ-29’s development in 2003, with thrust-vectoring and control technology undergoing testing between 2005 and 2007. A validation and verification test was conducted in 2011, with unconfirmed reports stating that it was successful. The project’s chief engineer, Yun Lee, affiliated with CASIC, was acknowledged in Chinese aerospace publications following this test. At the time, the HQ-29 was projected for delivery to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) before the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan. Available information suggests that the HQ-29 is designed for terminal-phase interception of ballistic missiles at lower altitudes. Chinese military assessments classify it as part of the third layer of the country's missile defense network, focusing on intercepting short- and medium-range threats within the atmosphere. Other missile defense elements include the HQ-19 and HQ-26, which are intended to counter threats at higher altitudes, while the DN-series interceptors are designed for mid-course engagements beyond the atmosphere. While the Chinese government has not confirmed the HQ-29’s operational status, references to related research and state awards suggest that the system has reached an advanced stage. A significant aspect of the HQ-29's possible guidance system could be the integration of an advanced fire-control algorithm, optimizing its impulse thrusters for precise trajectory corrections. This technology enables in-flight adjustments to improve interception accuracy. Studies from Chinese research institutions describe simulations and energy efficiency analyses conducted to refine the firing sequence of these thrusters. These developments align with China’s broader missile defense efforts, as demonstrated by exoatmospheric interception tests at the Korla Missile Test Site in 2013. The HQ-29 project is reportedly part of the larger '8102 Project,' an initiative under the Sixth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), which received national recognition. China's missile defense system is structured in three layers: an exoatmospheric layer managed by kinetic interceptors such as the DN-1 and DN-2; a mid-layer covered by the HQ-19 and HQ-26; and a terminal interception layer, which includes the HQ-9B and HQ-29. The PLA has conducted multiple anti-ballistic missile (ABM) tests since 2010, including midcourse interception trials in 2013, 2014, 2018, and 2021. While these tests were largely attributed to the HQ-19 and DN-series interceptors, some reports suggest that elements of the HQ-29 system were involved in evaluating China's lower-altitude missile defense capabilities. Comparisons between the HQ-29 and the American PAC-3 MSE highlight similarities in interception principles. The PAC-3 MSE is an enhanced variant of the PAC-3, featuring extended range and improved propulsion. Both systems employ hit-to-kill technology, with advanced thruster systems for final-phase targeting. Some sources claim the HQ-29 uses a 55 kg-class kinetic warhead and is launched from an underground vertical launch system, facilitating rapid engagement. Information from leaked documents also suggests that the HQ-29 is integrated with a strategic dual-band phased array radar, which may enhance its detection and tracking capabilities. Although official Chinese sources have provided limited details, available evidence indicates that the HQ-29 has progressed through key developmental stages. Reports of its deployment align with China's efforts to enhance its missile defense network. However, without direct confirmation from the Chinese government, key aspects of the HQ-29’s capabilities remain uncertain, requiring further analysis as more information becomes available.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/has-the-mysterious-hq-29-ballistic-missile-defense-system-been-spotted-in-service-with-the-chinese-armed-forces	2025-03-13T03:30:45-07:00

With its superior range and advanced radar-homing guidance, the AIM-260A allows U.S. aircraft to engage these stealth platforms at longer ranges, reducing the risk of detection and engagement. This ability to defeat next-generation stealth fighters ensures that U.S. forces can maintain air superiority in complex and contested environments. The multi-target engagement capability of the AIM-260A is also worth noting. Thanks to its advanced seeker and radar systems, the missile can track multiple targets simultaneously. This allows a single aircraft to engage multiple hostile aircraft in rapid succession, an essential capability in air combat scenarios where threats are numerous and dynamic. In modern combat, electronic warfare plays an increasingly significant role. The AIM-260A’s ability to resist jamming and spoofing makes it a reliable weapon in environments where electronic countermeasures are employed. This capability is critical in ensuring that the missile can maintain its lock on targets and successfully neutralize adversary aircraft, even in the face of sophisticated electronic warfare efforts. Finally, the AIM-260A’s first-strike advantage gives U.S. forces a critical edge in air combat. By leveraging its extended range and improved tracking capabilities, the missile allows U.S. aircraft to strike first, neutralizing enemy threats before they can launch their own weapons or countermeasures. This makes the AIM-260A a formidable tool for pre-emptively neutralizing enemy aircraft in contested airspace. As testing continues and the AIM-260A is integrated into operational fleets, it is expected to become a critical asset for the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Aircraft such as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-22 Raptors will soon be equipped with the missile, marking a new era in air combat capabilities. The ongoing integration of the AIM-260A into operational fleets will reshape the strategies of both the Navy and Air Force, enhancing their ability to dominate in contested airspace and high-threat environments. The increasing focus on near-peer competitors like China and Russia, both of whom are rapidly advancing their own technologies, underscores the importance of the AIM-260A. With its superior range, advanced guidance systems, and resilience against electronic countermeasures, the missile will allow U.S. forces to remain at the forefront of modern aerial warfare. It provides a vital tool for maintaining air superiority in the face of evolving global threats. Looking toward the future, the AIM-260A is expected to evolve even further, incorporating new technologies and potentially expanding its role in both air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements.

Italy Proposes a European Guarantee Fund to Stimulate Private Investment in Defense	Italy has submitted a proposal to its European partners aimed at establishing a common guaranteed mechanism to attract private investment in the defense and aerospace sectors within the European Union. This initiative, which could generate up to €200 billion in investments, is based on a €17 billion guarantee fund designed to limit the impact on public finances. Presented by Italy’s Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti during a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, this approach seeks to strengthen Europe’s defense capabilities without increasing national debt burdens. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French and Italian Marine Regiments Join Forces During Amphex 2024 (Picture source: Italian MoD) The Italian proposal comes as the EU explores various options to increase defense spending in response to potential security threats, particularly from Russia. Ongoing discussions include the possibility of new joint borrowing, the use of existing EU funds, and an expanded role for the European Investment Bank. A decision on these measures is expected by June. According to Giorgetti, Italy is willing to contribute to this collective effort but is committed to doing so without reducing funding for healthcare and public services. With a public debt amounting to approximately 135% of GDP—the second highest in the eurozone after Greece—Italy has limited fiscal flexibility and is seeking mechanisms that do not further increase national debt. The European Union is pursuing an extensive defense investment plan to enhance military capabilities and address emerging threats. Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and growing instability at Europe’s borders, several member states are advocating for increased defense expenditures and greater integration of the defense industry. The European Commission is considering mobilizing funds through various mechanisms, including the European Investment Bank and public guarantees, to modernize military equipment, develop new technologies, and expand production capacity. The aim is to reduce dependency on external partners and strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy. Europe’s rearmament efforts are primarily driven by evolving security challenges and the need for greater independence in crisis management. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exposed critical gaps in ammunition stockpiles and production capacities, underscoring the urgency of revitalizing the defense industry. Additionally, China’s growing military influence, tensions in the South China Sea, and persistent instability in the Middle East and North Africa are prompting the EU to reassess its strategic priorities. The objective is not only to deter potential threats but also to safeguard critical infrastructure and improve resilience against cyberattacks and hybrid warfare. To achieve these goals, the EU is coordinating efforts among member states, combining public investment with private capital to maximize financial impact without significantly increasing national debt. Strengthening the European Defense Fund, establishing a common market for military equipment, and advancing joint programs such as the MGCS main battle tank and the SCAF air combat system exemplify the commitment to collective defense initiatives. This shift is accompanied by discussions on increasing military budgets, with some countries advocating for a minimum defense spending target of 2% of GDP. While this raises concerns over budgetary implications, it reflects a broader recognition of the need for reinforced defense capabilities. The Italian proposal aligns with established financial practices such as InvestEU and the European Fund for Strategic Investments. According to Giorgetti, the proposed guarantee fund would optimize the use of both national and European resources while ensuring more effective private-sector participation. He also emphasized that under EU accounting rules, public guarantees only contribute to national debt if they are utilized by beneficiary companies, thereby mitigating immediate fiscal pressure. Italy currently plans to increase its defense spending to 1.61% of GDP by 2027, a level below the NATO target of 2%. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed raising this threshold to 5%, a suggestion that has generated debate within the alliance. Acknowledging these discussions, Giorgetti stressed the importance of identifying industrial sectors that could be repurposed for defense production. In this context, underutilized automotive factories across the EU have been identified as potential sites for expanding military production while revitalizing struggling industries. As the EU seeks a unified approach to financing its defense initiatives, Italy’s proposal offers a pragmatic alternative focused on mobilizing substantial private investment while maintaining fiscal constraints. This mechanism could play a crucial role in industrial transformation and the expansion of European defense capabilities, aligning financial considerations with strategic security objectives.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/italy-proposes-a-european-guarantee-fund-to-stimulate-private-investment-in-defense	2025-03-13T02:03:08-07:00	
Greece to announce modernization of four Papanikolis-class submarines with new acquisitions under consideration	As reported by OnAlert on March 13, 2025, the modernization of the four Papanikolis-class submarines and the procurement of new submarines are among the programs expected to be announced by the Greek Prime Minister in Parliament on March 27, 2025. Concurrently, the first batch of 44 SeaHake Mod4 heavy torpedoes is set to arrive at the Salamis Naval Base in early summer, following significant delays attributed to supply chain disruptions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hellenic Navy’s plan is to complete the Papanikolis-class modernization program alongside the delivery of new submarines, resulting in a fleet of nine operational submarines. (Picture source: Hellenic Navy) The Hellenic Navy prioritizes enhancing its submarine fleet to maintain operational capabilities established with the acquisition of four Papanikolis-class submarines, based on the German Type 214, and the modernization of Okeanos (S-118), a Poseidon-class submarine based on the German Type 209. During the 2020 maritime crisis between Greece and Türkiye, these submarines reportedly tracked multiple Turkish surface vessels while remaining undetected. The Papanikolis-class is based on the Type 214 submarine, a diesel-electric attack submarine featuring an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system utilizing Siemens polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cells. It has a length of 65 meters, a beam of 6.3 meters, and a submerged displacement of 1,860 tons. The submarine can operate at a maximum submerged speed of 20 knots and dive to depths approaching 400 meters. It is designed for an endurance of 84 days, with the ability to remain submerged for extended periods using its AIP system. The armament consists of eight 533 mm torpedo tubes capable of launching heavyweight torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Its propulsion system includes two MTU 16V-396 diesel engines, two Piller NTB56.40-10 charging generators, and a Siemens Permasyn electric motor, driving a low-noise skew-back propeller to minimize acoustic signature. Two SeaHake Mod4 heavy torpedoes have already arrived at the Salamis Naval Base for training and certification purposes. These torpedoes lack explosive warheads and are instead equipped with devices that emit light and release a special liquid to facilitate retrieval after launch. They are guided by a fiber-optic cable from the submarine, ensuring precise tracking. Once their battery power is depleted, they surface for retrieval. The first training launches are scheduled for May, with additional exercises planned in the following months. The training torpedoes can be converted into operational weapons by installing 260 kg explosive warheads. By the end of 2025, the Hellenic Navy is expected to receive most of the heavy torpedoes, which will replace the older SUT Mod0 torpedoes acquired in 1980 and the SST4 models that remain in use. The SeaHake Mod4 torpedoes are designed for speeds of up to 50 knots and a range exceeding 50 kilometers. They feature advanced electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) to resist interference and defensive countermeasures. These torpedoes can operate with both active and passive targeting systems and are guided with precision via fiber-optic cables. They can be deployed from various depths under different sea conditions while evading modern decoys and countermeasures. Weighing over 1.5 tons, they carry 260 kg of explosive material, capable of causing significant damage to large naval vessels. The original delivery schedule for these torpedoes was set for 2023, but manufacturer Atlas Elektronik cited material supply issues related to the war in Ukraine as the cause of delays. The Hellenic Navy’s fleet also operates five older Type 209-class submarines. Two '209/1100' units have been in service for over 52 years, while two '209/1200' units have nearly 45 years of operational history. The long-term strategy involves acquiring four new submarines to replace these aging vessels. The Hellenic Navy has expressed interest in several designs, including the German Type 209 1400 Mod, the French Scorpene Evolved and Barracuda, and the Swedish Saab A26. A key requirement is that these submarines be constructed in Greek shipyards to retain a portion of the investment within the national industry. The Minister of National Defense, Nikos Dendias, has proposed an armament package that includes acquiring four new submarines alongside the Papanikolis-class modernization initiative. The Naval Staff has received political approval to conduct market research and request bids for the new submarines, which will be introduced gradually over the next decade. The upgraded Okeanos (S-118) submarine is projected to remain in service for at least 15 more years. The Hellenic Navy’s plan is to complete the Papanikolis-class modernization program alongside the delivery of new submarines, resulting in a fleet of nine operational submarines, including the Okeanos.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/greece-to-announce-modernization-of-four-papanikolis-class-submarines-with-new-acquisitions-under-consideration	2025-03-13T01:36:52-07:00	
Belarus finalizes agreement allowing Russia to deploy Oreshnik ballistic missiles on its territory	According to WWW1.Ru on February 26, 2025, the lower house of the Belarusian parliament ratified a draft law approving the security treaty between Belarus and Russia within the framework of the Union State. The agreement, signed in Minsk on December 6, 2024, now requires approval from the upper house of parliament before being signed by President Alexander Lukashenko. The treaty formalizes security cooperation between the two nations and establishes mutual defense commitments, including military base arrangements for the Russian Federation on Belarusian territory.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Some reports suggest that the Oreshnik is derived from the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile program, which was previously discontinued. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The agreement coincides with discussions regarding the deployment of the Russian Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile system in Belarus. Alexei Polischuk, head of the second department of the CIS countries at the Russian Foreign Ministry, previously stated that deployment would follow the treaty’s ratification. The Oreshnik system, according to official Russian sources, has a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers, a speed of Mach 10 (12,400 km/h), and can carry a warhead weighing up to 1.5 tons. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that no current missile defense systems are capable of intercepting the Oreshnik. During a December 6, 2024, meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State, Lukashenko requested the deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus, citing security concerns related to NATO military activities in Poland and Lithuania. He stated that the missile system would serve as a deterrent and align with Belarus’s security policies. Putin responded that deployment could occur in the second half of 2025, depending on the pace of serial production. He specified that while the missiles would be integrated into Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Belarusian authorities would determine targeting parameters. The Oreshnik missile system was first used in combat on November 21, 2024, in a strike against a defense-related facility in Dnipro, Ukraine. The Russian government stated that this strike was in response to Ukraine’s authorization of long-range attacks inside Russian territory. Western defense officials, including those from Estonia and the United Kingdom, interpreted the missile launch as a strategic message rather than solely a tactical operation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that the timing of the strike was intended to influence U.S. policy under President Donald Trump’s administration. Belarusian officials maintain that security cooperation with Russia does not pose a threat to third countries. On February 26, 2025, Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov, speaking at the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, stated that the presence of Russian nuclear and conventional missile systems in Belarus was a defensive necessity. He referenced Belarus’s decision in the 1990s to relinquish its nuclear arsenal under the Budapest Memorandum and argued that Western security assurances had proven unreliable. Ryzhenkov emphasized that Russian Oreshnik missiles stationed in Belarus would serve a deterrent role in response to NATO military deployments in the region. Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin has stated that the deployment of Oreshnik and tactical nuclear weapons increases Belarus’s defense capabilities. He noted that the Belarusian Armed Forces are modernizing their equipment and strategy. While he did not specify the exact timeline for the missile system’s deployment, he confirmed that work in this direction was continuing. Russian officials describe the Oreshnik missile as a hypersonic system capable of penetrating defensive installations. The missile has been reported to deliver high-velocity impacts, with kinetic energy effects comparable to a nuclear strike without radiation consequences. According to Russian statements, multiple Oreshnik missiles launched in coordination could achieve destructive force similar to nuclear weapons. The possibility of Oreshnik deployment in Belarus has drawn international attention. Western analysts regard it as part of Russia’s broader strategy to exert pressure on NATO and Ukraine. U.S. intelligence assessments indicate that while Russia has started producing the missile, its full capabilities remain uncertain. Some reports suggest that the Oreshnik is derived from the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile program, which was previously discontinued. Experts have noted concerns about the missile’s precision in conventional strikes, suggesting that it may be more suited for nuclear payloads. Domestically, Lukashenko has stated that Oreshnik deployment is necessary for national security and that Belarus should retain control over targeting decisions. Russian officials have framed the deployment as fulfilling security obligations under the Union State agreement. The finalization of the treaty and the potential deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus are expected to remain key issues in regional security discussions throughout 2025.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/belarus-finalizes-agreement-allowing-russia-to-deploy-oreshnik-ballistic-missiles-on-its-territory	2025-03-13T00:59:04-07:00

These nations have relied on the K9 to modernize their artillery capabilities and enhance the effectiveness of their armed forces. One of the key advantages of the K9 is its ability to operate in extreme weather conditions. This makes it particularly attractive to nations like Canada, which face harsh winter environments and cold-weather operational requirements. In fact, the K9 is currently undergoing rigorous winter and cold-weather tests in Finland and Norway, two countries with climates similar to that of Canada. The K9’s performance in these conditions will be a crucial factor for the Canadian military, which operates in some of the most extreme weather in the world. Another significant advantage of the K9 self-propelled howitzer is its NATO compatibility. As Canada is a member of NATO, the integration of foreign defense equipment that aligns with NATO standards is a critical consideration for the Canadian Armed Forces. The K9 is fully compatible with NATO 155mm artillery ammunition, making it an ideal choice for Canada’s modernization efforts. Its interoperability with other NATO forces will ensure that Canada can work seamlessly alongside its allies in multinational operations, a key aspect of the country's defense strategy. South Korea’s offer to Canada also aligns with the current trend of diversifying military equipment sources, as Canada looks to reduce its reliance on American defense suppliers. This move could potentially allow Canada to strengthen its defense ties with South Korea, a country with a strong track record in producing high-quality, battle-tested military systems. In light of the ongoing tensions between Canada and the United States, the South Korean offer presents a strategic opportunity for Canada to diversify its defense procurement. The K9 self-propelled howitzer is not only a proven and reliable artillery system but also an opportunity for Canada to strengthen its defense relationships with South Korea, a partner with shared democratic values and security interests. The South Korean delegation’s visit to Ottawa is seen as a step toward deepening the bilateral defense cooperation between Canada and South Korea, and it could open the door for further sales of advanced defense equipment, including air defense systems, missile launchers, and other key technologies. As the Canadian government moves forward with its Indirect Fires Modernisation program, the K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzer is positioned to be a strong contender in the bidding process. With its robust track record of global exports, NATO compatibility, and proven performance in extreme cold-weather environments, the K9 may very well be the right choice to enhance Canada’s artillery capabilities in the years to come. The global success of the South Korean K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzer speaks to its broad appeal and versatility. Aside from its current service in multiple NATO and non-NATO countries, the K9 has been included in various international defense tenders and is being actively considered for procurement by other nations seeking to modernize their artillery capabilities. With its advanced features, superior firepower, and high mobility, the K9 self-propelled howitzer is set to remain a key player in the global artillery market, and it could play a significant role in strengthening Canada’s military defense strategy moving forward. As the Canadian military looks to modernize and equip itself for future challenges, the South Korean K9 self-propelled howitzer offers a powerful and reliable solution that could meet the nation’s needs for both domestic defense and international cooperation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-south-korea-proposes-its-k9-howitzer-as-replacement-for-us-artillery-in-canadas-modernization-plan	2025-03-12T09:16:39-07:00	
Volkswagen Ready to Enter Military Production Exploring Defense Equipment Supply	According to information reported by The Telegraph on March 11, 2025, Volkswagen is considering entering the production of military equipment for the German army, marking a potential diversification of its activities amid Europe's rearmament efforts. This statement comes from Oliver Blume, CEO of Europe’s largest car manufacturer, who stated that the company is open to exploring new concepts but has not yet received concrete proposals from potential partners. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg (Picture source: WikiCommons) This development coincides with Germany’s efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities, driven by concerns over a possible disengagement of the United States under President Donald Trump. Uncertainty about U.S. commitments is prompting Europe to bolster its defense industry, with increased investments and industrial restructuring. Several manufacturers, including Rheinmetall and KNDS Group, have already begun converting their automotive component production facilities to manufacture military equipment in response to growing demand. According to economic analysts, German car factories currently have surplus capacity due to a sharp decline in vehicle exports, which have halved from pre-pandemic levels. This drop is partly due to increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers, now the world’s leading car exporters, as well as a European market shifting toward electrification, which is reshaping traditional automotive production. In Germany, annual vehicle exports have fallen from 2.4 million to around 1.2 million units, forcing manufacturers to rethink their economic model. Asked about Volkswagen’s potential involvement in military equipment production, Oliver Blume emphasized the need for increased security investments in Europe. He clarified that no concrete steps had been taken so far but did not rule out the possibility of Volkswagen playing a role in the sector. He noted that the group has extensive expertise in the automotive industry and could provide consulting and technological support if needed, without immediately committing its production facilities. Rising demand for defense equipment has already had a significant impact on financial markets, with strong stock growth among German defense companies expanding their production capacity. Some automotive factories, initially designed for internal combustion engine production or light vehicle components, are now being converted to meet military sector needs. The industrial flexibility of these facilities could enable rapid adaptation to new defense market requirements, particularly for armored vehicles or aerospace components. Oliver Blume’s statements come as Volkswagen reports a 15% drop in profit, totaling €19.1 billion in 2024 compared to €22.5 billion the previous year. The company is facing challenges related to its transition to electric vehicles, which requires significant investment in new technologies, as well as the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on vehicles manufactured in Canada and Mexico. To remain competitive against Chinese manufacturers, Volkswagen has launched a major restructuring plan that includes cutting 35,000 jobs, reducing costs, and optimizing production lines. This potential diversification into the defense sector could present a strategic opportunity for the company. In addition to strengthening Germany’s and Europe’s defense capabilities, it could help Volkswagen offset losses in the traditional automotive market. However, the company remains cautious and is waiting for initiatives from the defense sector before committing further to this direction. The evolution of the geopolitical situation and the policies of European governments will be key factors in shaping this industrial strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/volkswagen-ready-to-enter-military-production-exploring-defense-equipment-supply	2025-03-12T08:16:09-07:00

Demand for air defense systems in Africa is influenced by several factors, such as the increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and low-cost drones by non-state actors, including insurgent groups and militias, which has exposed gaps in air defense capabilities across the region. Armed groups have employed both commercial and military-grade drones for reconnaissance and strikes, creating a requirement for counter-UAV systems and short-range air defense assets. Many African military forces rely on Soviet-era air defense systems that lack modern radar, electronic warfare integration, and networked capabilities. As a result, some nations are evaluating newer systems to address evolving aerial threats in asymmetric warfare and urban operations. Ongoing conflicts and security concerns in regions such as the Sahel, Horn of Africa, and parts of Central and West Africa have led to increased interest in mobile, rapidly deployable air defense platforms. Countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, and Algeria have examined options to modernize their air defense capabilities to counter airborne threats posed by armed groups and regional adversaries. Shifts in defense procurement strategies and regional geopolitical considerations have also influenced acquisition choices, with some African states seeking to diversify their suppliers beyond Russia and France. The growing presence of Chinese and Turkish defense companies in the African market has introduced alternative air defense options. Cost is another consideration, as many African nations prioritize affordable, modular systems that can integrate into existing force structures without significant infrastructure modifications. In this context, the Typhoon-PVO is being considered by multiple countries as a potential air defense solution due to its mobility, operational flexibility, and adaptability to localized security conditions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/russia-confirms-ongoing-discussions-with-african-nations-on-typhoon-pvo-air-defense-vehicle-procurement	2025-03-12T03:46:07-07:00	
Iran, Russia and China Strengthen Naval Cooperation with New Joint Exercises in Gulf of Oman	As Iran, China, and Russia continue their joint naval exercises in the northern Indian Ocean, Iran’s Navy Chief, Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, highlighted the emergence of new maritime powers capable of maintaining a significant presence in high seas, as reported by Tasnim News Agency. These maneuvers, named Security Belt-2025, represent another step in military cooperation between the three nations, which seek to expand their maritime influence while challenging what they perceive as American hegemony in the region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since 2019, Iran, China, and Russia have conducted several joint naval exercises, underscoring their ability to secure sea lanes in a region through which more than half of global trade passes (Picture source: Tasnim News ) According to Iranian media, the exercises will take place primarily off the southeastern coast of Iran, starting from the strategic port of Chabahar, a crucial hub for Iranian maritime trade with access to the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean. Reports on the exact start date vary, with Tasnim news agency indicating a Tuesday launch while the official Irna agency mentions Monday. This inconsistency reflects the confidentiality surrounding these drills, often seen as demonstrations of force aimed at deterrence. The exercises will involve combat and support vessels from the Chinese and Russian naval forces, as well as units from Iran’s regular navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy. The drills are designed to enhance operational coordination among the three fleets and improve their ability to respond to maritime threats, including piracy and asymmetric attacks on commercial ships. The stated objective of these exercises is to ensure regional maritime security and strengthen multilateral cooperation among the participating nations. This edition of the Security Belt is notable for the presence of several observer countries, including Azerbaijan, South Africa, Oman, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Qatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, and Sri Lanka. Their participation highlights the growing interest in such initiatives across the Indo-Pacific, a region where tensions over strategic maritime routes have increased in recent years. The Chinese Ministry of Defense confirmed that China would deploy a destroyer and a replenishment ship as part of the operations, demonstrating its commitment to the initiative. Since 2019, Iran, China, and Russia have conducted several joint naval exercises, underscoring their ability to secure sea lanes in a region through which more than half of global trade passes. While these operations are officially focused on combating piracy and maritime terrorism, they also have strategic and political dimensions. For Tehran, Moscow, and Beijing, the exercises serve as an opportunity to demonstrate their growing influence over international shipping routes and to strengthen a military partnership that presents an alternative to Western-led coalitions. Rear Admiral Shahram Irani’s statements came in response to former U.S. President Donald Trump, who downplayed the significance of these maneuvers, asserting that U.S. military strength far surpassed that of the participating nations. 'Not at all… Because we are stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them. I rebuilt the military,' Trump stated. In response, Irani emphasized that the exercises do not pose a threat to regional stability but rather aim to secure maritime trade routes and ensure the free movement of goods. He criticized what he called 'illusions' maintained by certain international actors, arguing that those who oppose such initiatives have not contributed to peace and security but have instead fostered instability and conflict. In parallel with these exercises, Iran continues to invest in developing its naval capabilities. On February 6, 2025, the country unveiled its first drone carrier, the Martyr Bahman Bagheri, during an official ceremony in the Gulf. This military platform represents a significant shift for the Iranian navy, which aims to integrate autonomous technologies and airborne systems into its maritime operations. Iran is relying on technological advancements to address gaps in its conventional naval capabilities while enhancing its deterrence posture in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Iranian armed forces had already conducted military exercises in this area in February to improve their defense capabilities and prepare for potential confrontations. As part of Security Belt-2025, the Iranian navy is also emphasizing its experience in safeguarding merchant vessels and oil tankers. According to Iranian authorities, more than 6,000 ships have been escorted by the national navy in recent years, and assistance has been provided to around 20 countries facing maritime emergencies. These naval maneuvers are part of a broader strategic shift in which Iran, China, and Russia seek to consolidate their influence and develop joint military capabilities that could rival those of the United States and its allies. They also reflect evolving power dynamics in the Indo-Pacific, where Beijing and Moscow are expanding their naval reach and asserting their role in global maritime security governance. While these exercises are officially intended to secure maritime trade routes and counter transnational maritime threats, they also send a clear political signal. By regularly coordinating large-scale military operations, Iran, China, and Russia demonstrate their commitment to strengthening a strategic partnership that could reshape global power balances. Amid rising tensions with the United States and its allies, these operations highlight the gradual emergence of a new maritime order, where multiple centers of influence challenge the dominance of Western powers.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/iran-russia-and-china-strengthen-naval-cooperation-with-new-joint-exercises-in-gulf-of-oman	2025-03-12T03:42:38-07:00

South Korea Offers Submarines to Canada as Relations with Washington Deteriorate	As Canada reassesses its strategic partnerships, South Korea is positioning itself as a reliable defense supplier capable of delivering advanced military equipment efficiently. A recent visit by a South Korean delegation to Ottawa highlights this initiative at a time when political instability in the United States is prompting several allies to diversify their sources of military procurement, as reported by the Ottawa Citizen on March 10, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A key element of this proposal is the KSS-III, a next-generation submarine developed by Hanwha Ocean (Picture source: ROK Navy) A group of twelve representatives from South Korea’s defense industry and government met with Canadian officials on March 5 and 6 to promote a range of military systems, including howitzers, training aircraft, rocket launchers, and submarines. The offer includes commitments to support Canadian industry by establishing local maintenance facilities and providing full access to onboard technology, an advantage that U.S. suppliers do not always guarantee their partners. A key element of this proposal is the KSS-III, a next-generation submarine developed by Hanwha Ocean. According to retired South Korean Admiral Steve Jeong, now vice president of the company, the platform aligns with the requirements of the Canadian Armed Forces. He emphasized that three units are already in service, and that South Korea could deliver a submarine within six years of signing a contract. With the capability to remain submerged for over three weeks without surfing and a range exceeding 7,000 nautical miles, the KSS-III is particularly suited for Arctic operations. South Korea is becoming an increasingly prominent player in the global arms market. Its defense exports have grown significantly in recent years, particularly in Europe, where several countries are seeking to reduce their reliance on the United States. Poland has signed a contract worth over $10 billion for South Korean tanks, self-propelled howitzers, light aircraft, and missile systems, while Romania has secured a $1 billion deal for howitzers. These agreements include provisions for local production, supporting job creation and industrial cooperation. The growth of South Korea’s defense industry is partly driven by past challenges with US suppliers. According to Jeong, South Korea previously faced rising costs and technological dependence that limited its autonomy. In response, the country developed its own defense systems, enabling it to provide NATO-compatible equipment while avoiding certain restrictions associated with U.S. exports. This shift comes at a time when Canada is increasingly scrutinizing its dependence on U.S. technology. The F-35 fighter jets ordered for $19 billion remain under American control in terms of software and hardware updates. Similarly, the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) warship program, which could cost up to $80 billion, incorporates key systems controlled by the United States, potentially restricting Canada’s operational sovereignty over its own naval fleet. Despite these concerns, the Canadian government has maintained its procurement strategy with the US, signing nearly $30 billion in military equipment contracts in 2023, including an $8 billion agreement with Boeing for surveillance aircraft and a $2.5 billion deal for drones. This approach aimed to address American criticism over Canada’s defense spending levels but has not prevented the Trump administration from increasing pressure on Ottawa. The issue of military and economic integration with the U.S. remains a divisive topic among Canadian policymakers and defense experts. Some former high-ranking officials, such as General Rick Hillier, advocate for closer ties with Washington, while others, like retired Vice Admiral Mark Norman, warn against excessive reliance and have suggested economic countermeasures in response to U.S. pressures. Against this backdrop, South Korea’s proposal aligns with a broader trend in which U.S. allies are exploring alternative defense suppliers. If Canada seriously considers this offer, it could mark a shift in its procurement policy, favoring partners that provide competitive and technologically accessible solutions without imposing excessive restrictions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/south-korea-offers-submarines-to-canada-as-relations-with-washington-deteriorate	2025-03-11T01:52:48-07:00	
Tenth Russian Project 12700 Alexandrit-class minesweeper Polyarny approaches the final construction phase	On March 9, 2025, the Telegram channel Military Russia shared an image of the tenth hull of the Project 12700 minesweeper, named Polyarny, indicating that the vessel is approaching the final stages of its construction at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard (SNSZ) in Saint Petersburg. This development is part of the ongoing expansion of Russia’s mine countermeasure fleet under the Alexandrit-class program, as initial plans called for the construction of ten ships, but later statements mentioned a total of up to 40 units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The classification of the Project 12700 has changed multiple times, alternating between base and sea minesweepers, though the Polyarny is officially designated as a base minesweeper, as indicated on its keel-laying plaque. (Picture source: Telegram/MilitaryRussia) The Polyarny was laid down on June 12, 2022, following a contract signed by the Russian Ministry of Defense on August 25, 2021, during the Army-2021 International Military-Technical Forum. The ship, designated with factory number 530, is intended for service with the Northern Fleet. Project 12700 ships are designed for mine countermeasure operations in both coastal and deep-sea environments. The classification of these ships has changed multiple times, alternating between base and sea minesweepers, though the Polyarny is officially designated as a base minesweeper, as indicated on its keel-laying plaque. The Project 12700, known as the Alexandrit-class, was developed by the Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau to modernize the Russian Navy’s mine countermeasure capabilities. The lead ship, named Aleksandr Obukhov, was laid down in 2011 and entered service in 2016. The project was initiated to replace aging Soviet-era minesweepers from the Gorya and Sonya classes with vessels utilizing composite materials and updated mine-hunting technology. Initial plans under the State Armament Program for 2018–2027 called for the construction of ten ships, but later statements mentioned a total of up to 40 units. A primary feature of the Alexandrit-class is its monolithic fiberglass hull, produced using vacuum infusion technology. The SNSZ is the only shipyard in Russia with this capability and the only one globally capable of producing monolithic hulls up to 80 meters in length. This construction method reduces the vessel’s magnetic signature, improving survivability against magnetic mines, while also providing higher structural strength compared to steel hulls. The fiberglass composition increases service life beyond that of low-magnetic steel hulls while reducing overall weight. The shipyard implemented advanced equipment and software to develop this technology. This construction method reduces the vessel’s magnetic signature, which improves survivability against magnetic mines. The composite hull also provides resistance to corrosion and extends its operational lifespan compared to traditional steel-hulled designs. The propulsion system consists of two 42-cylinder, star-configured Zvezda M503B-1 diesel engines, each producing 2,500 horsepower, supported by two ADGR-315/1500 OM4 diesel generators (315 kW each) and two DGF2A 200/1500 diesel generators (200 kW each). The ships are also equipped with two bow thrusters (PU-100F) and two stern retractable azimuth thrusters (VPK-90F/70), providing high maneuverability. The maximum speed is 16.5 knots, with an operational range of 1,600 nautical miles at 10 knots. The Alexandrit-class is equipped with a range of mine countermeasure systems, including the Livadia-M mine detection sonar, the Pall-N navigation radar, and the Ruberoid communications suite. The mine countermeasure system integrates high-performance hydroacoustic stations, deployed both onboard and via remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles, for mine detection and neutralization in coastal and deep-sea environments. The ships also feature an integrated bridge system and an automated mine countermeasure control system, allowing centralized management of all detection and neutralization operations. Defensive armament includes a six-barrel 30mm AK-306 close-in weapon system, a 14.5mm MTPU heavy machine gun mount, and eight man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), either the 9K38 Igla or the 9K333 Verba. The Aleksandr Obukhov (n°507), the lead ship of the Alexandrit-class (which became the most numerous type of sea minesweeper in service within the Russian Navy), was commissioned on December 9, 2016, and assigned to the Baltic Fleet. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The ships have a standard displacement of 620 tons, increasing to 890 tons at full load. They measure 61 meters in length, with a beam of 10.2 meters and a draft of 2.68 meters. Their maximum speed is 16.5 knots, with an operational range of 1,600 nautical miles at 10 knots. These vessels are designed for ten-day missions without resupply and have a crew complement of 45. Mine countermeasure capabilities are supported by unmanned mine-hunting systems, including the Skanda unmanned surface vehicle and the Alexandrit-ISPUM mine disposal system. The ships also retain the capability to operate traditional sweeping equipment, as well as using the Orlan-10 UAV. The onboard electronic suite features the Diez automated control system, the Anapa sonar, the Struktura-35 mine detection sonar, and the Altyn-M integrated sonar system for underwater navigation and detection. Production of the Alexandrit-class is centralized at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard, the sole facility currently manufacturing these vessels. Early production faced delays, particularly with diesel engine procurement from Zvezda, but shipbuilding capacity has since increased. While there were considerations to expand production to the Amur Shipyard, all orders remain with SNSZ. In 2021, official statements indicated that an additional ten ships were under consideration following the initial production run. Several ships from this class have been delivered to different Russian fleets, becoming the most numerous type of sea minesweeper in service within the Russian Navy. The Aleksandr Obukhov (n°507), the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on December 9, 2016, and assigned to the Baltic Fleet. For its part, the Black Sea Fleet operates the Ivan Antonov (460), commissioned on January 26, 2019, the Vladimir Yemelyanov (466), commissioned on December 28, 2019, and the Georgiy Kurbatov (464), which entered service on August 20, 2021. The Pacific Fleet has received the Yakov Balyaev (701), commissioned on December 26, 2020, the Pyotr Ilyichev (721), which entered service on November 16, 2022, and the Anatoly Shlemov (757), delivered on December 29, 2022. The most recently delivered unit, the Lev Chernavin (660), was assigned to the Baltic Fleet on December 25, 2023. Additional ships are currently in various stages of construction. The Afanasy Ivannikov (hull n°529), which was laid down on September 9, 2021, was launched on August 9, 2024, and is expected to enter service in 2025. The Polyarny (530), laid down on June 12, 2022, is nearing the final stages of construction and is also planned for commissioning in 2025. The Dmitry Lysov (531), laid down on June 19, 2023, and the Semyon Agafonov (532), laid down on January 18, 2024, are still under construction, with expected service entry in 2026 and 2027, respectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/tenth-russian-project-12700-alexandrit-class-minesweeper-polyarny-approaches-the-final-construction-phase	2025-03-11T01:48:31-07:00

(Picture source: Tajikistani MoD) Tajikistan unveiled its newly acquired HQ-17AE short-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) system for the first time during a parade marking the 32nd anniversary of its Armed Forces. The display of four combat vehicles and two transporter-loader vehicles underscores the country’s efforts to modernize its air defense and highlights its growing military cooperation with China. The HQ-17AE is a short-range surface-to-air weapon system designed to operate in all weather conditions and capable of intercepting targets flying at low and medium altitude. Developed by the Second Academy of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), it is an export version of the HQ-17A, itself derived from the Russian Tor system. Like all members of the HQ-17 family, the HQ-17AE is primarily intended to counter SHORAD ('Short-Range Air Defense') threats such as aircraft, helicopters, and drones, as well as precision-guided munitions (guided bombs, cruise missiles, and air-to-surface missiles). Chinese official sources indicate that it can also engage more challenging targets such as stealth aircraft, supersonic cruise missiles, and certain types of rockets. The HQ-17 range includes multiple variants: tracked versions (HQ-17) and 6×6 wheeled versions (HQ-17A), both operated by the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force, as well as an export version called the FM-2000, revealed for the first time at the 2018 Airshow China defense exhibition. It remains unclear whether the HQ-17AE is simply a new designation for the FM-2000 or whether it is a distinct variant featuring a launcher-radar vehicle more closely aligned with the HQ-17A. In any case, the difference between the HQ-17A and the FM-2000 mainly lies in the 6×6 chassis, although both systems use the same firing turret. In addition to Tajikistan, the HQ-17 series has been exported to countries including Serbia and Saudi Arabia, reflecting China’s growing footprint in the global defense market. This acquisition is part of a broader regional trend: neighboring Uzbekistan has also procured Chinese-made air defense systems such as the FM-90 and the KS-1C. By adding the HQ-17AE to its arsenal, Tajikistan signals a shift toward Chinese defense technology to strengthen its national security and enhance its overall deterrence posture.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/tajikistan-debuts-chinese-made-hq-17ae-air-defense-system-during-armed-forces-anniversary-parade	2025-03-11T01:28:50-07:00

Europe Strengthens Air Defense with Massive Aster Missile Order from France Italy and UK	France, the United Kingdom, and Italy are set to announce a new strategic order for nearly 220 Aster 15 and 30 missiles, as reported by La Tribune. This acquisition, to be officially confirmed early next week by the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), aims to enhance the missile defense capabilities of the three nations while reinforcing European industrial sovereignty in this critical sector. The contract, awarded to the industrial consortium Eurosam, reflects European efforts to address evolving aerial threats, including next-generation fighter aircraft, hypersonic missiles, and long-range armed drones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles form the backbone of air and missile defense systems for several European nations, equipping both naval and ground-based platforms (Picture source: OCCAR) The contract has been granted to Eurosam, a Franco-Italian economic interest group (GIE) comprising MBDA France, MBDA Italy, and Thales, key companies in the European defense industry. This longstanding partnership plays a major role in the development of naval and land-based air defense capabilities through widely deployed and proven systems. Beyond this latest order, Paris, London, and Rome have emphasized the need to accelerate production and delivery schedules, not only for these additional missiles but also for previously contracted units. The objective is to ensure the timely availability of Aster missiles for their respective armed forces, addressing operational readiness requirements in a geopolitical context marked by increasing military tensions. The Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles form the backbone of air and missile defense systems for several European nations, equipping both naval and ground-based platforms. Designed to provide effective protection against a broad range of aerial threats, they are integrated into key defense systems, including PAAMS (Principal Anti-Air Missile System), which is deployed on the UK Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers, the French and Italian Horizon frigates, and the SAMP/T system used by the French and Italian armies. The Aster 15, developed for short- to medium-range air defense, reaches speeds of Mach 3 and has an interception range exceeding 30 km, making it well-suited for countering multiple and simultaneous threats. The Aster 30 is designed for long-range engagements, with an operational range exceeding 120 km and a speed of Mach 4.5, enabling it to intercept short-range ballistic missiles and maneuver aerial threats. The missiles employ an advanced guidance system integrating an active radio frequency (RF) seeker and inertial navigation, ensuring high-precision target tracking. Their maneuverability is enhanced by a hybrid control system combining aerodynamic surfaces with thrust vector control, known as PIF-PAF, which enables rapid trajectory corrections. This design ensures a high interception success rate, even against supersonic targets executing complex evasive maneuvers. Due to these capabilities, Aster missiles are effective against a wide range of threats, including stealth aircraft, low-flying cruise missiles, and short-range ballistic missiles. With growing international tensions and the emergence of new threats, Aster missile production capacity has become a strategic concern. In December 2022, France and Italy had already placed an order with Eurosam for nearly 700 Aster missiles, highlighting the program’s significance for European armed forces. The current priority is to shorten production times and expand industrial capacity to meet operational requirements more effectively. MBDA, a key industry player, has set an objective to reduce production time significantly. In 2022, the average production time for an Aster missile was 42 months, but the goal is to bring this down to under 18 months by 2026. To achieve this, MBDA and its partners are implementing an industrial optimization strategy, including facility expansions and automation of certain manufacturing stages. The Selles-Saint-Denis site, which plays a key role in final assembly and missile integration, is undergoing investment initiatives to enhance production capacity and ensure a steady increase in output. The acceleration of deliveries and increased production capacity align with broader European efforts to strengthen strategic autonomy. As asymmetric and conventional threats continue to evolve, ensuring a secure and independent supply of essential defense systems is becoming a priority for European nations. This joint order reflects the commitment of Paris, London, and Rome to maintaining interoperability among their armed forces while reducing reliance on non-European suppliers. By modernizing industrial infrastructure and optimizing manufacturing processes, Europe is positioning itself as a key player in next-generation defense systems. This strategy extends beyond the Aster missile program and is part of a broader effort to enhance collective defense capabilities, including initiatives such as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and new missile defense programs within NATO and the European Union. The official confirmation of this order for more than 200 Aster missiles marks a new step in strengthening European air defense capabilities. By reinforcing industrial cooperation and accelerating the deployment of these critical systems, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy aim to enhance the protection of their strategic assets and military units. In a constantly evolving security landscape, this initiative underscores the importance of a proactive approach to addressing modern air defense challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/europe-strengthens-air-defense-with-massive-aster-missile-order-from-france-italy-and-uk	2025-03-10T07:39:24-07:00	
North Korea Builds Two New Frigates Simultaneously as It Expands Naval Capabilities with Russian Assistance	North Korea is undergoing an unprecedented modernization of its naval fleet with the simultaneous construction of two distinct frigates at the Nampo shipyard. These new surface vessels mark a strategic shift in Pyongyang’s maritime doctrine, aimed at strengthening its power projection and defense capabilities in response to regional threats. During an inspection visit on March 8, 2025, Kim Jong-Un reviewed the progress of these projects and reaffirmed the importance of naval power in national defense, emphasizing the need for a fleet capable of operating under modern naval warfare conditions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images released by state media show two ships under construction, each in a different section of the shipyard (Picture source: KCNA) Images released by state media show two ships under construction, each in a different section of the shipyard. The first, which appears to be at an advanced stage, features a large superstructure with a design seemingly intended to reduce radar signature. It is expected to integrate modern systems, including a fixed-panel radar, a configuration not previously seen in the North Korean Navy, and a vertical launching system (VLS) capable of deploying both cruise missiles and advanced guided surface-to-air missiles. With an estimated displacement of over 3,000 tons, this frigate would be the largest surface combatant ever built by North Korea. Its design suggests an effort to align with the technological standards of more developed navies while enhancing the country's blue-water capabilities. The second frigate, still under construction in another hall of the same shipyard, appears to be part of a separate program. The installation of a new clad structure in this section, identified by analysts in the previous year, indicates that construction on this vessel has recently accelerated. Its design and configuration are less advanced than those of the first ship, suggesting that it may be a more conventional variant, likely designed for patrol and coastal defense missions. However, it also incorporates modernized elements, reflecting a broader effort to enhance the North Korean surface fleet. This ambitious naval program is part of a wider modernization initiative, which also includes the construction of a 7,000-ton nuclear-powered strategic submarine. Currently being assembled at Sinpo South, this submarine is expected to carry up to ten ballistic missiles, providing Pyongyang with a more difficult-to-detect underwater strike capability. The commissioning of this submarine would significantly strengthen the country's nuclear deterrence strategy and mark a turning point in its submarine capabilities. The simultaneous acceleration of these naval projects is partly attributed to growing cooperation with Russia. Historically, North Korea has received technological transfers from China and the former Soviet Union to develop its naval capabilities. Today, presumed Russian involvement in these projects could explain the rapid integration of advanced technologies, particularly the VLS and modern radar systems. This development suggests an intensification of ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, reinforcing North Korea’s navy amid rising geopolitical tensions. Currently, the Korean People’s Navy relies primarily on an aging fleet dominated by Najin- and Nampo-class frigates. The Najin-class frigates, introduced in the 1970s, have undergone partial modernizations, including the integration of Kh-35 anti-ship missiles on certain units. However, with a displacement of around 1,500 tons, these ships exhibit clear technological limitations against modern threats. The Nampo-class frigates, more recent but produced in limited numbers, remain largely undocumented due to the secrecy surrounding North Korea’s naval programs. In comparison, the new frigates under construction represent a significant technological leap, enhancing the country's ability to conduct more effective naval operations. Alongside these developments, North Korea has also integrated a modernized frigate into its fleet, Patrol Ship No. 661, part of the Amnok-class. This vessel, among the most advanced in the North Korean Navy, features a design inspired by foreign models and a diversified weapons system. It is equipped with eight anti-ship missiles, six short-range surface-to-air missiles, a 76mm naval gun, two rapid-fire anti-aircraft systems, and anti-submarine rocket launchers, providing North Korea with improved maritime and coastal operational capabilities. The commissioning of this frigate coincided with North Korea’s participation in Russia’s 'Ocean-2024' naval exercises, an event that marked the country's first such involvement and highlighted a growing military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang. The simultaneous development of these frigates and the strategic nuclear submarine comes at a time of rising regional tensions, particularly with the United States and South Korea increasing their joint military exercises. Ahead of the Freedom Shield drills, North Korea appears to be signaling its ability to modernize its navy despite international sanctions and diplomatic pressures. This accelerated naval modernization marks a break from Pyongyang’s traditional military doctrine, which has historically focused on land-based and submarine deterrence. The commissioning of these new warships represents a major transformation for the Korean People’s Navy, which has long been limited to asymmetric and coastal operations but now appears to be shifting towards a broader enhancement of its blue-water capabilities. With these frigates and its submarine program, North Korea is moving beyond a purely defensive posture to establish a more diverse and sophisticated naval fleet. This evolution, combined with technical and strategic support from Russia, could alter the regional naval balance and force the United States and South Korea to reassess their maritime defense and presence strategies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/north-korea-builds-two-new-frigates-simultaneously-as-it-expands-naval-capabilities-with-russian-assistance	2025-03-10T06:45:06-07:00	
Poland Releases Video of First Successful CGR-080 Missile Launch from Homar-K MLRS	Poland has released a video of the first successful launch of the CGR-080 guided missile from the Homar-K system, shared on X by defense analyst Haku Mason. While the announcement of this launch was made on December 7, 2024, this is the first time footage of the event has been made public, providing a concrete illustration of the system’s capabilities and the extended range of this new-generation munition. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from the video of Poland's first successful launch of the CGR-080 guided missile from the Homar-K system. (Picture source: Haku Mason X Channel) The Homar-K system is a Polish adaptation of the South Korean K239 Chunmoo multiple-launch rocket system, integrating advanced South Korean technologies onto a Polish Jelcz 8x8 truck chassis and combined with the Topaz fire control system. This configuration provides Poland with a mobile, modular platform adapted to modern conflict requirements. The partnership between Hanwha Aerospace and Poland’s defense industry has resulted in a hybrid solution combining South Korean expertise in rocket artillery systems with local industrial capabilities. In addition to the CGR-080, Poland already operates the CTM-290 tactical ballistic missile and may eventually integrate long-range missiles such as the CTM-MR (formerly CTM-160) and KTSSM-II, further enhancing its long-range strike capabilities and deterrence potential. The CGR-080 is a guided missile utilizing GPS/INS (Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System) technology, ensuring high accuracy with an operational range of 30 to 80 kilometers and a Circular Error probability (CEP) of just 15 meters. Its explosive warhead is designed to effectively neutralize a variety of targets, including military infrastructure, lightly armored vehicles, and fortified positions. Unlike traditional unguided rockets, the CGR-080 provides precision strike capability, reducing collateral damage and improving the effectiveness of targeted bombardment, particularly in urban or complex environments. Compared to similar systems, the Homar-K equipped with the CGR-080 exceeds the performance of the U.S. HIMARS system armed with the M31 GMLRS missile, which has a maximum range of 70 kilometers. This increased range allows Polish forces to engage targets at greater distances while remaining beyond the reach of enemy counter-battery systems. The extended range, combined with the modularity of the Homar-K, provides greater operational flexibility and an enhanced deterrence capability on the battlefield while maintaining interoperability with allied artillery systems. A key advantage of the Homar-K system is its ability to fire a wide range of munitions, increasing its adaptability for various mission types. In addition to the CGR-080, it is compatible with the CTM-MR guided missile, which has a range of 50 to 160 kilometers and a penetration-fragmentation warhead designed for destroying fortified positions and strategic infrastructure. The CTM-290 missile can strike targets up to 290 kilometers away, further extending the Polish military’s deep-strike capability. The Homar-K can also deploy a guided anti-ship missile equipped with GPS/INS/IIR (Imaging Infrared) guidance, capable of engaging naval targets at ranges between 50 and 160 kilometers, enabling operations across multiple theaters. The success of this first CGR-080 launch demonstrates the increasing operational proficiency of Polish artillery crews in handling advanced systems. The K239 Chunmoo, from which the Homar-K is derived, is currently the second most-produced modern multiple launch rocket system globally after U.S. systems and is in service in significant numbers in South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Poland, and Saudi Arabia. Hanwha Aerospace, Poland’s partner in this project, has demonstrated its ability to provide solutions tailored to local requirements by integrating its systems with national components. The successful integration of the CGR-080 missile could also pave the way for the Homar-K system’s export to other countries, including Norway, the Philippines, and Malaysia, which may be interested in a multiple-launch rocket system offering modularity and compatibility with advanced munitions. This development strengthens the international appeal of the Homar-K program and could mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation between Poland and other strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-releases-video-of-first-successful-cgr-080-missile-launch-from-homar-k-mlrs	2025-03-10T05:48:22-07:00

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) The U.S. Army's decision to adopt the Israeli-made Spike NLOS missile system for its Interim-Long Range Precision Munition (I-LRPM) program in 2020 significantly bolstered the firepower and operational flexibility of its AH-64 Apache helicopters. Developed by Lockheed Martin, Spike NLOS enables the Apache to engage targets beyond visual range (BVR), extending the attack helicopter’s operational range to up to 32 kilometers. This long-range capability allows Apache pilots to neutralize high-value targets at distances far greater than traditional missiles, providing more effective standoff and reducing the risk of exposure to enemy air defenses. Spike NLOS is part of the broader Spike family of missiles, which was originally developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The Spike family, known for its precision and versatility, includes a variety of missile variants designed for different platforms and target engagement scenarios. The NLOS (Non-Line of Sight) version stands out by allowing the missile to be fired at targets that are not directly visible to the operator or the launch platform, thanks to its sophisticated guidance systems and the use of real-time sensor data from the Apache. This technology is a key feature that sets Spike NLOS apart from traditional missiles, making it ideal for modern combat environments where traditional line-of-sight targeting may not always be possible or effective. Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) technology enables the Spike missile to strike targets hidden behind obstacles such as buildings, terrain, or dense foliage. This capability is made possible by integrating the missile with advanced targeting and guidance systems, which allow the operator to launch the missile based on precise coordinates or sensor inputs, even if the target cannot be directly seen. In combat, where visibility may be limited due to weather conditions, smoke, or geographic features, this technology offers a significant advantage in striking high-value targets without exposing the platform to unnecessary risk. Spike NLOS is equipped with an advanced motor system that enhances its range and accuracy, two crucial elements for precision strikes in modern warfare. The missile’s long range allows Apache crews to engage distant targets from a safe standoff distance, minimizing exposure to hostile air defenses and ground fire. In addition to its extended range, the missile also incorporates a 'man-in-the-loop' control system. This feature provides Apache pilots with the ability to adjust the missile's trajectory during flight, giving them greater control over the missile’s path as it engages its target. The ability to make real-time adjustments is especially valuable in dynamic combat environments, where targets may move or change positions rapidly. The integration of Spike NLOS enhances the Apache’s precision strike capabilities. The man-in-the-loop feature enables the pilot to guide the missile to its target with greater accuracy, even if the target is moving or positioned in challenging terrain. This flexibility allows Apache crews to engage targets more effectively, particularly in complex combat situations where the environment is constantly changing, and precision is key to mission success. In addition, the ability to control the missile mid-flight ensures a high probability of hitting the target, even if it is not in direct line of sight from the helicopter. Moreover, the compatibility of Spike NLOS with the Apache’s existing suite of sensors and avionics systems ensures that the Apache will maintain situational awareness while executing precision strikes. The Apache’s onboard sensors can track and identify targets at long distances, and the integration with Spike NLOS allows the helicopter to launch a missile and strike with pinpoint accuracy, even when those targets are obscured by terrain or obstacles. This added capability is vital in modern warfare, where minimizing collateral damage and ensuring mission success are of paramount importance. The introduction of Spike NLOS onto the AH-64 Apache represents a significant enhancement of the U.S. Army’s precision strike capabilities, providing a new tool for a wide range of combat operations, including counter-terrorism, force protection, and conventional warfare. Previously, the AH-64 Apache’s primary missile system was the AGM-114 Hellfire, a laser-guided missile that has been in use for decades. While the Hellfire remains an effective weapon, its range and line-of-sight limitations have made it less suitable for certain modern combat scenarios. The Spike NLOS missile, with its extended range, non-line-of-sight capability, and advanced guidance systems, gives the Apache a significant tactical advantage. By integrating Spike NLOS into its weaponry, the Apache can now strike targets up to 32 km away, extending its operational reach and providing greater flexibility in combat. The ability to engage targets beyond visual range also enhances the safety of Apache crews, allowing them to remain at a standoff distance and reducing the risk of retaliation from enemy air defenses or ground forces. The precision targeting capabilities of the Spike NLOS, combined with its extended range, make the Apache a more formidable platform in modern, high-intensity conflicts. Looking ahead, the U.S. Army plans to continue testing and refining the Spike NLOS missile system, with the goal of fully integrating it into Apache units around the world. As the Army refines its use of Spike NLOS in real-world combat scenarios, it will be able to build on the Apache's already impressive capabilities, ensuring that it remains a key asset in the U.S. military’s arsenal for years to come. With its enhanced range, precision, and flexibility, the Spike NLOS missile system is set to play a critical role in the Army’s ability to conduct effective and efficient operations in a wide range of conflict zones. As the U.S. military continues to adapt to evolving threats, the integration of Spike NLOS on the Apache attack helicopter represents a key step in maintaining air superiority and providing critical support to ground forces. The system will provide Apache crews with the tools needed to tackle a wide range of targets, from enemy combatants to high-value assets, while minimizing risks and maximizing the effectiveness of each strike.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-army-integrates-israeli-spike-missile-on-ah-64-apache-helicopter-for-enhanced-precision-strikes	2025-03-08T11:26:02-08:00

With its extended range, speed, and advanced targeting capabilities, the Meteor missile will be an essential component of the Royal Navy’s air combat strategy for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-british-navy-tests-f-35b-fighter-jet-armed-with-meteor-missile-for-first-time-to-improve-naval-air-operations	2025-03-07T05:36:45-08:00	
Vietnam Selects South Korea's K9 Thunder Marking a Strategic Shift in Military Relations in Asia	South Korea continues its expansion in the defense market with the export of the K9 Thunder to Vietnam, a transaction that marks a strategic shift for Hanoi, as reported by South Korean media outlet Daum. Facing an increasingly tense regional environment, particularly in the South China Sea, Vietnam is seeking to modernize its artillery while reducing its dependence on Russia. Until now, most of its military equipment came from Moscow, but the war in Ukraine has disrupted Russian arms supplies, prompting Hanoi to diversify its sources. The contract signed between Hanwha Aerospace and the Vietnamese government, unveiled in January 2025, involves the acquisition of around 20 K9A1 self-propelled howitzers for an estimated $300 million. This sale is particularly significant as it represents the first export of South Korean weapons to a communist country, marking a milestone in the evolution of bilateral defense relations between Seoul and Hanoi.

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Vietnam’s interest in the K9 Thunder was expressed during the 11th ROK-Vietnam Strategic Defense Dialogue in April 2024, against the backdrop of rising tensions with China. The modernization of Vietnam’s artillery is part of a broader effort to strengthen its deterrence capabilities, particularly along its disputed borders and in the South China Sea. Currently, Vietnam’s arsenal relies heavily on aging Soviet-era equipment, such as the 2S3 Akatsiya and 2S1 Gvozdika, which have fallen behind technologically compared to contemporary systems. The K9 provides Vietnam with a modern self-propelled howitzer, capable of a firing range of 40 km with conventional shells and up to 60 km with specialized munitions, along with a high rate of fire and an advanced fire control system that enables multiple-round simultaneous impact (MRSI) capability. This ability to deliver rapid and mobile fire support is a key advantage in modern conflict scenarios, where artillery superiority can be a decisive factor. The K9 Thunder, developed by Hanwha Aerospace, is one of the most widely exported self-propelled howitzers worldwide, currently in service with armed forces in Poland, Finland, Norway, India, and Australia. Its combination of performance, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability to various terrains makes it a preferred choice compared to more expensive models like the German PzH 2000. Its lower cost allows countries seeking to modernize their artillery to acquire an effective system at a more accessible price, which has significantly contributed to its commercial success. Additionally, South Korea’s offer of technology transfer is a crucial factor for Vietnam, which aims to develop its domestic defense industry and strengthen its defense autonomy. This military cooperation between Seoul and Hanoi is not limited to a single transaction but is part of a broader strategic framework that includes officer training, joint exercises, and technology exchanges. The first K9 units are expected to arrive in Vietnam by 2025, with initial deployment likely to strategic artillery units in the northern regions. However, acquiring 20 to 30 units will not be sufficient for a comprehensive modernization of Vietnam’s artillery forces. To significantly enhance its capabilities, Vietnam would need to procure several hundred additional units, a process that would likely extend over several years. Nevertheless, this transaction represents a shift in Vietnam’s military procurement strategy, signaling a gradual move away from Russia in favor of suppliers capable of providing equipment compatible with NATO standards. This shift also highlights an evolving trend within South Korea’s defense industry, which is increasingly establishing itself as a key player in the global arms market. The acquisition of the K9 Thunder also reflects broader transformations in Vietnam-South Korea relations. Since normalizing diplomatic ties in 1992, the two countries have strengthened their cooperation in multiple areas, including economic, technological, and industrial sectors. South Korea is now the largest foreign investor in Vietnam, with major companies such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai playing a central role in the country’s economic development. More recently, this partnership has extended to the defense sector, with the signing of a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2022. South Korea aims to solidify its presence in Southeast Asia, a region where Chinese influence is expanding, while diversifying its defense and industrial partnerships. From a geopolitical perspective, this cooperation represents a significant opportunity for both countries. By strengthening its ties with Seoul, Vietnam gains access to advanced military technology without relying exclusively on the United States—an important balance to maintain in its foreign policy to avoid provoking China. For South Korea, this partnership with Hanoi aligns with a broader regional strategy aimed at establishing more independent defense alliances in response to growing security challenges in Asia. While remaining a close ally of the United States, Seoul seeks to build its strategic network in the Asia-Pacific region by fostering strong defense relationships with countries like Indonesia and Vietnam. This dynamic extends beyond the military sphere, reflecting a realignment of alliances in Asia, where Vietnam and South Korea are consolidating their positions amid increasing geopolitical uncertainties. Ultimately, Vietnam’s procurement of the K9 Thunder is more than just an arms deal. It signifies a strategic shift for Hanoi, which is modernizing its military forces and diversifying its defense partnerships while moving toward equipment compatible with Western standards. For South Korea, this transaction represents a significant step in its ambition to expand its influence in Southeast Asia, reinforcing its role as a leading defense supplier. This growing partnership between the two nations is part of a broader realignment of power dynamics in Asia, where alliances are shifting in response to an increasingly assertive China. The export of the K9 to Vietnam illustrates South Korea’s rising stature as a strategic player in the global defense market while contributing to the reshaping of security relations in the Asia-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/vietnam-selects-south-koreas-k9-thunder-marking-a-strategic-shift-in-military-relations-in-asia	2025-03-07T05:30:51-08:00
