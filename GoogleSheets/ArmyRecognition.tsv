Taiwan deploys new Qingtian hypersonic missile to counter China's growing missile capabilities	On December 28, 2024, the Liberty Times reported that Taiwan had finalized the development of its hypersonic cruise missile, the Qingtian, with a range exceeding 2,000 kilometers. The missile builds on the Yunfeng and Yungeng II programs, originally designed for ranges between 1,200 and 2,000 kilometers. The Qingtian introduces advancements in propulsion, navigation, and guidance technologies, enhancing its range, speed, and operational flexibility. Mass production of the Qingtian began in late 2024, with initial units already delivered to Taiwan’s Air Force missile brigades.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link According to information available, the Qingtian hypersonic missile is based on the earlier Yunfeng and Yungeng II programs, originally designed for ranges between 1,200 and 2,000 kilometers, allowing Taiwan to target strategic locations deep within mainland China. (Picture source: Taiwan MoD) The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) led the Qingtian’s development. The missile incorporates ramjet propulsion and materials capable of withstanding high temperatures during hypersonic flight, supported by the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense’s 'National Defense Advanced Technology Research Plan.' Utilizing composite ceramic materials, the missile can endure the extreme conditions associated with speeds exceeding Mach 6. These attributes enable it to evade air defense systems and extend its operational applications. The Qingtian will be deployed on both fixed-launch systems and mobile platforms, enhancing survivability against potential preemptive strikes. The Czech-made Tatra Force 12X12 trucks, were chosen for their off-road capabilities, adaptability to mountainous terrain, and maneuverability. If Czech procurement encounters difficulties, the American Oshkosh M983 serves as an alternative platform. The adoption of mobile launch platforms represents a shift from previous trailer-mounted systems, aligning with modern military trends favoring self-contained launchers. The Qingtian program builds on decades of work on Taiwan’s long-range strike capabilities, originating with the Yunfeng program under President Lee Teng-hui’s administration. Despite challenges such as technical issues in guidance systems and international restrictions under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the program advanced significantly after key restrictions were eased in 2023. This easing, facilitated by agreements with the United States, provided Taiwan access to critical components for precision guidance and propulsion, enhancing the Qingtian’s accuracy and range. The Qingtian forms part of Taiwan’s broader efforts to bolster deterrence capabilities while maintaining technological independence. The Wanjian air-to-ground missile, with a range of 200 kilometers, recently entered mass production, with a longer-range variant under development. Taiwan’s defense initiatives also include domestic submarine production and research into advanced propulsion technologies, such as scramjet engines for future hypersonic applications. These efforts diversify Taiwan’s missile inventory and address various tactical and strategic requirements. Taiwan’s missile advancements come in response to increasing military pressure from China. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) now fields over 3,000 ballistic missiles, including 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the DF-5, DF-31, and DF-41, which have ranges exceeding 12,000 kilometers. The PLARF also operates 900 short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), 1,300 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), 500 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), and 400 ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs). These systems include dual-use missiles like the DF-26, the DF-17 equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle, and the CJ-100, with a range of 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers. The Qingtian missile, with its range of approximately 2,000 kilometers, can target strategic locations within mainland China. Reports indicate that its reach extends to areas north of Beijing, including Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. This range covers significant political and military centers, including Beijing and other urban and industrial hubs. The deployment of the Qingtian provides Taiwan with the capability to address critical areas within northern China, strengthening its overall defense strategy. Hypersonic missiles, including the Qingtian, challenge existing defense systems due to their speed, maneuverability, and low-altitude flight paths. Traveling at speeds exceeding Mach 5, they reduce response times for interception. Unlike ballistic missiles that follow predictable trajectories, hypersonic systems perform evasive maneuvers, complicating detection and tracking. Their low-altitude profiles further evade radar detection, necessitating advanced interception technologies to counter their threat.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-deploys-new-qingtian-hypersonic-missile-to-counter-chinas-growing-missile-capabilities	2025-01-06T01:33:42-08:00

Iran to Enter Russian Su-35 Fighter Jets into Service by 2025 Strengthening Air Power	Based on a report from the Iran Observer X account on January 4, 2025, Iran is preparing to integrate Russia's cutting-edge Su-35 fighter jets into its air force by 2025. The Sukhoi Su-35, a multirole 4.5-generation fighter, will bolster Iran's aging fleet, significantly enhancing its aerial capabilities. This move follows a growing military partnership between Iran and Russia, especially in light of their close cooperation during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Su-35 fighter jet will enter service with the Iranian Air Force by 2025, enhancing Iran's air power amid growing military cooperation with Russia. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The Russian Su-35 fighter jets deal, which has been in the works for several years, is a key milestone in the evolving defense relations between Iran and Russia. The announcement of this delivery follows earlier reports that Russia would supply these advanced fighter jets to Iran in exchange for Tehran's support in the form of military supplies, notably drones. Satellite imagery has confirmed the construction of special shelters at Iran's 3rd Tactical Air Base near Hamadan, designed to accommodate the Su-35s.While Iranian officials have not confirmed the exact number of Su-35s to be delivered, various reports suggest the first batch could consist of around 24 aircraft. The jets are expected to be in service by 2025, with the potential for further acquisitions in the future. This acquisition marks a substantial upgrade for the Iranian Air Force, which has long struggled with outdated fighter jets. The Su-35, often referred to as the 'Flanker-E,' is one of Russia's most advanced fighter jets. It is a multirole, twin-engine, air superiority aircraft capable of engaging in both aerial combat and ground attack missions. The Su-35 is equipped with a powerful Irbis-E radar, advanced avionics, and the ability to carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. This gives it a significant edge over many of Iran's current aircraft, such as the aging F-4 Phantom and MiG-29 fighters. The Su-35's thrust vectoring engines allow for superior maneuverability in combat, while its long-range radar and ability to engage multiple targets at once make it a formidable opponent. Its advanced electronic warfare capabilities and data fusion systems will also enhance Iran's overall air defense network. Currently, the Iranian Air Force operates a mixed fleet of mostly older jets, many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s. The F-14A Tomcat, acquired before the 1979 revolution, is still a core component of Iran's air force, though it has suffered from technical issues and limited operational readiness. In addition to the F-14s, Iran flies F-4 Phantom IIs, MiG-29s, and Soviet-era Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, all of which are nearing the end of their operational life. Iran's reliance on these older aircraft has made air superiority a challenge, especially in the face of modern, western-supplied aircraft in neighboring countries. The arrival of the Su-35s will provide a much-needed boost to Iran’s air capabilities and help it assert greater control over its airspace. The delivery of Su-35s to Iran is part of a broader shift in military cooperation between the two countries. Iran has been supplying Russia with advanced drones for use in the Ukraine conflict, and in return, Russia has provided Iran with significant military technology. The Su-35 deal is a further sign of the growing strategic alignment between Tehran and Moscow, driven in part by their mutual interests in countering Western influence in the Middle East and the broader region. This partnership comes at a time when Russia is increasingly isolated on the global stage due to its actions in Ukraine, and Iran, too, has faced extensive sanctions. Both nations are turning to each other for defense supplies, with Russia also providing Iran with sophisticated air defense systems like the S-400 and the Tor-M2. Integrating Su-35s into the Iranian Air Force marks a new phase in the country's military modernization. While the acquisition will undoubtedly enhance Iran’s combat capabilities, experts note that the number of Su-35s may still be insufficient to fully rival regional adversaries' air power. However, the strategic value of the jets, combined with Iran’s increasing drone capabilities, suggests that Tehran will be better equipped to deter potential threats and assert its regional ambitions. As Iran continues to strengthen its air capabilities, the implications for regional security will be profound, with neighboring countries likely reassessing their defense postures in light of these developments. The deeper military ties between Iran and Russia may also lead to further arms deals, creating a new dynamic in the Middle East's volatile security environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/iran-to-enter-russian-su-35-fighter-jets-into-service-by-2025-strengthening-air-power	2025-01-05T07:57:46-08:00

This training, which began in mid-2024, was essential to ensuring that Ukrainian personnel are fully equipped to operate, maintain, and repair the French fighter jets. Simultaneously, the deployment of the necessary maintenance infrastructure for the Mirage 2000-5F has already begun, ensuring that the new fighters will be sustained effectively in Ukraine’s current operational environment. The Mirage 2000-5F starkly contrasts the Soviet-era fighter aircraft currently in service with Ukraine, such as the MiG-29 and Su-27. In terms of advanced capabilities, the Mirage 2000-5F is equipped with the Thales RDI (Radar Doppler à Impulsion) radar, a multi-mode radar system that is far more advanced than the Soviet-era radars found in MiG-29s and Su-27s. This radar offers superior long-range detection capabilities and can track multiple targets simultaneously, providing a crucial advantage in modern aerial combat against Russian aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles. In terms of weapon systems, the Mirage 2000-5F is capable of carrying a wider range of modern Western air-to-air missiles, including the MBDA Mica missile, which offers advanced radar and infrared guidance systems. This gives the Mirage 2000-5F a distinct edge in beyond-visual-range combat, a capability that Soviet-era aircraft like the MiG-29 and Su-27 are less equipped to handle. Another significant advantage the Mirage 2000-5F offers over its Soviet-made counterparts is enhanced situational awareness. With a modern digital cockpit and advanced avionics, Mirage 2000-5F pilots are able to process more information in real time, making faster, better-informed decisions during high-pressure combat situations. This enhanced situational awareness will be invaluable for Ukrainian pilots as they engage in fast-moving, high-stakes battles in Ukraine’s contested airspace, where countering Russian fighter jets and air defense systems is critical. The Mirage 2000-5F is also known for its exceptional agility and performance. Lighter and more maneuverable than the heavier MiG-29 and Su-27, the Mirage 2000-5F offers Ukrainian pilots greater precision and flexibility in close combat situations. This advantage will prove vital as they face Russia's fast-moving fighter jets and complex air defense systems. Additionally, the Mirage 2000-5F has an extended operational range, allowing it to conduct deeper strikes into Russian-held territory or provide extended air cover for Ukrainian ground forces, making it more effective in various operational contexts than the MiG-29 and Su-27, which have more limited ranges. The introduction of the Mirage 2000-5F into Ukraine’s air force is not only a boost to its aerial combat capability but also a significant shift in the balance of air power in the region. With its advanced radar, missile systems, and overall performance, the Mirage 2000-5F will give Ukraine a strategic tool to challenge Russia’s aerial dominance in the ongoing conflict. While Ukraine has already received various Western-supplied aircraft, including French-designed Mirages will further complement existing systems and improve interoperability with NATO forces, whose equipment and tactics Ukraine is increasingly adopting. The final delivery of the Mirage 2000-5F is expected to mark another step in the growing military cooperation between France and Ukraine, cementing France's role as a key supporter of Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty. As additional Western support is expected to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities throughout 2025, the arrival of these advanced fighter jets represents a key milestone in Ukraine's efforts to strengthen its military infrastructure in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/breaking-news-france-to-deliver-first-mirage-2000-5f-fighter-jets-to-ukraine-by-march-2025	2025-01-05T07:31:09-08:00

(Picture source: Israeli Defense Forces) The video, released by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), provided exclusive footage and insights into the complexity and success of this high-stakes operation. The target, known as 'Deep Layer,' was a key site in the development and production of precision-guided munitions used by Iranian-backed forces and supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The operation was conducted by an elite Israeli special forces unit, the Shaldag Unit, in coordination with the Israeli Air Force (IAF) and the Israeli Navy. The Shaldag Unit is part of Israel’s air force and specializes in special operations, including counter-terrorism, intelligence gathering, and sabotage missions behind enemy lines. Their role in this mission was vital, as the operation required highly skilled soldiers capable of conducting high-risk covert operations. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The operation, which has now been disclosed to the public, was a joint effort by multiple Israeli military branches, including the elite Shaldag Unit of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), as well as the IAF and Israeli Navy. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The Israeli commandos, numbering approximately 120 soldiers, included a substantial contingent from the Shaldag Unit, an elite air force special operations unit, as well as members from Unit 669, an expert combat search-and-rescue force. The mission’s objective was to destroy the 'Deep Layer' facility, a subterranean complex that had been a critical hub for Iran’s missile production activities in Syria. In the evening hours of September 8, 2024, Israeli forces initiated their covert operation. The target site was located more than 200 kilometers from the Israeli border, deep within Syrian territory and around 45 kilometers from the Syrian coast. The team, comprising 100 Shaldag soldiers and 20 Unit 669 operators, embarked on the mission aboard four large transport helicopters. The operation’s execution was as complex as it was daring. The transport helicopters, along with two additional helicopters providing close air support, made their way across the Mediterranean Sea, skirting Lebanon’s coastline before crossing into Syria. To provide maximum support, the IDF mobilized 21 fighter jets, five drones, and 14 reconnaissance aircraft. The latter, along with additional Israeli aircraft kept in reserve, provided surveillance, air cover, and immediate response capabilities in case the operation encountered unexpected resistance. As the helicopters approached the Syrian coastline, the IDF forces maintained a low altitude flight to avoid detection by Syrian radar and anti-aircraft defenses. The 18-minute flight from the Lebanese coast to the target area was executed under complete secrecy, with additional bombing operations carried out by the IAF and the Israeli Navy to create distractions and mask the movements of the special forces. Upon reaching the facility, the commandos swiftly infiltrated the underground complex and planted explosives to neutralize the target. The mission was executed with precision, and the explosives were detonated in a massive blast that was felt by some soldiers like a 'mini-earthquake.' The entire operation lasted approximately two and a half hours, and it was reported that at least 30 Syrian soldiers guarding the facility were killed during the attack. Remarkably, the operation resulted in no casualties on the Israeli side. None of the Shaldag Special Forces or Unit 669 personnel were injured during the mission, despite the dangerous and high-risk environment they were operating in. The precision of the assault, coupled with the overwhelming air and ground support provided by the Israeli military, ensured that the special forces completed their task without facing significant resistance. The Israeli military confirmed that, following the operation, the 'Deep Layer' facility was rendered non-operational and that Iran had completely withdrawn from Syria after the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The site, once a critical asset in Iran's efforts to supply advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, was no longer in use, marking a significant strategic victory for Israel in its ongoing efforts to counter Iranian influence in the region.

The 'Arkhangelsk' was officially launched on November 29, 2023, and is the 141st nuclear-powered submarine built at Sevmash, a shipbuilding facility under the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC). The design and development of the submarine were spearheaded by the Malachite Design Bureau in St. Petersburg. Four additional Yasen-M submarines—Perm, Ulyanovsk, Voronezh, and Vladivostok—are at various stages of construction and will soon join the fleet. Currently, four Yasen-class submarines, Severodvinsk, Kazan, Novosibirsk, and Krasnoyarsk, are operational within the Russian Navy. The success of the lead submarine, Kazan, during its recent mission to Cuba demonstrated the effectiveness of the Yasen-M class in maintaining Russian naval presence in global waters. Russian submarine Fleet The Russian submarine fleet comprises several categories of submarines, each serving specific roles. Nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines are the backbone of Russia’s strategic deterrent, carrying intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Borei-class, featuring modern designs, quieter propulsion systems, and capable of carrying 16 Bulava ICBMs, represents the latest in this category, while older Delta IV-class submarines provide additional strategic depth. Nuclear-powered attack submarines are designed for hunting enemy submarines and surface ships and can carry cruise missiles for land-attack roles. The Yasen-class is Russia’s most advanced attack submarine, with stealth features and a versatile weapon suite, including Kalibr and Oniks cruise missiles. Other classes, like the Akula and Oscar II, also contribute to this capability, with the latter notable for its anti-ship Granit missiles. Diesel-electric attack submarines, primarily used for coastal defense and littoral operations, are quieter than their nuclear counterparts. The Kilo-class, known for its low acoustic signature, is widely deployed, while the Lada-class represents a new generation of diesel-electric submarines with advanced air-independent propulsion. Russia also operates specialized and auxiliary submarines, such as the Belgorod, a modified Oscar II-class submarine designed to carry the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater drone. The fleet includes smaller submarines for covert missions, underwater cable interference, and seabed research. Strategic deterrence is achieved through regular patrols by ballistic missile submarines in Arctic waters and the North Atlantic, ensuring survivable second-strike capability in the event of a nuclear conflict. Borei-class submarines operate under the protection of the Northern Fleet’s Arctic bastions, leveraging the region’s geographic advantages. Attack submarines, particularly the Yasen-class, bolster Russia’s anti-access/area denial strategy by targeting NATO carrier strike groups and maritime logistics. Diesel-electric submarines, like the Kilo-class, enhance this capability in enclosed seas such as the Baltic. Russian submarines have been used in conflict zones, such as the Eastern Mediterranean during the Syrian Civil War, to launch precision strikes with Kalibr cruise missiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russias-nuclear-submarine-fleet-grows-with-arkhangelsk	2025-01-03T07:42:28-08:00	
Russian Warships Monitored Near UK by HMS Somerset Over Holidays	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 1, 2025, the Royal Navy maintained a vigilant watch over a Russian naval task group passing the British Isles during the Christmas holidays. HMS Somerset, a Type 23 frigate, was mobilized on December 27 after the corvette RFS Soobrazitelny and its support vessels, MV Sparta II and MV General Skobelev, were detected in the North Sea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's HMS Somerset monitors the movements of the Russian corvette RFS Soobrazitelny. (Picture source: UK MoD) The crew of HMS Somerset, recalled from their Christmas leave, swiftly prepared for deployment, leaving Devonport Naval Base to intercept and shadow the Russian vessels.

A Merlin helicopter from 814 Naval Air Squadron, stationed at RNAS Culdrose, provided aerial support during the mission. When weather conditions allowed, the helicopter conducted surveillance and captured imagery of both the Russian ships and HMS Somerset’s operations. Context The Russian shadow fleet represents a covert network of vessels employed by Russia to bypass international sanctions, particularly targeting its oil exports. This fleet has grown substantially following the imposition of sanctions in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, now comprising over 1,100 vessels, including many aging tankers acquired to sustain oil transportation. Operating under flags of convenience from countries with lax maritime regulations and employing opaque ownership structures, the fleet uses deceptive practices such as disabling Automatic Identification Systems, conducting ship-to-ship transfers in remote waters, and falsifying cargo documentation. These activities enable the fleet to obscure the origins and destinations of shipments. The shadow fleet poses significant risks across various domains. Environmentally, its reliance on old and poorly maintained vessels raises the potential for spills and other ecological disasters, as seen in incidents like the December 2024 oil spill in the Black Sea. From a maritime safety perspective, the clandestine nature of its operations, including AIS blackouts, increases the likelihood of collisions and accidents, threatening maritime traffic and coastal communities. There is also a security dimension, as the fleet could be leveraged for military purposes, such as transporting equipment or personnel, heightening concerns among NATO members and other global powers. Efforts to counter the shadow fleet include initiatives by Western nations to disrupt its operations and enforce sanctions more rigorously. However, despite these measures, the fleet continues to operate.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-warships-monitored-near-uk-by-hms-somerset-over-holidays	2025-01-03T06:18:18-08:00

Leaked Document Unveils Russia’s Plans for Targeting Key Sites in Japan and South Korea	Recently leaked Russian military documents have unveiled detailed plans for potential attacks on Japan and South Korea, targeting strategic civilian infrastructure, including nuclear power plants. These files, dated from 2013-2014 and obtained by the Financial Times through Western sources, highlight Moscow’s concerns about the vulnerability of its eastern flank in the event of a conflict with NATO and its Asian allies. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The cache of 29 secret documents reveals how Russia, wary of a coordinated attack by U.S. forces stationed in Japan and South Korea, identified a list of 160 priority targets. These include military facilities such as airbases and naval installations, as well as critical civilian infrastructure like tunnels, bridges, energy complexes, and industrial sites. The documents reflect Moscow’s strategic apprehension over the perceived threat posed by Asia-Pacific allies of the West. In the event of a conflict in Europe, Russia anticipates a 'horizontal escalation,' extending hostilities to Asia to counter or neutralize adversaries potentially supporting a Western offensive. The plans highlight the use of the Kh-101 cruise missile as a key weapon among the scenarios described. This system, designed for precision strikes, was proposed to neutralize key installations in Japan and South Korea. One scenario includes a simulated attack on a Japanese radar base at Okushiritou, featuring detailed assessments of target structures and expected damage. Of the 160 identified targets, 82 are military, such as command centers and radar installations. The remaining targets include critical civilian infrastructure, such as Japan’s Kanmon tunnel and nuclear energy complexes. In South Korea, strategic bridges and major industrial sites, including the Pohang steelworks, were also designated as priorities. The meticulous planning is evident in the precise calculations for damaging heavily fortified facilities in South Korea. These details underscore the depth of Russian preparations for a potential conflict in the region. This revelation emerges at a time when Asia plays a significant role in President Vladimir Putin’s broader strategy. Russia has recently deepened its ties with North Korea, deploying 12,000 North Korean troops to assist its operations in Ukraine and offering economic and military support to Pyongyang. This dynamic underscores Moscow’s view of an intrinsic link between European and Asian theaters of conflict. Experts argue that the plans confirm the interconnected nature of conflicts in Europe and Asia. William Alberque, a former NATO arms control official, emphasized that these documents illustrate the impossibility of Asia remaining unaffected by a European conflict and vice versa. Despite Russia’s confidence in the Kh-101 missiles, their performance during the Ukraine conflict has revealed limitations. Experts note the missiles' lack of stealth against layered air defenses and insufficient accuracy for precision strikes, which is a significant drawback for low-yield munitions reliant on pinpoint targeting. For Japan, these plans present a unique challenge, as the Russian threat is often perceived as secondary by the general public, despite consistent monitoring by the Japanese military. A rapid escalation originating in Europe would leave Tokyo with limited warning time, complicating its defense strategy. The strained relationship between Russia and Japan, further exacerbated by unresolved territorial disputes over the Kuril Islands, adds complexity. While then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed commitment to negotiations on the matter, Russian statements have signaled an uncompromising stance. In South Korea, the documents highlight the vulnerability of critical civilian and industrial infrastructure, such as refineries and chemical plants in Busan, underlining the strategic importance of these targets in a conflict scenario. In addition to attack plans, the documents include reports on Russian bomber flights intended to test the air defenses of the region. One report details a February 2014 mission during the annexation of Crimea, where Tu-95 bombers conducted flights near South Korea and Japan, documenting responses from local air forces. Similar maneuvers, such as Tu-142 flights in 2024, reflect Moscow’s continued efforts to assess and potentially exploit regional vulnerabilities. While these plans from 2013-2014 appear strategically plausible, their feasibility is questionable. The Kh-101 missiles, central to the scenarios, have demonstrated technical limitations, and the evolving geopolitical landscape presents further challenges. There is no public information confirming the modernization of these plans, although Russia's actions, including military flights near Japan, indicate sustained interest in the Asia-Pacific region. In conclusion, the leaked documents offer a rare glimpse into the depth of Russian military planning for potential conflicts in Asia. They highlight Moscow’s concerns over the vulnerability of its eastern borders and the interconnected nature of global conflict theaters. While some capabilities may have been overstated, the revelations underscore the complexity of contemporary geopolitical dynamics and the challenges faced by Japan and South Korea in ensuring their security against multifaceted threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/leaked-document-unveils-russias-plans-for-targeting-key-sites-in-japan-and-south-korea	2025-01-02T05:26:52-08:00

Focus: US-based GA-ASI Develops Gambit New Unmanned Aircraft to Support F-35 & Next-Gen Fighter Operations	The future of air power lies in the seamless integration of manned and unmanned systems, where autonomous unmanned aircraft serve as force multipliers, complementing and augmenting the capabilities of advanced human-crewed fighters. At the forefront of this transformation is General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) with its Gambit advanced unmanned aircraft series, designed to work alongside the most advanced manned aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II and the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link American Company GA-ASI develops the Gambit Autonomous unmanned aircraft to enhance F-35 and Next-Gen fighter operations through collaborative missions. (Picture source: GA-ASI) The central goal of the Gambit family of unmanned aircraft is to pair large numbers of autonomous systems with potent human-piloted fighters, ensuring that future air forces can dominate the battlespace with a combination of magazine depth, sustained situational awareness, and adaptability—all while minimizing risks to human pilots. In the high-stakes, dynamic environment of modern warfare, a pilot in an advanced fighter like the F-35 is faced with increasingly complex missions that demand more than just raw firepower and agility. These pilots need the ability to operate in a more collaborative, multi-dimensional combat environment—where autonomous unmanned aircraft serve as teammates, carrying out critical tasks that increase the overall operational effectiveness of the air force. Here’s how the Gambit series helps fulfill these roles: Magazine Depth and Force Augmentation: One of the most challenging aspects of modern air combat is ensuring that a combat force can sustain offensive and defensive operations. The concept of magazine depth refers to the ability to maintain a continuous supply of munitions and operational capability during prolonged engagements. The Gambit platforms play a pivotal role here by providing unmanned magazine depth—aircraft that can carry additional weapons, sensors, and combat payloads without placing a strain on human pilots. These unmanned systems can provide critical support to human-crewed fighters, including arming, resupply, and additional combat options that extend the reach and lethality of the entire air package. Situational Awareness and Surveillance: The modern battlefield is more congested and contested than ever before. Pilots in F-35s or NGAD systems require constant, real-time intelligence to make critical decisions. The Gambit platforms, particularly models like the Gambit 1, are built for persistent surveillance. By flying in coordinated swarms, these autonomous aircraft can surveil vast stretches of airspace, detect threats, and relay intelligence back to human pilots and other systems in the air and on the ground. The Gambit’s ability to sense, process, and share data autonomously allows human operators to make quicker, more informed decisions while staying one step ahead of adversaries. GA-ASI’s Gambit Series: Four advanced unmanned aircraft variants—Gambit 1 for surveillance, Gambit 2 for combat, Gambit 3 for training, and Gambit 4 for stealth and endurance—designed to collaborate with F-35 and Next-Gen fighters. (Picture source GA-ASI) Evasion and Detection Mitigation: One of the most potent advantages of unmanned systems like the Gambit is their ability to evade detection and operate in high-threat environments without risking human lives. Gambit aircraft, such as the Gambit 4, are designed with advanced low-observable technologies, ensuring that they can operate in contested airspaces, gathering critical information or striking high-value targets, while remaining undetected. By flying in close formation with manned aircraft or operating autonomously, these drones can reduce human pilots' exposure to enemy radar or missile systems, essentially acting as decoys or providing countermeasures. Autonomous Action and Collaboration: The Gambit series is not just about surveillance or force augmentation; these systems can take autonomous action when required. For instance, the Gambit 2 model can engage adversary aircraft in air-to-air combat, acting independently or in concert with other unmanned systems. These aircraft are equipped with AI-driven systems that enable them to make real-time decisions, from evading incoming threats to engaging in offensive actions. When integrated with manned systems, they provide actionable intelligence and can execute predefined combat missions while operating collaboratively and synchronously with human pilots. This autonomy reduces the cognitive load on human pilots, allowing them to focus on the most critical aspects of the mission while knowing that their unmanned teammates are handling key tasks. Whether it's intercepting enemy aircraft, neutralizing surface-to-air threats, or carrying out intelligence collection, Gambit platforms act as an autonomous extension of the pilot’s capabilities, ready to execute orders or respond to changing combat conditions without direct human input. Fulfilling the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) Concept: The Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) concept that GA-ASI and the U.S. Air Force are pushing toward envisions a highly collaborative and scalable force architecture, where human-piloted fighters, such as the F-35 Lightning II, are complemented by large numbers of autonomous unmanned aircraft—like the Gambit series. These unmanned aircraft are designed to work seamlessly with human pilots, forming a collaborative network that dynamically adapts to evolving battlefield conditions. By allowing unmanned aircraft to take on some of the most hazardous and mundane tasks, human pilots are freed up to focus on higher-value operations, knowing their 'teammates' are performing complementary functions. A key advantage of the Gambit series is its cost-effectiveness, allowing the deployment of large numbers of unmanned systems without the prohibitive costs typically associated with fighter jets. This scalability is crucial as future air forces will need to overcome the economic and logistical challenges of maintaining a high number of advanced aircraft, especially given the increasing complexity and expense of cutting-edge fighters like the F-35 and NGAD systems. The Gambit 4 is a combat reconnaissance variant featuring a tail-less design and swept wings. It is optimized for long-endurance, specialized missions, incorporating low-observable technologies and advanced systems to evade enemy detection. (Picture source GA-ASI) By leveraging shared components across the different Gambit models, GA-ASI is able to streamline production and reduce costs, making it feasible to field large numbers of autonomous aircraft that can augment the capabilities of human pilots at a fraction of the cost of a manned fighter. This approach also allows air forces to field a diverse mix of capabilities, ranging from ISR platforms to combat drones, all tailored to specific mission sets, and all operating in concert with human crews. The Gambit family includes a series of variants, each optimized for specific roles in this integrated, collaborative air combat environment. These variants range from Gambit 1, designed primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, to Gambit 2, which is configured for combat and offensive actions. The Gambit 3 is a platform primarily aimed at training, simulating both unmanned and manned systems in realistic air combat scenarios. Finally, the Gambit 4 is the most advanced model, integrating cutting-edge stealth and hybrid-electric propulsion for long-endurance missions and specialized low-observable capabilities. Each model in the Gambit series works in harmony with the others, providing a comprehensive, scalable solution for modern air forces. The Gambit series represents the strategic shift that is already underway in air combat—moving away from the reliance on a few high-end fighters and toward a distributed, collaborative force where both manned and unmanned systems operate in synergy. By pairing human-crewed fighters with autonomous unmanned aircraft, the future air force will achieve new levels of operational flexibility, speed, and effectiveness. This transformation is essential as potential adversaries, like China and Russia, continue to develop advanced air defense systems and aerial platforms. The Gambit series’ ability to operate autonomously in contested environments, while providing human pilots with the necessary support to achieve air dominance, ensures that the U.S. and its allies can maintain an edge in the rapidly changing landscape of aerial warfare. The Gambit series is not just about technology—it’s about rethinking air combat in a way that maximizes the combined power of human decision-making and autonomous systems. With its focus on collaboration, cost-effectiveness, and mission adaptability, the Gambit is poised to be a cornerstone of the future air force, where human pilots work alongside large numbers of unmanned systems to maintain supremacy in the skies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-based-ga-asi-develops-gambit-new-unmanned-aircraft-to-support-f-35-next-gen-fighter-operations	2024-12-31T06:49:28-08:00

The trial validated all aspects of the fueling concept, including the handoff of the lead-line, the connection of the refueling probe to the USV, and the subsequent simulated fuel transfer using water. Conducted entirely on the water, this test demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of the NOMARS FAS system in a real-world scenario. DARPA highlighted the critical support and resources provided by PMS-406 and USVRON-1 as instrumental to the test’s success. This collaboration ensures the FAS system aligns closely with the operational requirements of the U.S. Navy and the Military Sealift Command (MSC). The next phase of the program will test the FAS system on the NOMARS USV Defiant during its sea trials, scheduled to begin in spring 2025. Defiant, a 180-foot, 240-metric-ton autonomous vessel, is designed for long-term, human-free operation. These trials will further validate the system’s performance during extended, multi-month deployments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/darpa-and-us-navy-achieve-milestone-in-autonomous-naval-refueling	2024-12-27T00:44:51-08:00	
Focus | China could dominate the sky with two flying sixth-generation fighter jets as the US struggles to design one	On December 26, 2024, China revealed two sixth-generation combat aircraft prototypes developed independently by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) and Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). Both prototypes conducted their first flights on December 26, 2024. The date coincided with Mao Zedong’s birthday anniversary and the 13th anniversary of the rollout of the J-20 stealth fighter. The public flights are viewed as part of a calculated effort to publicize China’s latest military advancements, coinciding with the launch of the Type 076 Sichuan twin-island assault carrier and the Y-20 AWACS on the same day.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chengdu prototype, on the left, features a trijet, tailless diamond-delta wing configuration, while the Shenyang prototype, on the right, has a twin-engine configuration and incorporates a cranked arrow-wing configuration with what seems to be foldable full-movable vertical stabilizers. (Picture source: Weibo) The Chengdu prototype, known as the Cheng-6 on Chinese social media, features a trijet, tailless flying wing design. Its length is approximately 26 meters, and it employs a diamond-delta wing configuration with extended chine lines. The absence of vertical and horizontal tail surfaces suggests design priorities centered on radar signature reduction and aerodynamic efficiency. This design configuration indicates its potential use in roles requiring long-range missions, high-speed flight, and significant payloads, such as heavy tactical fighter or regional bomber missions. The Cheng-6 was accompanied by a J-20S twin-seat variant during its test flight. The J-20S had previously been speculated upon following a promotional video in 2021 and images released in 2022. It was officially unveiled at the Zhuhai Air Show 2024. This twin-seat variant introduces a rear seat to enable additional mission roles, including electronic suppression, tactical command, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm control. It is equipped with PL-15E and PL-10E missiles, allowing it to perform tasks such as ground strikes and UAV coordination. The twin-seat configuration is intended to distribute operational workload, with one operator focused on tactical roles and the other on sensor management. The J-20S may contribute to the 'loyal wingman' program by directing UAVs for reconnaissance, surveillance, and strike tasks. Once operational, it could influence the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) by introducing networked and data-driven air combat tactics. It is described as the first officially revealed fifth-generation two-seat fighter. The smaller Shenyang prototype, named the Shen-6, has a twin-engine configuration and measures approximately 21 meters in length. It incorporates a cranked arrow-wing configuration with what seems to be foldable full-movable vertical stabilizers. These stabilizers lay flat during cruising, forming a tailless design to enhance stealth and lift-drag efficiency, and rise during maneuvers to create a V-tail configuration for better control. It incorporates diverterless supersonic inlets (DSIs) located below the wing roots. The Shen-6 is likely to use components from other Shenyang aircraft, such as the J-35, as it is the most modern in the range, for example, the avionics and engines. Like the J-35, the Shen-6’s design characteristics indicate it could be suited for multi-role operations, including carrier-based missions. It was accompanied by a Shenyang J-16 fighter during its test flight. Both prototypes prioritize designs to reduce radar and infrared signatures. The Cheng-6’s trijet configuration may enhance performance in high-speed and high-altitude operations, while the Shen-6 employs diverterless supersonic intakes to optimize stealth and aerodynamic efficiency. The prototypes are understood to be in early stages of flight testing, with no high-resolution imagery confirming internal weapon bays. Analysts view the Chengdu and Shenyang prototypes as complementary rather than competitive, with the Chengdu prototype’s design considered consistent with characteristics attributed to the JH-XX tactical fighter-bomber concept, while the Shenyang prototype introduces features aimed at enhancing operational flexibility. Both aircraft align with principles associated with sixth-generation fighter designs, including advanced stealth, integration with unmanned systems, and networked combat capabilities. The Shen-6 could be equipped with foldable full-movable vertical stabilizers. These stabilizers lay flat during cruising, forming a tailless design to enhance stealth and lift-drag efficiency, and rise during maneuvers to create a V-tail configuration for better control. (Picture source: Weibo/伏尔戈星图) Sixth-generation aircraft are generally characterized by their focus on stealth features optimized for reducing radar signatures across multiple frequencies, often employing tailless (for Chengdu) or minimal control surface designs (for Shenyang). These aircraft typically integrate high-performance propulsion systems, such as variable-cycle engines, to enable sustained high-speed cruising and extended range. They are expected to operate optionally manned, with capabilities to function within a networked 'system of systems,' including artificial intelligence, advanced sensors, and data-sharing technologies. Modular payload configurations are anticipated to allow flexibility across roles, including air superiority, ground attack, and electronic warfare. These characteristics aim to address evolving air combat requirements, including survivability and adaptability in contested environments. In June 2024, China also conducted a test flight for a new aviation concept involving a stealth aircraft integrated with two detachable drones. This flight, held at an airport near the Mu Us Desert in Ningxia, showcased a blended wing-body design with delta wings. During the flight, sections of the main aircraft's wings detached, transforming into drones powered by electric ducted fans. The separation process caused shifts in the aircraft's center of gravity and wing area, momentarily affecting stability. However, the aircraft and drones regained stable flight due to the implementation of advanced aerodynamic designs and automated control algorithms. This test flight was characterized as a demonstration of a new approach to integrating manned and unmanned systems for coordinated operations. The system, developed by the Aerospace Technology Institute of the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC), employs a rear-edge docking layout, enabling drones to separate from the trailing edge of the main aircraft's wings. According to CARDC engineer Du Xin, this configuration addresses challenges such as speed mismatches and range limitations between crewed aircraft and drones. The system utilizes the FCC-100 flight control computer from Northwestern Polytechnical University, designed to manage complex calculations and ensure flight stability. The team also employed advanced control algorithms and high-performance components to maintain precision during separation. This design is intended to explore new modes of combat operations, reflecting China's ongoing testing of new next-generation features. Globally, the development of sixth-generation aircraft continues among other major powers. The United States is advancing its sixth-generation fighter development through the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program for the Air Force and the F/A-XX program for the Navy. These projects prioritize advanced stealth features, integration with unmanned systems, and improvements in propulsion technologies. Despite these efforts, budget constraints and evolving priorities have led to discussions about adjusting the scale or timelines of these programs. Europe, meanwhile, is pursuing two collaborative initiatives: the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a partnership between the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan aimed at delivering a next-generation fighter by 2035, and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), a joint effort among France, Germany, and Spain. Both programs focus on integrating advanced technologies such as supersonic performance, virtual reality cockpits, and networked operational capabilities. Russia is in the early stages of conceptualizing its sixth-generation fighter, with a prototype expected by 2050. Efforts are currently directed toward understanding the requirements of future conflicts and technological advancements to inform the design. Sweden's Saab is independently exploring concepts for both manned and unmanned sixth-generation fighters as part of efforts to develop next-generation platforms for its armed forces. In India, the primary focus remains the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a fifth-generation project, though there is interest in exploring sixth-generation technologies. At this stage, no official sixth-generation program has been announced in India. These programs collectively reflect global efforts to address future air combat needs through advanced fighter technologies. China's recent test flights of two new sixth-generation stealth fighter jets, the Cheng-6 and Shen-6, show that Chinese programs are much more advanced than previously thought. In a potential conflict with the United States, likely for Taiwan, China could potentially deploy these advanced stealth aircraft designed to evade known detection systems and challenge traditional U.S. air superiority. This fact may prompt the United States to reevaluate its strategic priorities by continuing to develop fighter jets, even though some say they are outdated, to maintain a competitive edge. The Shen-6's general design could be influenced by these earlier fighter designs from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre.

Defense Investigation: What is the Possible Cause Behind Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 Crash Near Aktau?	Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243, which tragically crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on December 25, 2024, may have been struck by a missile fired from a Russian air defense system, according to preliminary findings from aviation investigators. Although the exact details of the missile’s origin are still under investigation, information from multiple sources, including government and military experts, suggest the involvement of a surface-to-air missile, possibly launched from a Pantsir-S1 air defense missiles/cannons system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from video footage showing the moment of the crash of Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on December 25, 2024. (Video footage Social Network Screenshot) The incident occurred when Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 was operating a scheduled commercial flight from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny, Russia, with a stopover in Aktau, Kazakhstan. The Boeing 737-800, carrying 122 passengers and crew members, departed from Baku at 03:55 UTC. Everything appeared normal until the flight lost contact at 04:25 UTC, shortly after entering Kazakh airspace. At 04:37 UTC, some erroneous data was transmitted from the aircraft before contact was entirely lost. The wreckage was later found about 50 kilometers south of Aktau, near the Caspian Sea. Sadly, all on board perished in the crash. Initial analysis of the aircraft’s flight data, particularly the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data, provides important clues regarding the crash. The flight took off from Baku on schedule and transmitted valid ADS-B data until 04:25 UTC, indicating that the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and speed. However, after this time, significant GPS interference was detected, leading to a temporary loss of positional data. Between 04:25 and 04:37 UTC, the aircraft ceased transmitting positional data altogether, a highly unusual occurrence. During this period, it is believed that the aircraft may have suffered external damage, likely due to a missile strike, which could have compromised its ability to transmit accurate position information. Following this gap in data transmission, between 04:37 and 04:40 UTC, the aircraft transmitted likely erroneous ADS-B data. The information sent during this period was inconsistent, with fluctuating altitude and ground speed figures, which suggests that the aircraft was struggling with severe control issues. After a 36-minute gap, ADS-B data resumed at 05:13 UTC, revealing highly irregular flight characteristics. The data indicated variable altitude fluctuations of ±2,438 meters (approximately ±8,000 feet) and erratic ground speeds and vertical rate values. These irregularities point to catastrophic damage to the aircraft, likely caused by the missile strike, which caused the aircraft to lose control. The missile that struck Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 is believed to have been a Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile, a Russian-made air defense system. Although the exact missile used remains under investigation, multiple sources point to the involvement of Russian military assets in the region. According to AnewZ, an international news outlet based in Baku, Azerbaijani government sources have suggested that the missile was fired from a Pantsir-S1 air defense missiles/cannons system, which is known to be in operation by Russian military forces. While this information has not been independently confirmed, the Pantsir-S system is widely used by Russia for its advanced anti-aircraft capabilities, and it would be capable of striking targets at the altitude and speed at which the Boeing 737-800 was flying. Forensic analysis of the wreckage has revealed damage patterns consistent with a missile strike. The tail section and wing of the aircraft suffered significant damage, which matches the impact characteristics of a high-velocity missile. Additionally, missile fragments recovered from the crash site appear to resemble components from a Pantsir-S missile system. Satellite imagery and radar tracking from international agencies have confirmed the presence of Russian air defense systems near the Caspian coast around the time of the incident. The missile’s trajectory and launch point remain under investigation, but it is widely suspected that the strike originated from Russian-controlled territory or a nearby military base. Local witnesses along the coast of Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea reported seeing a bright flash in the sky and hearing an explosion shortly before the aircraft’s descent. These reports align with the likely timing of the missile impact, further corroborating the missile strike theory. The post-impact ADS-B data showing oscillating altitude, variable ground speed, and vertical rate values suggests that the aircraft experienced severe structural damage or control system failures consistent with a missile strike. These abnormalities further support the idea that an external force—such as a missile—caused the aircraft to lose control. The ongoing investigation is exploring several theories about the origins of the missile strike. One plausible explanation is that the missile was launched during a routine Russian military exercise in the region, potentially as a result of a mistake or misidentification. The proximity of the crash site to Russian-controlled areas raises the possibility that the aircraft was mistakenly identified as a military target. Given the high level of military activity in the region and Russia’s heightened state of readiness, there is a possibility that the aircraft was misidentified as a hostile target. If the missile was fired as a defensive measure against a perceived threat, this would be an error in judgment, likely exacerbated by the complex geopolitical environment. While less likely, there remains a possibility that the missile strike was not an accident but a deliberate action, perhaps linked to broader regional tensions. Russia and Azerbaijan have had some political differences in recent years, though this theory remains speculative and would require more concrete evidence. As is often the case with high-profile incidents, the Azerbaijan Airlines crash has been accompanied by a wave of speculation, some of which has strayed far from the facts. Reports suggesting that third-party actors or local militants were responsible for the missile strike have been debunked, as no credible evidence has been presented to support these claims. Given the complex nature of this tragedy and the sensitive political implications, it is important to rely on verified information from credible sources. Speculation or misinformation can hinder the investigation and distract from the critical task of determining the exact cause of the crash. While the preliminary findings point to a Russian-made missile, likely launched from a Pantsir-S air defense system, the investigation is far from complete. Additional forensic analysis, further satellite data, and expert reviews of the flight’s black boxes will be essential to confirm the exact missile system involved and to piece together the events leading up to the crash. As the investigation progresses, international authorities—including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia—will need to cooperate closely to ensure transparency and accountability. The final findings will likely have significant implications for both aviation safety and regional geopolitics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/defense-investigation-what-is-the-possible-cause-behind-azerbaijan-airlines-flight-j28243-crash-near-aktau	2024-12-26T08:02:17-08:00	
North Korea joins Russian naval exercises as observer for the first time	On December 18, 2024, General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, confirmed that North Korea participated as an observer in the 'Ocean-2024' naval exercises. This marked the first time North Korea attended such an exercise in this capacity. The drills, which took place from September 10 to 16, 2024, were the largest naval exercises conducted by Russia in over 30 years. They involved Russian naval forces and Aerospace Forces, with operations conducted in the Pacific, Arctic, Mediterranean, Caspian, and Baltic regions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Amnok-class Patrol Ship No. 661 frigate, one of the most modern vessels in the North Korean Navy, is allegedly built on a Krivak-class hull and is equipped with 8 KN-19 anti-ship missiles, 6 FN-6 SAM missiles, a 76mm gun, 2 AK-230 anti-air guns, 4 533mm torpedoes, and 4 RBU-1200 anti-submarine rocket launchers. (Picture source: KCNA) Over 90,000 personnel participated in the Ocean-2024 exercise, along with more than 400 warships, submarines, and auxiliary vessels, 120 aircraft and helicopters, and approximately 7,000 units of military and special equipment. The main objectives of the exercise included testing the readiness of Russia's Navy and Aerospace Forces, evaluating command and control systems, and assessing operational cohesion in conditions simulating large-scale military aggression. During the drills, activities included defending naval bases, combating unmanned systems, conducting amphibious landings, and protecting convoys. In addition to North Korea, 14 other countries were present as observers, including Vietnam, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. Observer status allowed these countries to monitor the exercises without directly participating. President Vladimir Putin participated in the opening of the active phase via videoconference, highlighting the drills' role in evaluating combat readiness, integrating modern weapons, and emphasizing maritime and aerospace capabilities. The exercise also saw coordinated actions with Chinese forces, which contributed naval assets such as the Type 055 destroyer Wuxi, Type 052D destroyer Xining, Type 054A frigate Linyi, and the fleet oiler Taihu, supported by 15 aircraft. The exercise unfolded in two stages: the first involved force deployment and operational planning, while the second included targeting strategically important objectives, defending critical maritime infrastructure, and utilizing unmanned reconnaissance and strike platforms. Russian and Chinese forces coordinated actions in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, focusing on security coordination in the Pacific region. The 'Ocean-2024' exercises emphasized adapting to emerging maritime challenges, including countering unmanned systems and electronic warfare. Russian forces also tested long-range strike capabilities and practiced defense against simulated NATO-style operations. The drills made use of all available naval resources not actively engaged in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. North Korea’s involvement reflects its growing military cooperation with Russia. In recent months, North Korea has reportedly provided munitions and personnel to assist Russia in its military operations. The two countries also formalized a defense agreement in November 2024, committing to mutual support in the event of external aggression. North Korea’s navy, part of the Korean People’s Army, operates approximately 780 vessels, including submarines, missile boats, corvettes, and support ships, with an estimated 60,000 personnel. The navy’s two fleets, the Eastern Fleet based in Wonsan and the Western Fleet headquartered in Nampo, focus on coastal defense and supporting ground operations. The North Korean Navy has been involved in incidents such as the 1968 capture of the USS Pueblo and continues to serve as a key component of North Korea’s defense strategy. The fleet's capabilities in sea control, surveillance, and anti-submarine warfare are limited, with a primary focus on the coastal zone. The timing of the 'Ocean-2024' exercises coincided with increasing military activities by NATO and U.S. forces near Russia’s borders, which Russian officials view as a challenge to regional security. These drills were presented as a response to NATO's expansion in northern Europe and the Arctic. General Gerasimov confirmed that large-scale exercises will continue, with the 'Zapad-2025' joint exercise with Belarus planned for the following year. This reflects Russia’s ongoing focus on joint operations and enhancing military readiness in response to global security developments. Russia’s military relations with North Korea have become more strategic, particularly following the signing of the North Korean–Russian Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in June 2024. This treaty includes a mutual defense clause, obligating both nations to provide military assistance if either is attacked. North Korea has reportedly supplied artillery shells and rockets to Russia for its operations in Ukraine. Additionally, over 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia, with over 3,000 casualties reported. These developments highlight the deepening military relationship between the two countries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/north-korea-joins-russian-naval-exercises-as-observer-for-the-first-time	2024-12-26T07:26:36-08:00	
US Coast Guard acquires first polar icebreaker in 25 years to fill critical Arctic sovereignty gap	On December 23, 2024, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) officially acquired the Aiviq, a 360-foot Polar Class 3-equivalent icebreaker, marking the first addition to its icebreaking fleet in over 25 years. Built in 2012, the vessel was purchased for $125 million under a fixed-price contract with Offshore Surface Vessels LLC. The Aiviq will be renamed USCGC Storis (WAGB-21) and is expected to enter Coast Guard service in 2026 following modifications.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Currently, the US Coast Guard's fleet includes two operational icebreakers: the Polar Star, a heavy icebreaker nearing 50 years of service, and the Healy, a medium icebreaker sidelined earlier this year due to an electrical fire. (Picture source: USCG) The acquisition of the Aiviq addresses a gap in the Coast Guard’s polar capabilities. Currently, the fleet includes two operational icebreakers: the Polar Star, a heavy icebreaker nearing 50 years of service, and the Healy, a medium icebreaker sidelined earlier this year due to an electrical fire. Increased activity in the Arctic, such as joint Russian-Chinese patrols near Alaska, has underscored the need for additional icebreaking assets to support U.S. sovereignty and security in the region. The vessel will undergo limited modifications before commissioning, including repainting the hull red and labeling it as WAGB-21. It will be assessed further for full operational capability in alignment with Coast Guard standards. This new purchase does not alter the Coast Guard’s ongoing plans to develop a fleet of eight to nine polar icebreakers. The PSC program, managed by Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding, has faced delays, with the first vessel, Polar Sentinel, now projected for delivery by 2030. The Coast Guard has cited challenges related to the specialized requirements for constructing heavy icebreakers, which have not been built in U.S. shipyards for nearly 50 years. As a bridging measure, the Aiviq will provide limited icebreaking and operational support until the PSC fleet becomes operational. For now, this new icebreaker will provide interim capabilities while the US Coast Guard awaits the delayed Polar Security Cutter (PSC) fleet. Once operational, the vessel will be permanently homeported in Juneau, Alaska, pending the completion of necessary infrastructure improvements. The Aiviq was originally constructed by Edison Chouest Offshore in Louisiana to support oil exploration in the Arctic. It is equipped for icebreaking and anchor-handling operations, featuring ABS A3 classification, which allows for navigation in polar ice, including multiyear ice floes. Its propulsion system includes four Caterpillar C280-12 engines, enabling speeds of up to 15 knots in open water and 5 knots in 1-meter-thick ice. The vessel is also equipped with a helideck, controllable-pitch propellers, and dynamic positioning capabilities. Its design includes accommodations for 64 personnel and a bollard pull capacity of 200 metric tons. Since its construction, the vessel has conducted Arctic and Antarctic missions, including oil spill response and refueling operations. The decision to name the vessel Storis reflects the Coast Guard's tradition of selecting meaningful names from multiple proposals. The name honors the original USCGC Storis (WMEC-38), a cutter that served from 1942 to 2007. The original Storis was notable for conducting Arctic patrols, facilitating the first American transit of the Northwest Passage, and operating as the oldest commissioned cutter in the Coast Guard's fleet at the time of its decommissioning. It also participated in key missions such as responding to the 1964 Alaska earthquake and conducting search and rescue operations, including the 1990 rescue of the M/V Alaskan Monarch. The initial crew for the Storis will consist of approximately 60 officers and enlisted personnel, who are expected to begin assignments in 2025. Temporary homeporting arrangements are being evaluated until the Juneau infrastructure is completed. The acquisition was facilitated by the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 and fiscal year 2024 appropriations, which allocated funding for the purchase. This action aligns with the Coast Guard’s broader strategy to address Arctic operational requirements while maintaining flexibility in its long-term procurement goals. The Arctic region is experiencing increased geopolitical activity driven by climate change, which has made its waters more accessible and economically significant. Russia, with a fleet of over 40 icebreakers, including nuclear-powered vessels, has emphasized year-round navigation along the Northern Sea Route to enhance its strategic and commercial interests. China, identifying itself as a 'near-Arctic state,' is building icebreakers and collaborating with Russia on Arctic shipping developments, such as the 'Ice Silk Road.' In response, nations like the United States, Canada, and Finland have initiated cooperative measures under the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE Pact) to strengthen their icebreaking capabilities and address the presence of other major powers. The focus on icebreaker development reflects the necessity of these vessels in ensuring safe navigation, supporting territorial and resource claims, and adapting to the evolving dynamics of the Arctic.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-coast-guard-acquires-first-polar-icebreaker-in-25-years-to-fill-critical-arctic-sovereignty-gap	2024-12-26T07:09:48-08:00	
Israel to expand production of Arrow-3 air defense missiles due to growing missile threats	On December 24, 2024, the Israel Ministry of Defense announced the expansion of its Arrow 3 interceptor procurement program through a multi-billion-shekel contract with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). The agreement, signed by Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Ministry, aims to address increased missile threats, particularly from the Houthi movement in Yemen, by replenishing and expanding existing stockpiles of Arrow 3 systems. Recent events, such as missile launches targeting Eilat and the Dan Bloc, have underscored the system's operational use.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Arrow program, initiated in 1986, includes two primary interceptors: the Arrow-2, for atmospheric interception, and the Arrow 3, designed to engage threats in the exo-atmospheric phase of their trajectory. (Picture source: IAI) The signing ceremony was conducted at the Ministry of Defense headquarters in Tel Aviv, with the participation of senior officials, including Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Dr. Daniel Gold, Head of DDR&amp;D; Moshe Patel, Director of IMDO; Boaz Levy, CEO of IAI; and CPA Dekel Cohen, Head of the Ministry’s Finance Department. The specific value of the contract, managed by the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) under the Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&amp;D), and the number of interceptors to be delivered have not been disclosed, citing security concerns. However, each interceptor is estimated to cost approximately $4 million. The ballistic missile threat against Israel has significantly increased, particularly from the Houthi movement in Yemen. Recent attacks involved ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli territories, including urban areas. These incidents have resulted in injuries and infrastructure damage. In response, Israel has launched airstrikes on Houthi positions and called for the international community to label the Houthis as a terrorist organization. Israel has also indicated potential measures to target Houthi leadership, emphasizing the connection between these attacks and broader regional dynamics involving Iranian support for allied groups. The Arrow program, initiated by the Missile and Space Systems Division of IAI in 1986, became operational in 2000. It includes two primary interceptors: the Arrow-2, for atmospheric interception, and the Arrow 3, designed to engage threats in the exo-atmospheric phase of their trajectory. The Arrow 3 system is one component of Israel’s multi-layered defense framework, which also includes the Iron Dome and David’s Sling systems. The Arrow 3 is engineered to intercept ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, outside the Earth’s atmosphere. The system features a two-stage engine, a gimbaled seeker providing hemispheric coverage, and thrust vectoring for maneuverability. It operates with a maximum reported range of 2,400 kilometers and can engage threats at altitudes exceeding 100 kilometers. Using hit-to-kill technology, the system can intercept multiple ballistic missiles within 30 seconds. It is launched from fortified underground silos and has the capacity to be deployed into space, potentially providing anti-satellite capabilities. Since becoming operational in 2017, the Arrow 3 system has been used in multiple scenarios. Its first operational use occurred on November 9, 2023, when it intercepted a Houthi missile near Eilat. During the 2024 Iran-Israel conflict and Red Sea crisis, the system intercepted multiple Houthi missiles, including those launched on September 14 and September 28, 2024. The system’s design allows it to handle salvos of more than five missiles within a short engagement window. The Arrow program is funded jointly by Israel and the United States. Germany is set to acquire the system under the European Sky Shield Initiative as part of a $3.5 billion procurement approved by the Bundestag in June 2023 and the United States in August 2023. Deliveries are scheduled to enable operational capability in Germany by 2025. This acquisition marks the largest defense procurement in Israel’s history. Additionally, Azerbaijan evaluated the Arrow 3 system in 2021 as a potential purchase during a period of heightened tension with Iran.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-to-expand-production-of-arrow-3-air-defense-missiles-due-to-growing-missile-threats	2024-12-26T06:59:15-08:00	
Israel strengthens ties with Europe as Slovakia officially purchases Barak MX air defense missile systems	As announced by the Israeli Ministry of Defense on December 23, 2024, Slovakia officially purchased the Barak MX air defense missile system, allowing Israel to further strengthen ties with Europe. Valued at €560 million ($583 million), this acquisition represents the largest defense export deal between Israel and Slovakia. The Barak MX, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), is designed to counter diverse aerial threats such as ballistic missiles, UAVs, helicopters, cruise missiles, and fighter jets, marking a significant step in Slovakia’s efforts to modernize its air defense capabilities and replace its outdated 2K12 Kub air defense systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Israeli Barak MX air defense missile system offers a wide range of capabilities through its three types of interceptors, which cover ranges of 35 km, 70 km, and 150 km. (Picture source: IAI) Under the terms of the agreement, Slovakia will receive six batteries of the Israeli Barak MX surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, with deliveries scheduled to begin by the end of 2025. The deal also includes training, technical documentation, simulators, tools, spare parts, and a two-year warranty. Furthermore, local production provisions in the agreement will enable Slovakia to manufacture certain system components domestically. This initiative involves local industries in the supply chain, particularly through the production of Barak MX missiles, and addresses the limitations of the aging 2K12 Kub systems. Introduced between 1978 and 1983, these legacy systems are no longer operationally viable due to outdated technology and a lack of spare parts. The decision to procure the Barak MX followed a thorough evaluation process initiated in May 2023 by Slovakia’s Ministry of Defense. Competing systems included Rafael’s Spyder, Diehl Defence’s IRIS-T SLM, and MBDA’s VL MICA. The Barak MX received the highest evaluation score, achieving a 95% overall assessment based on its technical capabilities, lifecycle costs, delivery timelines, and industry involvement. Its flexibility—offering both stationary and mobile configurations—was another critical factor in its selection. To complement the Barak MX, Slovakia has also approved the acquisition of 36 Polish Piorun MANPADS for €66 million. These portable systems, derived from the Soviet-era 9K38 Igla, feature upgrades such as a proximity fuse to enhance their effectiveness against UAVs and other aerial threats. With a range of up to 6 km and the ability to engage targets at altitudes between 10 m and 4 km, the Piorun system was selected for its affordability, compatibility with existing systems, and capacity to provide three times the number of launchers compared to competitors. Together, the Barak MX and Piorun aim to replace Slovakia’s Soviet-era 2K12 Kub systems, offering comprehensive protection for both strategic and civilian targets by addressing mid- to long-range threats and short-range aerial defense, respectively. The Barak MX system itself offers advanced capabilities through its three types of interceptors, which cover ranges of 35 km, 70 km, and 150 km. Its dual-pulse rocket motors, active radar seekers, and modular architecture enable integration with various sensors and management systems, ensuring NATO compatibility. This adaptability supports its use in both land-based and naval deployments. Additionally, its robust data link connects launchers, capable of carrying up to eight missiles each, to the Barak Battle Management Center, enabling multi-target engagement and updates to counter evolving threats. Slovakia’s modernization efforts extend beyond air defense. A joint procurement initiative with the Czech Republic aims to replace outdated military vehicles with 1,307 new transport trucks, slated for delivery between 2025 and 2031. Complementing this, Slovakia has approved the purchase of 5,000 US-made M4A1 rifles through the Foreign Military Financing program and continues to procure radar systems and tactical drones from Israeli manufacturers. Therefore, this new agreement with Israel underscores the strengthening defense partnership between the two nations, with recent acquisitions including an agreement to acquire 17 Israeli-made 3D air defense radar systems for approximately €148.2 million in 2021, followed by another agreement in 2022 for approximately 100 Spike LR2 anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). Despite ongoing regional conflicts, Israel's defense exports have seen significant growth, reaching $13 billion in 2023—nearly double the figures from five years prior. The Defense Export Control Agency (DECA) has issued 13,497 marketing licenses and 5,677 export licenses since October 2023. While some European nations, such as France, impose restrictions on Israeli defense industry participation, agreements like Slovakia’s highlight a growing demand for Israeli systems in Europe. Recent procurements by Germany (Arrow) and Finland (David’s Sling) further reflect this trend, driven by the operational performance of Israeli systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-strengthens-ties-with-europe-as-slovakia-officially-purchases-barak-mx-air-defense-missile-systems-4	2024-12-26T04:51:54-08:00	
Morocco eyes Chinese L-15 Falcon light attack aircraft to replace aging Alpha Jet fleet	According to Le Desk on December 25, 2024, Morocco's Royal Air Force is considering the Chinese L-15 Falcon light attack aircraft as a potential replacement for its fleet of Alpha Jets trainers. This evaluation aligns with Morocco’s efforts to modernize its defense capabilities while diversifying its military partnerships. The Alpha Jet, developed jointly by Dassault Aviation of France and Dornier Flugzeugwerke of Germany, has been in service since the late 1970s and has primarily been used for training and light attack roles. However, the Alpha Jet’s aging design no longer meets the requirements of modern military operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hongdu JL-10, also known as L-15 Falcon, has been exported to countries such as Zambia, which purchased six L-15Z units in 2014 for $100 million, and the United Arab Emirates, which ordered 12 units in 2022 with an option for 36 additional aircraft. (Picture source: Twitter/DS北风（风哥）) Morocco acquired 24 Alpha Jets between 1979 and 1981 to enhance its air force’s training and light attack capabilities. These aircraft were assigned to a training squadron and a counterinsurgency unit in Meknes. During the Western Sahara conflict, they were deployed in missions targeting Polisario Front positions. While the Alpha Jets fulfilled these roles, their subsonic performance, limited avionics, and lack of modern systems are now seen as inadequate. The Alpha Jet is equipped with two SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac turbofan engines and can carry up to 2,500 kilograms of armament across five hardpoints. Initially designed for subsonic training and close air support, its capabilities are now considered outdated in the context of current military needs. The L-15 Falcon, developed by Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation (HAIC), offers several features not present in the Alpha Jet. First flown in 2006 and introduced in 2013, the aircraft was developed with technical assistance from the Yakovlev Design Bureau in Russia. Its propulsion system includes AI-222K-25F turbofan engines, which incorporate Ukrainian technology. The L-15B variant can reach speeds of up to Mach 1.4. The aircraft includes nine hardpoints capable of carrying a maximum payload of 3,500 kilograms, accommodating munitions such as SD-10 and PL-8 air-to-air missiles, as well as LS-6 satellite-guided bombs. It also incorporates fly-by-wire controls, a Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar, and a glass cockpit, supporting its role in preparing pilots for advanced fighter aircraft. The L-15’s service life is estimated at 10,000 hours, and its design includes 25% composite materials to reduce weight and enhance durability. The L-15 has multiple operational variants, including subsonic and carrier-compatible models. It has been exported to countries such as Zambia, which purchased six L-15Z units in 2014 for $100 million, and the United Arab Emirates, which ordered 12 units in 2022 with an option for 36 additional aircraft. Other countries, including Pakistan and Ukraine, have shown interest in the platform. In China, the L-15 is used by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force and Navy for training pilots for fourth- and fifth-generation fighter aircraft as Hongdu JL-10. Morocco’s potential interest in the L-15 follows its acquisition of other Chinese defense systems, including the FD-2000B long-range air defense system, AR2 multiple rocket launchers, HJ-9A anti-tank missile systems, and Wing Loong 2 drones. This marks a shift from Morocco’s traditional reliance on Western suppliers. The L-15, if acquired, would be part of a broader defense modernization program aimed at updating and diversifying Morocco’s military equipment. Morocco and China have also expanded their political and economic ties. In January 2022, the two nations signed a Belt and Road Initiative implementation plan, making Morocco the first North African country to establish such comprehensive cooperation. Chinese investments in Morocco include infrastructure projects and initiatives in the electric vehicle battery sector. Morocco has affirmed its support for the One China policy, while China has expressed alignment with Morocco’s stance on the Western Sahara issue, strengthening bilateral relations. If the Royal Air Force opts for the L-15 Falcon, the decision would signify the introduction of a more modern and capable platform to replace the Alpha Jet. This move would reflect Morocco's commitment to meeting evolving operational needs and its efforts to diversify its defense partnerships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/morocco-eyes-chinese-l-15-falcon-light-attack-aircraft-to-replace-aging-alpha-jet-fleet	2024-12-26T02:53:46-08:00

First, the MICA missiles, combined with the Mirage 2000-5F’s radar and avionics, will allow Ukraine to challenge Russian aircraft more effectively, potentially altering the balance of power in the air. The ability to intercept Russian jets and protect Ukrainian airspace will be a decisive factor in mitigating Russia’s aerial advantage. Second, with the SCALP-EG cruise missile and AASM Hammer bombs, the Mirage 2000-5F gives Ukraine the means to strike high-value targets deep within Russian-controlled territory. This will enhance Ukraine’s ability to degrade Russia’s military logistics, command centers, and air defenses. Moreover, the Mirage 2000-5F’s multirole nature makes it adaptable to a wide range of missions, from air-to-air combat to ground strikes. This operational flexibility will be invaluable in supporting Ukraine’s shifting battlefronts and dynamic military strategies. Finally, the delivery of these fighters underscores the continued international support for Ukraine, particularly from Western nations like France. This support is not only militarily significant but also serves as a powerful message to Russia, highlighting the continued unity of Western allies in backing Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. With the French Mirage 2000-5F jets entering service, Ukraine is poised to bolster its aerial capabilities significantly. The introduction of these advanced platforms is expected to be a game-changer, particularly as Ukraine continues to defend its airspace from Russian strikes and seeks to reassert control over occupied territories. As the conflict evolves, further support from NATO allies, including additional fighter jets, air defense systems, and weapons, will likely be key in maintaining Ukraine's military momentum. The Mirage 2000-5F is expected to play a crucial role in Ukraine’s future air operations, and military analysts and defense experts worldwide will closely watch its integration into the Ukrainian Air Force. As these aircraft take to the skies in the coming weeks, their performance will be a critical factor in the ongoing battle for air supremacy over Ukraine, further cementing the importance of international military support in Ukraine’s fight for survival and sovereignty.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-french-mirage-2000-5f-fighter-jets-set-to-join-ukrainian-air-force-in-the-coming-weeks	2024-12-26T02:45:23-08:00

Japan Plans Historic $734 Billion Defense Budget for 2025 Nearing US Spending Levels	Japan is set to approve a record $734 billion (¥115.5 trillion) budget for fiscal 2025, surpassing the previous $727 billion (¥114.38 trillion) budget for 2023, according to a report by Kyodo News on December 25, 2024. While a significant portion will be allocated to defense and social security, Japan's growing defense spending remains much smaller than the U.S. defense budget, which exceeds $800 billion. Despite this, rising costs of defense and debt servicing continue to put pressure on Japan's public finances.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan's Self-Defense Forces: A highly trained and disciplined force of over 250,000 personnel focused on regional security and defense readiness. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Japan's record $734 billion defense budget for fiscal 2025 places it among the top global defense spenders, although it remains significantly smaller than that of the United States, which allocates over $800 billion annually for defense—more than any other country. The U.S. military budget represents a substantial portion of global defense expenditure and supports its extensive global military presence, technological superiority, and advanced defense systems. In comparison, China's defense budget, the second-largest globally, is estimated at around $290 billion, a figure that has been growing rapidly in recent years due to its expanding military capabilities. Russia's defense spending is considerably smaller, at approximately $144 billion, reflecting its economic constraints despite military aggressions in Ukraine and broader security concerns. France, as one of the major European defense powers, spends about $70 billion annually, prioritizing both national defense and its commitments within NATO. Japan’s defense budget, while still smaller than these nations, is notably rising in response to regional security challenges, particularly from China and North Korea, and is set to reach 2% of GDP by 2027, aligning more closely with NATO standards. The new budget reflects Japan's strategic shift toward bolstering its defense capabilities in the face of evolving regional threats and a deteriorating global security landscape. Defense spending is expected to see a substantial increase as part of the country’s broader efforts to enhance its military readiness and deterrence capabilities. The fiscal 2025 defense budget is poised to continue a trend of sharp increases that began with Japan's defense policy overhaul in late 2022. In December 2022, Japan unveiled a new National Security Strategy that calls for the country to double its defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, aligning with the NATO standard for military expenditure. This move comes amid growing concerns over the security situation in East Asia, where Japan faces numerous threats from neighboring countries. One of the most pressing concerns for Japan is the increasing military assertiveness of China. Beijing’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, coupled with its rapid military modernization, has raised alarm bells in Tokyo. The Chinese military’s activities around Taiwan, its expansion in the South China Sea, and its development of advanced weaponry, including hypersonic missiles, have placed Japan on high alert. Japan's proximity to China, along with its long-standing security alliance with the United States, underscores the need for enhanced defense capabilities. Japanese policymakers are particularly concerned about China’s increasing naval presence and its growing ability to challenge U.S. forces in the Pacific, which could potentially threaten Japan’s security. Another significant factor driving Japan's defense spending is the continued missile and nuclear threats posed by North Korea. Despite various rounds of sanctions, North Korea has consistently conducted missile tests and pursued the development of nuclear weapons, which directly threatens Japan's safety. The unpredictability of the North Korean regime, led by Kim Jong-un, remains a key challenge for regional stability. Japan has been increasingly focused on missile defense systems, such as the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and the ground-based PAC-3 systems, to counter North Korea's missile threats. Moreover, Japan has been working closely with the U.S. to improve deterrence capabilities and ensure a swift response to any provocations from Pyongyang. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Japan has also raised its defense concerns about Russia's activities in the Pacific. Russia’s ongoing military exercises in the Far East, including naval deployments near Japan's exclusive economic zone, have added an additional layer of anxiety. Japan’s northern territories, which are disputed with Russia, further complicate the situation, necessitating a heightened defense posture. While Japan has committed to strengthening its defense capabilities, the nation faces significant challenges in balancing military spending with social security needs and debt management. The Japanese population is aging rapidly, with a growing elderly demographic that places increasing pressure on the country’s pension and healthcare systems. The combination of rising social security demands, ballooning defense costs, and high debt-servicing obligations (which account for a large portion of the national budget) presents a complex fiscal challenge. Japan’s public debt, which stands at more than 250% of GDP, is one of the highest in the world. Servicing this debt, particularly amid global interest rate hikes, will continue to take a large portion of the national budget. Tax revenues are projected to reach a record high of ¥78.4 trillion for fiscal 2025, but even this increase may not be enough to cover the surging costs of defense, social security, and debt servicing. To address these fiscal pressures, the Japanese government is expected to look for ways to streamline public spending, but with the security environment in East Asia deteriorating, defense spending will remain a priority. The record-setting budget for fiscal 2025 is not an isolated development but part of a broader trend toward defense modernization in Japan. Key components of Japan’s long-term defense strategy include increased investment in advanced technology, such as cyber defense, space capabilities, and missile defense systems. Japan is focusing on cutting-edge technologies and plans to invest in a new fleet of fighter jets and advanced surveillance systems. Japan continues to strengthen its defense ties with the U.S. and other Indo-Pacific allies, such as Australia and India, through joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and capacity-building initiatives. Japan is also shifting toward a more proactive defense posture, with greater emphasis on acquiring the capability to conduct preemptive strikes if necessary. The country is pursuing the development of longer-range missiles and the enhancement of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). This includes a focus on more advanced air, sea, and missile defense systems, with the aim of deterring potential threats before they materialize. Japan is facing increasing domestic debate over its defense posture. While the public generally supports the country’s alliance with the U.S., there is some resistance to increased defense spending and a shift toward more offensive capabilities. However, with the regional security environment becoming more volatile, public opinion is gradually shifting in favor of stronger defense measures. As Japan crafts its $734 billion budget for fiscal 2025, the surge in defense spending underscores the country’s urgent need to confront mounting regional threats. From China’s military rise to North Korea’s missile provocations and the unpredictable dynamics of Russia’s military activities, Japan’s strategic priorities are clear. While this budget increases the strain on Japan’s public finances, it reflects a fundamental shift toward safeguarding the country’s national security in an increasingly unstable world. As Japan continues to modernize its military and enhance its defense capabilities, the world will be closely watching how the nation balances its security needs with the challenges of aging demographics and fiscal constraints.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/japan-unveils-historic-734-billion-defense-budget-for-2025-amid-growing-regional-security-threats	2024-12-26T01:48:05-08:00

Among these are advanced stealth capabilities, which will make the jet harder to detect by enemy radar, and next-generation avionics systems. Additionally, the aircraft is rumored to integrate artificial intelligence, enhancing its ability to process vast amounts of data and improve decision-making in real-time combat scenarios. One of the most anticipated features of this new jet is its potential for seamless coordination with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could redefine manned-unmanned teaming in future warfare. This would allow for greater flexibility and precision in combat operations, as the aircraft can work in tandem with drones to conduct reconnaissance, strike missions, or provide a defensive shield. Another promising feature of China's 6th-gen fighter is its potential to carry hypersonic weapons. The country has made significant strides in developing hypersonic technologies, and this fighter jet could serve as a platform to deploy these high-speed, long-range weapons. Furthermore, it is expected that the aircraft will be equipped with state-of-the-art radar systems capable of detecting and engaging threats at greater distances, giving the pilot a crucial advantage in modern air battles. Some experts also speculate that this jet could incorporate directed-energy weapons or other advanced countermeasures to defend against future missile threats. The successful flight of China’s 6th-generation fighter jet has profound implications not only for the PLAAF (People’s Liberation Army Air Force) but for the global balance of military power. With multiple countries working on their own 6th-generation fighter programs, China's latest achievement highlights the accelerating pace of technological advancement in air combat. In particular, the United States, which is developing its own next-generation air superiority fighter under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, will likely view China’s progress as a catalyst to fast-track its own plans. The U.S. Air Force has already conducted successful flight tests of prototypes for its NGAD program, with an expected operational rollout around the 2030s. The successful debut of China’s fighter will likely encourage the U.S. to further invest in artificial intelligence, advanced stealth, and hypersonic weapons to ensure its continued dominance in the skies. In Europe, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan are collaborating on the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP), which aims to produce a next-generation fighter jet by the early 2030s. This program is designed to replace the Eurofighter Typhoon and will likely incorporate many of the same advanced technologies expected in China's 6th-gen fighter, including enhanced stealth and autonomous systems. The developments in China are likely to influence the direction of European fighter programs, accelerating efforts to ensure that these countries do not fall behind in the race for air superiority. Russia, while less vocal about its 6th-gen fighter program, is also working on advancing its military aviation technology. The Su-57 Felon is the cornerstone of Russia’s efforts to modernize its air force, though it remains uncertain whether Russia will be able to match the technological advancements being pursued by China and the U.S. in the coming years. Russia’s approach to stealth and air combat has typically emphasized versatility and raw power, but it will likely need to integrate more sophisticated technologies to compete with the new generation of fighters coming out of China and the West. China’s new fighter is part of a broader strategy to modernize the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and project power well beyond its borders. This plan aligns with China’s goal of becoming a global military superpower by 2049, marking the centennial of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The 6th-gen fighter is just one part of this broader vision, which also includes the development of the H-20 stealth bomber, advancements in missile technology, and the expansion of China’s naval and space forces. Experts believe that China is moving towards a 'triad' of capabilities, focusing on cutting-edge fighters, bombers, and unmanned systems to maintain a technological edge in future conflicts. This focus on technological superiority is also driving China's push to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) across all of its military platforms. The fusion of AI with fighter jets like the new 6th-gen aircraft will likely allow for real-time decision-making based on vast amounts of data collected from various sources, including drones and satellites. This ability to coordinate across domains could be the key to winning future wars, as it will enable China’s military to respond to threats faster and more efficiently than ever before. The successful flight of China’s 6th-gen fighter jet represents a new chapter in the global arms race. As other nations scramble to develop their own next-generation aircraft, the competition for air superiority is poised to intensify. The U.S., Europe, and Russia will need to accelerate their own programs to ensure they remain ahead of China's growing military capabilities.

Japan plans the purchase of four C-2 SOJ electronic warfare aircraft to replace its unique EC-1	On December 23, 2024, the Japanese Ministry of Defense shared new information about the development of a stand-off electronic warfare (SOJ) variant of the Kawasaki C-2 transport aircraft, designed to replace the EC-1, an unique electronic warfare aircraft in service since 1986. This initiative, which will involve the purchase of four aircraft, aims to enhance the Japan Self-Defense Forces' (JSDF) capabilities with long-range jamming to disrupt enemy systems while ensuring operational safety. The program plans to procure four C-2 SOJ aircraft, using technologies from previous systems, including the J/ALQ-5 electronic jamming device and advanced radio wave measurement systems. (Picture source: Japan MoD) The Ministry of Defense (MoD) initiated the C-2 stand-off electronic warfare (SOJ) program in fiscal year 2020. Development is divided into two phases. The first, spanning 2020 to 2026, focuses on establishing data link jamming capabilities and integrating a multi-electronic warfare platform. The second phase, from 2023 to 2032, aims to refine and operationalize these technologies. The program plans to procure four SOJ aircraft, relying on domestic development to address national defense requirements while maintaining operational secrecy. The platform incorporates technology from previous systems, including the J/ALQ-5 electronic jamming device and advanced radio wave measurement systems. The EC-1, which the C-2 SOJ is intended to replace, is a dedicated electronic warfare platform derived from the Kawasaki C-1. Developed in 1983, the EC-1 is equipped with the J/ALQ-5 electronic countermeasure (ECM) system, later upgraded to the J/ALQ-5 Kai, Toshiba ELINT systems, and supplementary American ECM and ELINT avionics. The aircraft's airframe modifications include a black bulbous nose, tail radome, and antenna fairings for radar and communication jamming equipment. Testing began in December 1984, and the aircraft entered service in June 1986. Based at Iruma Air Base, the single-unit EC-1 supports training and operational testing for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). It can detect and jam radar and communication signals and deploy chaff pods when required. Although it remains in service, the EC-1 is being phased out as Japan transitions to more advanced systems, mainly based on the newer C-2 aircraft. Despite being initially designed as a transport aircraft, the C-2 has been adapted for multiple roles, including electronic intelligence gathering as the RC-2. Testing demonstrated its ability for semi-level takeoffs and landings on unpaved surfaces, enhancing its operational utility for emergency operations. The development of the C-2 began in the early 2000s under the designation CX, and to reduce expenses, the C-2 shares components with the Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft. In addition to this new electronic warfare variant, the C-2 could soon be armed with long-range missiles, including a modified Type 12 surface-to-ship missile, as well as the US-made AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). These missiles could extend the C-2’s operational range to over 11,000 kilometers, supporting counterstrike capabilities as outlined in Japan's earlier Defense Buildup Program. Like the future C-2 SOJ, the EC-1's airframe modifications include a black bulbous nose, tail radome, and antenna fairings for radar and communication jamming equipment. (Picture source: Twitter/アユザック) The Kawasaki C-2, a domestically developed military transport aircraft, is the platform for the new stand-off electronic warfare (SOJ) variant. The aircraft measures 43.9 meters in length, has a wingspan of 44.4 meters, and a height of 14.2 meters. It is powered by CF6-80C2 engines, capable of achieving speeds up to Mach 0.82, and can carry up to 20 tons over a range of approximately 7,600 kilometers. The C-2 was designed to replace the C-1 and complement the C-130H Hercules in the JSDF's fleet. It features a payload capacity of 36 tons, a glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and a tactical flight management system. The aircraft is capable of transporting large cargo such as MIM-104 Patriot missile systems and H-60 helicopters and has been deployed for operations including disaster relief and domestic missions since entering service in 2016. Japan plans to procure four C-2 Stand-Off Jammer (SOJ) aircraft to expand its electronic warfare capabilities and address evolving national defense requirements, a notable increase compared with the purchase of a single EC-1. The SOJ, based on the larger and more advanced C-2 airframe, is designed to disrupt and neutralize enemy radar and communication systems from a safe distance, allowing for operations beyond adversaries’ threat ranges. This program reflects Japan's strategy to modernize the Self-Defense Forces’ capabilities in the electromagnetic spectrum and enhance operational readiness across multiple areas. The SOJ complements other developments, such as the RC-2 and missile-equipped configurations, as part of efforts to adapt to changing security scenarios. The C-2 platform's design addresses broader operational requirements compared to the single-unit EC-1, which was developed in the 1980s as a modified C-1 transport for electronic warfare training and testing rather than frontline missions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/japan-plans-the-purchase-of-four-c-2-soj-electronic-warfare-aircraft-to-replace-its-unique-ec-1	2024-12-26T01:01:24-08:00

Breaking News: Russia Forms First Regiment Equipped with New S-500 Prometheus Air Defense Missile System	On December 18, 2024, General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Federation, announced the formation of Russia's first regiment equipped with the highly advanced S-500 'Prometheus' air defense missile system. This milestone marks a significant leap forward in Russia's air defense capabilities, with the S-500 being a next-generation system that combines air defense and anti-missile functionalities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The S-500 'Prometheus' air defense missile system launcher unit is on display at the Army-2020 defense exhibition in Russia, showcasing its advanced capabilities for intercepting long-range air and missile threats. (Picture source: Russian social network) The S-500 air defense missile system is being delivered in two primary configurations: one designed for long-range air defense and the other for anti-missile defense. However, General Gerasimov did not provide specific details on how many S-500 units have been delivered so far, leaving the full scope of its deployment unclear. The S-500 'Prometheus' is set to revolutionize Russia's defense posture. It is designed to engage a broader range of threats compared to its predecessors, the S-300 and S-400 air defense missile system. One of the most significant upgrades the S-500 brings is its ability to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic missiles, and even low-orbit satellites, positioning it as a direct counter to emerging missile threats worldwide. While both the S-300 and S-400 are formidable systems in their own right, the S-500 is a step ahead in terms of both range and target versatility, making it a truly cutting-edge air defense solution. The S-500 outclasses the S-300 and S-400 in several critical areas. First, its engagement range is considerably longer, with the S-500 capable of targeting threats up to 600 km (375 miles) away, compared to the S-400's 400 km (250 miles) and the S-300’s smaller range. This extended range allows the S-500 to offer a much larger protective umbrella, making it a powerful deterrent against a wide array of airborne threats. Moreover, while the S-400 is already capable of engaging both ballistic and aerodynamic targets, the S-500 enhances this with a specific focus on intercepting hypersonic missiles—an area where the S-400 struggles due to the extreme speed and maneuverability of these modern threats. Another important advantage of the S-500 is its anti-satellite capabilities. The system is reportedly able to target low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, which adds a new dimension to its operational scope. This makes the S-500 not only a highly capable missile defense system but also a powerful tool for denying adversaries access to crucial space-based assets, such as communications, reconnaissance, and weather satellites. In this regard, it enhances Russia's ability to disrupt the operations of adversaries, including NATO and other Western nations, that rely heavily on satellites for military and strategic purposes. The integration of the S-500 into Russia's defense network represents a significant escalation in Russia’s ability to protect its airspace while simultaneously presenting a direct challenge to NATO and U.S. air and missile defense systems. The system’s longer range and enhanced targeting capabilities mean that it could potentially neutralize many Western missile defense assets, including those deployed in Eastern Europe. For NATO, this poses a serious concern, as the S-500 could disrupt operations and significantly limit the freedom of maneuver for NATO forces, particularly in scenarios involving high-value assets such as reconnaissance aircraft, bombers, or missile defense installations. For the United States, the S-500 is seen as a major challenge to the global strategic balance. Its advanced features make it a direct counter to U.S. missile defense systems, such as the Patriot missile defense and the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, both of which may struggle to compete with the S-500’s advanced capabilities. The ability to counter hypersonic missiles is particularly concerning, as the U.S. has increasingly focused on developing its own hypersonic weapons. Russia’s success in deploying the S-500 could force a rethinking of Western missile defense strategies, especially in regions where Russia could use this technology to counter NATO and U.S. operations. In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the S-500 could have significant implications. Russia has already deployed the S-300 and S-400 systems in the region, using them to counter Ukrainian and NATO air assets. The arrival of the S-500 further strengthens Russia’s defensive capabilities, providing a potent shield against air strikes and missile attacks. With its ability to intercept a wider variety of threats, including advanced missile systems provided by the West, the S-500 could make it even more difficult for Ukraine to conduct precision strikes on Russian positions or critical infrastructure. The system’s long-range capabilities also mean that it could potentially engage targets well beyond Ukraine’s borders, complicating any air operations conducted by NATO or Ukrainian forces. The S-500’s introduction could also make it more challenging for NATO to supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry. For instance, long-range precision munitions such as the U.S.-supplied ATACMS or NATO’s new missile systems might find it difficult to evade the S-500’s missile interception capabilities. This could effectively undermine some of the strategic advantages that Western powers hoped to provide Ukraine in the fight against Russian forces. If successfully integrated into Russia's defense strategy in Ukraine, the S-500 would provide a formidable barrier to Western attempts to deliver military aid or support. Overall, the deployment of the S-500 marks a new era in air defense and anti-missile technology. The system's ability to counter both conventional aerial threats and advanced missile systems, as well as its potential to target satellites, gives Russia a powerful tool that could shift the balance of power in both regional and global defense postures. Its capabilities pose significant challenges for NATO and the United States, and the system could become a pivotal asset in Russia's military strategy moving forward. As this new system is integrated into Russia’s defense network, the global security landscape—especially in Europe and Eastern Europe—will likely undergo significant changes, with far-reaching consequences for both the war in Ukraine and broader international defense strategies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-russia-forms-first-regiment-equipped-with-new-s-500-prometheus-air-defense-missile-system	2024-12-25T03:11:13-08:00

Breaking News: Philippines to Acquire US Typhon Land-Based Missile System Amid Rising Tensions with China	According to a report published on December 23, 2024, by The Straits Times, Singapore Newspaper, the Philippines has confirmed plans to acquire the US-made Typhon missile system to bolster its defense capabilities and protect its maritime interests in the face of mounting tensions with China. The announcement was made during a press conference by Philippine Army Chief Lieutenant-General Roy Galido, who emphasized that the acquisition of the Typhon missile system would be crucial to the Philippines' 'concept of archipelagic defense,' a strategy designed to safeguard the nation's vast network of islands and maritime territory.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US Typhon Mid-Range Capability (MRC) missile system in action, a cutting-edge, land-based platform designed to deploy the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) for air defense, anti-ship, and precision strike missions, enhancing long-range defense capabilities. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) This decision comes as the Philippines grapples with an increasingly assertive China in the South China Sea, a region where Beijing has been intensifying its military presence and claims to disputed waters. The Philippines, which has territorial disputes with China over parts of the South China Sea, sees the acquisition of the Typhon missile system as a vital step in strengthening its defense against potential maritime threats. Lieutenant-General Galido stated, 'It is planned to be acquired because we see its feasibility and its functionality in our concept of archipelagic defense implementation.' The Philippines' move to acquire the Typhon system follows the deployment of the system in the northern Philippines earlier in 2024 for annual joint military exercises with the United States. Initially brought in for the exercises, the Typhon missile system remained stationed in the country despite criticism from Beijing, which has repeatedly accused the United States of destabilizing the region. The Typhon system's integration into the Philippine military represents a significant escalation in the country's defense posture, particularly as tensions with China continue to rise over disputed territories in the South China Sea. The Typhon missile system, officially known as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC) system, is a state-of-the-art, land-based missile platform developed by the United States. It is designed to deploy the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) interceptor, a weapon initially designed for naval use but now adapted for land-based operations. The SM-6 is one of the most advanced missile systems in the US arsenal, offering a range of capabilities that make it an ideal tool for defending coastal and maritime borders. The missile has an operational range exceeding 482 kilometers (300 miles) and can engage a variety of targets, including aircraft, ballistic missiles, and naval ships. The Typhon MRC platform is mobile, allowing for rapid deployment and repositioning across the Philippines' vast archipelagic territory. This mobility is critical for defending the Philippines' extensive coastline, particularly in regions that are heavily contested by China. In addition to its primary function of air defense and anti-ship capabilities, the SM-6 missile deployed by the Typhon system also offers precision land-attack options. With a range exceeding 370 kilometers (230 miles), the missile can strike high-value targets such as enemy warships, missile platforms, and critical infrastructure, giving the Philippines a robust defense layer against external maritime threats. Furthermore, the Typhon system is compatible with other advanced missile systems, including the SM-2, and has the potential for future upgrades. Notably, it could integrate the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and the Extended Range Guided Missile (ERGM), both of which are capable of striking targets at distances of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles). These upgrades would significantly extend the Typhon’s strike range and increase its effectiveness in defending the Philippines’ maritime boundaries from long-range threats. Looking further ahead, the Typhon MRC’s modular design offers the possibility of integrating the Tomahawk cruise missile, which has a range of between 500 and 1,500 kilometers (310 to 930 miles). Such an upgrade would provide the Philippines with long-range precision strike capabilities, enabling it to target strategic assets deep within contested areas of the South China Sea. By adding the Tomahawk or similar long-range missiles, the Typhon MRC could transform into a multi-theater platform capable of deterring and engaging a broader range of threats, not only along the coast but also deep within contested regions, enhancing the Philippines' ability to secure its maritime territory against foreign encroachments. The acquisition of the Typhon missile system also underscores the growing defense ties between the Philippines and the United States. The two countries share a long-standing military alliance, formalized through agreements such as the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which facilitates joint military exercises, equipment transfers, and pre-positioning of US military assets in the region. The Philippines has increasingly turned to the US for support in modernizing its defense forces, particularly as it faces growing challenges from China in the South China Sea. The US has been a key partner in the Philippines’ military modernization efforts, and the integration of advanced systems like the Typhon missile is a reflection of the deepening security cooperation between the two nations. As part of this alliance, the United States provides critical defense technologies and training to the Philippines, helping to strengthen its ability to defend its sovereignty and maintain regional stability. The Philippines' decision to acquire the US Typhon missile system marks a major shift in its defense strategy, signaling a stronger commitment to protecting its maritime interests and enhancing its deterrence capabilities in the face of China's growing military presence in the South China Sea. With its long-range, multi-mission capabilities, and advanced targeting systems, the Typhon system will significantly improve the Philippines' ability to defend its territorial waters and respond to potential threats. This acquisition also highlights the strengthening military relationship between the Philippines and the United States, as both countries work together to counter regional security challenges, particularly the growing influence of China in the Indo-Pacific. As tensions continue to rise in the South China Sea, the Philippines' deployment of the Typhon system will serve as a powerful deterrent, ensuring the country’s ability to secure its maritime boundaries and maintain its sovereignty in one of the world’s most contested regions. This strategic decision has broader implications for regional security and is expected to reshape the defense landscape in Southeast Asia, as the Philippines enhances its defensive capabilities and strengthens its ties with its key ally, the United States. The international community will be watching closely as this situation develops, as it could have far-reaching consequences for the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-philippines-to-acquire-us-typhon-missile-system-amid-rising-tensions-with-china	2024-12-24T03:35:42-08:00

(Picture source: Russian MoD) The Avangard hypersonic missile was first introduced to the Russian military in December 2019 with the 13th Red Banner Rocket Division, and by 2021, this unit had achieved full operational capability. A second unit went on combat alert by mid-2022, and now, the Orenburg division has joined the ranks, solidifying the Avangard’s role in Russia's nuclear strike capabilities. The Avangard is a cutting-edge hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) designed to be launched atop a ballistic missile. It represents a major leap forward in Russia’s ability to penetrate missile defense systems and strike high-value targets with immense speed and precision. One of the most remarkable aspects of the Avangard is its ability to travel at speeds exceeding Mach 20 — roughly 6.28 km per second — after being boosted into suborbital flight. These speeds place the Avangard in a category of its own, far beyond the capabilities of traditional ICBMs. The glide vehicle’s combination of speed and maneuverability during its descent allows it to unpredictably alter its flight path, making it virtually impossible for current missile defense systems to intercept. In terms of technical specifications, the Avangard boasts a range of over 6,000 km, with a weight of approximately 2,000 kg. The vehicle can carry both nuclear and conventional payloads, with the nuclear warhead reportedly capable of yielding more than 2 megatons of TNT equivalent — a staggering amount of destructive power. This versatility allows the Avangard to be employed in a variety of strategic contexts, from high-yield nuclear strikes to more conventional targets requiring precision. As a boost-glide weapon, the Avangard is carried to its suborbital apogee by a ballistic missile. Currently, this is the SS-19 'Stiletto' (UR-100NUTTH), though plans are in place to transition to the more powerful RS-28 'Sarmat' ICBM in the future. The RS-28 'Sarmat' will replace the SS-19 as the Avangard’s primary delivery system, providing increased range, payload capacity, and overall capability. Although Russia initially planned to mount the Avangard on the road-mobile RS-26 'Rubezh' (SS-X-31), financial constraints led to the adoption of the more advanced R-28 'Sarmat' for deployment. The R-28 'Sarmat' will provide greater flexibility and survivability for the Avangard in both mobile and silo-based configurations. Once boosted to its apogee at around 100 km in altitude, the Avangard separates from its rocket carrier and begins its glide towards its target. This separation occurs in the vacuum of space, allowing the glide vehicle to re-enter the atmosphere and continue its descent with atmospheric speeds exceeding Mach 20. During this phase, the Avangard remains highly maneuverable, using its aerodynamic features to shift its trajectory and evade interception. As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin revealed in a 2018 speech, the Avangard’s ability to maneuver at hypersonic speeds gives it an unpredictable flight path, making it especially difficult for missile defense systems to track and engage during its descent. Though no publicly available images of the Avangard exist, reports suggest that it likely features a short, wedge-shaped design or possibly a shuttle-like configuration with small stabilizer wings. The HGV itself likely does not rely on any propulsion system after separation from its carrier missile, instead using gravity and aerodynamic forces to maintain its speed and altitude. This design minimizes the complexity of the system and ensures that the vehicle remains as fast and efficient as possible while still retaining the ability to maneuver in flight. The operational capabilities of the Avangard present significant challenges for missile defense systems, particularly those developed by NATO and the United States. The vehicle’s combination of high speed, maneuverability, and range makes it an effective counter to current missile defense technologies, which are designed to intercept traditional ballistic missiles that follow predictable, high-arc trajectories. Hypersonic glide vehicles like the Avangard, with their unpredictable flight paths and speeds, complicate attempts to intercept or destroy them before they reach their targets. The threat posed by the Avangard is serious for the United States and Europe. The glide vehicle’s ability to carry up to a 2-megaton nuclear warhead provides Russia with a highly effective means of delivering devastating strikes to multiple targets simultaneously, potentially overwhelming missile defense systems. Each large Russian intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) can carry up to 12 Avangard warheads, allowing for a strike on 12 separate locations, all with the potential for thermonuclear destruction. This significantly enhances Russia’s strategic capabilities and raises the stakes in the nuclear arms race. Furthermore, the deployment of such advanced weapons systems by Russia increases the pressure on NATO and the U.S. to develop countermeasures that can neutralize hypersonic threats. While current missile defense systems can intercept traditional ICBMs, they are less equipped to deal with the unpredictability and extreme speed of hypersonic glide vehicles. This technological gap presents a potential vulnerability, particularly if Russia continues to expand its arsenal of hypersonic weapons, forcing the West to accelerate its own research into counter-hypersonic technologies. The Avangard’s deployment, alongside other Russian strategic systems like the Sarmat ICBM and Poseidon underwater drone, indicates a deliberate move by Moscow to ensure the survivability of its nuclear deterrent in the face of emerging missile defense technologies. For Russia, the Avangard is a tool of both defense and power projection, designed not only to counter U.S. missile defense systems but also to reinforce its nuclear deterrent in an increasingly multipolar global security environment. In conclusion, the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle represents a significant advancement in Russia’s military capabilities. With its long range, high speed, and ability to carry massive nuclear payloads, the Avangard poses a formidable challenge to missile defense systems in both the U.S. and Europe. As Russia continues to modernize its nuclear arsenal, the Avangard’s role as a primary component of its strategic deterrence posture is set to grow, while the implications for global arms control and missile defense systems will likely shape future military and diplomatic strategies worldwide.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-expands-strategic-nuclear-arsenal-with-avangard-hypersonic-missile-deployment	2024-12-24T02:48:21-08:00

US Army Awards a 155mm Air Defense Cannon with Hypervelocity Ammunition to BAE Systems by 2028	On December 20, 2024, the U.S. Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) announced its plan to award an exclusive contract to BAE Systems to develop a 155mm self-propelled cannon prototype. This system, the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon (MDAC), aims to address growing modern aerial threats, including drones and cruise missiles. The project utilizes hypervelocity ammunition originally developed for the U.S. Navy’s canceled electromagnetic railgun program, with an operational demonstration scheduled for 2028. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The MDAC is designed to protect fixed and semi-fixed positions against a wide range of threats, including drones, cruise missiles, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters (Picture source: USAF) This effort will be executed under an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), a contract mechanism designed to accelerate technology development by bypassing traditional administrative hurdles. This approach allows rapid focus on research and prototyping to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. armed forces. Since 2022, the RCCTO has been collaborating with the U.S. Air Force and other strategic organizations, such as the Pentagon’s Strategic Capabilities Office and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Together, they are advancing this ambitious project by leveraging related programs, including the Hypervelocity Ground Weapon System (HGWS). The current goal is to finalize a complete prototype MDAC battery by the end of fiscal year 2027. This battery will include eight MDAC cannons, four Multi-Function Precision Radars (MFPR), two Multi-Domain Battle Managers (MDBM), and at least 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles (HVP). These components will be integrated into a larger defense network, including the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS), which is currently being deployed. The MDAC is designed to protect fixed and semi-fixed positions against a wide range of threats, including drones, cruise missiles, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters. It will complement existing air defense systems within a layered strategy. Key technical requirements include a wheeled design, remote firing capabilities, high rates of fire, significant ammunition capacity, and fast resupply, whether manual or automated. The system must also be transportable by C-130 aircraft, enhancing its potential for expeditionary missions. While BAE Systems' specific design for the MDAC remains confidential, certain possibilities can be inferred. The system could draw inspiration from the Archer, a 155mm self-propelled howitzer developed by Bofors, a BAE Systems subsidiary. The Archer features a 21-round autoloader capable of firing the first round within 23 seconds and repositioning quickly after firing. However, a new platform tailored to the MDAC's transportability and other requirements might also be developed. A chassis based on the widely used FMTV tactical trucks is another feasible option. Hypervelocity projectiles (HVP) are a central element of this project, offering an innovative and cost-effective response to modern threats. Initially developed for the Navy’s railgun program, these projectiles can reach speeds exceeding 9,000 km/h, destroying targets through kinetic impact. Explosive variants are also planned, with an estimated range of 31 kilometers for 155mm cannons. With a unit cost below $100,000, HVPs are particularly competitive compared to traditional missiles, such as the Stinger ($400,000) or the PAC-3 MSE, which costs several million dollars. The MDAC project is especially relevant in the context of evolving aerial threats. Armed drones, cruise missiles, and autonomous systems have become strategic tools for state and non-state actors alike. Recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, have highlighted the need for innovative and cost-efficient defense solutions to counter these varied and often asymmetric threats. However, the MDAC will not serve as a standalone solution. It will need to be integrated into a broader defense architecture to address complex scenarios effectively. Additionally, its development occurs amid ongoing debates between the U.S. Army and the Air Force regarding the division of responsibilities for air base defense. The Air Force has recently expressed interest in reclaiming certain roles traditionally handled by the Army, citing the need for adaptation to evolving tactical realities. With this project, the U.S. Army aims to demonstrate by the end of the decade the capabilities of an innovative air defense system tailored to modern battlefield demands while reducing operational costs. The MDAC could become a critical asset in layered defense strategies, offering a flexible and efficient response to contemporary aerial threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-awards-a-155mm-air-defense-cannon-with-hypervelocity-ammunition-to-bae-systems-by-2028	2024-12-24T00:19:53-08:00

The frigate will undergo a planned maintenance period before reloading the missiles for operational use in 2025. The introduction of the NSM bridges the gap between the retired Harpoon system and the future offensive surface weapon currently under development. This next-generation missile will eventually become the Royal Navy’s premier long-range anti-ship weapon, to be deployed on the advanced Type 26 frigates now under construction. Analysis The Royal Navy's adoption of the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) significantly bolsters its maritime strike capability, particularly in scenarios involving conflict with Russia. Russia's naval capabilities, such as Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates equipped with Kalibr cruise missiles, pose a formidable challenge in maritime conflicts. The NSM provides a decisive counter by enabling the Royal Navy to strike these high-value assets from beyond their effective defensive ranges. This is particularly critical given the increasing deployment of advanced Russian vessels in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions, where control over vital sea lanes is crucial. The missile’s ability to engage both sea-based and land-based targets allows for strategic flexibility. It is especially effective in disrupting Russia's anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) systems, including Bastion-P missile batteries and coastal radar installations. These systems are often integrated into Russia’s broader defensive strategies in regions such as Crimea or the Baltic. The NSM’s combination of autonomous targeting, infrared imaging, and low observability ensures it can neutralize these threats with minimal risk of interception.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/hms-portland-becomes-second-royal-navy-frigate-armed-with-naval-strike-missiles	2024-12-23T05:59:45-08:00
