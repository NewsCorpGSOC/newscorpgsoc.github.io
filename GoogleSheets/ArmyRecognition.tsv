Strategic Leap: Japan Acquires V-BAT UAVs for Naval Surveillance	According to information published by ShieldAI on January 7, 2025, Japan is set to acquire advanced V-BAT unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from U.S. defense company Shield AI. An allocation of 4 billion yen (approximately $25 million) has been designated for this procurement. The V-BAT, renowned for its compact vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) system, is suited for deployment aboard smaller naval vessels, offering operational flexibility and endurance for monitoring expansive maritime territories.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan acquires V-BAT UAVs to elevate maritime patrols with VTOL technology and extended operational endurance. (Picture source: ShieldAI) The V-BAT UAV is renowned for its vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, requiring minimal space for deployment—specifically, a 12-foot square area (about 3.7 meters). This feature makes it particularly suitable for operations on naval vessels with limited deck space. Once airborne, the V-BAT transitions to horizontal flight, utilizing its wings for lift, and can sustain operations for up to 10 hours. This endurance is crucial for extended surveillance missions over Japan's vast maritime territories. In the context of a potential conflict with China, the V-BAT UAV could play a pivotal role in bolstering Japan’s maritime security and operational readiness, especially in contested areas such as the East China Sea. These waters, including the Senkaku Islands (claimed by both Japan and China), are a hotspot for geopolitical tensions. A conflict scenario would demand rapid, precise, and sustained intelligence-gathering and situational awareness, areas where the V-BAT excels. China’s naval strategy emphasizes anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities, bolstered by advanced missile systems, large surface fleets, submarines, and maritime militias. To counter this, the JMSDF must rely on persistent ISR and agile platforms like the V-BAT UAV to maintain awareness and provide actionable intelligence. The V-BAT’s ability to operate from smaller patrol ships, frigates, and remote bases gives Japan a distinct advantage in deploying assets near contested areas without escalating tensions. During a conflict, the V-BAT’s long-endurance surveillance can be used to monitor and track Chinese naval activities, such as movements of destroyers, submarines, and amphibious assault ships. This real-time intelligence is crucial for countering aggressive maneuvers or amphibious landings. Its ability to relay this data to JMSDF command and allied forces ensures a coordinated and informed response, which is critical in managing the fast-paced dynamics of naval engagements. In anti-submarine warfare, the V-BAT can assist in detecting Chinese submarines operating near Japanese waters. The East China Sea is a known transit area for Chinese submarines heading into the Pacific, and the V-BAT, equipped with synthetic aperture radar or magnetic anomaly detectors, could provide an additional layer of defense by identifying submarine locations and relaying their movements to JMSDF assets. The UAV’s stealthy design and low radar signature make it ideal for covert ISR missions in sensitive zones. For instance, it could be deployed to shadow Chinese vessels or maritime militia ships operating near the Senkaku Islands, documenting activities for strategic decision-making. In scenarios where China employs swarming tactics using smaller vessels or drones, the V-BAT can provide overwatch for JMSDF vessels, identifying threats early and coordinating countermeasures. Its modular payloads can also be adapted for electronic warfare, such as jamming Chinese communications or gathering electronic intelligence to disrupt their operational cohesion.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/strategic-leap-japan-acquires-v-bat-uavs-for-naval-surveillance	2025-01-08T05:24:48-08:00

General Carmine Masiello’s earlier visit to Rheinmetall Italia S.p.A. headquarters in Rome on December 17, 2024, confirmed the intention to equip Italian forces with these systems, aligning with details in the Multi-Year Programming Document 2024–2026.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A complete Skynex system comprises four Revolver Gun Mk3 35mm cannons, each capable of firing 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of up to 4 kilometers. It utilizes programmable 35mm Ahead ammunition, which is resistant to electronic countermeasures, ensuring precise target engagement. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Within this document, €400 million are forecasted for the overall requirement, with €80 million spread over four years currently financed by the defense budget. The plan includes the systems, their ten-year integrated logistics support, ammunition, trucks, communication and information systems, and infrastructure adaptations. The aim is to counter rockets, artillery, mortars, unmanned aircraft systems, and loitering munitions, thereby providing very short-range protection for personnel and critical infrastructure in Italy and for contingents deployed abroad. These four C-RAM systems fulfill commitments made to the Alliance and are described in the Defense Planning Document (DPP) as Skynex, a Rheinmetall-produced system that integrates separate airspace surveillance components and effectors, accommodates radar technologies from multiple manufacturers, and employs programmable 35 mm Ahead ammunition resistant to electronic countermeasures. This new capability is expected to deter threats posed by rockets, artillery, and mortars, as well as drones and loitering munitions, especially for contingents deployed in operational theaters. Reports indicate that Italy’s short-range air defense program (GRIFO), managed by the Italian Army and already involving the CAMM-ER missile, may integrate the Skynex 35 mm system to address low-altitude and short-range threats. In May 2024, MBDA announced tests of the CAMM-ER missile with the GRIFO system’s Command Post and Engagement Module, confirming its capability against a simulated enemy aircraft attack. Combining multiple solutions ensures that aerial targets of varying ranges and altitudes can be addressed, strengthening national defense sovereignty and industrial partnerships. This purchase also aims to secure technological expertise within Italy’s domestic defense sector, as the Skynex system is manufactured in Rome’s Tiburtina Valley. Several Italian publications have reported on Skynex production for Ukraine. Originally developed in Switzerland by Oerlikon, Skynex is now built at Rheinmetall Italia, circumventing Swiss restrictions on direct exports of completed war materials while adhering to regulations permitting the transfer of technological know-how. This approach facilitated deployment to Ukraine under a contract financed by the German government. By the end of 2023, two Skynex systems, financed by the German government and valued at 183 million Swiss francs, were delivered to Ukrainian forces. Germany subsequently placed orders for three more units, bringing the total value to around 500 million euros. Some systems even arrived ahead of schedule via the Polish logistics hub in Rzeszow. Following the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, Rheinmetall announced shorter delivery times for Skynex due to investments in personnel and infrastructure, reducing the timeline from two years to approximately one year. Rheinmetall Italia invested €100 million in 2023 and an additional €20 million in 2024 to expedite production and address increased demand. Personnel numbers are expected to grow from 450 to about 550 by early 2025, and the supplier roster expanded from 467 in 2022 to 762 in 2024. Italy’s short-range air defense program (GRIFO), managed by the Italian Army and already involving the CAMM-ER missile, may integrate the Skynex 35 mm system to address low-altitude and short-range threats. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Italy’s decision to invest in four systems follows NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s visit to Rheinmetall Italia’s Rome headquarters on November 5, 2024. This visit coincided with his meetings with President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and focused on reviewing new air defense technologies, such as Skynex, which Germany financed and donated to Ukraine. Rheinmetall AG is also collaborating with Leonardo to produce the Panther tank and Lynx tracked vehicle for the Italian Army, a partnership valued at over €23 billion over fifteen years. This cooperation aims to develop new heavy tanks, known as Main Battle Tanks, and address future European requirements under the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program. The Rome plant now plays a pivotal role in Rheinmetall’s global operations, overseeing major radar and cannon production. The company’s turnover in Italy exceeds one billion euros, with six plants nationwide. The Skynex air defense system includes several modular components designed for short-range and very short-range operations. It features four Revolver Gun Mk3 cannons, each capable of firing 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of up to 4 kilometers. The system utilizes programmable 35 mm Ahead ammunition, resistant to electronic countermeasures, for precise target engagement. Its CN-1 command module enables centralized control, while the X-TAR3D X-band radar ensures 360-degree target acquisition, classification, and tracking. Mobility is supported by HX trucks, and the modular design allows the integration of additional sensors and effectors, such as the SkyKnight missile, which extends the engagement range to 10 kilometers. The distributed component design reduces the risk of significant damage from single strikes. The Skynex system can address various aerial threats, including rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), NATO-class I drones, and loitering munitions. Its radar provides continuous 360-degree coverage, enabling tracking and classification in diverse environmental and electronic conditions. The programmable 35 mm ammunition creates a dense projectile pattern, ensuring an effective engagement of small, fast-moving targets. Rheinmetall Italia cited the success of Germany’s Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun in Ukraine as validation of cannon-based short-range defense systems. The company emphasizes the lower cost of 35 mm munitions compared to missiles and the rounds’ resistance to electronic interference. The modular architecture supports adaptability to mission-specific needs, allowing the integration of effectors like high-energy lasers or missiles to counter saturation attacks. These features make Skynex suitable for protecting critical infrastructure and deployed forces, enabling a robust response to evolving threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/italy-purchases-four-skynex-35mm-air-defense-systems-to-counter-low-altitude-and-short-range-threats	2025-01-08T04:09:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukrainian F-16 Fighter Jet Pilot Sets Historic Record by Destroying Six Missiles in a Single Mission	According to a report published on January 7, 2025, by the Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, a Ukrainian pilot flying an F-16 Fighting Falcon has achieved a remarkable feat by destroying six enemy cruise missiles in a single combat mission. This historic achievement occurred during a massive missile and drone attack in December 2024, marking a milestone in the F-16’s capability to engage and eliminate high-speed missile threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image: A Ukrainian pilot in front of an F-16 Fighting Falcon donated by Ukraine's international allies. (Picture source: Social Network) The Ukrainian pilot successfully intercepted and destroyed four cruise missiles using the F-16’s air-to-air missiles (AAMs) and then proceeded to eliminate two more missiles using the M61 Vulcan cannon. The F-16’s radar systems, including the AN/APG-68 radar, proved crucial in tracking the fast-moving missile targets, even those equipped with electronic countermeasures (REBs). This made the mission not only historically significant but also a testament to the high skill of the Ukrainian pilot and the versatile nature of the F-16 as a missile defense platform. While the Ukrainian F-16 pilot’s success is unprecedented, other F-16 pilots have also engaged in missile interception missions in previous combat scenarios, offering valuable insight into the aircraft’s ability to neutralize aerial threats. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, F-16s were used to intercept and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles, though their success in directly destroying these missiles was limited. F-16s were primarily tasked with striking missile launchers and air defense systems, but they also worked in tandem with Patriot missile defense systems to counter ballistic missile threats. The AIM-7 Sparrow missiles and radar systems on the F-16 allowed for some interception capabilities against the low-flying Scud missiles. This mission highlighted the F-16’s adaptability in missile defense operations, even in high-risk scenarios. Similarly, during Operation Allied Force in 1999, F-16s were integral in the broader NATO missile defense strategy, which involved targeting and neutralizing Serbian missile launchers and air defense sites. While the F-16 was not directly involved in intercepting incoming missiles, it provided essential offensive strikes against missile launch sites that posed significant threats to NATO aircraft. F-16 pilots contributed to air superiority by eliminating missile systems and supporting the overall missile defense efforts. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has extensive experience in missile defense operations, including using the F-16 to engage airborne missile threats. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Israeli F-16s were involved in countering Katyusha rockets and other short-range missiles fired by Hezbollah. Though the F-16 did not directly intercept these rockets with its cannon or air-to-air missiles, it played a critical role in eliminating missile launch sites and providing surveillance, which allowed other defense systems like the Iron Dome to neutralize the threats. The F-16’s precision strikes and close air support proved to be vital in controlling the airspace and eliminating missile launch points. In Turkey, during the Syrian Civil War, Turkey’s F-16s were actively used in countering ballistic missile threats from Syria. While Patriot missile systems served as the primary missile defense, F-16s were tasked with surveillance and offensive strikes against missile launchers and ground-based missile systems. These missions further demonstrated the F-16’s versatility in dealing with missile threats, often working in conjunction with other air defense systems to provide comprehensive protection. The M61 Vulcan cannon mounted on the F-16 is a 6-barrel, 20mm rotary cannon capable of firing at 6,000 rounds per minute. While it is commonly used in close-range dogfights and against aerial targets like enemy aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), its application against missiles is extremely rare and highly challenging. The cannon’s high rate of fire and short-range effectiveness make it a difficult tool to use against fast-moving missiles, which often require precise tracking and engagement at very close distances—typically under 500 meters. In the case of the Ukrainian pilot’s mission, the M61 Vulcan was used against two incoming cruise missiles, which required the pilot to close the distance and engage the target with great precision. While the primary method of missile interception in the F-16 is through air-to-air missiles (AAMs) like the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the cannon proved useful in situations where close-range engagement was necessary, especially in scenarios where the aircraft's missiles had already been expended or the threat was in the final stages of approach. The historic achievement by the Ukrainian F-16 pilot in destroying six missiles in one mission is a significant moment in the evolution of missile defense using F-16s. The aircraft’s radar systems, air-to-air missiles, and M61 Vulcan cannon allow for a range of interception options against high-speed aerial threats, from cruise missiles to ballistic projectiles. The experiences of other F-16 pilots in past combat situations, including the U.S., Israel, and Turkey, further highlight the fighter's versatility in missile defense roles, whether in directly destroying missiles or supporting broader air defense strategies. The success of the Ukrainian F-16 pilot underscores the growing capabilities of the F-16 Fighting Falcon in modern warfare, particularly in high-intensity conflicts where missile threats are increasingly sophisticated. With continued training, technology upgrades, and combat experience, the F-16 is proving to be a formidable weapon in the global fight against missile proliferation and aerial threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-jet-pilot-sets-historic-record-by-destroying-six-missiles-in-a-single-mission	2025-01-08T03:11:10-08:00

This initiative aligns with Japan's strategy to develop advanced technologies aimed at enhancing its military capabilities in autonomous systems and collaborative combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XQ-58A Valkyrie is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle designed by Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions for the U.S. Air Force's unmanned combat air vehicle program (Picture source: US DoD) Signed on October 18, 2024, for an amount of 155,177,000 JPY, approximately 1 million USD, this contract represents a significant step in Japan’s efforts to integrate UAVs into its military operations. ATLA explained that Boeing Japan was uniquely positioned to carry out this project due to its exclusive access to the required simulation software, along with the necessary technical resources and expertise. Japan's interest in combat UAVs is not a recent development. As early as December 2022, the Ministry of Defense (JMOD) announced plans to develop 'combat support UAVs' capable of collaborating with manned aircraft. These efforts are also part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a joint initiative between Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft. In December 2023, JMOD also signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct research on artificial intelligence for UAVs to ensure seamless integration with Japan's future fighter jets. The concept of collaborative UAVs, often referred to as 'loyal wingman' or 'collaborative combat aircraft' (CCA), aims to create autonomous drones capable of supporting manned aircraft in a range of missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and combat operations. One prominent example is Boeing Australia's MQ-28 Ghost Bat, a multi-role UAV developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. Designed as a 'force multiplier,' the Ghost Bat features advanced artificial intelligence and a modular nose section that can be customized to meet specific operational requirements. In July 2024, it was announced that Australia’s Ghost Bats would prioritize ISR capabilities over weapon systems, partially due to Boeing's unsuccessful bid for an autonomous combat jet program in the United States. Nevertheless, the Ghost Bat remains a viable candidate for Japan’s combat support UAV program, given its adaptability and role in multi-domain missions. Japan is also pursuing additional UAV development independently. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is working on two collaborative UAV concepts: one focused on tactical combat and another aimed at supporting manned aircraft operations. Both are being designed to integrate with the GCAP next-generation fighter, underscoring Japan’s commitment to incorporating cutting-edge technologies into its defense systems. In parallel with Boeing Japan's research, ATLA continues to explore other initiatives to advance autonomous capabilities. This month, the agency issued public bids for the development of stealth UAVs for aerial refueling and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) designed for explosive handling and mine countermeasures. The outcomes of Boeing Japan's simulation tests will play a crucial role in shaping ATLA and JMOD’s decisions on selecting UAVs that best align with Japan's defense requirements. These efforts reflect the country’s focus on modernizing its military through international partnerships and autonomous technological advancements. This contract between Boeing Japan and ATLA highlights a pivotal moment in Japan’s development of autonomous military capabilities. As the country invests in collaborative technologies for its future aircraft, partnerships with nations like the United States emphasize the importance of a strategic approach to addressing evolving defense challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/development-of-combat-uavs-in-japan-through-strategic-partnership-with-boeing	2025-01-08T02:30:36-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) To date, Arab African nations show mixed outcomes regarding the acquisition of F-35 fighter jets. Türkiye ordered 30 F-35As, with plans for up to 100, but purchases were halted in 2020 due to U.S. sanctions over Türkiye’s procurement of the Russian S-400 missile system. Four jets were delivered but remain withheld at Luke Air Force Base, and the U.S. stated in February 2024 that Türkiye could be readmitted to the F-35 program if it resolves the S-400 issue. The United Arab Emirates signed a deal in January 2021 for 50 F-35s as part of a $23 billion arms package, but in December 2021, the UAE unilaterally suspended the agreement, citing technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost concerns. A senior UAE official indicated in September 2024 that discussions with the U.S. over the F-35 are not expected to resume. Qatar expressed interest in the F-35 in 2020, but U.S. policy to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge has prevented progress. Saudi Arabia has shown interest in the F-35 since 2012 but has not advanced toward an agreement, with obstacles including U.S. concerns about regional stability, human rights issues, and Israel’s military edge, leading to the potential acquisition of 100 Turkish KAAN fighters. Regarding Morocco, negotiations for the deal reportedly took place between 2020 and 2022, with Morocco seeking Israel’s assistance to facilitate discussions with U.S. authorities. A meeting in November 2021 between Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Moroccan Defense Minister Abdellatif Loudiyi is cited as instrumental in advancing these negotiations. Rising tensions with Algeria—particularly regarding the Western Sahara conflict and Algeria’s support for the Polisario Front—are considered major factors driving Morocco’s interest in these aircraft. Algeria’s acquisition of Russian Su-57 stealth fighters has also reportedly influenced Morocco's decision. Algeria is reported to have signed a contract for the acquisition of 14 Su-57 fighter jets from Russia as part of a broader military agreement that includes Su-34 and Su-35 aircraft. The Su-57, designated as a fifth-generation stealth fighter, incorporates features such as reduced radar cross-section, advanced avionics, and enhanced maneuverability. This reported procurement would add to Algeria's existing fleet of Su-30MKA and Su-35 aircraft, reflecting its effort to modernize its air force. If the agreement is implemented, Algeria could become the first country outside Russia to receive the Su-57. This acquisition aligns with Algeria’s strategy to maintain a regional military balance with Morocco amid ongoing tensions over Western Sahara. Algeria’s potential acquisition of the Su-57 is considered a significant factor influencing Morocco’s decision to modernize its forces with a comparable or superior fifth-generation stealth fighter, such as the F-35. (Picture source: Russian social media) Since Morocco annexed the region in 1975, Algeria has supported the Polisario Front, which advocates for Western Sahara’s independence, by providing political backing and hosting Sahrawi refugees. Algeria frames this support as consistent with its regional policies and anti-colonial stance. Morocco claims Western Sahara as part of its territory and has proposed limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Diplomatic relations between the two countries worsened in August 2021, when Algeria severed ties with Morocco, citing what it called 'hostile actions' related to the conflict. Morocco’s interest in the F-35 is therefore part of a broader effort to strengthen its defense capabilities in collaboration with Western allies, including the United States and Israel. This effort also includes acquisitions such as AH-64E Apache helicopters, M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, Bradley armored vehicles, and MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. The F-35 was prominently featured at the 7th Marrakech Air Show, held from October 30 to November 2, 2024, under the High Patronage of King Mohammed VI and with the support of the Royal Moroccan Air Force. The event showcased over 300 exhibitors and hosted 100 international delegations. Morocco also displayed its first Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopter at the event, part of an order for 24 units currently in production. In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, several factors would determine the outcome. The Su-57 is a fifth-generation stealth aircraft designed by Russia, capable of achieving speeds over Mach 2 and equipped with thrust-vectoring engines for enhanced maneuverability. The F-35, developed by the United States, prioritizes stealth and advanced avionics, with a low radar cross-section and integrated sensor fusion for improved situational awareness. The Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. This balance suggests that the F-35 could hold an advantage in beyond-visual-range scenarios, depending on the operational context and pilot expertise. The potential acquisition of Su-57 fighter jets by Algeria and F-35 aircraft by Morocco could shift the military balance in North Africa. Algeria's interest in the Su-57 appears aimed at countering Morocco's existing fleet of F-16s and its potential procurement of F-35s, raising the likelihood of a regional arms race. This development might prompt neighboring countries, such as Spain, to reassess their defense strategies, including the possible acquisition of F-35s to maintain strategic balance. The introduction of these advanced aircraft could impact the military equilibrium, increase tensions, and influence diplomatic relations within the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/morocco-could-soon-become-the-first-arab-nation-to-acquire-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-jets	2025-01-08T02:05:30-08:00

In 2024, the French defense industry rebounded strongly, with exports exceeding €18 billion. During a speech delivered at the Invalides courtyard on January 7, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu described 2024 as the 'second-best year in our history,' surpassing the €14 billion achieved in 2016. These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands. Despite these achievements, the minister emphasized the need to sustain efforts, pointing to promising prospects for 2025. Among them, he confirmed the sale of 14 Caracal helicopters to Iraq, though this figure raises questions. In September, Baghdad had announced a contract for 12 H225M Caracals, suggesting a potential additional order, though no further details have been provided. Looking ahead, Lecornu outlined priorities that include surface ships, particularly defense and intervention frigates, submarines, radars, artillery systems, helicopters, and Rafale jets. He also highlighted the strategic importance of the next-generation SAMP/T medium-range ground-based air defense system, designed to counter increasing ballistic threats, particularly from Iran and Russia. The minister reiterated that arms exports are critical for the BITD. Beyond supporting the trade balance and generating employment across France, they ensure national sovereignty by sustaining an industrial model developed in the 1960s. The results achieved in 2024 reflect the resilience and adaptability of the French defense industry. However, maintaining this momentum requires continued vigilance, particularly in a global context of evolving military expenditures and strategic challenges. With major opportunities already emerging, 2025 has the potential to further consolidate France’s position as a global leader in arms exports.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rafale-fighter-jets-and-barracuda-submarines-propel-french-arms-sales-in-2024	2025-01-08T01:53:54-08:00

Defense analysts suggest this latest test underscores North Korea’s progress in refining its hypersonic capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korea's newly tested hypersonic missile, described as a 'new model,' shares similarities with the Hwasong-16B IRBM, first unveiled in April last year. (Picture source: North Korea press agency KCNA) The Hwasong-16B is considered one of North Korea's most advanced hypersonic missile systems, featuring a solid-fuel propulsion system that offers rapid launch readiness and greater mobility compared to traditional liquid-fuel missiles. This capability reduces detection and interception risks, giving the missile a strategic advantage. The upgraded version tested on Monday reportedly incorporates carbon-fiber composite materials, which enhance structural strength, thermal resistance, and aerodynamic efficiency. These improvements are particularly critical for sustaining hypersonic flight and ensuring successful re-entry during high-speed maneuvers. The latest design is believed to support a maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), a component aimed at evading missile defense systems with unpredictable flight paths. Hypersonic missiles are considered one of the most dangerous modern weapons due to their speed, maneuverability, and precision. Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic missiles can change course mid-flight, making them extremely difficult to detect and intercept. Traveling at speeds exceeding Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), they drastically reduce the reaction time available to adversaries. When equipped with conventional or nuclear warheads, their precision and destructive potential pose a severe threat to military assets, infrastructure, and population centers. This capability significantly destabilizes the global security landscape, as existing missile defense systems struggle to cope with the unique challenges posed by hypersonic weapons. Globally, several countries are investing heavily in hypersonic missile technology, driving an arms race in this domain. The United States is developing systems like the Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) and the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) to maintain its technological edge. These programs focus on precision-strike capabilities and the ability to target heavily defended regions. Russia, on the other hand, has operationalized systems like the Avangard and Kinzhal, boasting nuclear-capable hypersonic weapons with intercontinental reach. China has also achieved significant milestones, with the development of the DF-17, a medium-range missile equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle, highlighting its commitment to regional dominance. North Korea’s advancements in this field align with global trends, but its rapid progress raises concerns about unchecked proliferation. Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are also developing hypersonic systems, though their focus has been more on defensive applications and precision targeting. South Korea, for instance, is utilizing advanced ramjet propulsion and high-precision guidance systems to counter North Korea's growing missile threats. The race to develop hypersonic technology is fueled by its potential to disrupt existing military doctrines. Hypersonic missiles provide a combination of speed, range, and maneuverability that can bypass traditional air and missile defense systems, reshaping strategies for both offense and defense. As a result, these weapons are regarded not only as game-changers in modern warfare but also as destabilizing factors, intensifying global military competition and raising the risk of escalation in conflicts. While North Korea describes its new missile as a groundbreaking advancement, verification of its claimed performance metrics remains ongoing. Nevertheless, the refinement of the Hwasong-16B demonstrates Pyongyang’s clear intention to bolster its strategic deterrence capabilities and maintain its relevance in the hypersonic arms race. The increasing sophistication of hypersonic weapons worldwide underscores the need for international dialogue and cooperation to address the threats posed by this transformative technology.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-analysis-north-koreas-latest-hypersonic-missile-test-points-to-possible-advanced-hwasong-16b-model	2025-01-07T07:45:18-08:00

Comments Rivers in Ukraine have emerged as both strategic assets and critical challenges in the ongoing conflict, shaping the military dynamics on both sides. These waterways, particularly the Dnieper River, act as natural barriers and logistical corridors, influencing operations at tactical and strategic levels. One of the most significant issues revolves around the control and disruption of river crossings. Bridges over rivers like the Dnieper and Seym are pivotal for moving troops, equipment, and supplies. The deliberate destruction of these bridges, such as the Ukrainian strikes in the Kursk region, has effectively disrupted Russian supply chains and complicated logistics. Conversely, Russian forces have targeted river crossings to stall Ukrainian advances, exemplified by the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam, which led to widespread flooding. This flooding not only altered the terrain but created significant operational and humanitarian challenges, affecting both military mobility and civilian populations. Amphibious operations and river crossings have posed additional difficulties. Ukrainian forces have undertaken bold efforts to secure footholds on the eastern banks of rivers like the Dnieper, often operating in hostile and exposed environments. These operations demand high levels of coordination, specialized equipment, and resilience against artillery fire and entrenched defenses on opposing riverbanks.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/black-widow-2-ukraines-latest-weapon-in-river-operations-against-russia	2025-01-07T06:24:52-08:00	
Taiwan Conducts Military Drills Amid Concerns Over Defense Budget Cuts	Amid growing concerns about a potential reduction in the defense budget, Taiwan began three days of military drills on Tuesday. These exercises aim to showcase the island's ability to respond to increasing threats from China while addressing public concerns. The situation is particularly sensitive due to proposed legislative amendments that could significantly reduce defense spending. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The drills commenced in the northern city of Hsinchu, featuring tank maneuvers involving CM-11 tanks, which are being gradually replaced by newly acquired Abrams M1A2T tanks from the United States (Picture source: MoNDefense Taiwan) The drills commenced in the northern city of Hsinchu, featuring tank maneuvers involving CM-11 tanks, which are being gradually replaced by newly acquired Abrams M1A2T tanks from the United States. While these upgrades represent a technological improvement, some concerns have been raised regarding the weight of the new tanks and their effectiveness in preventing a potential Chinese amphibious landing. Troops arrived in armored personnel carriers, supported by Apache and S-70 helicopters providing reconnaissance and covering fire. Army Captain Chuang Yuan-cheng, of the 542nd Armored Brigade, explained that current capabilities allow a communication officer to coordinate aerial attacks from the ground. This ensures synchronization between ground and airborne firepower, reflecting efforts to enhance the interoperability of Taiwan's forces. The drills will continue on Wednesday with a demonstration of the Patriot III missile defense system, designed to counter Chinese ballistic missile threats. They will conclude on Thursday with anti-submarine exercises near Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest port. This strategically important area is considered a potential target for Chinese forces seeking to establish a supply foothold in the event of a conflict. Held annually ahead of the Lunar New Year, these exercises aim to reassure the Taiwanese public about the military's defensive capabilities while also supporting recruitment efforts. Concurrently, Taiwan is pursuing an ambitious military modernization program, including pending U.S. arms orders worth approximately $20 billion, upgrades to its F-16 fighter jets, and the development of domestically-produced submarines. Additionally, mandatory military service has recently been extended to one year to bolster troop numbers. However, a legislative proposal from the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, in cooperation with the Taiwan People's Party, threatens to reduce the defense budget by 28%. By altering the distribution of funds between the central and local governments, this measure could undermine Taiwan's ability to sustain its defense efforts. National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu has warned that such reductions might also weaken the willingness of allies like the United States, Japan, and the Philippines to assist Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China. Currently, Taiwan allocates approximately 2.4% of its GDP—around $20 billion—annually to defense spending. This investment regularly draws criticism from Beijing, which views U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as provocative. Although China has issued repeated warnings, calling these sales a 'dangerous game,' its responses have so far been limited to targeted economic sanctions on involved companies and frequent military displays near Taiwan. Despite this pressure, most Taiwanese continue to support the current state of de facto independence. In conclusion, these military drills take place in a context of rising internal and external tensions. While Taiwan strengthens its defensive capabilities to counter potential threats from China, uncertainties surrounding defense funding raise questions about the sustainability of its military posture in the long term.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-conducts-military-drills-amid-concerns-over-defense-budget-cuts	2025-01-07T06:12:57-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) The TLAM is a cornerstone of U.S. naval power, known for its long range, precision, and versatility. With a range exceeding 1,000 miles, these subsonic cruise missiles can strike deep into hostile territory while maintaining the safety of their launch platforms. The Tomahawk's navigation systems, which integrate GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain contour matching technologies, enable exceptional accuracy. This capability is critical for engaging high-value, fixed targets like fortified command centers and weapons depots, ensuring effective neutralization of threats with minimal collateral damage. The destroyers used in this operation are part of the Arleigh Burke-class, which are equipped with the Aegis Combat System and vertical launch systems (VLS). These destroyers offer a robust combination of firepower, situational awareness, and survivability. The use of VLS allowed for rapid and simultaneous missile launches, enabling a coordinated strike on multiple targets. Operating from the Red Sea, the destroyers exploited the long range of the TLAMs to engage targets in Yemen while remaining outside the immediate reach of hostile forces. The targeted Houthi facilities played a key role in the group’s military capabilities. Striking command centers disrupted their ability to coordinate operations, while destroying weapon production sites and storage depots reduced their capacity to manufacture and deploy advanced weapons. Many of these facilities were likely tied to Iranian support, as evidenced by the Houthis’ use of sophisticated drones and missiles in previous attacks. By targeting these assets, the operation aimed to degrade Houthi operational effectiveness and mitigate threats to regional stability. The choice of TLAMs reflects their strategic advantages in modern warfare. These missiles provide a combination of precision, range, and scalability, allowing commanders to engage multiple, dispersed targets simultaneously. Their ability to receive in-flight retargeting data further enhances flexibility, enabling adjustments based on real-time intelligence. While their cost is significant, estimated at $1.5 million per missile, their effectiveness in neutralizing critical infrastructure justifies their use against high-value targets. Conducting such an operation in the Red Sea presents its own challenges, given the area’s strategic importance as a major maritime route and its proximity to potential adversaries. The Houthis, supported by Iran, have previously targeted commercial shipping and military assets in the region using drones, mines, and anti-ship missiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/yemen-conflict-us-navy-dismantles-houthi-weapon-sites-with-tomahawks	2025-01-07T05:04:25-08:00

(Picture source: Taiwanese Coast Guard) In the early hours of January 3, damage was reported to a four-core international submarine cable near Taiwan's northeastern waters, off Keelung. Taiwan's Coast Guard identified a Cameroon-flagged cargo ship, Shunxing 39, as a possible culprit. The vessel had been navigating irregularly in the area and reportedly dragged its anchor at the exact location of the cable damage. Despite its foreign flag, the ship is registered to a Hong Kong-based company, Jie Yang Trading Co., whose sole listed owner is Guo Wenjie. The vessel, which attempted to leave the area due to poor sea conditions, is now en route to Busan, South Korea. Taiwan has sought South Korean assistance in investigating the ship and its activities. Chunghwa Telecom, the operator of the damaged cable, activated emergency backup systems to reroute communication traffic, successfully restoring service for affected customers in a short time. While no severe disruptions occurred, the incident underscores Taiwan’s vulnerability in safeguarding its communication infrastructure. The Taiwan Coast Guard dispatched vessels to investigate, requesting the Shunxing 39 to return to the site for inspection. However, adverse weather conditions hindered further actions, and the vessel proceeded toward its original destination in Busan. Taiwanese officials view the incident as part of a worrying global trend of submarine cable sabotage. A senior national security officer highlighted that many involved ships are often in poor condition and engaged in non-commercial activities, drawing comparisons to Russia's shadow fleet implicated in similar cases. Beijing has not officially responded to the incident, but Taiwanese lawmakers believe it is part of an escalating gray-zone strategy—using unconventional means to undermine Taiwan's security without direct conflict. Legislators have called for reinforced measures, including stricter cable protection zones, faster interception protocols, and the ability to detain suspected vessels. This is not the first time Taiwan’s submarine cables have been damaged. Over the past five years, cables connecting Taiwan’s main island to the Matsu Islands have been reportedly damaged nearly 30 times by Chinese vessels. Globally, submarine cables have become a focus of geopolitical tensions. In November 2024, Finland and Germany reported damage to the C-Lion1 cable, with a Chinese cargo ship, Yi Peng 3, flagged as a suspect. Similarly, the Newnew Polar Bear, a Chinese vessel, was linked to the October 2023 damage of a natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. Russian vessels have also been implicated in incidents, such as the Eagle S, suspected of damaging the Estlink 2 cable between Finland and Estonia last month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/taiwans-communication-cable-damaged-chinese-vessel-suspected-in-sabotage	2025-01-07T03:24:56-08:00

India to Upgrade Soviet-Era Anti-Aircraft Guns to Counter Drone Threats Along Borders	As part of its defense modernization strategy and efforts to address the growing threats posed by drones, India has initiated the development of specialized ammunition for two Russian-origin anti-aircraft systems, the ZU-23 and Schilka. This initiative aims to enhance the Indian Army's capabilities against the increasing drone threat while reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These munitions, designed for use with the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, will incorporate proximity fuse technology, enabling them to detonate near enemy drones (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) On January 2, 2025, the Indian Ministry of Defense issued a Request for Information (RFI) inviting local companies, both public and private, to submit proposals for the production of 23-mm anti-drone ammunition. These munitions, designed for use with the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, will incorporate proximity fuse technology, enabling them to detonate near enemy drones. This advancement seeks to address the limitations of existing munitions, which require a direct hit to neutralize targets. The ZU-23-2 is a Soviet-designed towed anti-aircraft gun adopted by India in the 1960s to bolster its close-range air defense. This system features two 23-mm automatic cannons mounted on a mobile platform, providing a combined rate of fire of approximately 2,000 rounds per minute. It uses 23 x 152 mm ammunition, including high-explosive incendiary tracer (HEI-T) and armor-piercing incendiary tracer (API-T) rounds. Primarily, the ZU-23-2 is deployed against low-flying aircraft and helicopters, as well as light ground targets. The ZSU-23-4 'Shilka' is a self-propelled anti-aircraft system introduced into the Indian arsenal in the 1970s. Mounted on a tracked chassis, it is armed with four 23-mm AZP-23 'Amur' automatic cannons, delivering a total firing rate of 3,400 rounds per minute. The Shilka is equipped with the RPK-2 'Tobol' radar, which provides aerial target detection and tracking capabilities over a range of up to 20 km. Carrying approximately 2,000 rounds of 23 x 152 mm ammunition, similar to the ZU-23-2, the Shilka is intended to protect mechanized units against low-altitude air threats. While the exact number of these systems in service with the Indian Army remains undisclosed, both platforms have been operational for several decades and have undergone modernization to address contemporary challenges. The development of specialized anti-drone munitions is set against the backdrop of global conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Caucasus, where drones have been extensively used for reconnaissance and targeted strikes. These aerial systems pose unique battlefield threats, including the potential to drop explosives on troops, tanks, or artillery positions. Currently, both the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, despite their high firing rates and armor-piercing ammunition, struggle to effectively engage drones due to their manual operation and low probability of direct hits. The introduction of proximity fuse technology is expected to significantly improve the effectiveness of these weapons, enhancing the Army's close-range air defense capabilities. Additional measures are already in place along the India-Pakistan border. The Border Security Force (BSF) employs laser-guided jammers to neutralize drones carrying narcotics from Pakistan. In 2024, nearly 290 small drones were intercepted in Punjab, with some disabled mid-flight. However, these systems, designed for non-military drones, are insufficient against more sophisticated aerial threats. In addition to this initiative, India has adopted other anti-drone solutions, including rifle-mounted systems and broader defense measures such as the Indrajaal counter-drone shield. Designed to protect areas of up to 2,000 square kilometers, Indrajaal demonstrates India's proactive approach to evolving warfare technologies.

Analysis: North Korea’s Hypersonic Missile Test Escalates Regional and Global Security Threats	On Monday, January 6, 2025, North Korea conducted a test launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) tipped with a hypersonic warhead, a move that has sharply elevated security concerns in the region and beyond. The missile, reportedly traveling 1,500 kilometers at a velocity of Mach 12—12 times the speed of sound—represents a significant escalation in Pyongyang’s missile technology. The test, personally supervised by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was described by state media as a pivotal step in bolstering the country’s defensive capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korea test-fires a hypersonic missile on January 6, 2025, escalating regional and global security threats (Picture source: North Korea press agency) According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the hypersonic missile is designed to 'reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state.' The South Korean military, which detected the launch, confirmed the missile’s trajectory from the Pyongyang area and noted it flew approximately 1,100 kilometers before landing in the East Sea (Sea of Japan). This marked North Korea’s first missile test of 2025 and underscored its intent to continue advancing its weapons programs despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts. The test’s strategic implications are profound, particularly due to the hypersonic technology employed. Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5, but their defining feature is their ability to maneuver unpredictably during flight. This combination of speed and agility makes them exceptionally difficult to detect, track, and intercept using existing missile defense systems. North Korea’s reported success in achieving a speed of Mach 12 amplifies these challenges, as regional defense systems, such as the U.S.-deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea or Japan’s Aegis-equipped destroyers, would have little time to respond. The missile’s range of 1,500 kilometers also underscores its potential to strike critical U.S. military installations in the Pacific, including those in Guam. These bases serve as key hubs for U.S. operations in the Indo-Pacific, providing logistical and strategic support to regional allies. A credible hypersonic missile capability targeting these installations fundamentally shifts the balance of power in the region, directly challenging U.S. military supremacy and deterrence. For South Korea, the proximity to North Korea amplifies the threat. Hypersonic missiles reduce detection and response times to such an extent that key South Korean cities, military installations, and infrastructure are left highly vulnerable. South Korea’s current political instability further complicates the situation. Following a failed attempt to impose martial law, President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached, leaving the nation’s leadership in disarray. This internal crisis has weakened South Korea’s ability to respond cohesively to North Korea’s provocations, exposing significant gaps in its national security. The test also sends a strong message to the United States, which is in a transitional political phase as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20, 2025. Analysts suggest the timing of the test was deliberate, aimed at leveraging the period of U.S. political uncertainty to demonstrate North Korea’s growing military prowess. By showcasing its hypersonic capability, Pyongyang is signaling its readiness to challenge the new U.S. administration while positioning itself for future negotiations. The test’s implications for Japan are equally alarming. The missile’s flight path into the East Sea (Sea of Japan) highlights Japan’s vulnerability to North Korea’s missile arsenal. As a close U.S. ally and a key regional security player, Japan will likely face intensified pressure to upgrade its missile defense systems to counter the hypersonic threat. This could trigger a broader arms race in the Indo-Pacific as nations seek to develop advanced defensive and offensive capabilities in response to North Korea’s actions. On a broader scale, North Korea’s successful hypersonic missile test threatens to destabilize the regional security environment. Hypersonic weapons pose unique challenges to the existing global security architecture, as their speed and maneuverability undermine traditional missile defense systems. This development could accelerate the proliferation of hypersonic technologies, with other nations racing to match or counter North Korea’s advancements. The international community, particularly through the United Nations Security Council, faces the difficult task of addressing this latest provocation. However, longstanding divisions among major powers such as China, Russia, and the United States complicate the prospect of unified action. Meanwhile, regional allies like South Korea and Japan will need to invest heavily in next-generation missile defense systems, including space-based sensors and counter-hypersonic technologies, to address this emerging threat. The risks of miscalculation are also rising. The combination of North Korea’s provocative actions, South Korea’s political turmoil, and the U.S. leadership transition creates a volatile environment where even minor incidents could spiral into more significant conflicts. Monday’s hypersonic missile test marks a turning point in North Korea’s weapons program, signaling its growing capability to threaten regional stability and global security. As Pyongyang continues to refine its hypersonic technology, the urgency for a coordinated response by the United States, its allies, and the broader international community has never been greater. Without decisive action, North Korea’s advancements risk emboldening the regime and heightening tensions in an already precarious Indo-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-north-koreas-hypersonic-missile-test-escalates-regional-and-global-security-threats	2025-01-07T01:00:27-08:00

North Korea has significantly expanded its ballistic missile capabilities in recent years, developing an arsenal ranging from short-range missiles like the KN-23 and KN-25 to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. In 2024, North Korea intensified its missile activities, including the launch of the advanced Hwasong-19 ICBM and the deployment of Hwasong-11D launchers near the southern border, each armed with short-range missiles. These actions align with a strategy aimed at reinforcing nuclear deterrence and asserting its presence on the global stage. The timing of this launch raises questions about its political motives. Some analysts suggest it might be an attempt to draw the attention of President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, and potentially restart stalled nuclear disarmament talks. However, Pyongyang appears cautious about resuming negotiations despite Trump’s interest in re-engaging. Geopolitically, reports suggest Russia might be providing satellite technologies to North Korea in exchange for military support in Ukraine. This potential cooperation has heightened international concerns, with Blinken emphasizing the importance of strengthened collaboration between Seoul and Tokyo to address threats from Pyongyang and China’s growing regional influence. In response to the launch, South Korea fired missiles into the sea as a show of deterrence. This underscores Seoul's resolve to counter any provocations, despite its domestic political challenges. Meanwhile, South Korean and U.S. forces remain on high alert, prepared to respond decisively to further escalations. As 2025 begins with renewed tensions, this event highlights the enduring security challenges on the Korean Peninsula.

The ACV has undergone nearly two years of rigorous testing and evaluation, designed to provide enhanced mobility, survivability, and operational capabilities compared to the aging AAV. Its first overseas operational deployment took place in Okinawa, Japan, with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) on June 24, 2024. Just a few days later, on June 29, III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) units received their own ACVs, marking the start of a new chapter in the Marine Corps’ amphibious operations. The Marine Corps has long recognized the need for robust amphibious capabilities, which remain central to its role as the nation’s expeditionary force in readiness. The ability to project power from the sea and conduct amphibious assaults is a core tenet of U.S. military doctrine, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, where contested littoral zones, rapid maneuvering, and the need for crisis response are critical. The transition from the AAV to the ACV is a response to these evolving demands, enhancing the Marine Corps’ ability to project power quickly and effectively from the sea to shore. The ACV was developed to modernize the Marine Corps’ amphibious assault capabilities. Unlike the AAV, which had limitations in terms of survivability, mobility, and communications, the ACV is designed with enhanced protection against land-based and maritime threats, greater speed, and improved maneuverability. It also offers superior communications capabilities, allowing Marines to maintain connectivity in challenging environments. The ACV can operate in a wide range of environments, including high-threat areas, urban combat zones, and areas with harsh environmental conditions, making it a versatile and essential asset for modern amphibious operations. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is the U.S. Marine Corps’ next-generation amphibious assault platform, designed to replace the aging Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV). (Picture U.S. The performance of the ACV at Kushi Crossing was a critical part of its integration into ongoing training and operations in Okinawa. According to 1st Lt. Jacob Yehl, the ACV platoon commander of 4th Marines, the mission was to validate the suitability of various training areas and beach landing sites (BLSs) for ACV operations. 'Since the ACV has been fielded here in July, these training areas have not yet been transited by ACVs or validated,' Yehl explained. 'Our mission here today, and on this rotation, is to make sure all of those training areas and BLSs are trafficable and supportable for ACV operations in the future.' The operation involved conducting amphibious exercises under varying conditions, including low tide, high tide, and low-light situations, ensuring that ACVs can perform effectively in a wide range of operational environments. Kushi Crossing is a particularly important site in Okinawa, as it provides the only entry point into the Central Training Area, a critical region for the integration of ACVs into larger training exercises. The ability of the ACVs to operate effectively at this location demonstrates their versatility and operational readiness. The ACV platoon’s central mission is to provide ship-to-shore lift for infantry and support the reinforcement of their assault as they move inland to key objectives. The transition from the AAV to the ACV is a significant one for many Marines, who have years of experience operating the older platform. Staff Sergeant Juwan White, a section leader in the ACV platoon, shared his perspective on this transition. 'I remember eight years ago I was driving an AAV from Recon Beach, Camp Schwab here to Kushi, regularly,' White recalled. 'Now here I am today doing the same thing with an ACV for the very first time for the next generations of Marines to do.' This shift reflects a broader modernization effort within the Marine Corps, ensuring that future Marines will be equipped with more capable and advanced vehicles for amphibious assault missions. The Marine Corps’ emphasis on maintaining robust amphibious capabilities is reflected in the strategic importance of units like the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The ACVs from the 4th Marine Regiment are attached to the 31st MEU, which is based at Camp Hansen, Okinawa. The 31st MEU is the Marine Corps' rapid-response force in the Indo-Pacific region, capable of responding to a wide range of contingencies, from humanitarian assistance to full-scale combat operations. The addition of the ACVs to the 31st MEU significantly enhances the unit’s amphibious capabilities, particularly in conducting ship-to-shore lift and supporting combat operations on land. As a rapid-response force, the 31st MEU is poised to provide a flexible and capable presence in the region, capable of responding quickly to emerging crises or conflicts. In addition to their role with the 31st MEU, the ACVs play a crucial part in the Marine Corps’ larger strategy for crisis response and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. The region is home to key U.S. allies, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, and is increasingly the focus of geopolitical competition. With tensions rising in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and other strategic areas, the Marine Corps’ ability to project power from the sea through amphibious operations is seen as a critical component of U.S. national security. The ability of the ACV to operate effectively in the Indo-Pacific region is crucial for maintaining the U.S. military’s amphibious capabilities and strengthening partnerships with regional allies. Staff Sgt. White emphasized the significance of the recent training at Kushi Crossing, stating, 'The primary message of the training we conducted is that we’ve proven and shown that ACVs belong here in Okinawa for III MEF to have at their disposal.' This reflects the growing confidence in the ACV as a reliable and integral part of the Marine Corps’ amphibious operations. As the ACV program continues to expand and evolve, it will play a central role in the U.S. Marine Corps’ strategy for amphibious warfare, ensuring that Marines are equipped with the most advanced and capable platforms for responding to future threats. The successful completion of the training mission in Okinawa demonstrates the operational effectiveness of the ACV and highlights its importance for future military operations in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. With its enhanced protection, mobility, and operational flexibility, the ACV is poised to play a key role in the Marine Corps’ ongoing efforts to maintain a strong and responsive amphibious force capable of confronting any challenge in today’s complex security environment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-marines-amphibious-combat-vehicle-completes-first-open-water-amphibious-movement-in-japan	2025-01-06T02:06:37-08:00

The creation of LTCYBERCOM is part of a broader plan to unify Lithuania’s cyber defense resources under a single authority. The new command includes a headquarters responsible for planning and implementing cyber operations, the Lithuanian Great Hetman Kristupas Radvila Perkūnas CIS Battalion, which will provide robust communication and information services throughout the defense structures, and the Cyber Defense Command’s IT Service, which emerged from the restructuring of the former IT service under the Ministry of National Defense. This reorganization consolidates several cyber functions under LTCYBERCOM’s mandate, while certain remaining tasks will be transferred to the National Cyber Security Center and the Core Centre of State Telecommunications, which also fall under the Ministry of National Defense. In parallel, the National Cyber Security Center will continue to serve as the national cybersecurity agency, providing cyber incident response and resilience across government entities and key sectors. Its activities will complement LTCYBERCOM’s efforts to build a comprehensive defense posture nationwide. LTCYBERCOM’s legal foundation was laid in July 2024, when the Seimas—the Lithuanian parliament—approved the Ministry of National Defense’s proposal to amend the law defining the principal structure of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. These legislative changes paved the way for the official inauguration of the new command. By establishing LTCYBERCOM, Lithuania adopts a proactive stance in a global context marked by rapidly evolving cyber threats. This initiative not only strengthens Lithuania’s internal defenses but also enhances its ability to collaborate closely with its NATO Allies. As cyber warfare becomes an increasingly central aspect of national security, the new Lithuanian Cyber Defense Command is poised to play a major role in safeguarding both national and collective interests.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lithuania-launches-new-cyber-defense-command-to-strengthen-national-and-nato-cybersecurity	2025-01-06T00:35:13-08:00

Iran to Enter Russian Su-35 Fighter Jets into Service by 2025 Strengthening Air Power	Based on a report from the Iran Observer X account on January 4, 2025, Iran is preparing to integrate Russia's cutting-edge Su-35 fighter jets into its air force by 2025. The Sukhoi Su-35, a multirole 4.5-generation fighter, will bolster Iran's aging fleet, significantly enhancing its aerial capabilities. This move follows a growing military partnership between Iran and Russia, especially in light of their close cooperation during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Su-35 fighter jet will enter service with the Iranian Air Force by 2025, enhancing Iran's air power amid growing military cooperation with Russia. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The Russian Su-35 fighter jets deal, which has been in the works for several years, is a key milestone in the evolving defense relations between Iran and Russia. The announcement of this delivery follows earlier reports that Russia would supply these advanced fighter jets to Iran in exchange for Tehran's support in the form of military supplies, notably drones. Satellite imagery has confirmed the construction of special shelters at Iran's 3rd Tactical Air Base near Hamadan, designed to accommodate the Su-35s.While Iranian officials have not confirmed the exact number of Su-35s to be delivered, various reports suggest the first batch could consist of around 24 aircraft. The jets are expected to be in service by 2025, with the potential for further acquisitions in the future. This acquisition marks a substantial upgrade for the Iranian Air Force, which has long struggled with outdated fighter jets. The Su-35, often referred to as the 'Flanker-E,' is one of Russia's most advanced fighter jets. It is a multirole, twin-engine, air superiority aircraft capable of engaging in both aerial combat and ground attack missions. The Su-35 is equipped with a powerful Irbis-E radar, advanced avionics, and the ability to carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. This gives it a significant edge over many of Iran's current aircraft, such as the aging F-4 Phantom and MiG-29 fighters. The Su-35's thrust vectoring engines allow for superior maneuverability in combat, while its long-range radar and ability to engage multiple targets at once make it a formidable opponent. Its advanced electronic warfare capabilities and data fusion systems will also enhance Iran's overall air defense network. Currently, the Iranian Air Force operates a mixed fleet of mostly older jets, many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s. The F-14A Tomcat, acquired before the 1979 revolution, is still a core component of Iran's air force, though it has suffered from technical issues and limited operational readiness. In addition to the F-14s, Iran flies F-4 Phantom IIs, MiG-29s, and Soviet-era Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, all of which are nearing the end of their operational life. Iran's reliance on these older aircraft has made air superiority a challenge, especially in the face of modern, western-supplied aircraft in neighboring countries. The arrival of the Su-35s will provide a much-needed boost to Iran’s air capabilities and help it assert greater control over its airspace. The delivery of Su-35s to Iran is part of a broader shift in military cooperation between the two countries. Iran has been supplying Russia with advanced drones for use in the Ukraine conflict, and in return, Russia has provided Iran with significant military technology. The Su-35 deal is a further sign of the growing strategic alignment between Tehran and Moscow, driven in part by their mutual interests in countering Western influence in the Middle East and the broader region. This partnership comes at a time when Russia is increasingly isolated on the global stage due to its actions in Ukraine, and Iran, too, has faced extensive sanctions. Both nations are turning to each other for defense supplies, with Russia also providing Iran with sophisticated air defense systems like the S-400 and the Tor-M2. Integrating Su-35s into the Iranian Air Force marks a new phase in the country's military modernization. While the acquisition will undoubtedly enhance Iran’s combat capabilities, experts note that the number of Su-35s may still be insufficient to fully rival regional adversaries' air power. However, the strategic value of the jets, combined with Iran’s increasing drone capabilities, suggests that Tehran will be better equipped to deter potential threats and assert its regional ambitions. As Iran continues to strengthen its air capabilities, the implications for regional security will be profound, with neighboring countries likely reassessing their defense postures in light of these developments. The deeper military ties between Iran and Russia may also lead to further arms deals, creating a new dynamic in the Middle East's volatile security environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/iran-to-enter-russian-su-35-fighter-jets-into-service-by-2025-strengthening-air-power	2025-01-05T07:57:46-08:00

The 'Arkhangelsk' was officially launched on November 29, 2023, and is the 141st nuclear-powered submarine built at Sevmash, a shipbuilding facility under the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC). The design and development of the submarine were spearheaded by the Malachite Design Bureau in St. Petersburg. Four additional Yasen-M submarines—Perm, Ulyanovsk, Voronezh, and Vladivostok—are at various stages of construction and will soon join the fleet. Currently, four Yasen-class submarines, Severodvinsk, Kazan, Novosibirsk, and Krasnoyarsk, are operational within the Russian Navy. The success of the lead submarine, Kazan, during its recent mission to Cuba demonstrated the effectiveness of the Yasen-M class in maintaining Russian naval presence in global waters. Russian submarine Fleet The Russian submarine fleet comprises several categories of submarines, each serving specific roles. Nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines are the backbone of Russia’s strategic deterrent, carrying intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Borei-class, featuring modern designs, quieter propulsion systems, and capable of carrying 16 Bulava ICBMs, represents the latest in this category, while older Delta IV-class submarines provide additional strategic depth. Nuclear-powered attack submarines are designed for hunting enemy submarines and surface ships and can carry cruise missiles for land-attack roles. The Yasen-class is Russia’s most advanced attack submarine, with stealth features and a versatile weapon suite, including Kalibr and Oniks cruise missiles. Other classes, like the Akula and Oscar II, also contribute to this capability, with the latter notable for its anti-ship Granit missiles. Diesel-electric attack submarines, primarily used for coastal defense and littoral operations, are quieter than their nuclear counterparts. The Kilo-class, known for its low acoustic signature, is widely deployed, while the Lada-class represents a new generation of diesel-electric submarines with advanced air-independent propulsion. Russia also operates specialized and auxiliary submarines, such as the Belgorod, a modified Oscar II-class submarine designed to carry the Poseidon nuclear-powered underwater drone. The fleet includes smaller submarines for covert missions, underwater cable interference, and seabed research. Strategic deterrence is achieved through regular patrols by ballistic missile submarines in Arctic waters and the North Atlantic, ensuring survivable second-strike capability in the event of a nuclear conflict. Borei-class submarines operate under the protection of the Northern Fleet’s Arctic bastions, leveraging the region’s geographic advantages. Attack submarines, particularly the Yasen-class, bolster Russia’s anti-access/area denial strategy by targeting NATO carrier strike groups and maritime logistics. Diesel-electric submarines, like the Kilo-class, enhance this capability in enclosed seas such as the Baltic. Russian submarines have been used in conflict zones, such as the Eastern Mediterranean during the Syrian Civil War, to launch precision strikes with Kalibr cruise missiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russias-nuclear-submarine-fleet-grows-with-arkhangelsk	2025-01-03T07:42:28-08:00	
Russian Warships Monitored Near UK by HMS Somerset Over Holidays	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 1, 2025, the Royal Navy maintained a vigilant watch over a Russian naval task group passing the British Isles during the Christmas holidays. HMS Somerset, a Type 23 frigate, was mobilized on December 27 after the corvette RFS Soobrazitelny and its support vessels, MV Sparta II and MV General Skobelev, were detected in the North Sea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Navy's HMS Somerset monitors the movements of the Russian corvette RFS Soobrazitelny. (Picture source: UK MoD) The crew of HMS Somerset, recalled from their Christmas leave, swiftly prepared for deployment, leaving Devonport Naval Base to intercept and shadow the Russian vessels.

A Merlin helicopter from 814 Naval Air Squadron, stationed at RNAS Culdrose, provided aerial support during the mission. When weather conditions allowed, the helicopter conducted surveillance and captured imagery of both the Russian ships and HMS Somerset’s operations. Context The Russian shadow fleet represents a covert network of vessels employed by Russia to bypass international sanctions, particularly targeting its oil exports. This fleet has grown substantially following the imposition of sanctions in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, now comprising over 1,100 vessels, including many aging tankers acquired to sustain oil transportation. Operating under flags of convenience from countries with lax maritime regulations and employing opaque ownership structures, the fleet uses deceptive practices such as disabling Automatic Identification Systems, conducting ship-to-ship transfers in remote waters, and falsifying cargo documentation. These activities enable the fleet to obscure the origins and destinations of shipments. The shadow fleet poses significant risks across various domains. Environmentally, its reliance on old and poorly maintained vessels raises the potential for spills and other ecological disasters, as seen in incidents like the December 2024 oil spill in the Black Sea. From a maritime safety perspective, the clandestine nature of its operations, including AIS blackouts, increases the likelihood of collisions and accidents, threatening maritime traffic and coastal communities. There is also a security dimension, as the fleet could be leveraged for military purposes, such as transporting equipment or personnel, heightening concerns among NATO members and other global powers. Efforts to counter the shadow fleet include initiatives by Western nations to disrupt its operations and enforce sanctions more rigorously. However, despite these measures, the fleet continues to operate.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-warships-monitored-near-uk-by-hms-somerset-over-holidays	2025-01-03T06:18:18-08:00

Leaked Document Unveils Russia’s Plans for Targeting Key Sites in Japan and South Korea	Recently leaked Russian military documents have unveiled detailed plans for potential attacks on Japan and South Korea, targeting strategic civilian infrastructure, including nuclear power plants. These files, dated from 2013-2014 and obtained by the Financial Times through Western sources, highlight Moscow’s concerns about the vulnerability of its eastern flank in the event of a conflict with NATO and its Asian allies. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The cache of 29 secret documents reveals how Russia, wary of a coordinated attack by U.S. forces stationed in Japan and South Korea, identified a list of 160 priority targets. These include military facilities such as airbases and naval installations, as well as critical civilian infrastructure like tunnels, bridges, energy complexes, and industrial sites. The documents reflect Moscow’s strategic apprehension over the perceived threat posed by Asia-Pacific allies of the West. In the event of a conflict in Europe, Russia anticipates a 'horizontal escalation,' extending hostilities to Asia to counter or neutralize adversaries potentially supporting a Western offensive. The plans highlight the use of the Kh-101 cruise missile as a key weapon among the scenarios described. This system, designed for precision strikes, was proposed to neutralize key installations in Japan and South Korea. One scenario includes a simulated attack on a Japanese radar base at Okushiritou, featuring detailed assessments of target structures and expected damage. Of the 160 identified targets, 82 are military, such as command centers and radar installations. The remaining targets include critical civilian infrastructure, such as Japan’s Kanmon tunnel and nuclear energy complexes. In South Korea, strategic bridges and major industrial sites, including the Pohang steelworks, were also designated as priorities. The meticulous planning is evident in the precise calculations for damaging heavily fortified facilities in South Korea. These details underscore the depth of Russian preparations for a potential conflict in the region. This revelation emerges at a time when Asia plays a significant role in President Vladimir Putin’s broader strategy. Russia has recently deepened its ties with North Korea, deploying 12,000 North Korean troops to assist its operations in Ukraine and offering economic and military support to Pyongyang. This dynamic underscores Moscow’s view of an intrinsic link between European and Asian theaters of conflict. Experts argue that the plans confirm the interconnected nature of conflicts in Europe and Asia. William Alberque, a former NATO arms control official, emphasized that these documents illustrate the impossibility of Asia remaining unaffected by a European conflict and vice versa. Despite Russia’s confidence in the Kh-101 missiles, their performance during the Ukraine conflict has revealed limitations. Experts note the missiles' lack of stealth against layered air defenses and insufficient accuracy for precision strikes, which is a significant drawback for low-yield munitions reliant on pinpoint targeting. For Japan, these plans present a unique challenge, as the Russian threat is often perceived as secondary by the general public, despite consistent monitoring by the Japanese military. A rapid escalation originating in Europe would leave Tokyo with limited warning time, complicating its defense strategy. The strained relationship between Russia and Japan, further exacerbated by unresolved territorial disputes over the Kuril Islands, adds complexity. While then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed commitment to negotiations on the matter, Russian statements have signaled an uncompromising stance. In South Korea, the documents highlight the vulnerability of critical civilian and industrial infrastructure, such as refineries and chemical plants in Busan, underlining the strategic importance of these targets in a conflict scenario. In addition to attack plans, the documents include reports on Russian bomber flights intended to test the air defenses of the region. One report details a February 2014 mission during the annexation of Crimea, where Tu-95 bombers conducted flights near South Korea and Japan, documenting responses from local air forces. Similar maneuvers, such as Tu-142 flights in 2024, reflect Moscow’s continued efforts to assess and potentially exploit regional vulnerabilities. While these plans from 2013-2014 appear strategically plausible, their feasibility is questionable. The Kh-101 missiles, central to the scenarios, have demonstrated technical limitations, and the evolving geopolitical landscape presents further challenges. There is no public information confirming the modernization of these plans, although Russia's actions, including military flights near Japan, indicate sustained interest in the Asia-Pacific region. In conclusion, the leaked documents offer a rare glimpse into the depth of Russian military planning for potential conflicts in Asia. They highlight Moscow’s concerns over the vulnerability of its eastern borders and the interconnected nature of global conflict theaters. While some capabilities may have been overstated, the revelations underscore the complexity of contemporary geopolitical dynamics and the challenges faced by Japan and South Korea in ensuring their security against multifaceted threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/leaked-document-unveils-russias-plans-for-targeting-key-sites-in-japan-and-south-korea	2025-01-02T05:26:52-08:00	
Japan Proposes New Frigate Deal to Indonesia to Counter South China Sea Tensions	According to information published by the Japan News on January 1, 2025, the Japanese government has decided to reintroduce a proposal for joint development of Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) frigates with Indonesia, aiming to enhance security collaboration with nations in East Asia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During a photo exercise for the Integrated Battle Problem (IBP), the Mogami-class frigate JS Kumano (FFM-2) from the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force maneuvered alongside the unmanned surface vessels Ranger and Mariner.

This visit seeks to capitalize on a new political dynamic under Indonesia’s recently inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto, who is familiar with Japan-Indonesia defense negotiations from his tenure as defense minister. Nakatani’s discussions are expected to lay the groundwork for a subsequent visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later in January, potentially leading to a high-level summit between the two nations. Japan’s proposal includes the joint development of frigates tailored to MSDF specifications. This initiative aligns with Indonesia’s strategic interests, as the country has previously shown interest in advanced maritime defense capabilities, including submarines. However, earlier talks under former President Joko Widodo’s administration stalled due to financial constraints linked to Indonesia’s ambitious capital relocation project. President Prabowo’s administration marks a renewed opportunity to revisit these discussions. Indonesia’s increasing concern over China’s assertive activities in the South China Sea, despite its strong economic ties with Beijing, adds urgency to Jakarta’s interest in diversifying its defense partnerships. Japan’s defense export policies, governed by the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, currently limit the export of finished military assets to non-combat applications such as surveillance and minesweeping. Consequently, Japan is pursuing joint development arrangements as a more feasible pathway to transfer advanced defense technology to Indonesia. This approach aligns with Japan’s revised National Security Strategy of 2022, which promotes defense exports through public-private collaboration to enhance ties with like-minded nations and strengthen its defense industrial base. The potential joint development of frigates could enhance strategic cooperation between Japan and Indonesia, particularly in maritime security. This collaboration would be a pivotal step in countering security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, including China’s maritime expansion. Indonesia’s partnership with Japan in frigate development mirrors Tokyo’s ongoing efforts to secure defense cooperation with other allies. For instance, Japan has proposed a joint frigate development project to Australia based on the Mogami-class design. The Australian government has shortlisted Japan and Germany as finalists for the initiative, with a decision expected in the second half of 2025.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-proposes-new-frigate-deal-to-indonesia-to-counter-south-china-sea-tensions	2025-01-02T05:05:35-08:00

Focus: US-based GA-ASI Develops Gambit New Unmanned Aircraft to Support F-35 & Next-Gen Fighter Operations	The future of air power lies in the seamless integration of manned and unmanned systems, where autonomous unmanned aircraft serve as force multipliers, complementing and augmenting the capabilities of advanced human-crewed fighters. At the forefront of this transformation is General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) with its Gambit advanced unmanned aircraft series, designed to work alongside the most advanced manned aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II and the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link American Company GA-ASI develops the Gambit Autonomous unmanned aircraft to enhance F-35 and Next-Gen fighter operations through collaborative missions. (Picture source: GA-ASI) The central goal of the Gambit family of unmanned aircraft is to pair large numbers of autonomous systems with potent human-piloted fighters, ensuring that future air forces can dominate the battlespace with a combination of magazine depth, sustained situational awareness, and adaptability—all while minimizing risks to human pilots. In the high-stakes, dynamic environment of modern warfare, a pilot in an advanced fighter like the F-35 is faced with increasingly complex missions that demand more than just raw firepower and agility. These pilots need the ability to operate in a more collaborative, multi-dimensional combat environment—where autonomous unmanned aircraft serve as teammates, carrying out critical tasks that increase the overall operational effectiveness of the air force. Here’s how the Gambit series helps fulfill these roles: Magazine Depth and Force Augmentation: One of the most challenging aspects of modern air combat is ensuring that a combat force can sustain offensive and defensive operations. The concept of magazine depth refers to the ability to maintain a continuous supply of munitions and operational capability during prolonged engagements. The Gambit platforms play a pivotal role here by providing unmanned magazine depth—aircraft that can carry additional weapons, sensors, and combat payloads without placing a strain on human pilots. These unmanned systems can provide critical support to human-crewed fighters, including arming, resupply, and additional combat options that extend the reach and lethality of the entire air package. Situational Awareness and Surveillance: The modern battlefield is more congested and contested than ever before. Pilots in F-35s or NGAD systems require constant, real-time intelligence to make critical decisions. The Gambit platforms, particularly models like the Gambit 1, are built for persistent surveillance. By flying in coordinated swarms, these autonomous aircraft can surveil vast stretches of airspace, detect threats, and relay intelligence back to human pilots and other systems in the air and on the ground. The Gambit’s ability to sense, process, and share data autonomously allows human operators to make quicker, more informed decisions while staying one step ahead of adversaries. GA-ASI’s Gambit Series: Four advanced unmanned aircraft variants—Gambit 1 for surveillance, Gambit 2 for combat, Gambit 3 for training, and Gambit 4 for stealth and endurance—designed to collaborate with F-35 and Next-Gen fighters. (Picture source GA-ASI) Evasion and Detection Mitigation: One of the most potent advantages of unmanned systems like the Gambit is their ability to evade detection and operate in high-threat environments without risking human lives. Gambit aircraft, such as the Gambit 4, are designed with advanced low-observable technologies, ensuring that they can operate in contested airspaces, gathering critical information or striking high-value targets, while remaining undetected. By flying in close formation with manned aircraft or operating autonomously, these drones can reduce human pilots' exposure to enemy radar or missile systems, essentially acting as decoys or providing countermeasures. Autonomous Action and Collaboration: The Gambit series is not just about surveillance or force augmentation; these systems can take autonomous action when required. For instance, the Gambit 2 model can engage adversary aircraft in air-to-air combat, acting independently or in concert with other unmanned systems. These aircraft are equipped with AI-driven systems that enable them to make real-time decisions, from evading incoming threats to engaging in offensive actions. When integrated with manned systems, they provide actionable intelligence and can execute predefined combat missions while operating collaboratively and synchronously with human pilots. This autonomy reduces the cognitive load on human pilots, allowing them to focus on the most critical aspects of the mission while knowing that their unmanned teammates are handling key tasks. Whether it's intercepting enemy aircraft, neutralizing surface-to-air threats, or carrying out intelligence collection, Gambit platforms act as an autonomous extension of the pilot’s capabilities, ready to execute orders or respond to changing combat conditions without direct human input. Fulfilling the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) Concept: The Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) concept that GA-ASI and the U.S. Air Force are pushing toward envisions a highly collaborative and scalable force architecture, where human-piloted fighters, such as the F-35 Lightning II, are complemented by large numbers of autonomous unmanned aircraft—like the Gambit series. These unmanned aircraft are designed to work seamlessly with human pilots, forming a collaborative network that dynamically adapts to evolving battlefield conditions. By allowing unmanned aircraft to take on some of the most hazardous and mundane tasks, human pilots are freed up to focus on higher-value operations, knowing their 'teammates' are performing complementary functions. A key advantage of the Gambit series is its cost-effectiveness, allowing the deployment of large numbers of unmanned systems without the prohibitive costs typically associated with fighter jets. This scalability is crucial as future air forces will need to overcome the economic and logistical challenges of maintaining a high number of advanced aircraft, especially given the increasing complexity and expense of cutting-edge fighters like the F-35 and NGAD systems. The Gambit 4 is a combat reconnaissance variant featuring a tail-less design and swept wings. It is optimized for long-endurance, specialized missions, incorporating low-observable technologies and advanced systems to evade enemy detection. (Picture source GA-ASI) By leveraging shared components across the different Gambit models, GA-ASI is able to streamline production and reduce costs, making it feasible to field large numbers of autonomous aircraft that can augment the capabilities of human pilots at a fraction of the cost of a manned fighter. This approach also allows air forces to field a diverse mix of capabilities, ranging from ISR platforms to combat drones, all tailored to specific mission sets, and all operating in concert with human crews. The Gambit family includes a series of variants, each optimized for specific roles in this integrated, collaborative air combat environment. These variants range from Gambit 1, designed primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, to Gambit 2, which is configured for combat and offensive actions. The Gambit 3 is a platform primarily aimed at training, simulating both unmanned and manned systems in realistic air combat scenarios. Finally, the Gambit 4 is the most advanced model, integrating cutting-edge stealth and hybrid-electric propulsion for long-endurance missions and specialized low-observable capabilities. Each model in the Gambit series works in harmony with the others, providing a comprehensive, scalable solution for modern air forces. The Gambit series represents the strategic shift that is already underway in air combat—moving away from the reliance on a few high-end fighters and toward a distributed, collaborative force where both manned and unmanned systems operate in synergy. By pairing human-crewed fighters with autonomous unmanned aircraft, the future air force will achieve new levels of operational flexibility, speed, and effectiveness. This transformation is essential as potential adversaries, like China and Russia, continue to develop advanced air defense systems and aerial platforms. The Gambit series’ ability to operate autonomously in contested environments, while providing human pilots with the necessary support to achieve air dominance, ensures that the U.S. and its allies can maintain an edge in the rapidly changing landscape of aerial warfare. The Gambit series is not just about technology—it’s about rethinking air combat in a way that maximizes the combined power of human decision-making and autonomous systems. With its focus on collaboration, cost-effectiveness, and mission adaptability, the Gambit is poised to be a cornerstone of the future air force, where human pilots work alongside large numbers of unmanned systems to maintain supremacy in the skies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-based-ga-asi-develops-gambit-new-unmanned-aircraft-to-support-f-35-next-gen-fighter-operations	2024-12-31T06:49:28-08:00

DARPA and US Navy Achieve Milestone in Autonomous Naval Refueling	According to information published by the US DoD on December 19, 2024, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has completed a groundbreaking automated fueling-at-sea (FAS) test under its No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program. This achievement marks a critical step forward in enabling unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to operate autonomously over extended durations without requiring human presence aboard the receiving vessel.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link DARPA's NOMARS program achieves a milestone with the first successful automated fueling-at-sea test. (Picture source: US DoD) The NOMARS program is developing USVs that can function independently, eliminating the need for crew accommodations or safety provisions onboard. This recent test was conducted with support from the U.S. Navy’s PMS-406 (Unmanned Maritime Systems Program Office) and USV Squadron 1 (USVRON-1) using two experimental USVs: Ranger and Mariner. Fueling USVs at sea poses unique challenges, as current methods require personnel to handle lines and hoses. These constraints complicate USV design and expose crew members to risks when transferring personnel during adverse sea conditions. The NOMARS program addresses these challenges by implementing a refueling approach that keeps humans aboard the refueling vessel while automating operations on the USV. For the recent demonstration, Ranger carried a prototype receiving station designed for the NOMARS USV Defiant, while Mariner was outfitted with a specialized refueling mini-station developed by the program’s prime contractor, Serco Inc. Though personnel were present on both vessels for safety oversight, the system operated autonomously on the receiving side throughout the test. The trial validated all aspects of the fueling concept, including the handoff of the lead-line, the connection of the refueling probe to the USV, and the subsequent simulated fuel transfer using water. Conducted entirely on the water, this test demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of the NOMARS FAS system in a real-world scenario. DARPA highlighted the critical support and resources provided by PMS-406 and USVRON-1 as instrumental to the test’s success. This collaboration ensures the FAS system aligns closely with the operational requirements of the U.S. Navy and the Military Sealift Command (MSC). The next phase of the program will test the FAS system on the NOMARS USV Defiant during its sea trials, scheduled to begin in spring 2025. Defiant, a 180-foot, 240-metric-ton autonomous vessel, is designed for long-term, human-free operation. These trials will further validate the system’s performance during extended, multi-month deployments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/darpa-and-us-navy-achieve-milestone-in-autonomous-naval-refueling	2024-12-27T00:44:51-08:00	
Focus | China could dominate the sky with two flying sixth-generation fighter jets as the US struggles to design one	On December 26, 2024, China revealed two sixth-generation combat aircraft prototypes developed independently by Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) and Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). Both prototypes conducted their first flights on December 26, 2024. The date coincided with Mao Zedong’s birthday anniversary and the 13th anniversary of the rollout of the J-20 stealth fighter. The public flights are viewed as part of a calculated effort to publicize China’s latest military advancements, coinciding with the launch of the Type 076 Sichuan twin-island assault carrier and the Y-20 AWACS on the same day.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chengdu prototype, on the left, features a trijet, tailless diamond-delta wing configuration, while the Shenyang prototype, on the right, has a twin-engine configuration and incorporates a cranked arrow-wing configuration with what seems to be foldable full-movable vertical stabilizers. (Picture source: Weibo) The Chengdu prototype, known as the Cheng-6 on Chinese social media, features a trijet, tailless flying wing design. Its length is approximately 26 meters, and it employs a diamond-delta wing configuration with extended chine lines. The absence of vertical and horizontal tail surfaces suggests design priorities centered on radar signature reduction and aerodynamic efficiency. This design configuration indicates its potential use in roles requiring long-range missions, high-speed flight, and significant payloads, such as heavy tactical fighter or regional bomber missions. The Cheng-6 was accompanied by a J-20S twin-seat variant during its test flight. The J-20S had previously been speculated upon following a promotional video in 2021 and images released in 2022. It was officially unveiled at the Zhuhai Air Show 2024. This twin-seat variant introduces a rear seat to enable additional mission roles, including electronic suppression, tactical command, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm control. It is equipped with PL-15E and PL-10E missiles, allowing it to perform tasks such as ground strikes and UAV coordination. The twin-seat configuration is intended to distribute operational workload, with one operator focused on tactical roles and the other on sensor management. The J-20S may contribute to the 'loyal wingman' program by directing UAVs for reconnaissance, surveillance, and strike tasks. Once operational, it could influence the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) by introducing networked and data-driven air combat tactics. It is described as the first officially revealed fifth-generation two-seat fighter. The smaller Shenyang prototype, named the Shen-6, has a twin-engine configuration and measures approximately 21 meters in length. It incorporates a cranked arrow-wing configuration with what seems to be foldable full-movable vertical stabilizers. These stabilizers lay flat during cruising, forming a tailless design to enhance stealth and lift-drag efficiency, and rise during maneuvers to create a V-tail configuration for better control. It incorporates diverterless supersonic inlets (DSIs) located below the wing roots. The Shen-6 is likely to use components from other Shenyang aircraft, such as the J-35, as it is the most modern in the range, for example, the avionics and engines. Like the J-35, the Shen-6’s design characteristics indicate it could be suited for multi-role operations, including carrier-based missions. It was accompanied by a Shenyang J-16 fighter during its test flight. Both prototypes prioritize designs to reduce radar and infrared signatures. The Cheng-6’s trijet configuration may enhance performance in high-speed and high-altitude operations, while the Shen-6 employs diverterless supersonic intakes to optimize stealth and aerodynamic efficiency. The prototypes are understood to be in early stages of flight testing, with no high-resolution imagery confirming internal weapon bays. Analysts view the Chengdu and Shenyang prototypes as complementary rather than competitive, with the Chengdu prototype’s design considered consistent with characteristics attributed to the JH-XX tactical fighter-bomber concept, while the Shenyang prototype introduces features aimed at enhancing operational flexibility. Both aircraft align with principles associated with sixth-generation fighter designs, including advanced stealth, integration with unmanned systems, and networked combat capabilities. The Shen-6 could be equipped with foldable full-movable vertical stabilizers. These stabilizers lay flat during cruising, forming a tailless design to enhance stealth and lift-drag efficiency, and rise during maneuvers to create a V-tail configuration for better control. (Picture source: Weibo/伏尔戈星图) Sixth-generation aircraft are generally characterized by their focus on stealth features optimized for reducing radar signatures across multiple frequencies, often employing tailless (for Chengdu) or minimal control surface designs (for Shenyang). These aircraft typically integrate high-performance propulsion systems, such as variable-cycle engines, to enable sustained high-speed cruising and extended range. They are expected to operate optionally manned, with capabilities to function within a networked 'system of systems,' including artificial intelligence, advanced sensors, and data-sharing technologies. Modular payload configurations are anticipated to allow flexibility across roles, including air superiority, ground attack, and electronic warfare. These characteristics aim to address evolving air combat requirements, including survivability and adaptability in contested environments. In June 2024, China also conducted a test flight for a new aviation concept involving a stealth aircraft integrated with two detachable drones. This flight, held at an airport near the Mu Us Desert in Ningxia, showcased a blended wing-body design with delta wings. During the flight, sections of the main aircraft's wings detached, transforming into drones powered by electric ducted fans. The separation process caused shifts in the aircraft's center of gravity and wing area, momentarily affecting stability. However, the aircraft and drones regained stable flight due to the implementation of advanced aerodynamic designs and automated control algorithms. This test flight was characterized as a demonstration of a new approach to integrating manned and unmanned systems for coordinated operations. The system, developed by the Aerospace Technology Institute of the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC), employs a rear-edge docking layout, enabling drones to separate from the trailing edge of the main aircraft's wings. According to CARDC engineer Du Xin, this configuration addresses challenges such as speed mismatches and range limitations between crewed aircraft and drones. The system utilizes the FCC-100 flight control computer from Northwestern Polytechnical University, designed to manage complex calculations and ensure flight stability. The team also employed advanced control algorithms and high-performance components to maintain precision during separation. This design is intended to explore new modes of combat operations, reflecting China's ongoing testing of new next-generation features. Globally, the development of sixth-generation aircraft continues among other major powers. The United States is advancing its sixth-generation fighter development through the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program for the Air Force and the F/A-XX program for the Navy. These projects prioritize advanced stealth features, integration with unmanned systems, and improvements in propulsion technologies. Despite these efforts, budget constraints and evolving priorities have led to discussions about adjusting the scale or timelines of these programs. Europe, meanwhile, is pursuing two collaborative initiatives: the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a partnership between the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan aimed at delivering a next-generation fighter by 2035, and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), a joint effort among France, Germany, and Spain. Both programs focus on integrating advanced technologies such as supersonic performance, virtual reality cockpits, and networked operational capabilities. Russia is in the early stages of conceptualizing its sixth-generation fighter, with a prototype expected by 2050. Efforts are currently directed toward understanding the requirements of future conflicts and technological advancements to inform the design. Sweden's Saab is independently exploring concepts for both manned and unmanned sixth-generation fighters as part of efforts to develop next-generation platforms for its armed forces. In India, the primary focus remains the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), a fifth-generation project, though there is interest in exploring sixth-generation technologies. At this stage, no official sixth-generation program has been announced in India. These programs collectively reflect global efforts to address future air combat needs through advanced fighter technologies. China's recent test flights of two new sixth-generation stealth fighter jets, the Cheng-6 and Shen-6, show that Chinese programs are much more advanced than previously thought. In a potential conflict with the United States, likely for Taiwan, China could potentially deploy these advanced stealth aircraft designed to evade known detection systems and challenge traditional U.S. air superiority. This fact may prompt the United States to reevaluate its strategic priorities by continuing to develop fighter jets, even though some say they are outdated, to maintain a competitive edge. The Shen-6's general design could be influenced by these earlier fighter designs from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre.

Defense Investigation: What is the Possible Cause Behind Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 Crash Near Aktau?	Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243, which tragically crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on December 25, 2024, may have been struck by a missile fired from a Russian air defense system, according to preliminary findings from aviation investigators. Although the exact details of the missile’s origin are still under investigation, information from multiple sources, including government and military experts, suggest the involvement of a surface-to-air missile, possibly launched from a Pantsir-S1 air defense missiles/cannons system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from video footage showing the moment of the crash of Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on December 25, 2024. (Video footage Social Network Screenshot) The incident occurred when Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 was operating a scheduled commercial flight from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny, Russia, with a stopover in Aktau, Kazakhstan. The Boeing 737-800, carrying 122 passengers and crew members, departed from Baku at 03:55 UTC. Everything appeared normal until the flight lost contact at 04:25 UTC, shortly after entering Kazakh airspace. At 04:37 UTC, some erroneous data was transmitted from the aircraft before contact was entirely lost. The wreckage was later found about 50 kilometers south of Aktau, near the Caspian Sea. Sadly, all on board perished in the crash. Initial analysis of the aircraft’s flight data, particularly the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data, provides important clues regarding the crash. The flight took off from Baku on schedule and transmitted valid ADS-B data until 04:25 UTC, indicating that the aircraft was flying at a normal altitude and speed. However, after this time, significant GPS interference was detected, leading to a temporary loss of positional data. Between 04:25 and 04:37 UTC, the aircraft ceased transmitting positional data altogether, a highly unusual occurrence. During this period, it is believed that the aircraft may have suffered external damage, likely due to a missile strike, which could have compromised its ability to transmit accurate position information. Following this gap in data transmission, between 04:37 and 04:40 UTC, the aircraft transmitted likely erroneous ADS-B data. The information sent during this period was inconsistent, with fluctuating altitude and ground speed figures, which suggests that the aircraft was struggling with severe control issues. After a 36-minute gap, ADS-B data resumed at 05:13 UTC, revealing highly irregular flight characteristics. The data indicated variable altitude fluctuations of ±2,438 meters (approximately ±8,000 feet) and erratic ground speeds and vertical rate values. These irregularities point to catastrophic damage to the aircraft, likely caused by the missile strike, which caused the aircraft to lose control. The missile that struck Azerbaijan Airlines Flight J28243 is believed to have been a Pantsir-S1 surface-to-air missile, a Russian-made air defense system. Although the exact missile used remains under investigation, multiple sources point to the involvement of Russian military assets in the region. According to AnewZ, an international news outlet based in Baku, Azerbaijani government sources have suggested that the missile was fired from a Pantsir-S1 air defense missiles/cannons system, which is known to be in operation by Russian military forces. While this information has not been independently confirmed, the Pantsir-S system is widely used by Russia for its advanced anti-aircraft capabilities, and it would be capable of striking targets at the altitude and speed at which the Boeing 737-800 was flying. Forensic analysis of the wreckage has revealed damage patterns consistent with a missile strike. The tail section and wing of the aircraft suffered significant damage, which matches the impact characteristics of a high-velocity missile. Additionally, missile fragments recovered from the crash site appear to resemble components from a Pantsir-S missile system. Satellite imagery and radar tracking from international agencies have confirmed the presence of Russian air defense systems near the Caspian coast around the time of the incident. The missile’s trajectory and launch point remain under investigation, but it is widely suspected that the strike originated from Russian-controlled territory or a nearby military base. Local witnesses along the coast of Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea reported seeing a bright flash in the sky and hearing an explosion shortly before the aircraft’s descent. These reports align with the likely timing of the missile impact, further corroborating the missile strike theory. The post-impact ADS-B data showing oscillating altitude, variable ground speed, and vertical rate values suggests that the aircraft experienced severe structural damage or control system failures consistent with a missile strike. These abnormalities further support the idea that an external force—such as a missile—caused the aircraft to lose control. The ongoing investigation is exploring several theories about the origins of the missile strike. One plausible explanation is that the missile was launched during a routine Russian military exercise in the region, potentially as a result of a mistake or misidentification. The proximity of the crash site to Russian-controlled areas raises the possibility that the aircraft was mistakenly identified as a military target. Given the high level of military activity in the region and Russia’s heightened state of readiness, there is a possibility that the aircraft was misidentified as a hostile target. If the missile was fired as a defensive measure against a perceived threat, this would be an error in judgment, likely exacerbated by the complex geopolitical environment. While less likely, there remains a possibility that the missile strike was not an accident but a deliberate action, perhaps linked to broader regional tensions. Russia and Azerbaijan have had some political differences in recent years, though this theory remains speculative and would require more concrete evidence. As is often the case with high-profile incidents, the Azerbaijan Airlines crash has been accompanied by a wave of speculation, some of which has strayed far from the facts. Reports suggesting that third-party actors or local militants were responsible for the missile strike have been debunked, as no credible evidence has been presented to support these claims. Given the complex nature of this tragedy and the sensitive political implications, it is important to rely on verified information from credible sources. Speculation or misinformation can hinder the investigation and distract from the critical task of determining the exact cause of the crash. While the preliminary findings point to a Russian-made missile, likely launched from a Pantsir-S air defense system, the investigation is far from complete. Additional forensic analysis, further satellite data, and expert reviews of the flight’s black boxes will be essential to confirm the exact missile system involved and to piece together the events leading up to the crash. As the investigation progresses, international authorities—including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia—will need to cooperate closely to ensure transparency and accountability. The final findings will likely have significant implications for both aviation safety and regional geopolitics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/defense-investigation-what-is-the-possible-cause-behind-azerbaijan-airlines-flight-j28243-crash-near-aktau	2024-12-26T08:02:17-08:00	
North Korea joins Russian naval exercises as observer for the first time	On December 18, 2024, General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, confirmed that North Korea participated as an observer in the 'Ocean-2024' naval exercises. This marked the first time North Korea attended such an exercise in this capacity. The drills, which took place from September 10 to 16, 2024, were the largest naval exercises conducted by Russia in over 30 years. They involved Russian naval forces and Aerospace Forces, with operations conducted in the Pacific, Arctic, Mediterranean, Caspian, and Baltic regions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Amnok-class Patrol Ship No. 661 frigate, one of the most modern vessels in the North Korean Navy, is allegedly built on a Krivak-class hull and is equipped with 8 KN-19 anti-ship missiles, 6 FN-6 SAM missiles, a 76mm gun, 2 AK-230 anti-air guns, 4 533mm torpedoes, and 4 RBU-1200 anti-submarine rocket launchers. (Picture source: KCNA) Over 90,000 personnel participated in the Ocean-2024 exercise, along with more than 400 warships, submarines, and auxiliary vessels, 120 aircraft and helicopters, and approximately 7,000 units of military and special equipment. The main objectives of the exercise included testing the readiness of Russia's Navy and Aerospace Forces, evaluating command and control systems, and assessing operational cohesion in conditions simulating large-scale military aggression. During the drills, activities included defending naval bases, combating unmanned systems, conducting amphibious landings, and protecting convoys. In addition to North Korea, 14 other countries were present as observers, including Vietnam, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. Observer status allowed these countries to monitor the exercises without directly participating. President Vladimir Putin participated in the opening of the active phase via videoconference, highlighting the drills' role in evaluating combat readiness, integrating modern weapons, and emphasizing maritime and aerospace capabilities. The exercise also saw coordinated actions with Chinese forces, which contributed naval assets such as the Type 055 destroyer Wuxi, Type 052D destroyer Xining, Type 054A frigate Linyi, and the fleet oiler Taihu, supported by 15 aircraft. The exercise unfolded in two stages: the first involved force deployment and operational planning, while the second included targeting strategically important objectives, defending critical maritime infrastructure, and utilizing unmanned reconnaissance and strike platforms. Russian and Chinese forces coordinated actions in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, focusing on security coordination in the Pacific region. The 'Ocean-2024' exercises emphasized adapting to emerging maritime challenges, including countering unmanned systems and electronic warfare. Russian forces also tested long-range strike capabilities and practiced defense against simulated NATO-style operations. The drills made use of all available naval resources not actively engaged in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. North Korea’s involvement reflects its growing military cooperation with Russia. In recent months, North Korea has reportedly provided munitions and personnel to assist Russia in its military operations. The two countries also formalized a defense agreement in November 2024, committing to mutual support in the event of external aggression. North Korea’s navy, part of the Korean People’s Army, operates approximately 780 vessels, including submarines, missile boats, corvettes, and support ships, with an estimated 60,000 personnel. The navy’s two fleets, the Eastern Fleet based in Wonsan and the Western Fleet headquartered in Nampo, focus on coastal defense and supporting ground operations. The North Korean Navy has been involved in incidents such as the 1968 capture of the USS Pueblo and continues to serve as a key component of North Korea’s defense strategy. The fleet's capabilities in sea control, surveillance, and anti-submarine warfare are limited, with a primary focus on the coastal zone. The timing of the 'Ocean-2024' exercises coincided with increasing military activities by NATO and U.S. forces near Russia’s borders, which Russian officials view as a challenge to regional security. These drills were presented as a response to NATO's expansion in northern Europe and the Arctic. General Gerasimov confirmed that large-scale exercises will continue, with the 'Zapad-2025' joint exercise with Belarus planned for the following year. This reflects Russia’s ongoing focus on joint operations and enhancing military readiness in response to global security developments. Russia’s military relations with North Korea have become more strategic, particularly following the signing of the North Korean–Russian Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in June 2024. This treaty includes a mutual defense clause, obligating both nations to provide military assistance if either is attacked. North Korea has reportedly supplied artillery shells and rockets to Russia for its operations in Ukraine. Additionally, over 12,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia, with over 3,000 casualties reported. These developments highlight the deepening military relationship between the two countries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/north-korea-joins-russian-naval-exercises-as-observer-for-the-first-time	2024-12-26T07:26:36-08:00

Increased activity in the Arctic, such as joint Russian-Chinese patrols near Alaska, has underscored the need for additional icebreaking assets to support U.S. sovereignty and security in the region. The vessel will undergo limited modifications before commissioning, including repainting the hull red and labeling it as WAGB-21. It will be assessed further for full operational capability in alignment with Coast Guard standards. This new purchase does not alter the Coast Guard’s ongoing plans to develop a fleet of eight to nine polar icebreakers. The PSC program, managed by Bollinger Mississippi Shipbuilding, has faced delays, with the first vessel, Polar Sentinel, now projected for delivery by 2030. The Coast Guard has cited challenges related to the specialized requirements for constructing heavy icebreakers, which have not been built in U.S. shipyards for nearly 50 years. As a bridging measure, the Aiviq will provide limited icebreaking and operational support until the PSC fleet becomes operational. For now, this new icebreaker will provide interim capabilities while the US Coast Guard awaits the delayed Polar Security Cutter (PSC) fleet. Once operational, the vessel will be permanently homeported in Juneau, Alaska, pending the completion of necessary infrastructure improvements. The Aiviq was originally constructed by Edison Chouest Offshore in Louisiana to support oil exploration in the Arctic. It is equipped for icebreaking and anchor-handling operations, featuring ABS A3 classification, which allows for navigation in polar ice, including multiyear ice floes. Its propulsion system includes four Caterpillar C280-12 engines, enabling speeds of up to 15 knots in open water and 5 knots in 1-meter-thick ice. The vessel is also equipped with a helideck, controllable-pitch propellers, and dynamic positioning capabilities. Its design includes accommodations for 64 personnel and a bollard pull capacity of 200 metric tons. Since its construction, the vessel has conducted Arctic and Antarctic missions, including oil spill response and refueling operations. The decision to name the vessel Storis reflects the Coast Guard's tradition of selecting meaningful names from multiple proposals. The name honors the original USCGC Storis (WMEC-38), a cutter that served from 1942 to 2007. The original Storis was notable for conducting Arctic patrols, facilitating the first American transit of the Northwest Passage, and operating as the oldest commissioned cutter in the Coast Guard's fleet at the time of its decommissioning. It also participated in key missions such as responding to the 1964 Alaska earthquake and conducting search and rescue operations, including the 1990 rescue of the M/V Alaskan Monarch. The initial crew for the Storis will consist of approximately 60 officers and enlisted personnel, who are expected to begin assignments in 2025. Temporary homeporting arrangements are being evaluated until the Juneau infrastructure is completed. The acquisition was facilitated by the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 and fiscal year 2024 appropriations, which allocated funding for the purchase. This action aligns with the Coast Guard’s broader strategy to address Arctic operational requirements while maintaining flexibility in its long-term procurement goals. The Arctic region is experiencing increased geopolitical activity driven by climate change, which has made its waters more accessible and economically significant. Russia, with a fleet of over 40 icebreakers, including nuclear-powered vessels, has emphasized year-round navigation along the Northern Sea Route to enhance its strategic and commercial interests. China, identifying itself as a 'near-Arctic state,' is building icebreakers and collaborating with Russia on Arctic shipping developments, such as the 'Ice Silk Road.' In response, nations like the United States, Canada, and Finland have initiated cooperative measures under the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE Pact) to strengthen their icebreaking capabilities and address the presence of other major powers. The focus on icebreaker development reflects the necessity of these vessels in ensuring safe navigation, supporting territorial and resource claims, and adapting to the evolving dynamics of the Arctic.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-coast-guard-acquires-first-polar-icebreaker-in-25-years-to-fill-critical-arctic-sovereignty-gap	2024-12-26T07:09:48-08:00	
Israel to expand production of Arrow-3 air defense missiles due to growing missile threats	On December 24, 2024, the Israel Ministry of Defense announced the expansion of its Arrow 3 interceptor procurement program through a multi-billion-shekel contract with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). The agreement, signed by Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Ministry, aims to address increased missile threats, particularly from the Houthi movement in Yemen, by replenishing and expanding existing stockpiles of Arrow 3 systems. Recent events, such as missile launches targeting Eilat and the Dan Bloc, have underscored the system's operational use.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Arrow program, initiated in 1986, includes two primary interceptors: the Arrow-2, for atmospheric interception, and the Arrow 3, designed to engage threats in the exo-atmospheric phase of their trajectory. (Picture source: IAI) The signing ceremony was conducted at the Ministry of Defense headquarters in Tel Aviv, with the participation of senior officials, including Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Dr. Daniel Gold, Head of DDR&amp;D; Moshe Patel, Director of IMDO; Boaz Levy, CEO of IAI; and CPA Dekel Cohen, Head of the Ministry’s Finance Department. The specific value of the contract, managed by the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) under the Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&amp;D), and the number of interceptors to be delivered have not been disclosed, citing security concerns. However, each interceptor is estimated to cost approximately $4 million. The ballistic missile threat against Israel has significantly increased, particularly from the Houthi movement in Yemen. Recent attacks involved ballistic missiles and drones targeting Israeli territories, including urban areas. These incidents have resulted in injuries and infrastructure damage. In response, Israel has launched airstrikes on Houthi positions and called for the international community to label the Houthis as a terrorist organization. Israel has also indicated potential measures to target Houthi leadership, emphasizing the connection between these attacks and broader regional dynamics involving Iranian support for allied groups. The Arrow program, initiated by the Missile and Space Systems Division of IAI in 1986, became operational in 2000. It includes two primary interceptors: the Arrow-2, for atmospheric interception, and the Arrow 3, designed to engage threats in the exo-atmospheric phase of their trajectory. The Arrow 3 system is one component of Israel’s multi-layered defense framework, which also includes the Iron Dome and David’s Sling systems. The Arrow 3 is engineered to intercept ballistic missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, outside the Earth’s atmosphere. The system features a two-stage engine, a gimbaled seeker providing hemispheric coverage, and thrust vectoring for maneuverability. It operates with a maximum reported range of 2,400 kilometers and can engage threats at altitudes exceeding 100 kilometers. Using hit-to-kill technology, the system can intercept multiple ballistic missiles within 30 seconds. It is launched from fortified underground silos and has the capacity to be deployed into space, potentially providing anti-satellite capabilities. Since becoming operational in 2017, the Arrow 3 system has been used in multiple scenarios. Its first operational use occurred on November 9, 2023, when it intercepted a Houthi missile near Eilat. During the 2024 Iran-Israel conflict and Red Sea crisis, the system intercepted multiple Houthi missiles, including those launched on September 14 and September 28, 2024. The system’s design allows it to handle salvos of more than five missiles within a short engagement window. The Arrow program is funded jointly by Israel and the United States. Germany is set to acquire the system under the European Sky Shield Initiative as part of a $3.5 billion procurement approved by the Bundestag in June 2023 and the United States in August 2023. Deliveries are scheduled to enable operational capability in Germany by 2025. This acquisition marks the largest defense procurement in Israel’s history. Additionally, Azerbaijan evaluated the Arrow 3 system in 2021 as a potential purchase during a period of heightened tension with Iran.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-to-expand-production-of-arrow-3-air-defense-missiles-due-to-growing-missile-threats	2024-12-26T06:59:15-08:00

Valued at €560 million ($583 million), this acquisition represents the largest defense export deal between Israel and Slovakia. The Barak MX, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), is designed to counter diverse aerial threats such as ballistic missiles, UAVs, helicopters, cruise missiles, and fighter jets, marking a significant step in Slovakia’s efforts to modernize its air defense capabilities and replace its outdated 2K12 Kub air defense systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Israeli Barak MX air defense missile system offers a wide range of capabilities through its three types of interceptors, which cover ranges of 35 km, 70 km, and 150 km. (Picture source: IAI) Under the terms of the agreement, Slovakia will receive six batteries of the Israeli Barak MX surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, with deliveries scheduled to begin by the end of 2025. The deal also includes training, technical documentation, simulators, tools, spare parts, and a two-year warranty. Furthermore, local production provisions in the agreement will enable Slovakia to manufacture certain system components domestically. This initiative involves local industries in the supply chain, particularly through the production of Barak MX missiles, and addresses the limitations of the aging 2K12 Kub systems. Introduced between 1978 and 1983, these legacy systems are no longer operationally viable due to outdated technology and a lack of spare parts. The decision to procure the Barak MX followed a thorough evaluation process initiated in May 2023 by Slovakia’s Ministry of Defense. Competing systems included Rafael’s Spyder, Diehl Defence’s IRIS-T SLM, and MBDA’s VL MICA. The Barak MX received the highest evaluation score, achieving a 95% overall assessment based on its technical capabilities, lifecycle costs, delivery timelines, and industry involvement. Its flexibility—offering both stationary and mobile configurations—was another critical factor in its selection. To complement the Barak MX, Slovakia has also approved the acquisition of 36 Polish Piorun MANPADS for €66 million. These portable systems, derived from the Soviet-era 9K38 Igla, feature upgrades such as a proximity fuse to enhance their effectiveness against UAVs and other aerial threats. With a range of up to 6 km and the ability to engage targets at altitudes between 10 m and 4 km, the Piorun system was selected for its affordability, compatibility with existing systems, and capacity to provide three times the number of launchers compared to competitors. Together, the Barak MX and Piorun aim to replace Slovakia’s Soviet-era 2K12 Kub systems, offering comprehensive protection for both strategic and civilian targets by addressing mid- to long-range threats and short-range aerial defense, respectively. The Barak MX system itself offers advanced capabilities through its three types of interceptors, which cover ranges of 35 km, 70 km, and 150 km. Its dual-pulse rocket motors, active radar seekers, and modular architecture enable integration with various sensors and management systems, ensuring NATO compatibility. This adaptability supports its use in both land-based and naval deployments. Additionally, its robust data link connects launchers, capable of carrying up to eight missiles each, to the Barak Battle Management Center, enabling multi-target engagement and updates to counter evolving threats. Slovakia’s modernization efforts extend beyond air defense. A joint procurement initiative with the Czech Republic aims to replace outdated military vehicles with 1,307 new transport trucks, slated for delivery between 2025 and 2031. Complementing this, Slovakia has approved the purchase of 5,000 US-made M4A1 rifles through the Foreign Military Financing program and continues to procure radar systems and tactical drones from Israeli manufacturers. Therefore, this new agreement with Israel underscores the strengthening defense partnership between the two nations, with recent acquisitions including an agreement to acquire 17 Israeli-made 3D air defense radar systems for approximately €148.2 million in 2021, followed by another agreement in 2022 for approximately 100 Spike LR2 anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). Despite ongoing regional conflicts, Israel's defense exports have seen significant growth, reaching $13 billion in 2023—nearly double the figures from five years prior. The Defense Export Control Agency (DECA) has issued 13,497 marketing licenses and 5,677 export licenses since October 2023. While some European nations, such as France, impose restrictions on Israeli defense industry participation, agreements like Slovakia’s highlight a growing demand for Israeli systems in Europe. Recent procurements by Germany (Arrow) and Finland (David’s Sling) further reflect this trend, driven by the operational performance of Israeli systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-strengthens-ties-with-europe-as-slovakia-officially-purchases-barak-mx-air-defense-missile-systems-4	2024-12-26T04:51:54-08:00	
Morocco eyes Chinese L-15 Falcon light attack aircraft to replace aging Alpha Jet fleet	According to Le Desk on December 25, 2024, Morocco's Royal Air Force is considering the Chinese L-15 Falcon light attack aircraft as a potential replacement for its fleet of Alpha Jets trainers. This evaluation aligns with Morocco’s efforts to modernize its defense capabilities while diversifying its military partnerships. The Alpha Jet, developed jointly by Dassault Aviation of France and Dornier Flugzeugwerke of Germany, has been in service since the late 1970s and has primarily been used for training and light attack roles. However, the Alpha Jet’s aging design no longer meets the requirements of modern military operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hongdu JL-10, also known as L-15 Falcon, has been exported to countries such as Zambia, which purchased six L-15Z units in 2014 for $100 million, and the United Arab Emirates, which ordered 12 units in 2022 with an option for 36 additional aircraft. (Picture source: Twitter/DS北风（风哥）) Morocco acquired 24 Alpha Jets between 1979 and 1981 to enhance its air force’s training and light attack capabilities. These aircraft were assigned to a training squadron and a counterinsurgency unit in Meknes. During the Western Sahara conflict, they were deployed in missions targeting Polisario Front positions. While the Alpha Jets fulfilled these roles, their subsonic performance, limited avionics, and lack of modern systems are now seen as inadequate. The Alpha Jet is equipped with two SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac turbofan engines and can carry up to 2,500 kilograms of armament across five hardpoints. Initially designed for subsonic training and close air support, its capabilities are now considered outdated in the context of current military needs. The L-15 Falcon, developed by Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation (HAIC), offers several features not present in the Alpha Jet. First flown in 2006 and introduced in 2013, the aircraft was developed with technical assistance from the Yakovlev Design Bureau in Russia. Its propulsion system includes AI-222K-25F turbofan engines, which incorporate Ukrainian technology. The L-15B variant can reach speeds of up to Mach 1.4. The aircraft includes nine hardpoints capable of carrying a maximum payload of 3,500 kilograms, accommodating munitions such as SD-10 and PL-8 air-to-air missiles, as well as LS-6 satellite-guided bombs. It also incorporates fly-by-wire controls, a Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar, and a glass cockpit, supporting its role in preparing pilots for advanced fighter aircraft. The L-15’s service life is estimated at 10,000 hours, and its design includes 25% composite materials to reduce weight and enhance durability. The L-15 has multiple operational variants, including subsonic and carrier-compatible models. It has been exported to countries such as Zambia, which purchased six L-15Z units in 2014 for $100 million, and the United Arab Emirates, which ordered 12 units in 2022 with an option for 36 additional aircraft. Other countries, including Pakistan and Ukraine, have shown interest in the platform. In China, the L-15 is used by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force and Navy for training pilots for fourth- and fifth-generation fighter aircraft as Hongdu JL-10. Morocco’s potential interest in the L-15 follows its acquisition of other Chinese defense systems, including the FD-2000B long-range air defense system, AR2 multiple rocket launchers, HJ-9A anti-tank missile systems, and Wing Loong 2 drones. This marks a shift from Morocco’s traditional reliance on Western suppliers. The L-15, if acquired, would be part of a broader defense modernization program aimed at updating and diversifying Morocco’s military equipment. Morocco and China have also expanded their political and economic ties. In January 2022, the two nations signed a Belt and Road Initiative implementation plan, making Morocco the first North African country to establish such comprehensive cooperation. Chinese investments in Morocco include infrastructure projects and initiatives in the electric vehicle battery sector. Morocco has affirmed its support for the One China policy, while China has expressed alignment with Morocco’s stance on the Western Sahara issue, strengthening bilateral relations. If the Royal Air Force opts for the L-15 Falcon, the decision would signify the introduction of a more modern and capable platform to replace the Alpha Jet. This move would reflect Morocco's commitment to meeting evolving operational needs and its efforts to diversify its defense partnerships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/morocco-eyes-chinese-l-15-falcon-light-attack-aircraft-to-replace-aging-alpha-jet-fleet	2024-12-26T02:53:46-08:00

Myanmar’s interactions with these countries include naval collaborations, energy resource exploration, and infrastructure projects. The country’s involvement in regional organizations like ASEAN further reflects its strategy to maintain balanced relations with neighboring states and global powers, shaping its role within the geopolitical dynamics of the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/myanmar-navy-commissions-ums-king-thalun-as-largest-domestically-built-frigate	2024-12-26T02:42:27-08:00	
Japan Plans Historic $734 Billion Defense Budget for 2025 Nearing US Spending Levels	Japan is set to approve a record $734 billion (¥115.5 trillion) budget for fiscal 2025, surpassing the previous $727 billion (¥114.38 trillion) budget for 2023, according to a report by Kyodo News on December 25, 2024. While a significant portion will be allocated to defense and social security, Japan's growing defense spending remains much smaller than the U.S. defense budget, which exceeds $800 billion. Despite this, rising costs of defense and debt servicing continue to put pressure on Japan's public finances.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan's Self-Defense Forces: A highly trained and disciplined force of over 250,000 personnel focused on regional security and defense readiness. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Japan's record $734 billion defense budget for fiscal 2025 places it among the top global defense spenders, although it remains significantly smaller than that of the United States, which allocates over $800 billion annually for defense—more than any other country. The U.S. military budget represents a substantial portion of global defense expenditure and supports its extensive global military presence, technological superiority, and advanced defense systems. In comparison, China's defense budget, the second-largest globally, is estimated at around $290 billion, a figure that has been growing rapidly in recent years due to its expanding military capabilities. Russia's defense spending is considerably smaller, at approximately $144 billion, reflecting its economic constraints despite military aggressions in Ukraine and broader security concerns. France, as one of the major European defense powers, spends about $70 billion annually, prioritizing both national defense and its commitments within NATO. Japan’s defense budget, while still smaller than these nations, is notably rising in response to regional security challenges, particularly from China and North Korea, and is set to reach 2% of GDP by 2027, aligning more closely with NATO standards. The new budget reflects Japan's strategic shift toward bolstering its defense capabilities in the face of evolving regional threats and a deteriorating global security landscape. Defense spending is expected to see a substantial increase as part of the country’s broader efforts to enhance its military readiness and deterrence capabilities. The fiscal 2025 defense budget is poised to continue a trend of sharp increases that began with Japan's defense policy overhaul in late 2022. In December 2022, Japan unveiled a new National Security Strategy that calls for the country to double its defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, aligning with the NATO standard for military expenditure. This move comes amid growing concerns over the security situation in East Asia, where Japan faces numerous threats from neighboring countries. One of the most pressing concerns for Japan is the increasing military assertiveness of China. Beijing’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, coupled with its rapid military modernization, has raised alarm bells in Tokyo. The Chinese military’s activities around Taiwan, its expansion in the South China Sea, and its development of advanced weaponry, including hypersonic missiles, have placed Japan on high alert. Japan's proximity to China, along with its long-standing security alliance with the United States, underscores the need for enhanced defense capabilities. Japanese policymakers are particularly concerned about China’s increasing naval presence and its growing ability to challenge U.S. forces in the Pacific, which could potentially threaten Japan’s security. Another significant factor driving Japan's defense spending is the continued missile and nuclear threats posed by North Korea. Despite various rounds of sanctions, North Korea has consistently conducted missile tests and pursued the development of nuclear weapons, which directly threatens Japan's safety. The unpredictability of the North Korean regime, led by Kim Jong-un, remains a key challenge for regional stability. Japan has been increasingly focused on missile defense systems, such as the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and the ground-based PAC-3 systems, to counter North Korea's missile threats. Moreover, Japan has been working closely with the U.S. to improve deterrence capabilities and ensure a swift response to any provocations from Pyongyang. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Japan has also raised its defense concerns about Russia's activities in the Pacific. Russia’s ongoing military exercises in the Far East, including naval deployments near Japan's exclusive economic zone, have added an additional layer of anxiety. Japan’s northern territories, which are disputed with Russia, further complicate the situation, necessitating a heightened defense posture. While Japan has committed to strengthening its defense capabilities, the nation faces significant challenges in balancing military spending with social security needs and debt management. The Japanese population is aging rapidly, with a growing elderly demographic that places increasing pressure on the country’s pension and healthcare systems. The combination of rising social security demands, ballooning defense costs, and high debt-servicing obligations (which account for a large portion of the national budget) presents a complex fiscal challenge. Japan’s public debt, which stands at more than 250% of GDP, is one of the highest in the world. Servicing this debt, particularly amid global interest rate hikes, will continue to take a large portion of the national budget. Tax revenues are projected to reach a record high of ¥78.4 trillion for fiscal 2025, but even this increase may not be enough to cover the surging costs of defense, social security, and debt servicing. To address these fiscal pressures, the Japanese government is expected to look for ways to streamline public spending, but with the security environment in East Asia deteriorating, defense spending will remain a priority. The record-setting budget for fiscal 2025 is not an isolated development but part of a broader trend toward defense modernization in Japan. Key components of Japan’s long-term defense strategy include increased investment in advanced technology, such as cyber defense, space capabilities, and missile defense systems. Japan is focusing on cutting-edge technologies and plans to invest in a new fleet of fighter jets and advanced surveillance systems. Japan continues to strengthen its defense ties with the U.S. and other Indo-Pacific allies, such as Australia and India, through joint military exercises, intelligence sharing, and capacity-building initiatives. Japan is also shifting toward a more proactive defense posture, with greater emphasis on acquiring the capability to conduct preemptive strikes if necessary. The country is pursuing the development of longer-range missiles and the enhancement of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). This includes a focus on more advanced air, sea, and missile defense systems, with the aim of deterring potential threats before they materialize. Japan is facing increasing domestic debate over its defense posture. While the public generally supports the country’s alliance with the U.S., there is some resistance to increased defense spending and a shift toward more offensive capabilities. However, with the regional security environment becoming more volatile, public opinion is gradually shifting in favor of stronger defense measures. As Japan crafts its $734 billion budget for fiscal 2025, the surge in defense spending underscores the country’s urgent need to confront mounting regional threats. From China’s military rise to North Korea’s missile provocations and the unpredictable dynamics of Russia’s military activities, Japan’s strategic priorities are clear. While this budget increases the strain on Japan’s public finances, it reflects a fundamental shift toward safeguarding the country’s national security in an increasingly unstable world. As Japan continues to modernize its military and enhance its defense capabilities, the world will be closely watching how the nation balances its security needs with the challenges of aging demographics and fiscal constraints.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/japan-unveils-historic-734-billion-defense-budget-for-2025-amid-growing-regional-security-threats	2024-12-26T01:48:05-08:00

(Picture source: Chinese Social Network) The new fighter jet, although its exact specifications remain confidential, is believed to feature a range of cutting-edge technologies. Among these are advanced stealth capabilities, which will make the jet harder to detect by enemy radar, and next-generation avionics systems. Additionally, the aircraft is rumored to integrate artificial intelligence, enhancing its ability to process vast amounts of data and improve decision-making in real-time combat scenarios. One of the most anticipated features of this new jet is its potential for seamless coordination with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could redefine manned-unmanned teaming in future warfare. This would allow for greater flexibility and precision in combat operations, as the aircraft can work in tandem with drones to conduct reconnaissance, strike missions, or provide a defensive shield. Another promising feature of China's 6th-gen fighter is its potential to carry hypersonic weapons. The country has made significant strides in developing hypersonic technologies, and this fighter jet could serve as a platform to deploy these high-speed, long-range weapons. Furthermore, it is expected that the aircraft will be equipped with state-of-the-art radar systems capable of detecting and engaging threats at greater distances, giving the pilot a crucial advantage in modern air battles. Some experts also speculate that this jet could incorporate directed-energy weapons or other advanced countermeasures to defend against future missile threats. The successful flight of China’s 6th-generation fighter jet has profound implications not only for the PLAAF (People’s Liberation Army Air Force) but for the global balance of military power. With multiple countries working on their own 6th-generation fighter programs, China's latest achievement highlights the accelerating pace of technological advancement in air combat. In particular, the United States, which is developing its own next-generation air superiority fighter under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, will likely view China’s progress as a catalyst to fast-track its own plans. The U.S. Air Force has already conducted successful flight tests of prototypes for its NGAD program, with an expected operational rollout around the 2030s. The successful debut of China’s fighter will likely encourage the U.S. to further invest in artificial intelligence, advanced stealth, and hypersonic weapons to ensure its continued dominance in the skies. In Europe, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan are collaborating on the Global Combat Air Program (GCAP), which aims to produce a next-generation fighter jet by the early 2030s. This program is designed to replace the Eurofighter Typhoon and will likely incorporate many of the same advanced technologies expected in China's 6th-gen fighter, including enhanced stealth and autonomous systems. The developments in China are likely to influence the direction of European fighter programs, accelerating efforts to ensure that these countries do not fall behind in the race for air superiority. Russia, while less vocal about its 6th-gen fighter program, is also working on advancing its military aviation technology. The Su-57 Felon is the cornerstone of Russia’s efforts to modernize its air force, though it remains uncertain whether Russia will be able to match the technological advancements being pursued by China and the U.S. in the coming years. Russia’s approach to stealth and air combat has typically emphasized versatility and raw power, but it will likely need to integrate more sophisticated technologies to compete with the new generation of fighters coming out of China and the West. China’s new fighter is part of a broader strategy to modernize the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and project power well beyond its borders. This plan aligns with China’s goal of becoming a global military superpower by 2049, marking the centennial of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The 6th-gen fighter is just one part of this broader vision, which also includes the development of the H-20 stealth bomber, advancements in missile technology, and the expansion of China’s naval and space forces. Experts believe that China is moving towards a 'triad' of capabilities, focusing on cutting-edge fighters, bombers, and unmanned systems to maintain a technological edge in future conflicts. This focus on technological superiority is also driving China's push to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) across all of its military platforms. The fusion of AI with fighter jets like the new 6th-gen aircraft will likely allow for real-time decision-making based on vast amounts of data collected from various sources, including drones and satellites. This ability to coordinate across domains could be the key to winning future wars, as it will enable China’s military to respond to threats faster and more efficiently than ever before. The successful flight of China’s 6th-gen fighter jet represents a new chapter in the global arms race. As other nations scramble to develop their own next-generation aircraft, the competition for air superiority is poised to intensify. The U.S., Europe, and Russia will need to accelerate their own programs to ensure they remain ahead of China's growing military capabilities. With the emergence of advanced fighter jets, hypersonic weapons, and unmanned systems, the landscape of air combat is set to undergo a dramatic transformation. As we move toward the middle of this century, the sky may be filled with not just manned aircraft, but a new breed of collaborative, autonomous, and hyper-speed weaponry, with China poised to play a dominant role in shaping this future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-chinas-next-gen-6th-generation-fighter-jet-successfully-completes-first-flight	2024-12-26T01:09:44-08:00	
Japan plans the purchase of four C-2 SOJ electronic warfare aircraft to replace its unique EC-1	On December 23, 2024, the Japanese Ministry of Defense shared new information about the development of a stand-off electronic warfare (SOJ) variant of the Kawasaki C-2 transport aircraft, designed to replace the EC-1, an unique electronic warfare aircraft in service since 1986. This initiative, which will involve the purchase of four aircraft, aims to enhance the Japan Self-Defense Forces' (JSDF) capabilities with long-range jamming to disrupt enemy systems while ensuring operational safety. The program plans to procure four C-2 SOJ aircraft, using technologies from previous systems, including the J/ALQ-5 electronic jamming device and advanced radio wave measurement systems. (Picture source: Japan MoD) The Ministry of Defense (MoD) initiated the C-2 stand-off electronic warfare (SOJ) program in fiscal year 2020. Development is divided into two phases. The first, spanning 2020 to 2026, focuses on establishing data link jamming capabilities and integrating a multi-electronic warfare platform. The second phase, from 2023 to 2032, aims to refine and operationalize these technologies. The program plans to procure four SOJ aircraft, relying on domestic development to address national defense requirements while maintaining operational secrecy. The platform incorporates technology from previous systems, including the J/ALQ-5 electronic jamming device and advanced radio wave measurement systems. The EC-1, which the C-2 SOJ is intended to replace, is a dedicated electronic warfare platform derived from the Kawasaki C-1. Developed in 1983, the EC-1 is equipped with the J/ALQ-5 electronic countermeasure (ECM) system, later upgraded to the J/ALQ-5 Kai, Toshiba ELINT systems, and supplementary American ECM and ELINT avionics. The aircraft's airframe modifications include a black bulbous nose, tail radome, and antenna fairings for radar and communication jamming equipment. Testing began in December 1984, and the aircraft entered service in June 1986. Based at Iruma Air Base, the single-unit EC-1 supports training and operational testing for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). It can detect and jam radar and communication signals and deploy chaff pods when required. Although it remains in service, the EC-1 is being phased out as Japan transitions to more advanced systems, mainly based on the newer C-2 aircraft. Despite being initially designed as a transport aircraft, the C-2 has been adapted for multiple roles, including electronic intelligence gathering as the RC-2. Testing demonstrated its ability for semi-level takeoffs and landings on unpaved surfaces, enhancing its operational utility for emergency operations. The development of the C-2 began in the early 2000s under the designation CX, and to reduce expenses, the C-2 shares components with the Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft. In addition to this new electronic warfare variant, the C-2 could soon be armed with long-range missiles, including a modified Type 12 surface-to-ship missile, as well as the US-made AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM). These missiles could extend the C-2’s operational range to over 11,000 kilometers, supporting counterstrike capabilities as outlined in Japan's earlier Defense Buildup Program. Like the future C-2 SOJ, the EC-1's airframe modifications include a black bulbous nose, tail radome, and antenna fairings for radar and communication jamming equipment. (Picture source: Twitter/アユザック) The Kawasaki C-2, a domestically developed military transport aircraft, is the platform for the new stand-off electronic warfare (SOJ) variant. The aircraft measures 43.9 meters in length, has a wingspan of 44.4 meters, and a height of 14.2 meters. It is powered by CF6-80C2 engines, capable of achieving speeds up to Mach 0.82, and can carry up to 20 tons over a range of approximately 7,600 kilometers. The C-2 was designed to replace the C-1 and complement the C-130H Hercules in the JSDF's fleet. It features a payload capacity of 36 tons, a glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and a tactical flight management system. The aircraft is capable of transporting large cargo such as MIM-104 Patriot missile systems and H-60 helicopters and has been deployed for operations including disaster relief and domestic missions since entering service in 2016. Japan plans to procure four C-2 Stand-Off Jammer (SOJ) aircraft to expand its electronic warfare capabilities and address evolving national defense requirements, a notable increase compared with the purchase of a single EC-1. The SOJ, based on the larger and more advanced C-2 airframe, is designed to disrupt and neutralize enemy radar and communication systems from a safe distance, allowing for operations beyond adversaries’ threat ranges. This program reflects Japan's strategy to modernize the Self-Defense Forces’ capabilities in the electromagnetic spectrum and enhance operational readiness across multiple areas. The SOJ complements other developments, such as the RC-2 and missile-equipped configurations, as part of efforts to adapt to changing security scenarios. The C-2 platform's design addresses broader operational requirements compared to the single-unit EC-1, which was developed in the 1980s as a modified C-1 transport for electronic warfare training and testing rather than frontline missions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/japan-plans-the-purchase-of-four-c-2-soj-electronic-warfare-aircraft-to-replace-its-unique-ec-1	2024-12-26T01:01:24-08:00
