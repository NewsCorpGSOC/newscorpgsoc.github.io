This class of guided-missile destroyers is being developed to replace the Royal Navy’s existing Type 45 destroyers, ensuring maritime air defense capabilities remain operational into the late 2030s and beyond. In response to a parliamentary question from MP Mark Francois, Minister of State for Defence Maria Eagle confirmed the Type 83’s role in FADS and its purpose of replacing the Type 45’s air defense function.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This new class of guided-missile destroyers is being developed to replace the Royal Navy’s existing Type 45 destroyers, ensuring maritime air defense capabilities remain operational into the late 2030s and beyond. (Picture source: British MoD) The Type 83 is expected to be larger and more advanced than its predecessor, and serve both as a conventional guided-missile destroyer and an air defense destroyer. Its primary mission will be to provide integrated air and missile defense against various threats, including hypersonic missiles. Government updates have described FADS as a multi-domain initiative designed to enhance UK defense capabilities across air, land, and maritime operations. In December 2024, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) conducted a Market Engagement Event (MEE) to collect industry input on the project’s direction, evaluating marketplace capabilities and challenges. Further industry engagement is scheduled for 2025 as the Royal Navy refines its requirements. Concept images released in 2023 suggest the Type 83 may be larger than the Type 45, with a size comparable to the US Navy’s Zumwalt-class or China’s Type 055 destroyers. Although exact specifications remain undisclosed, the Type 83 is anticipated to incorporate next-generation radar and sensor systems, possibly including an advanced phased array radar suite. The ship is also expected to be equipped with Mk 41 vertical launch systems (VLS) for air defense, land attack, and anti-ship missiles. Additionally, it may feature a power generation system capable of supporting directed energy weapons such as high-energy lasers or railguns. The projected timeline for the Type 83 indicates an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in the late 2030s or early 2040s. The exact number of ships to be built remains uncertain, as past UK defense procurement programs have often resulted in fewer vessels than initially planned. Future decisions regarding fleet composition are expected to be determined through a Strategic Defence Review later in the decade. The location of the Type 83’s construction is another unresolved factor. While the government has expressed support for domestic shipbuilding, no official confirmation has been made regarding the shipyard responsible for the program. Minister Maria Eagle stated that the decision remains subject to commercial considerations, but she noted that the project will sustain employment in the UK defense sector until at least the mid-2040s, depending on the number of ships constructed. The MoD has committed to analyzing supply chain involvement and social value aspects during the concept phase to ensure the support of UK-based defense manufacturing. Several design concepts have been proposed, including a large cruiser-like vessel with an expanded missile payload, an arsenal ship with a reduced crew requirement, and an air-warfare variant derived from the Type 26 frigate. Each approach presents trade-offs in terms of cost, capability, and operational flexibility. Parallel developments in sensor technology, such as the potential integration of the Aegis combat system or UK-developed radar systems, could influence final design decisions. The Type 83's primary mission will be to provide integrated air and missile defense against various threats, including hypersonic missiles, likely for the UK Carrier Strike Group, also known as UKCSG. (Picture source: British MoD) The Type 45 destroyers currently serve as the Royal Navy’s primary air defense platform, with plans for their retirement by 2038. To maintain operational effectiveness until the Type 83 enters service, the Type 45s are undergoing upgrades, including the integration of the Sea Ceptor missile system. However, concerns remain over whether the replacement schedule will maintain the required number of air defense platforms. Historically, UK naval procurement programs have seen reductions in planned fleet numbers, and similar risks could impact the Type 83 program. The Future Air Dominance System (FADS) is designed as a system-of-systems, with Type 83 destroyers expected to operate alongside NATO allies, the Queen Elizabeth-class carrier air wing, and other maritime and land-based assets. Preliminary discussions have indicated that the ships may act as motherships for new sensors and autonomous vessels, potentially expanding their role beyond traditional air defense. The MoD has also confirmed that the Type 83 will be equipped to counter hypersonic missile threats. Former Chief of the Defence Staff General Nick Carter has previously highlighted the necessity of these destroyers, emphasizing that the Type 45s currently provide the UK’s only long-range air defense capability against cruise and ballistic missile threats. The final number of Type 83s to be constructed is yet to be determined and will be influenced by the upcoming Strategic Defence Review. Uncertainty also surrounds the industrial strategy for the Type 83 program. Multiple UK shipyards are competing for the contract, and the MoD has yet to decide whether the vessels will be constructed at a single facility or distributed across multiple sites. The government has reaffirmed its commitment to sustaining domestic shipbuilding jobs, with officials indicating that the program will generate employment opportunities through at least the mid-2040s. Challenges related to recruitment and resource management within the Royal Navy have raised concerns about whether the number of Type 83s procured will be sufficient to maintain current operational capabilities. Previous trends suggest that projected fleet sizes often decrease over time, which could lead to capability gaps in the UK’s air defense structure if the Type 83 program does not meet planned targets.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/focus-british-type-83-destroyer-moves-towards-the-development-phase-to-strengthen-naval-air-defense	2025-03-06T05:10:34-08:00

The importance of this training was underscored by recent operations in Poland, where Dutch F-35s assisted in securing airspace following a large-scale Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine. This event highlighted the growing role of counter-drone defense in regional security and the need for allied forces to enhance their ability to counter asymmetric aerial threats. Since late 2023, the RNLAF has deployed four F-35A jets in Estonia as part of NATO’s air policing mission. So far, these aircraft have conducted ten interception missions, identifying eighteen Russian aircraft near NATO airspace. These operations demonstrate the Netherlands’ commitment to monitoring and protecting NATO’s eastern flank, particularly in the context of heightened tensions with Russia. The Baltic Sea is a strategically significant region for Nordic countries and Europe, especially amid ongoing tensions with Russia. A key hub for trade and energy transit, it hosts critical infrastructure, including the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, which connect Russia directly to Europe. However, this energy dependency has exposed the continent to security vulnerabilities, exacerbated by political tensions and sabotage incidents, such as those targeting these pipelines. Additionally, the security of underwater infrastructure has become a growing concern, as seen in the damage to the EstLink 2 cable, which connects Finland and Estonia, raising alarm over the protection of subsea communication and energy networks. In response to these challenges, Nordic and Baltic countries have been strengthening their defensive posture. The recent accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO has significantly altered the strategic balance in the Baltic Sea, effectively turning the region into a 'NATO-controlled zone', increasing pressure on Russia. Additionally, proposals such as the one from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, advocating for a joint naval force in the Baltic Sea, reflect Europe’s effort to bolster security cooperation. In this context, the Netherlands’ deployment of F-35A jets in Estonia contributes to NATO’s deterrence and defensive strategy, reinforcing the collective effort to counter potential destabilizing actions by Russia in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/dutch-f-35s-train-to-intercept-drones-with-aim-9-sidewinder-missiles-over-baltic-sea	2025-03-06T02:00:47-08:00

While initially focused on replacing medium-armored vehicles such as the Griffon, Serval, and Jaguar, the program also aims to enhance the capabilities of engineering units through the EGC, a new 8x8 armored engineering vehicle formerly known as the Moyen d’Appui au Contact (MAC).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link With the Auroch concept, further refinements have been undertaken by the French consortium of CNIM Systèmes Industriels, KNDS France, and Texelis to closely align with the expected requirements of the EGC program. (Picture source: CNIM) The current engineering vehicle used by the French Army, the Engin Blindé du Génie (EBG), was introduced in 1989 and is based on the chassis of the AMX-30B2 main battle tank. Over the years, the EBG has undergone two modernization phases, with the most recent upgrades including an improved lifting arm for earth-moving tasks and an air conditioning system. The EGC is planned to replace the EBG, along with the Engins du Génie Rapide de Protection (EGRAP) and the Engins du Génie d’Aménagement (EGAME), to provide a modernized engineering capability on the battlefield. Belgium joined the project last year through the CaMo (Capacité Motorisée) strategic partnership, intending to use the EGC to replace its Pionnier vehicles. According to the French military programming law (Loi de Programmation Militaire, LPM) for 2024-2030, the French Army was expected to receive its first five EGC units before 2030, with a total of 125 units by 2035. However, the recent market consultation published by the Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement (OCCAR), which oversees the program on behalf of France and Belgium, indicates that deliveries will be delayed. The first EGCs, formerly referred to as the Moyen d’Appui au Contact (MAC), are now scheduled for delivery in 2031, with a total production target of 200 units by 2040. For its part, the Belgian Land Component has indicated a requirement for approximately 30 vehicles. The overall cost of the program, covering development, production, and initial support, is estimated at between €800 million and €1.2 billion. OCCAR has announced plans to negotiate and award the contract through a competitive process starting in 2025, limited to suppliers from OCCAR member states and the European Union. A market consultation process is underway, with an Industry Day scheduled for May 14, 2025, in Bonn, Germany, where OCCAR will provide details to potential suppliers. Suppliers interested in participating must submit applications and capability briefs by April 4, 2025. The program follows a phased development approach, including a System Requirements Review (SRR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), Test Readiness Review (TRR), and Qualification Review (QR). Qualification is expected by 2030, with prototypes for industrial qualification and testing available between 2028 and 2029. OCCAR has also shared the requirements for the EGC program, defining the vehicle’s engineering, mobility, and protection capabilities. The EGC must feature a 4-in-1 bucket and an excavator arm capable of digging a tank firing position within 50 minutes, creating anti-tank ditches at a rate of 30 meters per hour with two vehicles, and lifting loads of up to three tons. Additionally, the system must be able to excavate trenches 90 cm wide and up to 2.5 meters deep, relocate soil, and construct protective berms using displaced earth. These capabilities must be functional both during the day and at night, with integrated equipment ensuring operability in low-visibility conditions. The EGC is also required to be certified for use on civilian roads in customer countries. Beyond its engineering role, the EGC must feature multi-functional capabilities aligned with the SCORPION combat system. It will integrate communication systems such as CONTACT/SYNAPS radios, the SICS battlefield management system, and the BARAGE jammer. The vehicle must match the speed, protection, autonomy, and off-road mobility of the Griffon and Jaguar armored vehicles, ensuring operational continuity. Designed to function in muddy and sandy environments, the EGC will feature an adaptive tire pressure system for improved traction and a winch for self-recovery. It will operate with a three-person crew consisting of a commander, a driver, and a radio-gunner and must be capable of towing a trailer and functioning in CBRN-contaminated environments. To date, one candidate is known: CNIM. This French company has proposed both an initial project and an evolution. When first introduced as a concept by CNIM in collaboration with Texelis in 2022, the Engin du Génie de Combat (EGC) was envisioned as a high-mobility, 8x8 wheeled engineering vehicle designed to operate in complex battlefield environments. It was intended to perform combat engineering tasks such as obstacle clearance and fortification construction while ensuring crew protection. Additionally, the EGC was already designed for integration into the SCORPION combat system, ensuring interoperability with other armored platforms in the French and Belgian armed forces. With the Auroch concept, the French consortium of CNIM Systèmes Industriels, KNDS France, and Texelis has introduced refinements to align more closely with the anticipated requirements of the EGC program. Initially conceived with a more complex architecture, the Auroch now features a single forward-mounted arm capable of supporting either an excavator bucket or a loader. The vehicle which is based on an 8x8 chassis originally developed for the Singaporean Terrex armored vehicle, weighs 28.6 tons and is equipped with optronic systems for environmental monitoring and a remotely operated 7.62mm turret. Powered by a 600-horsepower diesel engine, it can reach speeds of 80 km/h on roads and has an operational range of 600 km. Designed for both combat and disaster response, it is capable of obstacle clearance and terrain modification.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/french-army-accelerates-development-of-new-egc-8x8-armored-vehicle-to-modernize-engineering-capabilities	2025-03-06T01:29:23-08:00

North Korea to soon deploy its first airborne early warning aircraft based on a Russian IL-76	As reported by 38 North on March 4, 2025, North Korea appears to be nearing completion of its first airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft, representing an expansion of its air force capabilities. Satellite imagery analysis indicates that a modified Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft has been stationed at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport, with a large radome mounted on its fuselage.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Converting an IL-76 into an AEW platform requires expertise in radar integration, airborne networking, and electronic warfare, areas in which North Korea has limited experience. (Picture source: Airbus Defence &amp; Space and 38 North via Decker Eveleth/Twitter) The radome features a triangular shape, a design seen on Chinese KJ-2000 and KJ-500 AEW aircraft, which typically house three fixed phased array radars covering 120-degree sectors each. While this configuration suggests a possible Chinese influence, there is no definitive evidence confirming direct external support. The IL-76 was previously part of Air Koryo’s cargo fleet before being transferred to a maintenance facility in October 2023, where security fences were installed around it. Structural modifications began in November 2023, prompting speculation regarding its conversion into an AEW platform. By late 2024, visible progress had been made, and the aircraft was moved into an adjacent hangar. In February 2025, it reappeared with a mounted radome, providing the clearest indication yet of North Korea’s efforts to develop an AEW system. However, state media has not acknowledged the project. According to Decker Eveleth, the development of an AEW aircraft would allow North Korea to detect low-flying threats such as cruise missiles, which its existing Soviet-era ground-based radar systems struggle to track due to the country’s mountainous terrain and the curvature of the Earth. Airborne radar coverage would improve North Korea’s situational awareness and potentially enhance its air defense network. However, the effectiveness of such a system depends on its integration with existing command and control infrastructure. AEW platforms require advanced networking capabilities and real-time data-sharing systems, the availability of which in North Korea remains uncertain. Analysts have raised questions regarding possible foreign involvement in the modification process. Satellite imagery from late 2023 revealed structural changes that resemble AEW modifications observed in Russian and Chinese aircraft. No conclusive evidence exists to confirm Russian assistance, but reports indicate increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. Since North Korea began supplying artillery shells and other military aid to Russia during the Ukraine conflict, speculation has grown that Pyongyang could be receiving technical support or surplus military equipment in return, including components relevant to AEW capabilities. North Korea’s use of the Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft began in 1993 when Air Koryo acquired three IL-76TDs for freight transport to and from China and Russia. These aircraft remain in service and are registered as P-912, P-913, and P-914. Air Koryo’s Il-76s have been cited in reports alleging their involvement in transporting cargo associated with North Korea’s military programs, including missile components, in violation of United Nations sanctions. In 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated 16 Air Koryo aircraft, including its Il-76s, for their association with North Korea’s transportation sector and potential links to weapons proliferation. North Korea’s use of the Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft began in 1993 when Air Koryo acquired three IL-76TDs for freight transport to and from China and Russia. (Picture source: LiuXiaHui/RussianPlanes.net) While primarily operated for cargo transport, at least one Il-76 has been photographed in a military camouflage scheme, leading to speculation about its use beyond commercial freight operations. Despite international restrictions, these aircraft remain an integral part of North Korea’s air logistics capabilities, particularly given the country’s reliance on Soviet-era aircraft and its limited access to newer models due to sanctions. Recent reports suggest that Russia has agreed to supply North Korea with MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets in exchange for the deployment of North Korean personnel to Russia. According to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel Paparo, approximately 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, though they have not yet participated in combat operations. This agreement aligns with broader patterns of increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, with indications that Pyongyang may also seek additional technological transfers, including missile re-entry vehicles, submarine technologies, and upgraded air defense systems. North Korea’s air force operates a fleet of aging Soviet-era aircraft with limited modernization due to sanctions and resource constraints. The inventory primarily consists of MiG-21s, MiG-23s, Su-25s, and a small number of MiG-29s. The acquisition of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters would expand its air force’s capabilities, though it would still remain behind South Korea’s technologically advanced air fleet, which includes F-35 and F-15K fighters. North Korea’s AEW initiative aligns with its broader intelligence-gathering objectives, which include increased investments in space-based reconnaissance through satellite deployments. A functional AEW platform would complement these efforts by providing airborne surveillance, potentially improving Pyongyang’s ability to monitor foreign military activities and coordinate its own operations. Significant challenges remain in fully operationalizing an AEW aircraft. Converting an IL-76 into an AEW platform requires expertise in radar integration, airborne networking, and electronic warfare, areas in which North Korea has limited experience. Additionally, AEW platforms require continuous operation to maintain surveillance coverage, and a single modified IL-76 would provide only intermittent capability. Expanding the AEW fleet would require additional modifications or foreign assistance to sustain operational readiness. The introduction of an AEW system in North Korea has implications for regional security. While it may enhance Pyongyang’s ability to track military activities, it also raises concerns about potential misinterpretation of intelligence and an increased risk of escalation. Analysts caution that while an AEW system could improve situational awareness, it might also lead to miscalculations if North Korea interprets routine military exercises as a threat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/north-korea-to-soon-deploy-its-first-airborne-early-warning-aircraft-based-on-a-russian-il-76	2025-03-05T03:48:40-08:00

Cobra Gold, the largest joint exercise in mainland Asia, serves as a symbol of the longstanding U.S.-Thailand partnership. The exercise not only focuses on conventional military operations but also emphasizes humanitarian missions and disaster relief, both of which are critical to addressing the needs of the region's diverse populations. This holistic approach enhances the military readiness of the countries involved while deepening their cooperation with civilian agencies to better respond to humanitarian crises and natural disasters — challenges that are especially relevant in a region prone to tsunamis, typhoons, and earthquakes. In addition, AMPHIBEX represents a significant opportunity for the United States to reinforce its commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. As tensions rise in places like the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, maintaining a strong presence and fostering partnerships with regional allies has become a top priority. Exercises like Cobra Gold offer a tangible demonstration of military support and the ability to execute complex operations across various terrains, ensuring regional stability and enhancing collective defense. One of the central themes of AMPHIBEX is the enhancement of interoperability between different military forces. Each participating nation brings its unique capabilities and equipment, making coordination vital. For example, the Republic of Korea Army’s K-55 howitzer, which was showcased in the amphibious exercise, is a key asset for providing indirect fire support during amphibious landings. Its integration into the exercise exemplifies how modern military platforms, despite coming from different countries, can work together seamlessly. Moreover, Thailand's naval and air forces, combined with the U.S. Marines' amphibious assault vehicles and the Singaporean artillery support, demonstrate the importance of multinational coordination in operations that could involve large-scale humanitarian aid or military intervention in conflict zones. This is particularly important in a region that remains vulnerable to flashpoints, ranging from territorial disputes to larger power struggles. The interoperability forged in exercises like Cobra Gold is not limited to military engagements. These drills also foster a deeper understanding between armed forces, enabling more effective disaster relief operations in the event of natural disasters, which are frequent in the region. This multifaceted collaboration enhances not only military capability but also collective resilience to non-combat challenges. The Asia-Pacific region is facing increasing geopolitical and security challenges, particularly with respect to territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the broader competition for influence between global powers. Exercises such as AMPHIBEX and Cobra Gold are key to strengthening military alliances and enhancing the ability of U.S. and regional forces to respond to aggressive actions and humanitarian crises alike. The region's reliance on maritime trade makes it a strategic crossroads for the global economy and security. For this reason, ensuring that regional partners can perform joint amphibious operations effectively is paramount. The U.S. military's presence in the region, underscored by exercises like AMPHIBEX, reinforces its commitment to deterrence and stability while fostering positive relations with Southeast Asian nations. AMPHIBEX, part of Cobra Gold 2025, is a vital training ground for improving military capabilities and multinational cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.

Russia restarts TVD-10 engine production to modernize the An-2 biplane aircraft in service since 1947	As reported by TASS on February 27, 2025, Russia has announced plans to restart production of the TVD-10 turboprop engine, originally developed in the Soviet Union, to support the modernization of the Antonov An-2 Kukuruznik biplane aircraft, which was introduced in 1947. Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Anton Alikhanov confirmed the decision, stating that these engines will be used to re-engine An-2 aircraft, with potential future applications for additional modernization.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The An-2, a single-engine biplane, was developed in response to a Soviet Ministry of Forestry requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Polikarpov Po-2 and made its first flight on August 31, 1947. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Siberian Scientific Research Institute of Aviation (SibNIA) plans to have a prototype An-2 equipped with the TVD-10B engine by the summer of this year, while the production of the engine is set to be re-established in Omsk. The decision follows delays in the availability of the VK-800 engine developed at UZGA, which led to the continuation of the older TVD-10 model to ensure aircraft operability at least until 2030, when the LMS-901 Baikal light multipurpose aircraft is expected to enter full-scale production. Originally, the VK-800 project began in 2008 to power various Russian aircraft, including the Ansat and Ka-226 helicopters, but faced numerous challenges, leading to a near halt in progress for about a decade. A renewed effort commenced around 2018-2019 to adapt the engine for the Baikal aircraft. Despite these efforts, the engine's certification is now anticipated by the end of 2025, with serial production expected to begin in 2026. These delays have impacted the timeline for the Baikal aircraft's mass production, which was initially planned for early 2024 but has been postponed. The postponement is further complicated by a substantial increase in the aircraft's projected cost, rising from an initial estimate of 120 million rubles to approximately 445 million rubles per unit. The TVD-10 turboprop engine was developed in 1965 by the Omsk Engine Design Bureau (OMKB) based on the GTD-3F engine used in the Ka-25 helicopter. The engine was designed for regional passenger aircraft and features a free turbine and a remote gearbox. Its takeoff power is 1,025 horsepower, with a propeller power output of 960 horsepower. The engine's fuel consumption rate at takeoff is 0.255 kg/hp per hour. Serial production of the TVD-10 began in 1969, with the engine primarily installed on aircraft such as the Beriev Be-30. In the 1980s and 1990s, the TVD-10 was produced in Poland at the VSK-Rzeszow and VSK-Kalisz plants, with approximately 500 units manufactured. Since 1992, OMKB has conducted maintenance and overhaul operations, repairing 190 engines by 2004 under AP-145 and FAP-145 certification standards. The TVD-10B is a modification of the TVD-10, designed for re-engining the An-2. It retains the same structural features as its predecessor, with a takeoff power of 1,025 horsepower and a dry weight of 230 kilograms. The engine is designed to operate for up to 10,000 hours, with an inter-repair resource of 2,000 hours and a time between overhauls of 1,500 hours. In Poland, the TVD-10B was produced in serial quantities, and with its reintroduction in Russia, it will continue to be used for maintaining and modernizing An-2 aircraft. The Siberian Scientific Research Institute of Aviation (SibNIA) plans to have a prototype An-2 equipped with the TVD-10B engine by the summer of this year, while the production of the engine is set to be re-established in Omsk. (Picture source: Russian social media) The An-2 has been used by Russian military forces since its introduction, fulfilling roles in transport, airborne training, and other logistical operations. During the Soviet period, it was widely utilized by the Airborne Troops, with dedicated squadrons assigned to divisions such as the 106th, 105th, 104th, 7th, 103rd, 76th, and 31st Guards Airborne Divisions. The aircraft remained in military service following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, continuing its role in airborne training. In 2024, Russian conscripts of the Airborne Troops conducted jumps from an An-2 at the Klokovo airfield in the Tula region. The personnel used D-10 main parachutes and Z-5 reserve parachutes, jumping from a height of 1,000 meters at a speed of approximately 160 km/h with a three-second separation interval. The exercise, which included parachute training and tactical drills, resulted in over 500 jumps by the Tula Guards Airborne Unit. The An-2, known as 'Annushka' and 'Kukuruznik' in Russia and designated 'Colt' by NATO, was developed in response to a Soviet Ministry of Forestry requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Polikarpov Po-2. The Antonov Design Bureau, under the direction of Oleg Antonov, designed the aircraft, with the prototype, initially designated SKhA-1, making its first flight on August 31, 1947. Testing continued through 1947 and 1948, and the aircraft was formally accepted into service as the An-2. It was produced for applications in agriculture, transport, aerial firefighting, and airborne operations. Some aircraft have accumulated flight hours exceeding 20,000. Production of the An-2 occurred in multiple locations, with more than 18,000 units built between 1947 and 2002. Initial manufacturing took place at Plant No. 473 in Kyiv, followed by large-scale production at WSK PZL-Mielec in Poland, where approximately 11,915 units were produced between 1960 and 2002. Additional production was conducted in China under the designation Yunshuji Y-5, with some sources indicating continued manufacturing. The aircraft was exported to 26 countries and remains in service in Russia, China, and other states. As of 2012, 1,580 An-2 aircraft were listed as operational in Russia, with 322 considered airworthy. Other fleets included 290 aircraft in Kazakhstan, 135 in Ukraine, 143 in Uzbekistan, 89 in Turkmenistan, 82 in Belarus, 63 in Azerbaijan, 30 in Kyrgyzstan, 13 in Moldova, and 6 in Armenia. The An-2 is a single-engine biplane with a braced-wing configuration powered by a Shvetsov ASh-62IR radial engine with a takeoff power of 1,000 horsepower. Its maximum speed is 258 km/h, with a cruising speed of 180 km/h and a service ceiling of 4,500 meters. The takeoff run is 235 meters, while the landing roll is 225 meters. The upper wing has a span of 18.17 meters, while the lower wing spans 14.23 meters, giving the aircraft a total wing area of 71.52 m². The An-2's empty weight ranges from 3,400 to 3,690 kg, and its maximum takeoff weight is 5,500 kg. It features slatted wings that deploy automatically at low speeds, allowing it to maintain controlled flight at speeds as low as 50 km/h. The aircraft has been used in both civilian and military roles and continues to operate in regions requiring short takeoff and landing capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/russia-restarts-tvd-10-engine-production-to-modernize-the-an-2-biplane-aircraft-in-service-since-1947	2025-03-05T02:48:23-08:00

US Pennsylvania National Guard to receive 324 new Stryker Double V-hull vehicles to increase crew protection	On March 3, 2025, the Pennsylvania National Guard began receiving upgraded Strykers double-V hull (DVH) and Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs) as part of a modernization effort for the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT). The 56th SBCT is scheduled to receive 324 upgraded Stryker vehicles and 300 JLTVs to replace its flat-bottom-hull Strykers and M1097 HMMWVs with models that provide improved protection and operational capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The double-V hull (DVH) upgrade was developed to address vulnerabilities observed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where underbody improvised explosive device (IED) attacks posed a significant threat. (Picture source: Pennsylvania National Guard) The first batch of 25 Strykers has arrived at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, where they will be used for training before being assigned to units. All JLTVs will be received at Fort Indiantown Gap before distribution. The final allocation of the remaining Strykers is still being determined. A 'train-the-trainer' program is planned for March to familiarize personnel with the new vehicles, alongside a field-level maintenance course focused on sustainment and servicing requirements. The double-V hull (DVH) upgrade was developed to address vulnerabilities observed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where underbody improvised explosive device (IED) attacks posed a significant threat. The design incorporates a modified lower hull that redirects blast energy away from the vehicle to reduce structural damage and the likelihood of casualties. Combat data from Afghanistan indicated that DVH-equipped Strykers were more resistant to these threats compared to flat-bottom models. Col. Christopher Costello, commander of the 56th SBCT, noted that the DVH configuration resulted in a measurable decrease in injuries among vehicle occupants following IED incidents. The DVH configuration includes structural reinforcements, blast-attenuating seats, an armored driver’s station, and upgraded armor protection. Additional modifications involve an improved suspension and driveline to compensate for the increased vehicle weight. Testing and analysis have confirmed that the DVH offers enhanced protection against IEDs and blast threats while maintaining mobility and operational effectiveness. The design improvements stem from lessons learned in previous deployments, where flat-bottom Strykers exhibited higher casualty rates. The revised hull shape is engineered to dissipate explosive forces more effectively to mitigate damage. The double-V hull serves as the basis for multiple Stryker variants, including the Infantry Carrier Vehicle-Scout (ICVV-S), Mortar Carrier Vehicle (MCVV), Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEVV), and Anti-Tank Guided Missile Vehicle (ATVV).

Japan to Establish Second F-35B Fighters Squadron by 2030 Strengthening Amphibious Cooperation with US Marines	According to a Japanese Ministry of Defense document reported by USNI News on March 4, 2025, Japan will establish a second F-35 B squadron by the end of the decade. This initiative includes adjustments to the training schedule due to a three-year delay in the completion of the planned airbase on Mageshima Island, which is intended to serve as the fleet's primary training facility. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-35B Lightning II executes a vertical landing aboard Japan Maritime Self-Defense Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga during a developmental test on November 2, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Last week, the Kyushu Defense Bureau of the Ministry of Defense released an explanatory document outlining revisions to the training plan. The ministry’s regional offices regularly provide such updates when military activities may impact local populations. A detailed table outlining the expected number of monthly vertical landing training sessions at Nyutabaru Air Base, located on Kyushu's main island, confirms the formation of a second F-35B squadron by fiscal year 2029, bringing the total number of stationed aircraft at the base to approximately 30. Japan currently plans to establish a temporary F-35B squadron at Nyutabaru by the end of March while awaiting the delivery of the first batch of six aircraft from the planned total of 42. The F-35B Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole fighter equipped with short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability, enabling operations from small ships, roads, and remote bases. Developed for the US Marine Corps as well as the British and Italian forces, it combines stealth, supersonic speed, and operational versatility. Its propulsion system features a Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine and a shaft-driven LiftFan, allowing vertical landing maneuvers while maintaining high flight performance. With a maximum speed of 1,600 km/h and a range of 1,667 km, the F-35B is designed for rapid deployment in conflict zones, reducing reliance on traditional airbases and increasing operational tempo. In terms of armament, the F-35B carries more than 15,000 pounds of ordnance, with an internal weapons bay optimized for stealth or external pylons for maximum payload. It is equipped with the GAU-22/A 25mm cannon and a range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Its advanced avionics include the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, the AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system, and the MADL secure communication system, ensuring effective battlefield connectivity. Protection is enhanced by the AN/AAQ-37 DAS, providing 360-degree threat awareness. These features make the F-35B a key asset for naval and amphibious operations. While the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force operates fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) will be responsible for the F-35Bs, complementing the F-35A fleet already in service. Japan’s acquisition plan includes 105 F-35A and 42 F-35B aircraft. According to projections, eight F-35Bs will be operational by 2025, increasing to 30 with the establishment of the second squadron in 2029. By 2031, the fleet is expected to comprise 40 F-35Bs. Initially, the plan was to station the F-35Bs at Nyutabaru Air Base without conducting vertical landings except in emergencies. However, a review determined that the Mageshima airbase would not be completed until the end of fiscal year 2029. Due to the inability to conduct training there as planned, the Ministry of Defense revised its decision to allow vertical landing training at Nyutabaru. Mageshima, uninhabited since 1980, is located approximately 40 kilometers south of Kyushu’s main island. The Japanese government purchased it in 2019 to develop an airbase for the JASDF, which will also serve as a facility for US Navy and Marine Corps aircraft to conduct simulated carrier landing practice, replacing the current site at Iwo Jima. Additionally, it will function as an operational base for the defense of Japan’s southwestern islands. Construction began in January 2023 and was initially expected to be completed in 2027. However, in September 2024, the Ministry of Defense announced that completion had been pushed back to March 2030 due to material shortages and labor constraints. At a press conference last Friday, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that the ministry had informed local authorities through the Kyushu Defense Bureau and planned to hold explanatory meetings with residents. Military installations and activities in Japan are frequently located near populated areas, often leading to concerns among residents. Regarding the F-35B training at Nyutabaru, local concerns primarily relate to noise pollution. The explanatory document noted that noise from vertical landings would last for three minutes, citing a 2013 US study that measured a peak noise level of 130 decibels at 75 meters from the landing point and 110 decibels at 300 meters. Japan’s F-35B vertical landing training program includes four types: emergency landings, aircraft type conversion, and proficiency maintenance, landings on non-ship surfaces, and simulated carrier landings. The first three will be conducted at Nyutabaru, while the fourth will only take place at Mageshima once the necessary shipboard landing simulation infrastructure is in place. As Japan integrates the F-35B, other branches of its military are familiarizing themselves with its operations, particularly amphibious units. From February 3 to 6, the commanding officers of the three Amphibious Rapid Deployment Regiments (ARDB) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force observed flight operations aboard the USS America (LHA-6). This visit was part of a broader engagement with the America Amphibious Ready Group and the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. The objective of this cooperation is to enhance interoperability between US and Japanese forces. Several briefings and planning sessions were held between the commanders of the respective units to strengthen coordination for joint operations. This initiative is part of a larger effort to bolster military ties between the US Marine Corps, the US Navy, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Colonel Chris Niedziocha, commander of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, highlighted the significance of the visit, noting that the simultaneous presence of all three ARDB regiment commanders underscored Japan’s commitment to cooperation with US Marines. He also emphasized the strategic importance of such coordination in the Indo-Pacific, stating that joint actions send a clear signal against coercive or destabilizing activities in the region. As Japan continues to expand its fifth-generation air combat capabilities, the integration of the F-35B into its air force and its coordination with amphibious units represent a strategic shift. The delay in the completion of Mageshima presents logistical challenges, but the Ministry of Defense has adjusted training plans accordingly. Intending to deploy 40 F-35Bs by 2031 and enhance interoperability with US forces, Japan is positioning itself to strengthen its defense posture in response to regional security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-to-establish-second-f-35b-fighters-squadron-by-2030-strengthening-amphibious-cooperation-with-us-marines	2025-03-05T01:20:43-08:00	
US Air Force to deploy the OA-1K Skyraider II as the new primary light attack aircraft for special operations	On February 27, 2025, the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) designated its newest light attack aircraft, the AT-802U Sky Warden, as the OA-1K Skyraider II. Developed under the U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Armed Overwatch program, the aircraft is based on the Air Tractor AT-802 and modified by L3Harris for close air support, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The designation references the Cold War-era A-1 Skyraider, widely used during the Vietnam War.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The OA-1K Skyraider II is derived from the Air Tractor AT-802U Sky Warden, a militarized version of the AT-802 agricultural and firefighting aircraft. (Picture source: AFSOC) Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, AFSOC commander, announced the designation at the Global SOF Foundation’s Special Air Warfare Symposium in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Conley stated that the OA-1K Skyraider II is designed for multiple mission sets, including ISR, close air support, and precision strikes. He emphasized the aircraft’s modularity, allowing it to be reconfigured for different missions. He also noted its capability for rapid deployment, as it can be disassembled for transport inside a C-17 cargo aircraft and reassembled within a day. Conley highlighted that as operators gain experience with the aircraft, its role may evolve beyond initial mission requirements. Brig. Gen. Craig Prather, AFSOC’s director of Strategic Plans, Programs, and Requirements, explained that while the Skyraider II is not intended to engage advanced fighter aircraft, it provides support to special operations forces in low-threat environments. Addressing criticism of its propeller-driven design, he stated that the aircraft’s long loiter time, maneuverability, and adaptability make it effective for its intended role. The OA-1K is equipped with precision-guided munitions, air-to-ground missiles, and electro-optical/infrared sensors. Prather also pointed out that its lower operating cost and ability to provide immediate fire support make it a practical asset for missions requiring persistent overwatch. SOCOM originally planned to procure 75 OA-1K aircraft under a $3 billion contract awarded to L3Harris in August 2022. However, following a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review, the procurement target was reduced to 62 aircraft. The GAO questioned the necessity of such a large fleet after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, where persistent air support was a key requirement. SOCOM officials maintain that the aircraft remains essential for operations in environments where modern jet fighters are unnecessary. The Armed Overwatch program aims to provide sustained ISR and close air support capabilities in regions where higher-cost platforms may be less efficient. AFSOC expects to receive its first operational OA-1K at Hurlburt Field, Florida, in the coming weeks. Two unmodified AT-802 aircraft were delivered in 2024 for pilot familiarization. The 17th Special Operations Squadron is conducting training at Will Rogers Air National Guard Base in Oklahoma. The OA-1K is expected to replace the U-28A Draco, enhancing endurance and operational flexibility for special operations missions. It is scheduled to achieve initial operational capability in 2026, with full fleet delivery expected by 2029. The introduction of the Skyraider II aligns with the Air Force’s plan to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt II, a long-serving close air support aircraft. While the A-10 is known for its survivability and firepower, its phase-out has been contested by those who argue that modern jets cannot fully replace its role. AFSOC officials indicate that the OA-1K can fill a niche in providing close air support in low-threat environments at a lower operational cost. The aircraft is expected to complement other platforms in missions that require rapid deployment to austere locations. The original A-1 Skyraider was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company, introduced in 1946, and was extensively used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. (Picture source: US DoD) L3Harris is exploring additional capabilities for the Skyraider II beyond its light attack and reconnaissance role, including electronic warfare and signals intelligence. The aircraft’s ability to operate from short and unimproved airstrips allows for rapid deployment and crisis response missions. L3Harris has demonstrated that the OA-1K can be disassembled within six hours for transport inside a C-17, enabling global deployment with minimal logistical requirements. Interest in the Skyraider II has extended beyond the U.S., with L3Harris confirming export approval for 22 potential foreign buyers and an additional 15 countries under review. This indicates demand for a cost-effective armed overwatch capability. The OA-1K Skyraider II is derived from the Air Tractor AT-802U Sky Warden, a militarized version of the AT-802 agricultural and firefighting aircraft. The AT-802U was designed for ISR and strike missions in permissive airspace, particularly for counter-insurgency operations. Its rugged construction allows it to operate from austere airstrips with minimal logistical support, a key requirement for special operations forces. The aircraft was selected under the Armed Overwatch program to provide persistent, armed ISR capability while reducing reliance on higher-maintenance platforms. The Skyraider II is equipped with ten external hardpoints capable of carrying a range of precision-guided munitions, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and APKWS laser-guided rockets. It has a maximum speed of 245 miles per hour at 10,000 feet and a range of 1,500 miles at 8,000 feet. The aircraft features a reinforced steel cockpit, self-sealing fuel tanks, and a five-point harness system with airbags. It does not include ejection seats. Its armor protection consists of lightweight composite ballistic shielding around the engine and cockpit, and the airframe is built for an extended operational lifespan with low maintenance requirements. The original A-1 Skyraider was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company and introduced in 1946. It was extensively used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. As a carrier-based attack aircraft, it was designed to carry heavy ordnance loads and provide close air support. The A-1 was particularly noted for its ability to escort search and rescue missions and remain over a battlefield for extended periods. It was eventually replaced by jet-powered platforms. The OA-1K Skyraider II continues this operational concept by adapting similar capabilities for modern special operations requirements, ensuring sustained ISR and close air support in permissive environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-air-force-to-deploy-the-oa-1k-skyraider-ii-as-the-new-primary-light-attack-aircraft-for-special-operations	2025-03-05T01:06:13-08:00

Such actions appear to be aimed at restricting freedom of movement in international airspace, adding to a series of similar incidents involving Russian and Western military aircraft in recent years. The extreme proximity of flight paths and the behavior of the Russian pilot raise concerns about the safety of surveillance operations in the region. French forces routinely conduct missions in this area to ensure compliance with international law and regional stability, aligning with broader efforts to protect strategic interests in the Mediterranean. This type of maneuver is perceived as deliberate and unprofessional, reflecting an aggressive posture that increases the risk of aerial incidents. Through drone deployments, the French military conducts surveillance operations to uphold freedom of navigation in international air and maritime spaces. These missions are carried out in coordination with allies and partners, in response to actions that could jeopardize both military and civilian aviation safety in this strategically sensitive area. The recurrence of such confrontations adds to tensions between Moscow and Western forces, raising questions about the most appropriate diplomatic and military responses to these provocations. In response to this episode, France has reaffirmed its commitment to defending the right to free movement in shared spaces while continuing its operations in compliance with international regulations. This incident highlights the importance of structured military dialogue to prevent uncontrolled escalation. The lack of effective communication channels between opposing air forces increases the risk of serious incidents, which could lead to diplomatic crises that are difficult to manage. In a geopolitical context already marked by high instability, such interactions underscore the need to establish clear limits to prevent further deterioration in relations between Russia and Western powers. The Eastern Mediterranean has become a space where military, strategic, and energy-related issues intertwine, making the region a theater of increasing tensions between rival powers. With the presence of numerous actors, including Russia, the United States, France, Turkey, and several Middle Eastern nations, this maritime area is a key point for freedom of navigation and power projection. Naval and air forces are regularly deployed to monitor adversary movements, escort convoys, or secure critical infrastructure such as hydrocarbon supply routes. The Eastern Mediterranean is also the primary passage for the transport of natural gas from Israeli and Cypriot exploitation fields, further fueling rivalries between nations seeking to assert their influence over this strategic route. The military engagement of Western powers in the region, notably France and the United States, is partly aimed at ensuring stability and deterring any actions that could disrupt maritime circulation. However, Russia, which until recently maintained a military base in Syria and a Black Sea fleet capable of operating in the Mediterranean, had been intensifying its presence and multiplying shows of force, including naval exercises and aerial interceptions. These operations were part of Moscow’s broader effort to challenge Western influence in this strategic region while protecting its interests in Syria and consolidating its regional alliances. Aerial and maritime incidents, such as the interception of a French drone by a Russian Su-35, illustrated the growing climate of tensions and the risk of escalation between rival forces operating in close proximity. However, the situation in Syria has recently undergone major upheavals. In December 2024, a swift offensive by rebels led to the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, forcing him to flee to Russia. This development has significantly affected Russia’s military presence in Syria. The new Syrian authorities have not severed ties with Moscow nor demanded a complete withdrawal of Russian forces, but they have canceled certain contracts, including the one granting a Russian company control over the port of Tartus. Russian troops have retreated to their main stronghold, the Hmeimim airbase near Latakia, though a total evacuation is not currently planned These dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean echo the escalating tensions in the Baltic Sea, where Russia regularly defies restrictions imposed by NATO and the European Union. Between aggressive overflights, ship interceptions, and suspected sabotage of underwater infrastructure, the confrontation between Moscow and Western nations is becoming increasingly global. In both regions, the main issues revolve around control of strategic routes, energy resources, and military influence, further intensifying the rivalry between Russia and its Western adversaries on multiple simultaneous fronts. Encounters between MQ-9 Reaper drones and Russian Su-35 fighters have become increasingly frequent in recent years, particularly in Syrian airspace and over the Black Sea. One of the most notable incidents occurred on March 14, 2023, when a Russian Su-27 collided with the propeller of a U.S. Reaper, forcing the drone to crash into the Black Sea. Similarly, in July 2023, a Reaper operating in Syria sustained significant damage after being intercepted by a Su-35, which deployed flares nearby, striking the drone’s propeller and compromising its functionality. Such incidents have continued, notably on June 21 and June 27, 2024, when Su-35s engaged in aggressive maneuvers near U.S. Reaper drones over Homs province, compelling the drones to take evasive action to avoid a collision. These dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean echo the escalating tensions in the Baltic Sea, where Russia regularly defies restrictions imposed by NATO and the European Union. Between aggressive overflights, ship interceptions, and suspected sabotage of underwater infrastructure, the confrontation between Moscow and Western nations is becoming increasingly global. In both regions, the main issues revolve around control of strategic routes, energy resources, and military influence, further intensifying the rivalry between Russia and its Western adversaries on multiple simultaneous fronts. These tense interactions reflect a broader dynamic in which Russia and Western forces engage in a contest for influence in disputed airspaces. In Syria, the near-constant presence of U.S. drones, operating without authorization from Damascus, is viewed by Moscow as an infringement on Syrian sovereignty and a potential threat to Russian military assets. These incidents underscore the increasing militarization of airspace interactions between rival powers, elevating the risk of an uncontrolled confrontation that could escalate into a significant diplomatic crisis.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/tensions-in-mediterranean-with-russian-su-35-fighters-dangerously-threaten-a-french-reaper-drone	2025-03-04T07:39:01-08:00

The timing of the exercise, conducted just months before the release of these images, is highly significant. Tensions over Taiwan remain at the forefront of China’s military planning. The South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait are areas of intense geopolitical competition, with Beijing asserting its territorial claims in the region. As such, the PLA’s emphasis on amphibious warfare is seen as part of its broader strategy to prepare for a potential conflict over Taiwan. The ability to launch a swift, large-scale amphibious assault could be critical in any scenario involving the island, where the PLA would need to quickly establish control over coastal areas, while preventing intervention from foreign powers like the United States. The PLA Southern Theater Command, responsible for operations in the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and surrounding areas, has been at the forefront of these preparations. With an increasing focus on amphibious training and operational readiness, the command aims to enhance China’s ability to rapidly respond to any escalation in the Taiwan Strait. The release of these images further highlights Beijing's commitment to ensuring its military forces are prepared for a range of contingencies, including amphibious landings in contested areas. China's ongoing investment in amphibious warfare capabilities is reshaping the regional security landscape. The presence of ships like the Jinggangshan and Hainan enables the PLA to project power in critical maritime regions, particularly in scenarios involving Taiwan. These exercises also send a clear signal to Taiwan and its allies about China’s growing military capabilities and its readiness to enforce its territorial claims. While Beijing maintains that military action would only occur in response to Taiwanese moves toward independence or foreign intervention, the frequency and scale of these exercises raise concerns about the potential for conflict in the Taiwan Strait. As tensions in the region continue to rise, the PLA's focus on amphibious warfare and its ability to conduct large-scale operations is likely to be a key factor in future security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific. The growing capabilities of China’s amphibious forces highlight the importance of maintaining a military edge in these contested waters, particularly as the geopolitical balance continues to shift. The PLA Navy’s enhanced readiness for amphibious operations could significantly influence the future trajectory of China-Taiwan relations, with far-reaching implications for regional and global security.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/china-demonstrated-its-capabilities-to-conduct-large-scale-amphibious-operations-during-february-2025-exercise	2025-03-04T05:02:18-08:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Regent Craft has previously entered into agreements with the U.S. Marine Corps and Lockheed Martin Ventures to evaluate the military applications of its Viceroy seaglider. The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab (MCWL) signed a $4.75 million agreement with Regent to assess the platform’s capability in hull, foil, and wing-borne modes for defense logistics. The evaluation will include a live demonstration in a U.S. government exercise. Additionally, Regent collaborates with the Naval War College Foundation to research seaglider defense applications. The company is also engaged with Lloyd’s Register and the UAE Marine Transport Affairs Department to establish maritime certification pathways for military use. Production of the Viceroy seagliders is planned in the UAE and at Regent’s 23,690-square-meter manufacturing facility in Rhode Island at the Quonset Business Park, which is expected to be operational in 2026. The facility will manufacture components, assemble vehicles, and conduct pre-delivery testing. It is intended for large-scale production of the Viceroy Seaglider and future models for both commercial and defense applications. The facility is projected to create at least 300 jobs over ten years and serve as the primary production hub until additional capabilities in the UAE are developed. The Viceroy Seaglider is a dual-use platform designed for high-speed, low-signature, and runway-independent operations. The aircraft is 16.8 meters in length, 5.5 meters in height, and has a 19.8-meter wingspan. It accommodates a crew of two and twelve passengers, with a cabin measuring 7.9 meters in length, 1.8 meters in height, and 1.7 meters in width. The cargo door dimensions are 1.45 meters by 1.64 meters. The aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 6,985 kilograms and a useful load capacity of 1,360 kilograms in passenger configuration or 1,588 kilograms in cargo configuration. It cruises at 290 kilometers per hour (156 knots) and has an expected range of 290 kilometers (156 nautical miles) with end-of-life batteries. It features motors with a 120 kW output, though details regarding the manufacturer and model have not been disclosed. Noise levels during takeoff are measured at 59 dBA at 100 meters. The cabin has 21.1 cubic meters of passenger space and an additional 2.5 cubic meters for luggage storage. The Viceroy Seaglider operates using wing-in-ground effect (WIG) technology, which allows it to fly close to the water's surface. This enables improved efficiency and reduced detectability. The platform can reach speeds of up to 296 kilometers per hour (160 knots), which is significantly faster than conventional waterborne craft, while maintaining a lower radar and infrared signature. It does not require a runway for takeoff or landing and is equipped with a modular mission system that supports integration of sensors, weapons, and data links. The Viceroy Seagliders could have some potential applications for armed forces in contested maritime environments, as their high-speed capability supports the rapid movement of personnel and supplies while minimizing detectability. Operating within one wingspan of the water’s surface reduces exposure to radar detection and increases survivability in high-threat areas. These characteristics make them suitable for expeditionary logistics, maritime supply chain security, and search-and-rescue missions. Their design enables navigation through denied zones and adverse weather conditions, making them useful for contested logistics. For intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, the Viceroy seaglider’s low observability and modular mission system support sensor and communication equipment integration. This allows for real-time situational awareness across surface, subsurface, and aerial domains. Its electric propulsion system contributes to a reduced infrared signature, limiting detection from aerial and satellite-based surveillance. The platform can also incorporate autonomous drone operations to expand ISR capabilities and battlefield awareness. In special operations, the seaglider’s combination of speed, stealth, and maneuverability supports covert infiltration and exfiltration missions.

Lockheed Martin positions its new CMMT cruise missile as a cost-effective option for a potential conflict with China	On February 3, 2025, Lockheed Martin introduced the Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT), a subsonic, long-range cruise missile designed for cost-effectiveness, adaptability, and scalability. The system is intended to accelerate development and production timelines in response to the U.S. military's focus on maintaining a large inventory of affordable precision weapons, especially to counter China's increasing military activities. CMMT incorporates modular components, including interchangeable seekers, payloads, and propulsion systems, allowing operational flexibility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT) is part of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division under Project Carrera, which seeks to develop a flexible autonomy framework for integrating crewed and uncrewed aircraft in collaborative operations. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) Lockheed Martin is restructuring its internal processes through the 1LMX initiative, its largest modernization effort, to enhance production efficiency, lower costs, and reduce development cycles. The Rapid Dragon program, which validated the feasibility of deploying cruise missiles from palletized transport aircraft, was an early example of this transformation. The CMMT builds on these lessons, prioritizing affordability, rapid production, and adaptability, as the United States is strengthening its inventory of anti-ship and precision-strike weapons to counter Chinese military activities The Rapid Dragon program, developed with the U.S. Air Force, demonstrated the deployment of long-range standoff munitions from cargo aircraft. Live-fire tests confirmed that palletized munitions could be launched from C-130 and C-17 aircraft, expanding the number of potential strike platforms. The system integrates existing munitions while reducing costs and the need for dedicated strike aircraft. These design principles have influenced the CMMT program, particularly in modularity and cost-efficiency. Unlike conventional defense programs that assess production feasibility at later stages, Lockheed Martin has involved manufacturing and quality engineers early in CMMT's development. The company employs a distributed production model to allow for rapid scaling, using modular production cells across multiple locations. This approach also reduces supply chain risks by incorporating multiple suppliers. The Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT) is a subsonic, long-range cruise missile with an expected range exceeding 800 km (500 miles). It is priced at approximately $150,000 per unit. According to Scott Callaway, Director of Affordable Mass at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, CMMT is positioned between low-cost standoff glide weapons and more expensive cruise missiles such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), which costs over $1.5 million per unit. If procured by the U.S. Department of Defense, the production capacity could reach 2,500 units per year to support the U.S. military’s effort to sustain a stockpile of cost-effective weapons for potential conflicts, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, while managing budget constraints. The CMMT has two primary configurations. The first is an air-launched variant designed for deployment from U.S. Air Force airlifters, fighters, and bombers, extending strike range. The second is a shorter-range version for rotary-wing aircraft. The system's modularity allows for customization across multiple environments, including maritime strike applications. Lockheed Martin has indicated that CMMT can be deployed in swarms and can integrate varied seeker technologies to optimize targeting efficiency. It is also worth noting that the CMMT is the third missile unveiled by Lockheed Martin in just a few months, following the JASSM-XR and the Mako, highlighting the company's strategic effort to diversify the U.S. armed forces' stockpile. CMMT is part of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division under Project Carrera, which seeks to develop a flexible autonomy framework for integrating crewed and uncrewed aircraft in collaborative operations. The initiative includes the creation of AI-driven control systems for autonomous drones to operate collaboratively with piloted aircraft such as the F-35, rather than serving as supplementary assets. Early testing has included integrating the Speed Racer drone, a modular payload testbed using digital engineering that has influenced the CMMT design approach, with F-35 fighters to refine operational capabilities. Digital engineering has also allowed Lockheed Martin to reduce the time required to reach the preliminary design review milestone by 50%. Furthermore, Project Carrera builds on previous initiatives, including Skyborg and the X-44A program, which explored AI-driven control systems for uncrewed combat aircraft. In these initiatives, the Skunk Works division tested autonomous drones in combat scenarios, supporting piloted fighters in strike and reconnaissance missions. Early trials have included AI-assisted route planning, sensor integration, and automated threat response. Project Carrera also incorporates Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO) battlespace multipliers, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for beyond-line-of-sight sensing in contested environments and forward-survivable platforms with enhanced sensor capabilities. Integration with Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (JADC2) is a core component, ensuring bi-directional data exchange with command nodes to enhance operational effectiveness. With structured investments of $20 million in crewed and uncrewed assets, $42 million in teaming enablers, and $38 million in battlespace multipliers, Project Carrera is designed to enhance distributed warfare capabilities through networked, AI-enabled systems. The CMMT has two primary configurations, an air-launched variant designed for deployment from U.S. Air Force airlifters, fighters, and bombers, extending strike range, as well as a shorter-range version for rotary-wing aircraft.

Russian destroyer Severomorsk could become the new flagship of the Baltic Fleet to strengthen its anti-submarine capabilities	According to MilitaryRussia on March 2, 2025, the Baltic Fleet appears to have a new flagship, as the Russian Navy has left the Severomorsk, a Udaloy-class destroyer, in the Baltic Sea following its 14-month technical restoration and combat training, rather than returning it to its home fleet. This decision appears to be related to the status of the Baltic Fleet’s former flagship, the Nastoichivy, which has likely been decommissioned and is awaiting disposal, as suggested by the cessation of its sea deployments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The decision to keep the Severomorsk in the Baltic is driven by the need to enhance the fleet’s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities and support sea trials for new diesel-electric submarines under construction in St. Petersburg. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Baltic Fleet has historically maintained limited anti-submarine warfare (ASW) assets compared to the Northern and Pacific Fleets, with a greater emphasis on surface combatants and smaller multi-role vessels. The removal of the Nastoichivy from operational duty necessitated a replacement, and the ASW-focused Severomorsk could improve the fleet’s ability to detect and engage submarines, as its gas turbine propulsion offers increased reliability and sustained deployment capability compared to the steam-powered Nastoichivy. The Severomorsk is a Project 1155 Udaloy-class destroyer commissioned on January 24, 1988, after being built at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad. Originally laid down as Simferopol, it was renamed Severomorsk in 1996. The ship has served extensively in the Northern Fleet, taking part in various naval exercises, including joint drills with the United States and Norway. It has conducted long-range deployments in multiple theaters, including the Arctic, Mediterranean, and the Gulf of Aden, where it carried out convoy escort missions and counter-piracy operations. It has also been involved in Arctic naval operations, including a mission to the New Siberian Islands and participation in the Northern Sea Route transit. The ship’s armament includes two quadruple launchers for URK-5 Rastrub-B anti-submarine/anti-ship missiles, two Kinzhal surface-to-air missile systems with a total of 64 missiles, and 24 RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers. It is also equipped with two AK-100 naval guns, four AK-630 close-in weapon systems (CIWS), and eight 53-65K 533mm torpedoes. It also carries two Ka-27PL helicopters, which enhance the ship's ability to detect, track, and engage submarines beyond the range of its onboard sonar systems. Its sensor suite includes the Polynom sonar system, which provides long-range submarine detection, and the Frigate radar system, which offers air and surface surveillance. The Severomorsk has a standard displacement of 6,840 tons and a full-load displacement of 7,480 tons. It is 163 meters long, 19 meters wide, and has a draft of 7.8 meters. The ship is powered by four gas turbine engines, each generating 20,000 horsepower, for a total of 80,000 horsepower. This propulsion system allows the ship to reach a maximum speed of 29.5 knots and an operational range of 6,882 nautical miles at economical speed. The ship can remain at sea for up to 30 days without resupply. Compared to earlier Soviet destroyers, its gas turbine propulsion system is more reliable than the steam turbines of the Sovremenny-class, reducing maintenance demands and improving operational availability. The hull design incorporates an extended forecastle for improved seaworthiness, and its dual helicopter hangar provides additional ASW capabilities. The Udaloy-class destroyers, developed under Project 1155 in the 1970s, were designed as specialized ASW ships to operate alongside the missile-armed Sovremenny-class destroyers. Soviet naval doctrine at the time emphasized role specialization, with the Udaloy-class optimized for ASW operations and equipped with long-range sonar, missile-torpedoes, and rocket launchers for engaging submarines. The class was introduced to counter NATO submarine threats, particularly those from the United States and the United Kingdom. While early Udaloy-class ships had limited anti-ship and air defense capabilities, later modifications incorporated improved missile systems and gun armament, making them more versatile. The Nastoichivy, a Project 956 Sovremenny-class destroyer, was among the last of its class to be built in the late 1980s and served as the flagship of the Baltic Fleet. Unlike the Udaloy-class, which was designed primarily for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations, Nastoichivy was optimized for surface warfare, armed with Moskit anti-ship missiles and AK-130 dual naval guns. Its air defense capabilities were based on the Uragan missile system, but its ASW capability was limited, relying only on torpedoes and depth charges. The ship was powered by a steam turbine propulsion system, which required extensive maintenance and had operational limitations compared to gas turbines. The Sovremenny-class, developed under Project 956, was designed in response to NATO’s emphasis on surface warfare in the late 1970s. The class prioritized speed and firepower, equipping each ship with long-range anti-ship missiles and rapid-firing artillery. Built between the late 1970s and early 1990s, these destroyers were initially a key part of the Soviet Navy’s surface strike force. However, their lack of strong ASW capabilities and reliance on steam turbine propulsion reduced their long-term viability. Many units have since been retired or transferred to China, with only a few remaining in service with the Russian Navy. The Nastoichivy, a Project 956 Sovremenny-class destroyer, was among the last of its class to be built in the late 1980s and served as the flagship of the Baltic Fleet.

Taurus KEPD-350 Missile Soon to Be Operational on Swedish Gripen Fighter Jets Enabling Long-Range Precision Strikes	Sweden has initiated negotiations with Germany to integrate the Taurus KEPD-350 air-launched cruise missile into its fleet of Saab JAS39 Gripen C/D fighters, according to a recent document from the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), highlighted by The Aviationist. This initiative is part of a broader plan to modernize Sweden’s air force, which includes the gradual phase-out of 45 Gripen C/D aircraft from the current fleet of 105. These will be replaced with newly built Gripen E/F variants and 60 upgraded Gripen C/Ds. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 on the Gripen C is expected to reach initial operational capability by 2028, with its integration on the Gripen E to follow at a later stage (Picture source: Saab) The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 on the Gripen C is expected to reach initial operational capability by 2028, with its integration on the Gripen E to follow at a later stage. Saab, one of the development partners of the missile alongside MBDA Germany, has previously showcased the KEPD-350 as part of the Gripen’s weapon package, though it remains unclear whether it has been live-fired from the aircraft. As a NATO member, Sweden might also consider alternatives such as the AGM-158 JASSM, already acquired by other alliance members, including Poland. The Taurus KEPD-350 is a long-range cruise missile designed for precision strikes against fortified targets. It has a range of 500 km and flies at an altitude of only 35 meters above the ground, reaching a speed of Mach 0.95 (approximately 1,170 km/h). Its 481 kg MEPHISTO warhead features a dual-charge configuration, allowing it to penetrate heavily protected structures. Comparable to the British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG, it provides deep-strike capability for strategic targets. Interest in this missile in Europe has grown, particularly due to its potential deployment in Sweden. In operational scenarios, Gripen aircraft could use Agile Combat Employment (ACE) tactics, utilizing roads and highways as temporary runways to quickly reposition in the Scandinavian terrain. This approach would enhance Sweden’s air force resilience in case of an attack while taking advantage of gaps in Russian defenses to conduct long-range strikes against key targets. South Korea has also demonstrated the effectiveness of the Taurus KEPD-350, integrating it into its fleet of F-15K Slam Eagles in 2016. The missile was used in live-fire exercises in 2017 and, more recently, in October 2024. Its adoption by other air forces further establishes it as a reliable cruise missile capable of operating in modern threat environments. Alongside the Taurus KEPD-350 integration, Sweden is upgrading 60 Gripen C/D aircraft as part of an obsolescence management program. These aircraft will be upgraded to the MS20 Block 3 standard starting in 2026, followed by the MS20 Block 4 upgrade in 2028. The modification process, which began in 2024, will continue until 2027, ensuring sufficient operational capability for training missions and the transition to Gripen E. The planned phase-out of 45 Gripen C/Ds will be adjusted depending on the operational availability of the new Gripen E variants. Sweden’s Gripen program is also directly linked to military assistance for Ukraine. On September 9, 2024, Stockholm announced a $443 million aid package to acquire Gripen spare parts, potentially preparing for a future transfer of aircraft to Kyiv. This support aligns with Sweden’s broader strategy of strengthening Ukraine’s defense capabilities. However, Stockholm remains cautious about the timeline for deliveries, considering ongoing international negotiations and the requirements of its own air force. The development of the Gripen E program has undergone multiple adjustments since its launch in 2013, particularly to align Swedish requirements with those of international customers. Deliveries to the Swedish and Brazilian air forces began in 2020, and Saab has since received orders for conversion kits to upgrade 20 Gripen C/D aircraft to Gripen E. The aim is to achieve a higher level of technical maturity while slightly slowing production to optimize performance. The Swedish Air Force plans to introduce the Gripen E at Såtenäs Air Base by late 2025, though its initial deployment will be limited. Additionally, Saab has received a SEK 1.7 billion order to maintain and modernize Taurus KEPD-350 missiles currently in service with the German Air Force. The contract, signed with TAURUS Systems—a joint venture between MBDA Germany and Saab—includes a major system upgrade and ten years of maintenance from 2025 to 2035. These enhancements will improve the missile’s capabilities to meet evolving operational requirements. The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 into Sweden’s Gripen fleet represents a significant development in the country’s long-range strike capabilities, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions in Europe. By combining an agile platform like the Gripen with a cruise missile capable of neutralizing strategic targets at extended ranges, Sweden strengthens its deterrence posture and enhances its operational flexibility. Future developments in the Gripen program, as well as decisions regarding Ukraine and Sweden’s air force modernization, will have a lasting impact on the country’s defense strategy in the coming years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/taurus-kepd-350-missile-soon-to-be-operational-on-swedish-gripen-fighter-jets-enabling-long-range-precision-strikes	2025-03-03T00:46:53-08:00

Remotely piloted from a mobile ground control station, it provides real-time secure data transmission for operational flexibility. Primarily developed for export, the Wing Loong II has been acquired by several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Serbia. It is marketed as a cost-effective alternative to Western drones such as the U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper, with an estimated unit price between $1 million and $2 million, compared to approximately $30 million for a Reaper. This affordability and versatility make it an attractive option for militaries seeking to enhance their strike and surveillance capabilities. The drone has been used in various conflicts, including Libya, where it conducted airstrikes under Emirati control in 2020. It has also been deployed for non-military missions, such as disaster response during the 2021 Henan floods, where a modified Wing Loong II variant carried out reconnaissance and communication relay operations. The presence of the GJ-2 near Japan aligns with broader regional tensions in the East China Sea. This area, particularly around the Senkaku Islands—administered by Japan but claimed by China as the Diaoyu Islands—has seen frequent incursions by Chinese military aircraft. Just two days before the GJ-2 incident, Japan detected two Chinese Y-9 military aircraft flying a similar route between the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The Y-9, a multi-role aircraft used for intelligence gathering and maritime patrol, is regularly involved in such operations, prompting Japan to deploy fighters in response. Japan’s Ministry of Defense has raised concerns about China's increasing military presence and its potential impact on regional stability. Although the Chinese drones did not violate Japan’s sovereign airspace, their proximity is seen as a show of force and a possible attempt to test Japan’s air defense response. A spokesperson for Japan’s Joint Staff confirmed that the country is maintaining constant airspace surveillance and will take all necessary measures to ensure security. This Chinese drone incursion coincides with the U.S.-Japan joint military exercise 'Iron Fist,' which runs until March 7 and involves maneuvers across multiple locations, including Okinawa. During this exercise, the simultaneous presence of the GJ-2 and BZK-005 near Japanese islands raises questions about potential surveillance activities or strategic messaging from Beijing. The PLA has previously escalated operations in response to military exercises conducted by the U.S. and its allies, highlighting an ongoing competition for influence in the Indo-Pacific. The growing integration of drones into China's military strategy presents a challenge for Japan and its partners, who must adapt their defense capabilities to counter these evolving threats. The potential use of armed drones near Japan’s territory raises considerations about strengthening detection, interception, and counter-drone measures. As China continues to expand its military presence in the region, Japan and its allies remain vigilant, closely monitoring any developments that could alter the strategic balance in the East China Sea and the broader Indo-Pacific.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/emergency-deployment-of-japanese-f-15j-fighter-jets-against-a-chinese-gj-2-drone-off-coast-of-okinawa	2025-03-03T00:14:00-08:00

Focus: What Are the Nuclear Capabilities of France After President Macron's Offer to Protect Europe Against Russia?	On March 1, 2025, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that he was ready to initiate discussions on nuclear deterrence for Europe, signaling that France could extend its nuclear protection to other European Union (EU) member states in light of the increasing security threats posed by Russia. This statement marks a pivotal moment in European defense, suggesting that France, with its advanced nuclear capabilities, may play a more prominent role in safeguarding the continent’s security amid growing geopolitical tensions, particularly as Russia’s actions in Ukraine and military assertiveness in Eastern Europe continue to unsettle the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Rafale fighter aircraft equipped with the ASMP-A supersonic nuclear missile. (Picture source: MBDA) France has long maintained a robust nuclear deterrent, positioning itself as one of the leading nuclear powers globally. The French nuclear arsenal is primarily designed to defend national sovereignty, but in the context of the evolving security environment in Europe, Macron’s comments suggest a shift towards a more collaborative European nuclear posture. President Macron’s willingness to explore the idea of extending France's nuclear umbrella to other EU countries could signify an evolution in the continent's defense strategies, underscoring France's leadership role within both NATO and the EU. France’s nuclear deterrence is built around three primary elements: land-based missiles, air-launched systems, and sea-based platforms, each playing a critical role in ensuring the country's second-strike capability. These three pillars work together to provide France with a comprehensive and survivable nuclear force, capable of responding to any existential threat. While these forces are primarily intended to safeguard France’s own security, they also form the foundation for any potential broader European nuclear deterrence discussions that Macron alluded to. At the heart of France’s land-based nuclear deterrent are the M51 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which are primarily deployed on the Triomphant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). These missiles have a range of approximately 8,000 km and can carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), each with a nuclear warhead. This ensures that France can strike adversaries from a considerable distance, even in the event of a first-strike attack. The M51 system represents one of the most reliable and survivable elements of France’s nuclear strategy. While France does not currently have land-based ICBMs in the traditional sense, the strategic role of submarine-launched M51 missiles ensures that French nuclear forces are second-to-none when it comes to survivability. In terms of air-launched nuclear capabilities, France’s focus is on the ASMP-A (Air-Sol Moyenne Portée-Amélioré) cruise missile, which is deployed on both Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft and Mirage 2000N bombers. The ASMP-A missile is a supersonic, air-to-ground missile designed to deliver nuclear warheads to strategic targets at distances of up to 300 km. The French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) provides the air component of France’s nuclear triad, ensuring that the country can launch nuclear strikes from airbases or aircraft carriers, depending on the operational requirements. The Rafale fighter, with its high agility, versatility, and proven combat record, serves as the primary platform for the delivery of nuclear payloads. France is also planning to integrate future generations of missiles and aircraft, ensuring that its nuclear deterrent remains cutting-edge and capable of evolving alongside emerging technological threats. By far, the most prominent component of France's nuclear deterrent is its sea-based leg, which is centered around the Triomphant-class SSBNs. These submarines carry M51 ICBMs, which have the ability to strike enemy targets thousands of kilometers away while maintaining an untraceable presence beneath the ocean's surface. There are four Triomphant-class SSBNs in service, and they are equipped with the M51 missiles, each capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads. The SSBNs operate under strict nuclear deterrence protocols, and their survivability at sea ensures that France’s nuclear deterrent is never fully neutralized in the event of an attack. These submarines can remain submerged for extended periods, making them a virtually impregnable component of France’s deterrent. This highly survivable second-strike capability means that even in a scenario where French land-based or air-launched nuclear assets are neutralized, the nation can still retaliate with devastating effect from its nuclear-powered submarines. President Macron’s recent comments about European nuclear deterrence come as Europe faces growing geopolitical instability, particularly with Russia's actions in Ukraine and its renewed military assertiveness in Eastern Europe. In this context, Macron has indicated that France is willing to discuss the possibility of extending its nuclear umbrella over other EU member states, potentially enhancing security cooperation within NATO and the EU. Macron’s remarks are timely, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has raised concerns about the security of NATO’s eastern flank. While the alliance has worked to bolster its defenses, the reality is that nuclear deterrence remains a cornerstone of military strategy, especially for nations like France that possess advanced nuclear arsenals. The President’s comments suggest a willingness to deepen defense ties within the EU, including sharing strategic nuclear deterrence to better secure the continent. If Macron's proposal gains traction, France could theoretically offer extended nuclear protection to other EU member states. However, several technical and political factors would need to be addressed, including political consensus within the EU and the logistics of nuclear sharing arrangements. NATO has long used a nuclear-sharing arrangement with several countries, such as Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, allowing these nations to host nuclear weapons as part of the broader alliance. France’s willingness to allow other EU states access to its nuclear deterrent would mark an evolution of this concept and could change the dynamics of European defense. Additionally, extending nuclear deterrence would require detailed agreements on command and control protocols, ensuring that France retains control over its nuclear arsenal while simultaneously offering security guarantees to its European partners. Several NATO member countries also possess or host nuclear capabilities that contribute to the alliance's overall deterrence strategy. The United Kingdom maintains a nuclear deterrent based on the Trident II D5 SLBMs deployed aboard Vanguard-class SSBNs, while the United States provides a significant share of NATO’s nuclear forces through its arsenal of ICBMs, SLBMs, and B61 nuclear bombs stationed in various European countries. Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands all participate in NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangements, hosting U.S. nuclear weapons and ensuring that their aircraft are capable of delivering these weapons in a crisis. Although these countries do not have independent nuclear arsenals, they play a vital role in NATO’s nuclear posture. France’s nuclear deterrent, consisting of land-based, air-launched, and sea-based capabilities, is one of the most sophisticated in the world. President Macron's recent statements on discussing nuclear deterrence for Europe are part of a broader strategy to bolster European security, particularly in light of growing tensions with Russia. While much remains to be discussed, France's nuclear capabilities could play a crucial role in shaping the future of defense policy in Europe, ensuring stability, and providing a powerful deterrent against any potential aggressors. Should Macron’s proposal come to fruition, it could lead to a more integrated European defense strategy, enhancing security across the continent while reinforcing the collective security framework within NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-what-are-the-nuclear-capabilities-of-france-after-president-macrons-offer-to-protect-europe-against-russia	2025-03-02T05:08:19-08:00

Flash News: US Army to Field First Land-Based Variant of New LRHW Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon in 2025	The U.S. Army is set to deploy its land mobile version of its Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) to an operational unit by the end of 2025, as revealed in a recent U.S. Congress report released on February 27, 2025. This marks a significant leap forward in the U.S. Army's modernization efforts and highlights the growing importance of hypersonic technology in the evolving landscape of modern warfare. The LRHW is part of a broader strategy to ensure the U.S. military maintains its technological edge over adversaries who are rapidly developing advanced missile technologies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to Bravo Battery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery, Long Range Fires Battalion, 1st Multi-Domain Task Force, demonstrate the capabilities of one of the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon LRHW Transporter Erector Launchers participating in exercise Bamboo Eagle 24-3 on Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., August 2, 2024. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Hypersonic weapons, such as the LRHW (Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon), are a category of missiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5—five times the speed of sound—and can even reach speeds up to Mach 20, or roughly 24,000 kilometers per hour. What sets these weapons apart from traditional missiles is their ability to travel at hypersonic speeds while maintaining maneuverability mid-flight. Unlike conventional ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable arc, hypersonic weapons can adjust their flight path during the missile's trajectory, making them much harder to intercept with existing missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability gives hypersonic weapons a clear advantage in both offensive and defensive operations, allowing them to evade interception and strike with extreme precision, making them a game-changer in modern military strategy. The LRHW, designed to deliver these hypersonic capabilities, is a long-range, ground-launched missile system that combines an advanced hypersonic glide body with a conventional warhead. This combination enables the U.S. Army to strike targets at ranges far beyond those achievable by traditional artillery or missile systems. The LRHW has a reported range of approximately 2,776 kilometers (1,725 miles) and can travel at speeds exceeding 6,100 kilometers per hour (3,800 miles per hour). The weapon is capable of reaching the top of the Earth's atmosphere and remaining just beyond the reach of current air and missile defense systems until it is ready to strike, at which point it becomes nearly impossible to intercept or defend against. The LRHW can engage a variety of high-value targets, such as enemy command centers, naval fleets, missile defense sites, and strategic infrastructure, all with minimal warning. Its ability to reach these targets at extremely high speeds, coupled with its precision, makes it a formidable tool in both conventional and strategic warfare scenarios. The LRHW system provides the U.S. Army with a strategic attack weapon designed to defeat Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities, suppress adversary long-range fires, and engage other high-priority or time-critical targets. As part of the U.S. Army’s modernization efforts, it is seen as a critical asset for deterring potential adversaries, particularly in regions where military access is restricted or contested. In addition, the U.S. Army’s LRHW development program is closely aligned with the U.S. Navy's efforts, enhancing the overall interoperability of the military’s hypersonic missile capabilities. The LRHW is made up of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) and a 34.5-inch booster developed by the Navy, with the missile component being developed by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. The missile is designed to be launched from a land-based, truck-launched system, giving it the flexibility and mobility to be deployed in a wide variety of operational environments. When the hypersonic glide body is attached, it is referred to as the Navy-Army All Up Round plus Canister (AUR+C). This missile component serves as the common two-stage booster for both the U.S. Army’s LRHW and the U.S. Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) system, which can be fired from both surface vessels and submarines. The U.S. Army’s integration of the LRHW into its arsenal represents a significant leap in strike capability, offering the ability to engage targets at long ranges, outpacing traditional missile defense systems. The weapon’s speed, maneuverability, and precision make it a formidable tool in the U.S. military’s arsenal, with the ability to deter adversaries and respond rapidly to evolving threats. The deployment of hypersonic weapons like the LRHW is especially critical in the current geopolitical environment, where rival powers such as China and Russia are also developing similar technologies. The LRHW offers the U.S. Army a critical strategic advantage by ensuring that it can strike at high-priority targets in enemy territory at speeds that are difficult to defend against. The weapon's ability to rapidly change its trajectory mid-flight further complicates the task of intercepting or neutralizing the threat, making it an essential element in the U.S. military's deterrence strategy. In August 2024, a significant milestone in the LRHW program occurred when the U.S. Army’s only LRHW battery, part of the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), participated in Bamboo Eagle, an eight-day joint exercise led by the U.S. Air Force. The exercise, which took place across various locations in the U.S., was the first time that U.S. Army land-based fires were integrated into an Air Force-led exercise. Over 3,000 service members from the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and even allied forces like the Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force participated. The integration of the LRHW into Bamboo Eagle 24-3 showcased the U.S. military's ability to operate across multiple domains, including land, air, sea, and cyber, in a coordinated and effective manner. This participation demonstrated the LRHW's potential for joint operations, proving that it could serve as a key element in integrated, multi-service military operations, providing a versatile and powerful strike capability. The U.S. Army originally planned to deploy the LRHW to the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, specifically to the 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, 17th Field Artillery Brigade. However, the latest reports indicate that it is still unclear whether this specific unit will be the first to receive the LRHW, or if other units will be chosen for its initial deployment. Despite the uncertainty around the exact deployment location, the U.S. Army is on track to begin fielding the LRHW by the end of 2025, with the goal of having the system fully operational shortly thereafter. Looking to the future, the LRHW is expected to be just the beginning of the U.S. Army's hypersonic missile program. The U.S. Army is continuing to refine the LRHW's capabilities and is also working on developing additional hypersonic systems, including air-launched and sea-launched variants. These systems will complement the LRHW, enabling the U.S. military to maintain a strategic edge in high-speed, precision strikes across various domains. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare cannot be overstated. With their ability to strike rapidly and with precision, hypersonic missiles are seen as a key deterrent against adversaries who may otherwise feel emboldened to challenge U.S. military forces. These weapons represent a significant shift in how the U.S. military will engage in future conflicts, offering capabilities that are not only faster but also harder to predict and defend against. The LRHW, as part of the U.S. Army’s overall strategy, will provide a vital asset in future conflicts, allowing the U.S. to project power more effectively and rapidly than ever before, ensuring that it remains a dominant force in global military affairs.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-army-to-field-first-land-based-variant-of-new-lrhw-long-range-hypersonic-weapon-in-2025	2025-03-01T07:23:57-08:00

Russia’s use of both surveillance and combat drones to attack Ukrainian positions has been a persistent threat. NASAMS, with its advanced tracking and missile engagement systems, is particularly effective at intercepting UAVs before they can cause significant damage. This capability is vital, given the growing use of drones on the battlefield. Moreover, NASAMS' modular design allows for flexible deployment in a variety of settings, from fixed installations to mobile units that can be quickly repositioned. This mobility makes NASAMS a highly adaptable solution, whether deployed to defend strategic military sites or used in broader area defense operations. The delivery of NASAMS to Ukraine has significantly strengthened the country’s air defense capabilities, especially in the face of Russia's large-scale missile and drone strikes. As Colonel Trøite pointed out, the success of NASAMS in intercepting over 900 aerial threats, including more than 500 cruise missiles, has been a crucial factor in mitigating the damage caused by Russian missile campaigns. In the broader context of Ukraine’s defense strategy, the 94 percent interception rate of NASAMS complements other air defense systems, creating a multi-layered defense network that can protect critical infrastructure from a wide array of missile and aerial threats. The continued supply of NASAMS and similar advanced systems will be essential for Ukraine as the war progresses. The success of NASAMS in countering Russia’s missile and drone tactics highlights the importance of Western defense support in ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and its ability to resist external aggression. With the impressive 900+ intercepts, NATO's contributions are playing a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defensive efforts and in shaping the future of the conflict. The NASAMS air defense missile system, with its advanced radar capabilities, highly effective missile interceptors, and modular design, has emerged as one of the most effective tools in Ukraine’s defense arsenal. The continued deliveries from NATO countries, including Norway and the United States, are enhancing Ukraine’s capacity to safeguard its airspace and critical infrastructure against Russian aerial threats. As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, systems like NASAMS will remain central to the country's efforts to defend itself and maintain its sovereignty in the face of ongoing Russian invasion.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-nasams-air-defense-system-intercepts-over-900-russian-missiles-with-94-percent-effectiveness-in-ukraine	2025-03-01T05:55:45-08:00

Used by 29 countries, it can be launched from ships, submarines, aircraft, or coastal defense batteries. Equipped with active radar guidance, it follows a low-altitude trajectory to avoid detection and employs terminal maneuvers such as sea-skimming or pop-up attacks to increase effectiveness. Over time, the missile has been upgraded, including the Block II version, which features GPS-assisted inertial navigation, enabling land attack capability. The latest iteration, the Harpoon Block II+, enhances guidance, network connectivity, and resistance to electronic countermeasures, improving its ability to operate in electronic warfare environments. Manufactured by Boeing, the Harpoon has been integrated into several platforms, including the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18 fighters and P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, as well as the U.S. Air Force’s B-52H bombers. Ship- and land-launched variants require a solid-fuel booster for launch, whereas the air-launched version activates its engine after release. Powered by a Teledyne turbojet generating over 600 pounds of thrust, the missile maintains subsonic speed while ensuring extended range and precision. Initially designed for naval warfare, its evolving capabilities have made it suitable for broader operational contexts. By leveraging the gateway system, the U.S. Air Force has significantly reduced the time required to integrate the Harpoon onto the F-16, demonstrating a viable concept for the rapid adaptation of other weapon systems. This approach could allow for more agile responses to battlefield requirements while minimizing costs and development timelines. According to the project lead for the integration, this method could be applied to additional weapon types and aircraft platforms, providing military planners with increased flexibility in operational and contingency planning. The successful integration of the Harpoon into the F-16 also demonstrates the U.S. military’s ability to streamline processes that traditionally slow down the deployment of new capabilities. By reducing bureaucratic delays and modification costs, this approach enables faster upgrades without extended aircraft downtime. The ability to integrate new weapons onto existing platforms efficiently could influence future strategies for Air Force modernization. This test marks a milestone in how military forces approach capability upgrades. By proving that rapid integration is feasible, it sets the stage for further advancements in weapons acquisition and deployment processes. Over time, this methodology could enhance the responsiveness of air forces and ensure continued operational effectiveness in an evolving threat landscape.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-air-force-equips-f-16-fighter-jets-with-harpoon-missiles-expanding-naval-strike-capabilities	2025-02-28T01:34:07-08:00

This follows Poland's 2022 decision to procure 32 AW149 helicopters from the Italian company Leonardo, with production based at PZL Świdnik. Deliveries, which began in 2023, are set to continue through 2029 as part of a $1.85 billion (€1.76 billion) contract, the largest order for the AW149 to date.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link It is estimated that approximately 20 of the ordered AW149 helicopters will be assembled in Świdnik, strengthening Poland’s domestic helicopter production. (Picture source: Twitter/Wiktor Sawicki) The AW149 production line in Świdnik officially opened in 2024, serving as a domestic logistics and technical support hub. The facility oversees systems integration, armament fittings, modernization efforts, and maintenance throughout the helicopters’ service life. It is estimated that approximately 20 of the ordered AW149 helicopters will be assembled in Świdnik, strengthening Poland’s domestic aerospace industry. Leonardo’s involvement in Polish helicopter production extends beyond the AW149, as the company previously secured a contract for four AW101 naval helicopters for the Polish Navy, also assembled at PZL Świdnik. This industrial investment aligns with Poland’s broader strategy of reducing reliance on Soviet-era platforms, as its helicopter fleet, which includes the Mi-8, Mi-17, Mi-24, and SH-2G, faces aging issues, with an average fleet age exceeding 30 years. Poland's decision to acquire the AW149 helicopters is linked to the Perkoz program, which aims to modernize the country’s rotary-wing fleet by replacing aging Soviet-era Mi-2 and W-3 Sokół helicopters. Initially, the Perkoz program sought to acquire 32 multi-role helicopters in three different variants: combat support, command, and reconnaissance/electronic warfare. However, in March 2021, the technical dialogue involving 12 contractors was suspended. The outbreak of war in Ukraine expedited Poland’s decision, leading to an urgent operational requirement that resulted in the AW149 contract in 2022. The helicopters are expected to be operated primarily by the 25th Air Cavalry Brigade, enhancing its transport, combat support, and reconnaissance capabilities. Historically, Poland had considered multiple options for replacing its helicopter fleet. Previous plans included the 2015 selection of the Airbus H225M Caracal, which was ultimately canceled, followed by small-scale acquisitions of the Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk for special forces. The AW149 was previously proposed in tenders but only secured its place in Poland’s modernization efforts after an assessment of industrial and operational benefits. The contract also ensures that at least a portion of the helicopters will be built in Poland, reinforcing local aerospace capabilities. The AW149 is a multi-role military helicopter with an 8,600 kg maximum takeoff weight, a 17.6-meter fuselage, and a 14.6-meter rotor diameter. Its development began in 2006 as a military derivative of the AW139, with its first flight occurring in 2009. It features structural reinforcements for military operations, advanced avionics, and modularity for multiple mission configurations. The helicopter has previously been exported to Thailand and Egypt, but Poland’s acquisition represents its largest commitment to date. In terms of performance, the AW149 is powered by either two General Electric CT7-2E1 or two Safran Aneto-1K engines. It achieves a maximum speed of 313 km/h and an operational range of 844 km, with a service ceiling of 4,600 meters. The helicopter can carry up to 19 passengers or 16 fully equipped soldiers, with a standard military configuration of 12 soldiers and two gunners. It supports various mission profiles, including troop transport, reconnaissance, and close air support. The Polish AW149s will be equipped with observation and targeting systems, self-defense countermeasures, and multiple weapon configurations. Armament options include two 7.92 mm machine guns mounted internally, along with guided and unguided rockets and air-to-ground missiles of the same class as Hellfire. Depending on mission requirements, weapons can be installed inside the cabin or mounted externally. Additionally, Poland has secured 800 AGM-114R2 Hellfire II missiles to integrate with the fleet, enhancing its offensive capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/polands-first-locally-produced-leonardo-aw149-leaves-assembly-line-to-replace-aging-soviet-era-helicopters	2025-02-28T00:15:29-08:00	
North Korea Conducts New Cruise Missile Test in Response to Reinforcement of US Military Exercises in Indo-Pacific	On February 26, 2025, North Korea carried out a new test of strategic cruise missiles from its west coast, demonstrating its military capabilities and responding to what it perceives as increasing external threats. Supervised by Kim Jong-un, the test aimed to assess the reliability of its weapons systems and send a direct message to its adversaries. According to the official KCNA news agency, the missiles followed an elliptical trajectory of 1,587 kilometers for nearly 8,000 seconds before reaching their targets, highlighting their precision and operational capability. The launch, closely monitored by South Korea and the United States, was detected early by South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, which had been tracking military movements in the North based on prior warning signs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency shows a strategic cruise missile being launched during a drill on February 26. (Picture source: KCNA) This test is part of an ongoing pattern of North Korea’s military demonstrations in response to regional geopolitical tensions. Kim Jong-un emphasized the necessity of these tests to maintain the effectiveness of North Korea’s nuclear deterrent and ensure national security. Pyongyang views these missile launches as a reaction to what it calls 'provocations' from the United States and its allies, particularly amid the strengthening of joint military exercises between Seoul and Washington. With the annual Freedom Shield exercise scheduled for March, North Korea perceives these drills as a direct threat, whereas the United States and South Korea maintain that they are purely defensive. In this context, North Korea aims to reinforce its deterrence posture, signaling that its military capabilities are operationally ready if needed. The timing of this launch coincides with shifts in U.S. policy toward North Korea under the Trump administration. Washington has reaffirmed its commitment to North Korea’s denuclearization and has strengthened its trilateral partnership with Seoul and Tokyo, increasing pressure on Kim Jong-un’s regime.According to Hong Min, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, these missile tests directly respond to Washington’s recent measures, including its continued support for UN sanctions against Pyongyang. This launch marks the fourth missile test conducted by North Korea this year and the second since Trump’s return to office. In January, Pyongyang had already tested nuclear-capable cruise missiles, framing the move as a 'firm countermeasure' to U.S. actions. Over the years, North Korea has sought to expand and refine its missile arsenal, developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, which are capable of reaching U.S. territory, as well as intermediate-range missiles like the Hwasong-12, which pose a direct threat to Japan and Guam. Additionally, it has developed short-range missiles, including the KN-23, modeled after the Russian Iskander missile, and strategic cruise missiles like those tested in its latest launch. This modernization effort reflects Pyongyang’s strategy to counter its adversaries’ missile defense systems by employing more unpredictable flight paths and harder-to-detect weapons. These technological advancements have significant implications for neighboring countries. South Korea and Japan remain the most exposed to North Korea’s missile capabilities and have been reinforcing their defense systems, with increased support from the United States, which has expanded its military presence in the region. For Washington, North Korea’s ability to reach U.S. territory with long-range missiles presents a strategic challenge, prompting a reassessment of deterrence frameworks. In response, the U.S. and its allies continue to strengthen their collective defense posture while maintaining diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang to curb its military advancements. The February 26 launch once again highlights North Korea’s approach of demonstrating its military capabilities while testing the reactions of its adversaries. As tensions in the region escalate, such displays risk further complicating the security situation in East Asia, reducing the prospects for diplomatic engagement or de-escalation soon.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/north-korea-conducts-new-cruise-missile-test-in-response-to-reinforcement-of-us-military-exercises-in-indo-pacific	2025-02-27T23:58:04-08:00

The Chunmoo is designed for enhanced mobility on the field with its 8x8 chassis and quick deployment capabilities, featuring four hydraulic jacks to ensure stability during firing. One of the main strengths of the Chunmoo lies in its integration flexibility, demonstrated through its deployment in Poland’s HOMAR-K program, where it is mounted on Jelcz trucks. This adaptability is particularly relevant for Norway, as the system could be integrated onto national platforms, enhancing interoperability with other European defense systems, especially those of NATO, and also allowing the use of 122 mm rockets, a common caliber in Europe. Beyond its technical features, the acquisition of the Chunmoo aligns with an ongoing industrial cooperation strategy between Norway and South Korea. Since 2017, Hanwha Aerospace has provided Norway with K9 VIDAR self-propelled howitzers, and in 2022, additional orders increased the number of K9 units to 28 and K10 ammunition resupply vehicles to 14 in Norwegian service. This partnership has been further strengthened by a memorandum of understanding signed in June 2024 at the Eurosatory defense exhibition, aimed at integrating Norwegian technologies into Hanwha’s platforms. A prior agreement in 2022 focused on collaboration in infantry fighting vehicles and long-range precision strike systems, underscoring the mutual interest of both parties in joint projects. The K239 Chunmoo could significantly enhance Norway’s long-range precision strike capability, improving its effectiveness against potential threats in the Nordic region. As a NATO member, Norway must maintain a defense force capable of deterring any aggression, particularly due to its proximity to Russia. The Chunmoo, with its ability to fire rockets of varying calibers and strike targets up to 200 km away, would allow Norway to conduct precise strikes while providing flexibility for operations in different terrain and mission types. Additionally, its compatibility with multiple vehicle platforms would offer interoperability with other NATO defense systems. From a geopolitical standpoint, acquiring the Chunmoo would strengthen Norway’s strategic ties with South Korea, a key partner in Asia, and diversify its military relations beyond its traditional European and American allies. In the context of increasing tensions in Eastern Europe and the Arctic, particularly with Russia, a precision strike system like the Chunmoo would provide Norway with enhanced capabilities to respond swiftly to threats and contribute to deterrence efforts. Furthermore, this cooperation could create industrial opportunities for Norwegian companies, while solidifying Norway’s position as a key player in regional defense and within NATO. Hanwha Aerospace, South Korea's largest defense and aerospace group, continues to expand its presence in the international market. Specializing in the production of armored vehicles, and precision-guided munitions, and active in the space sector through the Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV) program, the company aims to increase its footprint in Europe. The Chunmoo MLRS offer to Norway is part of this strategy, presenting a high-performance system capable of significantly enhancing Norway’s long-range artillery capabilities while contributing to collective defense within NATO in an evolving security environment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/chunmoo-mlrs-by-hanwha-aerospace-could-emerge-as-a-new-platform-for-cooperation-with-norway	2025-02-27T07:31:51-08:00

Germany's new Cicada electric drone killer expands land and naval defense against low-altitude threats	Diehl Defence is presenting its Sky Sphere drone defense system at the German Enforce Tac exhibition in Nuremberg, taking place from February 24 to 26, 2025. A key feature of the exhibition is the eMissile Cicada, presented under this name for the first time in Europe. The Cicada is designed to counter Class 1 and 2 drone threats and is available in both lethal and non-lethal configurations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Diehl Defence is already in discussions with potential customers regarding integration projects, with plans to have the Sky Sphere system and the Cicada missile commercially available by late 2026. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Cicada is an electrically driven missile designed for two operational roles. The non-lethal variant neutralizes drones with a catch net, while the lethal version incorporates a fragmentation warhead to destroy aerial threats. As part of the Sky Sphere system, the Cicada integrates into a sensor-to-shooter chain, providing flexibility in configuration. The system can be customized with components from Diehl Defence or partner companies to meet specific customer requirements. Diehl Defence is already in discussions with potential customers regarding integration projects, with plans to have the Sky Sphere system commercially available by late 2026. For instance, the German Army is reportedly considering its integration with the Skyranger 30 short-range air defense vehicle, and industry sources suggest it may also be tested aboard an F125 frigate following trials of the Iris-T SLM surface-to-air missile later in 2025. Diehl Defence representatives stated that Cicada currently holds a technology readiness level of 5 to 6, indicating it has moved beyond laboratory testing to functional prototype evaluations in controlled environments. A 2024 Bundeswehr review highlighted the necessity of systems like Cicada to address the growing presence of drones in combat. Vice Admiral Rainer Brinkmann also emphasized the need for enhanced drone defenses in Germany’s naval fleet to counter evolving aerial threats. Cicada is a lightweight, vertical-launch system with an estimated weight of less than 50 kilograms, designed for compatibility with various platforms. The missile features foldable fins for compact storage within a 30-centimeter-diameter tube, deploying mid-flight for stability and maneuverability. Its guidance system includes an active radar seeker for target acquisition and an uplink-downlink communication channel for in-flight adjustments. The missile’s high-explosive fragmentation warhead is designed to create a 10-meter kill radius, enhancing effectiveness against drones. The missile’s propulsion relies on a solid-fuel rocket motor, generating an initial thrust of approximately 1,000 meters per second. The burn time supports an engagement range of 8 to 12 kilometers, with an operational ceiling of 5 kilometers. In contrast to the Iris-T SLM’s 40-kilometer range, Cicada is designed for short-range drone interception. The missile employs a steep ascent followed by a guided descent to engage targets, utilizing algorithms designed for tracking unpredictable drone movements. Under the name Sky Sphere, the Cicada, developed by Diehl Defence in collaboration with the Swiss company Skysec, was previously presented at Euronaval 2024 as part of efforts to enhance defensive capabilities against drones, which have become widely used in reconnaissance and offensive operations. Sky Sphere builds on Diehl Defence’s High Power Electro-Magnetic (HPEM) systems, adding another layer of drone defense. The Sky Sphere is based on Skysec’s Sentinel Catch concept, originally designed to capture enemy drones using a net before descending safely with a parachute. The updated design retains the same airframe but replaces the net system with a high-explosive fragmentation warhead, allowing for the destruction of multiple drones in swarm attacks. At Euronaval 2024, the missile was presented with a radar seeker for target acquisition and a data-link system to coordinate responses between multiple interceptors. The system was said to have a flight duration of three to four minutes, a maximum speed exceeding 200 km/h, and a range of up to five kilometers. At that time, Diehl Defence and Skysec were optimizing the missile for canister launch to enable multiple-launch configurations. The companies were also testing different materials, including metal and foam, to refine the production process and reduce manufacturing costs. The Sky Sphere system was projected to reach operational status by 2026, with support from the Swiss military.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/germanys-new-cicada-electric-drone-killer-expands-land-and-naval-defense-against-low-altitude-threats	2025-02-27T02:51:36-08:00

This expansion of Chinese military activities signals an increasing effort to establish a dominant presence in the region. Meanwhile, China continues to reinforce its discourse on reunification with Taiwan. The official Xinhua news agency reported that Wang Huning, a senior leader of the Chinese Communist Party, recently urged Chinese authorities to 'firmly grasp the initiative in cross-strait relations and resolutely advance the cause of national reunification.' These statements, combined with recent military actions, indicate a more assertive approach by Beijing to exert pressure on Taiwan. In response to this growing challenge, the Taiwanese government reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening its defense capabilities. The Ministry of Defense stated that China’s policy, which claims to support 'peaceful coexistence' with Taiwan, contradicts its actions, as military incursions into the island’s maritime and aerial zones continue to increase. Taipei interprets these maneuvers as attempts to intimidate its population and test the responsiveness of its armed forces. Rising tensions around Taiwan remain a significant source of friction between China and the United States. While Washington maintains a policy of 'strategic ambiguity,' it is legally bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide the island with the means to defend itself in the event of Chinese aggression. However, there remains uncertainty regarding whether the U.S. would directly intervene militarily in a potential conflict. Amid this military and diplomatic standoff, Taipei continues to enhance its defense capabilities by modernizing its armed forces and strengthening strategic alliances. The situation in the Taiwan Strait remains highly volatile, with each new military maneuver increasing concerns over a potential confrontation between China and Taiwan.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-mobilizes-military-as-china-launches-live-fire-drills-near-its-coast	2025-02-27T01:30:00-08:00

The system is designed to provide both precision and rapid-response fire support, delivering guided rockets and artillery rounds over great distances with pinpoint accuracy. During the exercise, U.S. Soldiers had the opportunity to maneuver and operate the M270A2 on an Arctic battlefield. They practiced moving the system through snowy, ice-crusted terrain, and firing live rockets to simulate a response to a potential conflict in the Arctic. The operation demonstrated the U.S. Army’s ability to quickly deploy and coordinate with allied forces under conditions that are often considered one of the most extreme battle environments in the world. The M270A2 was first delivered to the U.S. Army in 2020, with the first operational unit receiving the upgraded systems in 2021. The 3rd Battalion, 13th Field Artillery Regiment, based at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, was the first unit to officially field the M270A2. This modernized version of the system marked a significant leap forward in the Army's artillery capabilities, with key upgrades that improved the effectiveness and survivability of the vehicle in both conventional and complex battle environments. Following its initial deployment with the 3rd Battalion, other units, including Charlie Battery of the 1st Battalion, 6th Field Artillery Regiment, continued to receive the M270A2, ensuring that the U.S. Army’s artillery units were equipped with the most advanced systems available. The M270A2’s performance in the Arctic was particularly crucial as the system was developed to operate in a variety of demanding environments.

These include a new fire control system, digital communications, and enhanced power generation capabilities, all designed to improve the overall system's mobility, accuracy, and operational efficiency. One of the most notable improvements is the integration of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), which allow for longer ranges and higher precision strikes. The new fire control system also enables faster target acquisition and quicker response times, reducing the time between receiving orders and launching munitions. The M270A2’s enhanced launcher mechanisms allow for a more rapid reload process, improving the system's efficiency during combat. This reduction in downtime between fire missions is a significant advantage, particularly in combat scenarios where speed and adaptability are crucial. Moreover, the M270A2 has a new cab design that is more comfortable and ergonomic for the crew, which enhances operational readiness and reduces fatigue during extended operations. The system’s ability to launch multiple types of rockets and missiles, including precision-guided munitions, makes it a versatile asset on the battlefield. In the Arctic, the system's ability to operate in extreme cold and navigate through rugged, snow-laden terrain is vital. The integration of new technologies, such as the ATACMS and GMLRS, is expected to provide U.S. and NATO forces with a significant edge in both conventional and long-range strikes. This Arctic test demonstrated that the M270A2 can function effectively in sub-zero temperatures, with no significant performance issues reported during the exercise. Joint Viking 25, a multilateral exercise hosted by Norway, brought together forces from multiple NATO countries, aiming to improve interoperability and enhance readiness in Arctic warfare. The exercise's focus on the Arctic is particularly timely, given the increasing geopolitical tension in the region, particularly around Russian military activities in the High North. For the U.S. Army, the exercise served as an essential test of its ability to work closely with Arctic Allies. Norwegian Army instructors provided critical expertise, guiding U.S. Soldiers through the nuances of operating in one of the world’s most inhospitable environments. The collaborative training highlighted the shared commitment to maintaining security and deterrence in the Arctic region, which remains strategically vital for NATO. The Arctic is becoming an increasingly important theater for military operations, with nations like Russia ramping up their presence in the region. The U.S. Army’s participation in Joint Viking 25 reflects the growing importance of Arctic warfare training and operations in maintaining military readiness. By strengthening the U.S. military’s capacity to operate in such challenging conditions, the exercise bolstered the Army’s capability to respond rapidly to any crisis in Arctic terrain, where mobility and speed are critical. The M270A2’s successful performance during this test is a promising sign that the U.S. Army’s modernization efforts are well on track. The system’s enhanced mobility and firepower, combined with the proficiency of U.S. Soldiers operating in close coordination with their Norwegian counterparts, make it a formidable asset in defending NATO’s northern flank. As the exercise concluded, the feedback from U.S. and Norwegian forces alike indicated that the M270A2 was able to operate effectively in the harsh Arctic environment. This not only validates the system's technological improvements but also provides valuable lessons for future operations in the region. The successful integration of the M270A2 MLRS into Arctic operations further emphasizes the U.S. Army’s commitment to modernizing its forces to face emerging global threats. The test of the system in the Arctic highlights a new era of readiness, where U.S. forces are equipped to confront both traditional and unconventional threats with agility and precision, regardless of the climate. Joint Viking 25 marks just one of many upcoming exercises designed to strengthen NATO’s presence and capabilities in the Arctic. As tensions in the region continue to evolve, the lessons learned from this first test of the M270A2 will be critical for shaping future operations in the High North. This exercise further solidifies the U.S. Army’s ability to deploy powerful systems like the M270A2 in support of its allies and to deter potential adversaries, ensuring stability and security in the Arctic for years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-army-conducts-first-arctic-test-of-new-m270a2-mlrs-rocket-launchers-in-norway	2025-02-27T00:49:59-08:00	
US Navy Deploys Nuclear Submarine USS Minnesota to Australia as Chinese Flotilla Operates Offshore	The arrival of the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Minnesota (SSN 783) at HMAS Stirling naval base in Western Australia on February 25, 2025, comes amid rising tensions in the Tasman Sea, where a Chinese flotilla is operating within Australia’s exclusive economic zone, as reported by Stars and Stripes. While this port call marks the first of two planned visits by U.S. attack submarines to Australia this year, it is also part of the AUKUS trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, aimed at providing Australia with a sovereign nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarine capability. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Virginia-class fast-attack submarine USS Minnesota transits Apra Harbor, Naval Base Guam, January 18, 2025 (Picture source: US DoD) This visit coincides with the presence of a Chinese flotilla in waters south of Australia, attracting increased scrutiny from Australian and U.S. military authorities. The task force, consisting of the Jiangkai-class frigate Hengyang, the Renhai-class cruiser Zunyi, and the Fuchi-class replenishment vessel Weishanhu, was spotted south of Tasmania within Australia's exclusive economic zone. It recently conducted live-fire exercises in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, an action perceived by Australian officials as a strategic move to gauge regional responses. The USS Minnesota (SSN-783) is a Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine designed for surveillance, power projection, and undersea warfare. The tenth vessel of its class, it was built by Newport News Shipbuilding, laid down on May 20, 2011, and commissioned on September 7, 2013. Measuring 114.9 meters in length with a submerged displacement of approximately 7,800 tons, it is powered by an S9G nuclear reactor, providing it with virtually unlimited operational range over a 33-year lifespan. It is equipped with Mk-48 torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, allowing it to engage both undersea and land-based targets. Its pump-jet propulsor enhances stealth by reducing acoustic signatures. The Minnesota's early service life was marked by extended repairs due to a reactor cooling system defect. Following maintenance, it returned to operational status in May 2016 and was gradually reassigned to the Pacific Theater. In November 2024, it became the first Virginia-class submarine permanently forward-deployed to Naval Base Guam, reflecting an increased U.S. naval presence in the Indo-Pacific. Its ability to conduct prolonged operations at sea and integrate advanced electronic warfare systems makes it a significant asset for the U.S. Navy. Andrew Shearer, Director-General of Australia’s Office of National Intelligence, stated before a parliamentary committee that the Chinese exercises not only demonstrate an increasing ability to project military power into Australia’s immediate region but also indicate an expanding intent to do so. According to Shearer, Beijing seeks to normalize its military presence and influence regional behaviors by monitoring responses to its activities. He described the deployment as the southernmost operation ever conducted by a People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA-N) task force. Australian military authorities have not confirmed whether a Chinese submarine is accompanying the flotilla but consider it a plausible assumption. Additionally, commercial airline pilots flying over the Tasman Sea reported intercepting radio communications between the Chinese vessels and New Zealand military surveillance aircraft, particularly warnings related to live-fire drills. Meanwhile, the USS Minnesota is engaged in at-sea operations as part of the Submarine Command Course, a training program for naval officers preparing for submarine command. During its port call at HMAS Stirling, U.S. and Australian naval personnel have the opportunity to share and compare procedures, including weapons handling and submarine operations. Royal Australian Navy Rear Admiral Tom Phillips, Head of the Australian Submarine Agency, emphasized the significance of this visit in establishing a rotational submarine force in Western Australia. 'Each time a nuclear-powered submarine docks at HMAS Stirling, we take a meaningful step closer to establishing the Submarine Rotational Force – West and developing a sovereign nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarine capability for Australia,' he stated. The Australian government continues to strengthen its cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom through AUKUS. By 2027, the initiative is expected to establish a rotational nuclear submarine force at HMAS Stirling, including one British and four U.S. submarines. Australia is upgrading its naval infrastructure to accommodate and service allied nuclear-powered submarines, a process already initiated with the visit of the USS Hawaii and USS Emory S. Land in 2024. U.S. Consul General in Perth, Siriana Nair, reaffirmed the strategic importance of the AUKUS partnership, stating that 'AUKUS is a foundational agreement that demonstrates the United States' confidence in Australia and its commitment to Indo-Pacific allies and partners.' Amid escalating tensions in the Indo-Pacific, the deployment of the USS Minnesota to Australia underscores U.S. engagement in regional security and its commitment to allies in response to increasing Chinese naval activity. As Beijing expands its military presence further from its own territory, Australia and the United States are intensifying efforts to adapt their defense posture and ensure regional stability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navy-deploys-nuclear-submarine-uss-minnesota-to-australia-as-chinese-flotilla-operates-offshore	2025-02-27T00:41:00-08:00

Denmark Ramps Up Rearmament to Counter European Tensions and American Influence	On 19 February 2025, Denmark announced an unprecedented plan to strengthen its defense, allocating an investment of 120 billion Danish kroner (16 billion euros) by 2033. This decision marks a break from decades of budget cuts and comes amid increasing tensions in Europe, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and uncertainty regarding U.S. engagement in the region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In December 2024, Denmark strengthened its cooperation with Sweden by signing a $2.5 billion contract with BAE Systems for the acquisition of 115 new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles (Picture source: Danish MoD) The Danish strategy follows a dual approach. An acceleration fund of 50 billion kroner will be allocated for 2025-2026 to finance short-term military acquisitions and reinforce support for Ukraine. An additional 70 billion kroner will be allocated between 2027 and 2033 to modernize the armed forces, recruit personnel, and develop infrastructure. This increase will bring defense spending to 3.2% of GDP in 2025, exceeding NATO’s 2% target. In 2024, Denmark implemented several significant measures to strengthen its military capabilities. A multiparty agreement was reached to achieve 2% of GDP in military spending that same year, six years ahead of the original plan. An allocation of 35.2 billion kroner (4.72 billion euros) was dedicated to acquiring CV90 infantry fighting vehicles, short- and medium-range air defense systems, and anti-submarine capabilities. The military service system was also reformed, increasing the number of annual conscripts from 4,700 to 7,500 and extending the service period from four to eleven months. In December 2024, Denmark strengthened its cooperation with Sweden by signing a $2.5 billion contract with BAE Systems for the acquisition of 115 new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles. These vehicles, equipped with upgraded turrets and advanced targeting systems, are intended to enhance Denmark’s heavy brigade and contribute to collective security. Denmark has also increased its support for Ukraine with arms and military equipment purchases amounting to 538 million euros. These acquisitions include Bohdana artillery systems, long-range strike drones, anti-tank missiles, and anti-ship missiles. In February 2025, an additional 50 billion kroner (6.99 billion euros) was allocated to address gaps in air defense systems and expedite military equipment acquisitions. Denmark justifies these measures by citing an increasing potential threat from Russia, which could pose a serious risk to the Baltic states and NATO members if the alliance does not strengthen its military capabilities. A recent Danish intelligence report warns of a credible threat in the Baltic Sea region within two years if the war in Ukraine ends or reaches a stalemate. The re-election of Donald Trump and shifts in U.S. foreign policy have further added to uncertainties. Statements suggesting a possible U.S. disengagement from European affairs and renewed interest in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, have prompted Copenhagen to reassess its strategic position. To accelerate military acquisitions, the Danish Ministry of Defense will undergo restructuring. The Chief of Defense will be given an expanded role, with certain administrative agencies placed under direct military command. This centralization aims to streamline decision-making. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated, 'There is only one directive for the Chief of Defense: buy, buy, buy,' adding that procurement processes will be expedited to facilitate quicker acquisitions, even if that means opting for alternatives when the best equipment is unavailable. Denmark is also enhancing its military presence in the Arctic and North Atlantic by acquiring additional Arctic patrol vessels and long-range drones to counter Russian military activities in the region. The issue of Greenland remains a focal point, particularly after the U.S. announced in January 2024 its intention to expand its military presence on the island. In response, Frederiksen reaffirmed that 'Greenland is not for sale' and emphasized Denmark’s sovereignty over the territory. This military buildup aligns with broader European trends. Lithuania has announced an increase in its defense budget to 5-6% of GDP by 2026, while Latvia plans to reach 4% in 2025. To finance these investments, Denmark is considering exceptional fiscal measures. The government has not ruled out introducing a 'war tax' to cover rising military expenditures, which could cost an average Danish household up to 85,000 kroner (11,927 euros) per year. This policy marks a shift for a country historically cautious in budgetary matters, having maintained surpluses since 2016 and holding the best fiscal balance in the European Union since 2019. Finally, Denmark has developed a 'Danish model' to support Ukraine, facilitating direct contracts between Kyiv and European defense manufacturers to accelerate weapons production. With these changes, Denmark is positioning itself as a key player in European security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/denmark-ramps-up-rearmament-to-counter-european-tensions-and-american-influence	2025-02-27T00:06:08-08:00	
British Navy Deploys New Mini Helicopter Drone Peregrine for Maritime Security Operations	The UK Royal Navy has successfully deployed its new mini remotely piloted helicopter, Peregrine, on a long-term maritime security mission in the Middle East. This marks the first operational use of the drone, which was first announced for deployment in 2023. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Peregrine is a 10ft long uncrewed aerial vehicle. (Picture source: UK MoD) Peregrine, a 10ft long uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, including conducting extended sorties of up to five hours, operating beyond the horizon. The UAV was launched from the flight deck of the Type 23 frigate HMS Lancaster, where it played a key role in monitoring illicit activities on the so-called 'Hash Highway,' a major route for smuggling operations in the region. The Peregrine UAV is a variant of the Schiebel S-100, equipped with advanced UK military technology, customized for the Royal Navy’s requirements. Its features include radar and an infra-red/electro-optical camera, enabling it to operate in both day and night conditions, and in poor visibility. With a maximum speed of 125 mph, the drone provides real-time intelligence by relaying live radar feeds and imagery directly to the ship’s operations room. Lancaster's commanding officer, Sam Stephens, highlighted the significance of the integration of Peregrine into the longest-serving operational Type 23 frigate. He noted that the UAV represents a force-multiplier for the Navy, enhancing its ability to gain a strategic advantage over smugglers and other adversaries. 'This is just the start, as we continue to unlock the game-changing capability with every flight,' said Stephens. In addition to its surveillance capabilities, Peregrine has been instrumental in supporting board and search operations. During its operational debut, the drone assisted Royal Marines aboard HMS Lancaster in locating and boarding suspect dhows, leading to the successful seizure of drugs and contraband. Peregrine's deployment also highlights HMS Lancaster’s role as the first ship in the Indian Ocean to be equipped with a new counter-drone system. This system is especially significant in light of the recent surge in drone attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region over the past 18 months. HMS Lancaster, which embarked on a three-year-long security mission in the Gulf in 2022, has undergone extensive maintenance and upgrades during its deployment. The ship's weapon systems and sensors were enhanced, and one of its diesel generators was replaced, requiring structural modifications to the frigate. This successful deployment of Peregrine marks a significant milestone for the Royal Navy, as it continues to integrate cutting-edge unmanned systems into its maritime operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/british-navy-deploys-new-mini-helicopter-drone-peregrine-for-maritime-security-operations	2025-02-27T00:01:16-08:00

The Romanian Naval Forces will receive the first V-BAT drone system, consisting of four aircraft, as a donation from the United States through the Maritime Domain Awareness facility. This initial set, valued at approximately $18 million, is expected to be operational by the end of 2025. Following this donation, Romania plans to purchase two additional V-BAT systems, comprising eight drones, through a direct government-to-government agreement with the United States for approximately $30 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Romania is set to receive a total of twelve V-BAT drones with the first four donated by the US and eight more to be purchased through a government-to-government deal. (Picture source: US DoD) The MQ-35A V-BAT drones, developed by the American company Shield AI, feature vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, allowing them to launch and land vertically on ship decks without requiring an airfield or airstrip. This design is intended to enhance operational flexibility, particularly for naval operations. The drones are designed primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and can also be equipped with laser-guided munitions. The V-BAT's ducted-fan propulsion system increases thrust and safety by avoiding exposed rotors, allowing for use in confined or dynamic environments, including maritime scenarios. The Romanian Ministry of Defense has identified two primary focus areas for 2025: acquisitions and modernization. Planned acquisitions include the continuation of the minehunter program, with the second Sandown-class ship expected from the UK in May 2025, as well as maritime patrol vessels, intervention ships, maritime tugs, man-portable air-defense systems (MANPAD), the V-BAT unmanned aerial system, radio stations, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) equipment, and multifunctional wheeled vehicle transport platforms. Modernization projects will target maritime dredgers, frigates, missile carriers, maritime support and intervention ships, and corvettes. The V-BAT drones were previously utilized in Ukraine during late 2024 and early 2025, where they were reportedly effective against Russian electronic warfare measures. According to Brandon Tseng, president and co-founder of Shield AI, the drones were launched from approximately 40 kilometers behind the front lines, flew 100 kilometers into Russian-controlled territory, identified SA-11 surface-to-air missile systems, and provided targeting coordinates to a HIMARS airburst system. The operation resulted in the destruction of the missile systems, demonstrating the drones' capacity to gather targeting data and communicate with artillery units under conditions of advanced electronic warfare. The MQ-35A V-BAT drone weighs 57 kg, including a payload capacity of up to 11.3 kg, and offers an air endurance of up to 10 hours. It operates within a radio range of 130 km and can achieve a flight ceiling of 6,100 meters. The drone can carry a variety of payloads, including electro-optical (EO) and mid-wave infrared (MWIR) cameras, automated information systems (AIS), and land/maritime wide-area search (WAS) AI-based technologies. It is powered by a 288cc two-stroke EFI engine and has a maximum airspeed of 157 km/h, with a cruise speed of 98 km/h. The required landing zone is 4 by 4 meters, and it can transition from hover to flight in under 15 seconds. James Lithgow, director of Shield AI, mentioned at the Defense Tech Innovation Forum 2025 that discussions are underway to integrate laser-guided munitions developed in Ukraine with the V-BAT system. While specific Ukrainian partners were not disclosed, this integration would potentially expand the drone’s operational roles to include direct combat support. The V-BAT's modular architecture allows for the integration of a range of sensors and combat payloads, supporting mission-specific adaptability. Shield AI has also stated that the V-BAT was selected over 13 competitors for the US Navy and SOCOM’s MTUAS Increment 2 Program of Record. The drone’s design facilitates take-off and landing on stationary and moving platforms, including in high winds and on crowded ship decks with landing zones as small as 3.6 by 3.6 meters. The aircraft is designed for expeditionary operations, requiring only two personnel for deployment and capable of being transported in the bed of a pickup truck or a UH-60 Blackhawk. It can be prepared for flight in under 20 minutes, making it suitable for dynamic operational environments. The Romanian acquisition of V-BAT drones is part of a wider modernization initiative that also includes new minehunters, maritime patrol vessels, and multifunctional wheeled vehicles, as well as upgrades to frigates, missile carriers, and other naval assets. The Ministry of Defense's 2025 focus on the Naval Forces aims to increase operational readiness and maritime security in the Black Sea, a region with significant geopolitical tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/romania-to-receive-twelve-mq-35a-v-bat-drones-from-the-us-for-intelligence-gathering-in-the-black-sea	2025-02-26T07:30:12-08:00	
Future Hellbound hypersonic drone could strengthen US strike capabilities against China and Russia	On February 12, 2025, the companies Cummings Aerospace and ATRX, both based in Huntsville, Alabama, partnered to develop an unmanned hypersonic drone. The drone will be a new variant of the Hellhound subsonic weapons system, which Cummings Aerospace is currently developing for the US Army. The collaboration focuses on integrating ATRX’s Air Turbo Rocket (ATR) propulsion system into a proven airframe, enhancing the Hellhound's performance to achieve supersonic and hypersonic speeds.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link According to ATRX, the ATR engine provides approximately 40% more thrust than an afterburning turbojet of the same size. It is intended for scenarios requiring short bursts of thrust, such as rapid take-offs, fast climbs, and high acceleration. (Picture source: ATRX) Cummings Aerospace specializes in producing missiles, radars, and command and control systems, and will utilize its Hellhound family of drones for this initiative. The Hellhound series includes multiple specialized variants, notably the Hellhound S3, developed for the US Army’s Loitering Munition program, which has recently completed flight tests. ATRX, a startup in aerospace propulsion technology, brings its ATR propulsion system to the project. The ATR, also known as a Multi-Mode Combined Cycle Propulsion Engine or Overjet, utilizes a rocket-type gas generator to power and overdrive the turbojet, featuring an air-breathing design that has undergone several prototype tests. The companies aim to incorporate the ATR engine into a Hellhound variant specifically designed for high-speed flight. The drone will use a modular 3D-printed design and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware to manage costs and enable quick payload swaps in less than five minutes without tools. According to ATRX, the ATR engine provides approximately 40% more thrust than an afterburning turbojet of the same size. It is intended for scenarios requiring short bursts of thrust, such as rapid take-offs, fast climbs, and high acceleration, with potential uses in space launch systems and missiles. ATRX CEO Felix Bustos III stated that the partnership would streamline ATR engine flight testing, leveraging a custom unmanned aerial system (UAS) based on a flight-proven airframe to support ATRX’s Hummingbird spaceplane development, intended to assist with launching over 50,000 commercial satellites into orbit in the coming years. Cummings Aerospace CEO Sheila Cummings noted that the partnership aims to meet the requirements of modern battlefields, which demand systems capable of greater speed and extended reach into contested airspace. The companies plan to conduct the first vertically launched test of the hypersonic drone within 18 to 24 months. The test will involve a Hellhound UAS that is up to 12 times larger than the loitering munition variant expected to compete in the US Army’s Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance (LASSO) competition later this year. Future development cycles are scheduled every 18-24 months, incorporating increased complexity. The Hellhound drones include multiple specialized variants, notably the Hellhound S3, developed for the US Army’s Loitering Munition program, which has recently completed flight tests. (Picture source: Cummings Aerospace) If the collaboration proceeds as planned, ATRX and Cummings Aerospace could become prominent suppliers of low-cost hypersonic drones to global military markets, as the development of hypersonic drones, including cost-effective models, has the potential to enhance the United States' capabilities against adversaries such as China and Russia. These drones, capable of speeds exceeding Mach 5, a milestone not yet reached by any US military branch, can engage time-sensitive and high-value targets, including mobile missile launchers and advanced air defense systems integral to China's and Russia's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies. Their high velocity and maneuverability make interception by existing defense systems challenging, thereby increasing the likelihood of mission success. Additionally, deploying these drones from various platforms, such as aircraft, ships, and submarines, provides the U.S. military (and its allies) with flexible options for power projection in contested regions. Integrating low-cost hypersonic drones into the U.S. arsenal ensures that a sufficient quantity of these advanced weapons can be produced and deployed without imposing excessive financial burdens, maintaining a robust deterrent posture. Their rapid response time and extended operational range enhance the U.S. military's ability to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions, providing real-time intelligence and early warning of potential attacks. Therefore, the United States is pursuing hypersonic drone development through multiple projects, including the Hellhound UAS by Cummings Aerospace and ATRX, as well as Hermeus Corporation’s Quarterhorse series. The Hellhound UAS aims to combine ATRX’s Air Turbo Rocket with a modular 3D-printed design to achieve supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Separately, Hermeus Corporation is testing its Quarterhorse Mk 1 prototype, which is projected to reach Mach 4 and lay the groundwork for the Darkhorse drone, potentially matching Lockheed Martin’s SR-72 capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/future-hellbound-hypersonic-drone-could-strengthen-us-strike-capabilities-against-china-and-russia	2025-02-26T06:55:08-08:00

First South Korean Stealth Drone LOWUS Enhances Survivability of KF-21 Fighters	The Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and Korean Air held a rollout ceremony for the prototype of the Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System (LOWUS) at the Korean Air Tech Center in Busan on February 25, 2025. Designed to operate alongside piloted fighter jets in a manned-unmanned teaming system, this stealth drone autonomously carries out reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and strike missions under the supervision of a crewed aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The LOWUS Drone features a trapezoidal fuselage, sharply swept wings, a V-tail, and an overhead air intake, resembling the American XQ-58A Valkyrie drone (Picture source: DAPA) The development of LOWUS is part of a project initiated in 2021 by ADD and Korean Air, with support from the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). Its design prioritizes stealth, minimizing radar detection through the use of radar-absorbing materials and an optimized structure to reduce visibility to radar, acoustic, and optical sensors. A first flight is planned by the end of the year, followed by manned-unmanned teaming tests scheduled to continue until 2027, during which a crewed aircraft will take direct control of the drone in flight. LOWUS was designed from the outset to operate in coordination with crewed fighter jets, particularly the KF-21 Boramae, South Korea’s next-generation combat aircraft currently under development. It features a trapezoidal fuselage, sharply swept wings, a V-tail, and an overhead air intake, resembling the American XQ-58A Valkyrie drone. It also shares some visual similarities with Boeing’s MQ-28 Ghost Bat, developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. However, LOWUS distinguishes itself with an electro-optical sensor mounted under the nose, as well as the planned integration of an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and a domestically developed engine. Manned-unmanned teaming concepts are increasingly being explored by air forces worldwide, and South Korea is working to integrate this capability into its fleet. LOWUS is expected to complement certain limitations of the KF-21, particularly in its initial Block 1 configuration, which is dedicated to air superiority and does not feature an internal weapons bay. The drone could undertake air-to-ground missions, allowing the KF-21 to operate at a safer distance while leveraging its air-to-air missiles and advanced sensors. This operational approach would reduce the electronic signature of the crewed aircraft and enhance its survivability in combat scenarios.

The rapid progress of the project suggests the potential adoption of this technology by other air forces, further establishing South Korea as a key player in the global defense aviation market.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/first-south-korean-stealth-drone-lowus-enhances-survivability-of-kf-21-fighters	2025-02-26T02:46:35-08:00	
Focus: Russia claims that new S-500 air defense system can intercept Western hypersonic missiles	According to Russian military expert Mikhail Khodarenok, the S-500 Prometheus air defense missile system, developed by Almaz-Antey, is capable of intercepting hypersonic missiles, including those developed by Western nations with characteristics comparable to Russia's Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile. The system, also known as the 55R6M Triumfator-M, entered service with the Russian Air Defense Forces in May 2021 and, in early January 2025, Russia announced plans to deploy up to twelve S-500 systems to defend the Crimean Bridge against potential Ukrainian strikes, with production set to increase to meet operational needs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new S-500 Triumfator-M air defense missile system is designed to counter a wide range of aerial threats, including stealth aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic missiles, and even low-orbit satellites. (Picture source: Russian social media) Several Western nations are currently developing hypersonic missile systems with capabilities comparable to Russia's Oreshnik. The United States is advancing multiple projects, including the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), also known as 'Dark Eagle,' a surface-to-surface boost-glide weapon with a range of up to approximately 2,776 km; the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC), an air-launched cruise missile capable of speeds exceeding Mach 5; and the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), designed to reach speeds over Mach 7. France is developing the ASN4G (Air-Sol Nucléaire de 4ème Génération), a nuclear-armed, air-launched hypersonic cruise missile expected to replace the ASMPA missile by 2035. Lockheed Martin is also working on the Mako hypersonic missile, intended for use with modern stealth fighters such as the F-35 and F-22. To counter these emerging hypersonic threats from Western nations, the S-500 system is designed to address a wide range of aerial threats, including stealth aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic missiles, and even low-orbit satellites. It offers a maximum operational range of 600 kilometers and an altitude capability of 200 kilometers, surpassing the capabilities of the S-300 and S-400 systems. The S-500 uses the 77N6-N and 77N6-N1 missiles, which support high-speed kinetic interception, including hypersonic targets. Its capacity to engage low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites could potentially disrupt NATO's surveillance and communication capabilities near Crimea. Russia has proposed joint production of the S-500 with India, but no final decision has been announced by India. Despite the capabilities of the Oreshnik, interception of such a hypersonic missile by the S-500 is considered feasible primarily during its initial flight phase, before reaching hypersonic speeds, according to Khodarenok. The S-500 Prometheus may have this capability, while Western systems, including the American Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), may encounter challenges in intercepting such high-speed targets. The THAAD system has demonstrated capabilities against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, either inside or just outside the atmosphere, but its effectiveness against hypersonic missiles remains limited. Hypersonic missiles, which travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5 and can maneuver unpredictably, present challenges that THAAD was not originally designed to address. However, contrary to Mikhail Khodarenok's assertions, it seems that the S-500 is not the only air defense system that has either demonstrated or is developing the capability to intercept hypersonic missiles. The U.S. Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) system has reportedly intercepted maneuvering hypersonic missiles, including a Russian Kinzhal during engagements in Ukraine in May 2023. The U.S. Navy's Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, utilizing the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, intercepted an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) target in November 2020, indicating potential applicability against high-speed threats. Israel's Arrow 3 system, operational since 2017, is designed for exo-atmospheric interception of ballistic missiles and has engaged hypersonic targets, including Iran's Kheibar Shekan missiles. Additionally, the U.S. Navy is progressing with plans to integrate PAC-3 MSE interceptors onto its ships to enhance defenses against hypersonic threats. In parallel, the United States, in collaboration with Japan, is developing the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) to engage hypersonic missiles during their glide phase. The GPI is intended for deployment on Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers and Aegis Ashore systems. The Aegis Sea-Based Terminal (SBT) system offers limited capability against certain hypersonic missile threats, focusing on specific trajectory phases. Germany is developing the IRIS-T SLX, an upgraded IRIS-T surface-to-air missile system with an operational range of 80 km and a ceiling of 30 km, aimed at addressing advanced aerial threats, including hypersonic missiles. Despite advancements in these systems, achieving fully reliable interception of hypersonic threats remains a technological challenge, as no current system has demonstrated complete effectiveness against all hypersonic threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-russia-claims-that-new-s-500-air-defense-system-can-intercept-western-hypersonic-missiles	2025-02-26T02:39:26-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Su-57 is designed to ensure air superiority and execute precision strikes, integrating advanced stealth capabilities, supermaneuverability, and thrust-vectoring engine (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) According to Maxar Technologies’ satellite images dated February 19 show the Su-57 at Bandar Abbas, parked alongside two P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft acquired from the United States during the Shah’s era, as well as a Russian Il-76 transport plane. Additional images captured on February 21 confirm the aircraft’s prolonged presence at the Iranian base. Viral videos have also surfaced, showing the Su-57 on the tarmac next to an Il-76 bearing the registration RA-76373, which was also seen in India a few days earlier. The aircraft has been identified as the T-50-4 prototype, bearing the bort number '054 Blue,' one of the primary models used in the international promotion of the Su-57. After participating in the Zhuhai Air Show in China last November, this aircraft was later showcased in India, where it shared the stage with U.S. F-35s, which were also exhibited in both static and flight displays. The Su-57’s stop in Iran has raised numerous questions regarding its purpose. While some reports suggest that the aircraft may have experienced an engine issue, delaying its departure, others speculate that the visit may have had a strategic objective. The presence of the fighter at an Iranian base takes place in the context of strengthening military ties between Moscow and Tehran, particularly as Russia continues to receive Iranian support in military operations in Ukraine, including the supply of kamikaze drones and assistance in their domestic production. If Iran were to consider acquiring the Su-57, it would mark a significant upgrade for its aging air force, which largely consists of American aircraft acquired before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and older Russian models. The Su-57 is designed to ensure air superiority and execute precision strikes, integrating advanced stealth capabilities, supermaneuverability, and thrust-vectoring engines. It is equipped with the N036 Byelka AESA radar, the L402 Himalayas electronic countermeasures suite, and the 101KS Atoll electro-optical system, which includes an infrared search and track (IRST) sensor and laser countermeasures.

Focus: Russia Set to Ramp Up Missile Production in 2025 with 750 Iskander and 560 Kh-101 Missiles	According to a report shared on February 24, 2025, by defense analyst John Hardie on his X (formerly Twitter) account, Russia is ramping up its missile production in 2025, with plans to produce more than 750 9M723 Iskander ballistic missiles and over 560 Kh-101 cruise missiles. These figures, drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Defence, signal a significant surge in missile production that could have substantial implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and for broader security dynamics in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Transloader (on the left) and 9P78-1 TEL on the right (Transporter Erector Launcher) equipped with 9M723K5 missiles, part of the 9K720 Iskander-M SRBM system, designed for rapid deployment and precision strikes. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The 9M723 Iskander, part of the Iskander tactical missile system, is a short-range ballistic missile designed to provide high accuracy and fast deployment. It can strike targets at ranges up to 500 kilometers, with various warhead options, including conventional and nuclear payloads. The Iskander system is known for its maneuverability during flight, which makes it more difficult for enemy air defenses to intercept. Its mobile launch platforms allow for rapid repositioning, enhancing its survivability in a contested battlefield environment. With 750 of these missiles planned for production in 2025, Russia aims to bolster its ability to conduct precise, high-impact strikes against key military and infrastructure targets. The Kh-101 is a long-range air-launched cruise missile that Russia primarily uses to target high-value strategic assets. With a range of up to 4,500 kilometers, the Kh-101 is a crucial weapon for Russia's long-range strike capabilities. The missile is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads, allowing for strategic flexibility. It is known for its stealth characteristics, designed to reduce its radar cross-section and increase its chances of penetrating advanced air defense systems. The missile’s ability to travel at subsonic speeds and fly at low altitudes enables it to avoid detection by radar, making it a formidable weapon for deep strikes against enemy territory. The production of 560 Kh-101 missiles in 2025 reflects Russia's effort to maintain a significant deterrence capability, particularly as the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve. While Russia has set ambitious targets for missile production, Ukrainian defense officials remain cautious and vigilant. A Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) representative emphasized that Russia's missile production is still critically dependent on foreign components. Despite efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing capabilities, Moscow remains reliant on foreign suppliers for key parts, complicating efforts to maintain consistent production levels. This dependence on external sources underscores the importance of the international sanctions regime, which has limited Russia’s access to advanced components for missile and weapon systems. The GUR representative urged international bodies to tighten sanctions enforcement and strengthen monitoring to hamper further Russia’s ability to replenish its missile stockpiles. Russia has achieved relatively high monthly monthly production rates as part of its strategy to maintain a robust missile arsenal. According to Ukrainian intelligence estimates, Russia is capable of producing approximately 40 to 50 Iskander missiles per month. The Kalibr missiles, a family of cruise missiles launched from both ships and submarines, are being produced at a rate of 30 to 50 units per month. Additionally, about 50 Kh-101 missiles are being manufactured monthly, further contributing to Russia's missile capabilities. These production rates are significant, given the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. The ability to produce such quantities of missiles on a monthly basis could allow Russia to continue conducting large-scale missile strikes, potentially targeting critical infrastructure, military installations, and other key sites in Ukraine. The increase in Russia’s missile production, coupled with ongoing missile strikes in Ukraine, continues to create a persistent and escalating threat to Ukrainian civilians and military personnel. Ukrainian intelligence officials, particularly through the voice of representative Andriy Yusov, have urged citizens to take air raid warnings seriously, as large-scale Russian missile strikes remain a constant danger. The increasing frequency of missile attacks, combined with the growing stockpiles of Russia’s missile arsenal, makes it clear that air defense systems, early warning mechanisms, and civil protection measures will remain critical for Ukraine's defense in the coming months. Ukrainian authorities continue to emphasize the need for vigilance, as the risk of missile strikes is not expected to diminish anytime soon. The escalation of Russia's missile production in 2025 also has broader international implications. The increased missile stockpiles, along with Russia’s ongoing reliance on foreign components, highlight the critical role of sanctions in shaping the conflict. Western nations and allies of Ukraine will likely focus on strengthening the enforcement of sanctions to disrupt Russia’s missile production capacity. The situation presents a key challenge for both Russia and the international community, as the impact of sanctions will play a pivotal role in either constraining or enabling Russia's military actions in the near future. Russia's missile production plans for 2025 demonstrate its commitment to enhancing its missile stockpiles, particularly in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine. While the production of the Iskander and Kh-101 missiles is set to increase significantly, the ongoing reliance on foreign components remains a critical vulnerability. Ukrainian intelligence officials continue to monitor Russia’s production capabilities closely, while urging both international bodies and citizens to remain vigilant as the risk of large-scale missile strikes persists. The continued enforcement of sanctions and the monitoring of Russia's ability to acquire foreign components will play a crucial role in limiting the scope of Russia's missile production and its capacity for prolonged strikes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-russia-set-to-ramp-up-missile-production-in-2025-with-750-iskander-and-560-kh-101-missiles	2025-02-25T03:22:36-08:00	
China Constructs Hypersonic Missile Submarine in Response to US Typhon Deployment in Philippines	The construction of a new Chinese nuclear-powered attack submarine, equipped with hypersonic missiles, could present a strategic challenge to the deployment of the United States' Typhon missile system in the Philippines. According to a report by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), citing a semi-official Chinese military publication, this submarine, currently under development at a shipyard in Wuhan, is part of Beijing’s broader strategy to counter the expansion of U.S. military influence in the region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A satellite image from Maxar captured on March 10, 2024, shows the Zhou-class submarine docked at the pier. (Picture source: Maxar) Although the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has not officially confirmed the existence of this submarine, the magazine Naval &amp; Merchant Ships, affiliated with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), has provided several details about its design and potential role. The publication suggests that the project aims to strengthen China’s deterrence capabilities within the 'first island chain,' a strategic zone stretching from Japan to the Philippines. This development follows the deployment of U.S. Typhon missile launchers on Luzon Island in the Philippines during a joint military exercise in April 2024. These launchers are capable of firing long-range missiles capable of reaching targets in China, Russia, and North Korea, altering the regional military balance. China has strongly opposed their presence, describing them as offensive and strategic weapons that pose a security threat. The United States, however, maintains that these systems are intended to deter potential threats and safeguard its allies. The Chinese submarine under construction is designed to be equipped with advanced hypersonic missiles, enabling it to carry out precision strikes over long distances and penetrate enemy defenses. According to the publication, it may also have the capability to deploy nuclear warheads, enhancing China’s ability to counter U.S. military assets in the western Pacific. If operationalized, this vessel could play a key role in China’s evolving naval doctrine, which emphasizes stealth, deterrence, and asymmetric warfare. The submarine was first identified in mid-2024 through satellite imagery captured at a shipyard in Wuhan, Hubei province. Analysts suggest it could belong to the Zhou-class (Type 041), which gained attention following an incident in May or June 2024 when the first unit allegedly sank during its fitting-out phase at Wuchang Shipbuilding along the Yangtze River. According to U.S. military assessments, the Type 041 is equipped with a hybrid propulsion system that combines conventional diesel-electric power with a small nuclear reactor. This configuration could provide increased operational endurance and greater strategic flexibility. One of the submarine’s notable technological features is its vertical launch system (VLS), allowing it to fire both cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles. Unlike traditional submarines that rely on torpedo tubes for missile launches, this capability enhances firepower, enables faster missile deployment, and provides greater tactical versatility. The vessel also incorporates an X-shaped tail fin, a design aimed at improving maneuverability and operational safety, particularly in deep-water environments. Another critical feature of this submarine is its air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which reduces the need for surfacing to access oxygen. This technology would allow the vessel to remain submerged for extended periods, making it more difficult to detect and track. In the South China Sea, where China has been expanding its military presence, this capability could provide a significant strategic advantage. The region’s underwater geography, which includes reefs, sandbanks, deep trenches, and islands, presents both opportunities and challenges for stealth operations. Experts suggest that this submarine, capable of operating independently or in small formations, could complicate adversaries' operations by forcing them to disperse in response to an unpredictable undersea threat. This aligns with China’s asymmetric deterrence strategy, which seeks to counter technologically superior opponents through innovative means rather than direct confrontation. The vessel is reportedly armed with the YJ-21 hypersonic missile, already deployed on China’s Type 093 nuclear attack submarines and Type 055 cruisers. With an estimated range of 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers and a speed of up to Mach 10, this missile would significantly enhance the Chinese Navy’s strike capabilities against naval and land-based targets. This suggests that China is actively working on integrating hypersonic technology into its undersea forces, which could reshape the balance of power in the Western Pacific. The development of this submarine coincides with Beijing’s increasing opposition to U.S. military deployments in the region. China has strongly criticized the placement of Typhon missile systems in the Philippines, calling for their removal and arguing that they destabilize regional security. Meanwhile, the United States continues to expand its global missile defense network, considering additional Typhon deployments in Japan, Germany, and Denmark as part of a broader strategy aimed at limiting Chinese naval movements. Amid increasing militarization, the South China Sea could become a crucial testing ground for this submarine. With an average depth exceeding 1,200 meters and a complex underwater landscape, this area presents a strategic environment where stealth operations could play a decisive role. The submarine’s ability to navigate these waters undetected could be a key factor in China’s ability to project power and deter foreign military activities near its maritime borders. Although the PLA has not yet officially acknowledged the existence of this submarine, the detailed descriptions provided by a semi-official Chinese military publication indicate that it is in the development phase. If operationalized, it could mark a transformation in China’s naval capabilities, particularly in countering U.S. and allied military forces in the Indo-Pacific. The emergence of this submarine reflects the intensifying strategic competition between Beijing and Washington, as both powers continue to strengthen their military presence in contested waters of the Pacific.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/china-constructs-hypersonic-missile-submarine-in-response-to-us-typhon-deployment-in-philippines	2025-02-25T02:28:22-08:00

(Picture source: Wikimedia) The Rafale fighter jet, developed by the French Company Dassault Aviation, is one of the most versatile and technologically advanced multirole aircraft globally. It is not only capable of conducting conventional missions but also plays a critical role in France’s strategic nuclear deterrence. The Rafale can carry the ASMP-A (Air-Sol Moyenne Portée-Amélioré), a French air-launched cruise missile specifically designed to deliver nuclear payloads. This missile has a range of approximately 500 km and is capable of delivering a 300-kiloton nuclear warhead, making it a key asset for France’s defense strategy. Equipped with advanced guidance systems such as inertial navigation and GPS, the ASMP-A ensures high precision and reliability, critical for deterrence operations. France’s proposal to deploy these nuclear-capable Rafales to Germany represents a strategic pivot in Europe’s defense architecture, especially as tensions rise in the wake of Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The Rafale’s dual-role capability makes it a unique asset. Designed for both nuclear and conventional missions, the Rafale can seamlessly transition between strategic deterrence roles and tactical operations such as air superiority, ground attack, and reconnaissance. While it may not possess the same level of stealth as some next-generation jets, the Rafale is designed with a low radar cross-section (RCS), which enhances its survivability in hostile environments. This makes it highly effective in situations where maintaining a credible deterrent is essential, particularly in operations where survivability in contested airspace is paramount. The nuclear mission modifications on the Rafale include an internal nuclear safety and control system, ensuring that the launch of a nuclear weapon can only happen under direct authorization from France’s high command. This specialized setup guarantees the highest levels of security, confirming that the Rafale fleet is ready for rapid response in the event of a nuclear crisis. Additionally, the aircraft’s ability to be deployed from air bases or aircraft carriers offers France flexibility in deterrence operations, ensuring a swift and credible nuclear response if required. France’s nuclear triad—which includes Triomphant-class nuclear-powered submarines, Mirage 2000N aircraft, and the Rafale—forms the backbone of the country’s second-strike capability. The Rafale’s role is vital in ensuring that France can retaliate even if its land-based nuclear assets are destroyed. This reflects France’s nuclear doctrine, based on the principle of 'assurance of retaliation'—the belief that any nuclear aggression against France will trigger devastating consequences, convincing any adversary that such an attack would not be survivable. By proposing to position Rafale fighter jets in Germany, Macron aims to provide NATO with enhanced nuclear capabilities while ensuring that Europe retains a more independent nuclear deterrent. While Germany already hosts NATO’s dual-capable aircraft (DCA), which can carry U.S. nuclear weapons, French Rafales would offer a level of autonomy in European defense, especially in the event that the U.S. reduces its nuclear footprint in Europe. The proposal also aims to give Europe greater flexibility in managing escalation, allowing for independent deterrence operations without relying solely on U.S. nuclear forces. Macron’s announcement highlights a broader shift toward a more robust European defense posture. The deployment of nuclear-capable Rafales to Germany would not only demonstrate France’s commitment to NATO but also reinforce the idea of European strategic autonomy, particularly as tensions between NATO and Russia continue to escalate. By introducing these highly capable aircraft into Germany, Macron aims to deepen France’s leadership role within European defense, solidifying its position as a key pillar of European security in the face of growing external threats. The Rafale fighter jet represents a sophisticated blend of technological versatility and nuclear deterrence capabilities. Its advanced guidance systems, dual-role design, and rapid response capabilities make it an essential tool in France’s defense strategy. Macron’s proposal to deploy these nuclear-capable aircraft to Germany will undoubtedly strengthen Europe’s nuclear capabilities, offering a more independent and robust defense posture as tensions with Russia and NATO’s security concerns continue to evolve. As Europe navigates the complexities of the ongoing Ukraine conflict, France’s increased reliance on nuclear deterrence through platforms like the Rafale serves as a powerful reminder of the evolving security dynamics in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-france-offers-european-nuclear-shield-with-rafale-jets-in-germany-after-meeting-with-us-president	2025-02-25T01:55:44-08:00

Taiwan Arms F-CK-1 Fighters with Supersonic HF-3 Missile to Counter Growing Chinese Naval Threat	On February 21, 2025, the Taiwanese newspaper United Daily News (UDN) published what appears to be the first clear image of an air-launched HF-3 missile mounted on a Taiwan Air Force (ROCAF) F-CK-1 fighter. A few days later, the Liberty Times also released another image of the missile under the aircraft's wing, confirming progress in the program. These publications, widely shared on social media, indicate a new step in integrating the supersonic missile onto a combat aircraft, potentially altering Taiwan’s maritime strike capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An air-launched HF-3 missile mounted on a Taiwan Air Force (ROCAF) F-CK-1 fighter (Picture source: UND) The images show a single HF-3 missile mounted under one wing of the aircraft, with inscriptions and positioning markings suggesting its use in testing and evaluations. Observers noted the presence of a rotating sleeve at the missile’s end, which may assist in stabilization after release. Additional photos depict an F-CK-1 undergoing ground tests with two HF-3 missiles, an external fuel tank, and two Sky Sword air-to-air missiles for self-defense, indicating a possible future operational configuration. Although the project to equip F-CK-1 fighters with the HF-3 was first proposed in 2017, it faced multiple challenges, mainly due to the original missile’s size and weight, which measured 6.1 meters in length, 46 centimeters in diameter, and weighed approximately 1,500 kg. Adapting it for an aerial platform required significant reductions in both weight and dimensions, a task undertaken by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) in 2022. NCSIST engineers gradually scaled down the HF-3, resulting in a modified version measuring 5.5 meters in length, 36 centimeters in diameter, and weighing under 900 kg. One key modification was the removal of the solid-fuel boosters, previously used for launches from land and naval platforms, which reduced the missile’s weight by around 200 kg. The program experienced delays but resumed in September 2024 with renewed testing over maritime and flight environments. According to recent reports, operational tests are expected to begin in 2025, including separation tests and potentially a first live-fire test from an F-CK-1. The HF-3 sometimes referred to as a 'carrier killer,' is powered by a liquid-fuel ramjet engine, enabling it to reach speeds of Mach 3.5 with a range of up to 400 km. Compared to the AGM-84 Harpoon currently used by Taiwan’s air force, the HF-3 offers extended range and higher speed, making it more difficult to intercept. Its guidance system combines inertial navigation with active radar homing for terminal targeting. The missile's warhead, weighing 225 kg in land- and sea-based versions, is designed to maximize damage by directing the explosion toward a ship’s hull. Developed by NCSIST since the 1990s, the HF-3 was first tested in 1997 and integrated into Taiwan’s navy in 2007 aboard Kang Ding- and Cheng Kung-class frigates. It is also deployed on Tuo Chiang-class corvettes alongside other missile systems. Adapting it for aerial deployment represents a significant shift, allowing for a more mobile and unpredictable strike capability. By integrating the HF-3 into its F-CK-1 fighters, Taiwan expands its options for anti-ship operations and enhances its deterrence capabilities against the Chinese navy. Some analysts have suggested that if successful, this development could also extend the operational life of the F-CK-1 or even lead to the design of a new indigenous combat aircraft. As tensions in the Taiwan Strait continue to escalate, deploying an air-launched supersonic missile such as the HF-3 could become a key element in Taiwan’s defense strategy. If the program proceeds as planned, the ROCAF will soon have an additional capability to challenge China’s naval presence and complicate any potential blockade or invasion scenario.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/taiwan-arms-f-ck-1-fighters-with-supersonic-hf-3-missile-to-counter-growing-chinese-naval-threat	2025-02-25T00:31:37-08:00

Building on these results, the development team anticipates large-scale deployment of this technology as early as the beginning of 2025. The aim is to make existing fourth-generation fleets more resilient against emerging threats while paving the way for simpler integration on other airborne platforms. This new AI-boosted RWR illustrates the trend of moving computing power directly into the field rather than centralizing it in distant data centers. In an operational environment where rapid analysis and reaction are critical, this approach offers several key advantages. On the one hand, it provides near-instant reactivity in detecting and identifying threats, which significantly reduces the risk of critical errors. On the other hand, it enables greater interoperability: AI/ML solutions can be easily updated or replaced without major hardware modifications. The introduction of this next-generation RWR, which incorporates cognitive algorithms, marks another step toward more autonomous and efficient electronic warfare capabilities. In potential conflict zones where enemy jamming and detection systems are becoming more advanced, having technology that can learn and adapt during missions could offer a decisive tactical edge. Recent test campaigns on widely used aircraft like the F-16 demonstrate the maturity of the solution. In the future, this technology could be extended to other combat aircraft, whether they are fourth-, fifth-, or even sixth-generation. With this intelligent RWR, air forces will have a groundbreaking protective tool capable of instantly distinguishing harmless signals from genuine threats. This asset aligns with a broader effort to automate and optimize decision-making processes on the battlefield while reducing the cognitive load on the crew.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/first-ai-ml-powered-radar-warning-receiver-for-fourth-generation-aircraft	2025-02-25T00:09:02-08:00

Each battery includes six ready-to-launch missiles housed in individual containers on a trailer towed by a military truck. The system is integrated with the EL/M-2084 Super Green Pine radar, which provides detection and tracking, as well as the Golden Citron battle management center and the Hazelnut Tree launch control system, developed by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), respectively.The Arrow 3 missile is designed to intercept ballistic missiles carrying conventional or weapons of mass destruction payloads before they enter the Earth’s atmosphere. Its deployment in Germany is part of the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI), a program aimed at strengthening the continent’s defense against emerging threats, particularly in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This acquisition reflects Berlin’s efforts to modernize its air defense systems and improve interoperability with NATO's defensive infrastructure.However, European security discussions are increasingly shaped by broader geopolitical dynamics, particularly following Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency and his more conciliatory stance toward Russia. During his campaign, Trump questioned the U.S. commitment to NATO and suggested that European nations should take greater responsibility for their own defense. His position, along with a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, has raised concerns in Europe about the reliability of American support, particularly regarding Ukraine.In response to these uncertainties, European states are reassessing the need to enhance their defense capabilities independently of Washington. The European Sky Shield Initiative, which includes Arrow 3, has taken on increased strategic importance. Germany’s investment in missile defense aligns with its broader objective of reinforcing European security while addressing calls for greater strategic autonomy within the region.Holzdorf will be the first of three planned Arrow 3 command and launch sites in Germany. Construction, expected to be completed by 2028, will enable a phased introduction of the system. Studies are also underway to determine the locations for additional installations in northern and southern Germany, where supporting infrastructure will be established later.By integrating the Arrow 3 system, Germany is expanding its missile defense capabilities to counter long-range threats. This acquisition represents a significant step in Europe’s evolving security architecture and highlights the growing importance of defense cooperation among European nations. However, questions remain regarding Europe’s long-term reliance on the United States and the extent to which the continent can develop a more autonomous security strategy amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/germany-moves-forward-with-arrow-3-defense-system-to-improve-europes-ballistic-missile-protection	2025-02-24T00:48:45-08:00	
South Korea’s Defense Procurement Agency in Egypt to Strengthen Military Ties and Explore Arms Exports	Seok Jong-gun, the Chief of South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), visited Egypt last week to bolster military relations and expand South Korean arms exports in the Middle East and North Africa region. The visit comes at a time when Egypt is ramping up its military modernization efforts and looking for reliable foreign partners to help diversify its defense procurement portfolio.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzer, a key acquisition by Egypt from South Korea, has proven to be a game-changer in modernizing Egypt's artillery capabilities. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) During his visit to Cairo, Seok held high-level talks with several key Egyptian defense officials, including Major General Mohamed Adly Abdel Wahed, the Director of Military Power at Egypt’s Ministry of Defense. The discussions focused on enhancing South Korea's participation in Egypt’s future weapons systems development and strengthening military collaboration between the two nations. A major highlight of Seok’s trip was his meeting with Egyptian Air Force Commander Mahmoud Fouad Abdel-Gawad. The talks centered around Egypt’s potential acquisition of South Korea's FA-50 light combat aircraft. The FA-50, a multi-role fighter jet developed by South Korea’s Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), is seen as an ideal option for nations like Egypt, which require versatile, cost-effective aircraft for both air-to-ground and air-to-air missions. Seok emphasized that South Korea is prepared to provide full-scale support if Egypt moves forward with the FA-50 acquisition, including extensive training, maintenance, and post-sale services. The aircraft’s low operational costs, advanced avionics, and strong weaponry make it a compelling choice for Egypt’s ongoing efforts to modernize its air force. This potential deal aligns with Egypt’s broader military modernization strategy, which includes expanding its fleet of multi-role combat aircraft, upgrading naval assets, and modernizing its ground forces. The country has been diversifying its sources of military hardware in recent years, moving away from a historically heavy reliance on U.S. arms and turning towards new partners like South Korea, Russia, and China for different types of equipment. In addition to discussions about specific acquisitions like the FA-50, Seok's visit underscored a larger trend of increasing defense cooperation between South Korea and Egypt. Both nations recognize the mutual benefits of strengthening ties in defense and security. South Korea’s advanced military technologies, particularly in areas such as aviation, surveillance, and missile systems, are highly regarded, and Egypt is eager to leverage this expertise to boost its defense capabilities. Egypt, situated in a geopolitically strategic region, has long maintained a robust military presence in the Middle East and North Africa.

French Navy Aims for Eighteen More Frigates to Address New Maritime Challenges from Mediterranean to Pacific	French Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, recently confirmed the objective of strengthening the French Navy by increasing its fleet to eighteen first-rank frigates. This announcement was made in Le Parisien on February 22, 2025, in response to an increasingly tense international context and an operational workload that far exceeds the strategic guidelines previously established. Currently, the French fleet consists of fifteen frigates, including five La Fayette-class ships, which until recently were not classified as first-rank vessels. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The primary objective of increasing the number of frigates is to meet France's evolving strategic needs, particularly amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Mediterranean, and the North Atlantic. (Picture source: French MoD) For several years, the French Navy has been advocating for an expansion of its fleet to meet the growing intensity of its missions. In 2017, Admiral Christophe Prazuck, then Chief of Staff of the Navy, had already pointed out the outdated nature of the operational contracts defined by the 2013 White Paper on Defense and National Security. That document outlined that the Navy was to conduct two permanent missions—deterrence and protection—while maintaining deployment capabilities in two operational theaters. However, in practice, it currently operates in five, significantly straining both personnel and equipment. Admiral Prazuck also highlighted that the White Paper's trajectory would reduce the number of frigates to fifteen by 2030, despite the increasing maritime threat, driven by renewed geopolitical rivalries and France's expanding military commitments. He cited the Falklands War as an example, where fourteen British vessels were damaged, underscoring the necessity of a more robust fleet adapted to contemporary strategic demands. This request has now been acknowledged and appears to align with a broader trend of reinforcing defense efforts. Sébastien Lecornu explicitly stated that maintaining a sufficient naval presence across multiple maritime zones required more than the current fleet of fifteen frigates, justifying the goal of expanding to eighteen. This objective is part of a broader effort to enhance France's military capabilities, including the acquisition of twenty to thirty additional Rafale fighter jets for the Air and Space Force and accelerated investments in drones and electronic warfare for the Army. However, achieving this expansion faces financial and industrial constraints. During discussions on the 2024-2030 Military Programming Law, Lecornu had advocated for a budget of €422 billion, but interministerial negotiations reduced it to €413 billion. This financial framework raises concerns regarding the timeline and feasibility of acquiring new frigates. According to current plans, the fifth and final Defense and Intervention Frigate (FDI) will not be delivered until 2032, which calls into question how quickly the target fleet size can be reached. The new frigates would likely follow the existing models. The most probable option is to reinforce the fleet with additional FDI frigates from Naval Group. Another possibility is to modernize FREMM-class frigates to enhance their air defense and electronic warfare capabilities. Currently, the French fleet comprises fifteen first-rank frigates: eight FREMM, two Horizon-class air defense frigates, and five La Fayette-class ships, which have been recently reclassified. The Navy also operates an aircraft carrier, several nuclear attack submarines, and amphibious assault ships, forming a well-balanced naval force but one that remains under significant operational pressure. The primary objective of increasing the number of frigates is to meet France's evolving strategic needs, particularly amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Mediterranean, and the North Atlantic. A larger fleet would allow continuous presence across multiple maritime theaters, enhancing deterrence and safeguarding national interests. However, several challenges remain, notably budgetary and industrial constraints. Expanding ship production within a short timeframe poses difficulties, as does the need for trained personnel and adequate maintenance infrastructure. Ultimately, the formal recognition of the need for eighteen first-rank frigates marks a shift in France's naval defense strategy. It reflects an awareness of the strategic challenges facing the Navy and the necessity of adapting its capabilities to evolving geopolitical conditions. However, achieving this goal will depend on financial and industrial capacities as well as the political commitment to sustaining this effort over time.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/french-navy-aims-for-eighteen-more-frigates-to-address-new-maritime-challenges-from-mediterranean-to-pacific	2025-02-24T00:16:41-08:00

The addition of AIP technology is expected to significantly extend the underwater endurance of these vessels, allowing them to operate more effectively in deeper waters and for longer durations without the need to surface. This upgrade would make the Fateh-class an even more formidable asset in Iran’s naval arsenal, enhancing both its stealth and operational reach. The IRIN currently operates a fleet of 19-27 submarines, including a variety of classes that contribute to Iran’s evolving maritime strategy. Among the most significant of these are the Kilo-class (Tareq-class in Iranian service), the Fateh-class, and the Ghadir-class mini-submarines. The Kilo-class (Tareq-class in Iranian service) submarines were imported from Russia in the 1990s and are the backbone of Iran’s submarine fleet. With a displacement of around 3,000 tons and six torpedo tubes, the Kilo-class submarines are capable of launching torpedoes, mines, and ASCMs. These submarines, however, are limited by their need for relatively deep waters and the challenges posed by the unique salinity and currents in the Persian Gulf, restricting their operational effectiveness in some areas. The Ghadir-class mini-submarines represent an important part of Iran’s expanding submarine capabilities. With a reported fleet size of 15-23 vessels, the Ghadir-class submarines are small, coastal diesel-electric boats, ideal for operations in shallow waters. These submarines are equipped with two 533mm torpedo tubes and have the ability to launch torpedoes or anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs). The Ghadir-class provides Iran with a more flexible option for operations close to shore, where larger submarines like the Kilo-class would be less effective. Notably, these mini-submarines are built indigenously, showcasing Iran's growing domestic submarine production capabilities. Iran also operates the Nahang-class mini-submarine, which is reportedly used for transporting special operations forces. Although this vessel lacks torpedo tubes, it may carry mines or torpedoes externally, giving it a niche role in Iran’s maritime operations. The Nahang-class, like the Ghadir-class, is designed for coastal and shallow water operations, contributing to the flexibility of Iran’s submarine fleet. While Iran has no nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) or ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), its focus on mini-submarines like the Ghadir-class and advancements in torpedo technology such as the Valfajr make it a formidable regional power in maritime security. These vessels, along with retrofitting efforts for older submarines and the development of new submersible technologies, ensure that Iran maintains an effective and adaptive naval force. Iran is also experimenting with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs) for special operations. These technologies, although still in their early stages, may further enhance Iran’s ability to conduct covert operations, reconnaissance, and asymmetric warfare in coastal waters and beyond. In particular, SDVs like the Sabehat-15, which has been tested by both the IRIN and the IRGCN, can be used for reconnaissance or to deploy mines, enhancing Iran's ability to conduct irregular warfare. The modernization of Iran’s submarine fleet is further exemplified by the Fateh-class's planned integration of an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. This technology, which would allow the vessels to operate underwater for extended periods without the need to surface for air, would greatly enhance the operational endurance of these submarines. The upgrade to AIP is expected to give the Fateh-class submarines significantly improved performance, making them more capable of conducting extended missions in deeper waters like the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Iran’s expanding submarine fleet is not merely about enhancing military capabilities; it also plays a strategic role in Iran’s national security and its broader defense strategy. Submarines, especially in a region as geopolitically sensitive as the Persian Gulf, serve as a powerful deterrent against foreign naval presence and can influence global shipping routes, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz. By controlling access to this vital chokepoint, Iran can exert significant influence over the flow of global energy markets, especially oil and gas, which are crucial to the economies of many nations. The IRIN’s operations extend beyond the Persian Gulf, with Iranian submarines also deployed in the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Indian Ocean. The ability to operate in such diverse and challenging environments adds a layer of flexibility to Iran’s naval power projection. The combination of conventional submarine designs and cutting-edge technologies such as the Valfajr torpedo, AIP systems, and mini-submarines further bolsters Iran’s regional influence. The successful launch of the Valfajr torpedo from the Fateh-class submarine is not just a demonstration of Iran’s increasing technological sophistication but also a statement of its strategic intent. As Iran continues to modernize and expand its submarine fleet, integrating new technologies and refining its undersea warfare capabilities, the country’s naval forces are poised to remain a potent force in the region. Iran’s growing submarine capabilities, underscored by innovations such as the Valfajr torpedo and the anticipated AIP upgrade for the Fateh-class, are key components of its broader strategy to assert control over vital maritime regions and ensure national security in an increasingly volatile geopolitical environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-irans-navy-enhances-underwater-warfare-capabilities-with-new-torpedo-launch-from-fateh-submarine	2025-02-23T02:50:26-08:00

Türkiye Considers a Carrier-Based Version of KAAN Fighter for Its Future MUGEM Aircraft Carrier	On February 19, 2025, Ulusavunma reported that Türkiye is exploring the possibility of developing a carrier-based version of its fifth-generation stealth fighter, KAAN, designed for naval operations on its future aircraft carrier, MUGEM. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to establish an independent and modern carrier aviation capability. Currently under discussion between the Turkish Navy’s design bureau and Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), the project would require significant structural and technological modifications to adapt the KAAN to the requirements of carrier-based operations. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link First model of the Turkish-built MUGEM aircraft carrier in Saha 2024 (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) Originally designed for land-based operations, the KAAN would need modifications to enable takeoff and landing on an aircraft carrier. Necessary adjustments include reinforced landing gear, an arrestor hook, and foldable wings for optimized storage onboard. The choice of launch and recovery system will also impact its development. The MUGEM is designed for STOBAR (Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) operations, meaning the KAAN would need to take off using a ski-jump and land using arrestor cables. However, a future transition to a CATOBAR (Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery) configuration is being considered, which could require additional modifications, such as a reinforced landing gear structure to withstand catapult launch forces. Construction of the MUGEM aircraft carrier officially began on January 2, 2025. This 285-meter-long, 60,000-ton vessel represents a significant step in Türkiye’s naval development. It features an angled flight deck measuring 72 meters in width and a draft of 10.1 meters. The ship is designed to accommodate up to 50 aircraft, including 30 stored in the hangar and 20 positioned on the flight deck. Upon entering service, it will not be equipped with a catapult system, but a modular launch system is planned for future integration. The ship’s propulsion system is based on COGAG (Combined Gas And Gas) technology, allowing a maximum speed of 25 knots and an operational range of 10,000 nautical miles, enabling both regional and international deployments. The KAAN fighter, developed by TAI under its initial designation Milli Muharip Uçak (MMU) or TF-X, conducted its maiden flight in February 2024, reaching an altitude of 8,000 feet and a speed of 230 knots. A second flight in May 2024 extended its altitude to 10,000 feet. The development program aims to produce three Block prototypes by 2026 and a Block I prototype by 2029. From a technical standpoint, the KAAN is designed as a fifth-generation fighter with a reduced radar signature and high maneuverability. It measures approximately 21 meters in length, with a 14-meter wingspan and a 6-meter height. Its maximum takeoff weight is estimated at 27,000 kg. It is currently powered by two General Electric F110 engines, though Türkiye is developing an indigenous engine in collaboration with TRMotor, intended for integration into future production models. The aircraft is equipped with an AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, developed domestically, providing advanced detection and tracking capabilities. It also features an IRST (Infrared Search and Track) system for passive target acquisition and an advanced electronic warfare suite capable of countering enemy targeting systems. The KAAN's armament includes a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, with internal weapons bays to maintain stealth characteristics. Expected weapons include the Gökdoğan (Bozdogan) and Gökhan missiles, designed for medium- and long-range engagements. The aircraft will also be capable of carrying precision-guided bombs and cruise missiles. Future developments could integrate hypersonic weapons and artificial intelligence-based systems to enhance combat autonomy. Its cockpit features an advanced glass cockpit interface with touchscreen displays and an enhanced head-up display (HUD). It incorporates artificial intelligence to assist with data processing and decision-making, reducing pilot workload. In terms of connectivity, the KAAN is designed for networked operations, enabling coordination with other aircraft, including combat drones and airborne command platforms. Adapting the KAAN for carrier operations presents a significant technological challenge but aligns with medium-term plans to enhance Türkiye’s airpower projection. If realized, this project would provide the Turkish Navy with a fifth-generation carrier-based fighter, strengthening its operational capabilities. The successful integration of the KAAN into the MUGEM program would mark a key milestone in Türkiye’s military aviation development, positioning it among nations with advanced carrier aviation capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/tuerkiye-considers-a-carrier-based-version-of-kaan-fighter-for-its-future-mugem-aircraft-carrier	2025-02-20T09:15:36-08:00
