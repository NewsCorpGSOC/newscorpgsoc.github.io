The MGCS was launched in 2017 to deliver a next-generation tank, with France's Nexter (part of KNDS) and Thales working alongside Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (also in KNDS) and Rheinmetall. The project received renewed momentum in April 2024 through an agreement to organize it around eight technological pillars divided equally between the two nations. Nevertheless, the program has encountered multiple obstacles, including disagreements over technology choices and responsibility sharing, causing notable delays. These tensions raise questions about the viability of Franco-German defense cooperation. Additionally, competing developments, such as Rheinmetall’s partnership with Italy’s Leonardo to produce the Panther KF51 tank, add further pressure, challenging MGCS’s relevance within Europe’s defense landscape. To address these delays, Chiva confirmed that efforts are underway to extend the operational lifespan of the Leclerc tank to 2040. He also mentioned a potential 'intermediate solution,' already proposed by KNDS France, involving an upgraded Leclerc model equipped with advancements like the ASCALON cannon. The DGA also raised the possibility of France and Germany developing separate heavy tanks within a shared architecture. This approach could meet each nation’s specific needs while maintaining collaborative elements. However, such an initiative would require national funding, which could reflect a degree of strategic independence, particularly for France. Despite the challenges, Chiva expressed support for French innovation, citing ASCALON as a major technological achievement. He emphasized that the French Military Programming Law was designed to avoid capability gaps, although restarting production lines remains a complex issue. While no details were provided on a potential 'Plan B,' he stressed the importance of fostering innovation and overcoming logistical hurdles. Both the MGCS and the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) embody Franco-German ambitions to strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy in defense. These programs aim to integrate advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and interconnected systems, into next-generation combat platforms. However, since their inception in 2017, both have faced industrial and political challenges, delaying progress and raising concerns over their future. These difficulties highlight broader issues in building an effective European defense framework. Disputes over MGCS and SCAF underline the complexity of multinational cooperation in defense, where national interests can conflict with collective goals. Achieving meaningful strategic autonomy for Europe will require aligning member states' priorities, fostering industrial cohesion, and overcoming existing barriers. Success in projects like MGCS and SCAF is crucial for Europe's defense aspirations and its role on the global stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/frances-uncertainty-amid-challenges-for-future-main-ground-combat-system	2024-12-12T00:51:54-08:00

US Deploys A-10 Thunderbolt II Ground Attack Aircraft Squadron to Counter China Threats in the Philippines	On December 11, 2024, the United States deployed A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, nicknamed 'Warthogs,' to the Philippines for joint training exercises with the Philippine Air Force. This deployment underscores the longstanding defense partnership between the two nations and takes place amid rising tensions in the South China Sea. The A-10s, assigned to the 25th Fighter Squadron based in South Korea, landed at Clark Air Base on December 6 and will remain in the Philippines until December 15. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US A-10 Thunderbolt II Ground Attack Aircraft (Picture source: US MoD) This training is part of the U.S. Air Force's Dynamic Force Employment (DFE) strategy, which aims to ensure strategic predictability while maintaining operational unpredictability in contested regions. Officially adopted in 2018, the DFE strategy combines strategic foresight with operational flexibility to respond effectively to threats in disputed areas. Developed against the backdrop of growing rivalries with powers like China and Russia, this approach prioritizes agile and short-term deployments over prolonged or fixed rotations. Since its implementation, DFE missions have been conducted in strategic regions, including Europe and the Indo-Pacific, to test and demonstrate force responsiveness. These rapid, often unannounced, deployments are designed to keep adversaries uncertain about U.S. intentions while enhancing deterrence. At the same time, this strategy maximizes troop readiness for rapidly evolving geopolitical threats, a critical factor in sensitive areas like the Indo-Pacific, where DFE was recently applied with the A-10 deployment to the Philippines in December 2024. This joint training operation occurs against the backdrop of escalating tensions in the South China Sea, where reports from late November 2024 indicated the presence of nearly 100 Chinese vessels near Thitu Island, occupied by the Philippines. The contested waters are central to overlapping territorial claims involving China, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian nations. The Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951 between the United States and the Philippines obligates both nations to respond jointly to any attack on their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces in the Pacific region, highlighting the importance of these military collaborations. Military ties between the Philippines and the United States are deeply rooted, dating back to the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, which commits both nations to mutual defense in the event of armed attacks in the Pacific region. These ties were further solidified by the 1947 military base agreement, which allowed the U.S. to maintain strategic installations such as Clark Air Base, north of Manila, and Subic Bay Naval Base, on the western coast of Luzon. Although the U.S. withdrew from these bases in 1991 following a Philippine Senate vote, cooperation resumed vigorously with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed in 2014. This agreement grants U.S. forces access to several key bases, including Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, near the South China Sea, and Basa Air Base in Pampanga, for temporary rotations. These bases play a strategic role in regular joint exercises like Balikatan, which aim to enhance interoperability and address security challenges, particularly amid China's growing claims in the South China Sea. Today, this alliance remains a cornerstone of stability in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Department of Defense has designated the Indo-Pacific region as a priority due to escalating Chinese military and maritime activities. Regular joint training exercises, such as the arrival of A-10s and a recent air drill over the Philippine Sea in November, are central to Washington's strategy for maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. According to U.S. officials, these exercises aim to bolster interoperability and shared capabilities, ensuring preparedness for emerging regional challenges. The A-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the 'Warthog,' is a twin-engine attack aircraft renowned for its rugged design and close air support capabilities. Powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines, it achieves a maximum speed of 833 km/h and has a combat range of 460 km. The aircraft is heavily armored to withstand ground fire and features redundant systems for enhanced survivability. Its primary weapon is the GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm rotary cannon, capable of firing 3,900 rounds per minute, optimized for destroying armored vehicles. Additionally, the A-10 can carry up to 7,260 kg of mixed ordnance, including missiles, bombs, and rockets, across 11 hardpoints. Its ability to operate at low altitude and slow speeds makes it unmatched in close air support and battlefield interdiction. The development of the A-10 Thunderbolt II dates back to the late 1960s when the U.S. Air Force initiated the AX (Attack Experimental) program to design an aircraft capable of providing close air support in hostile environments. The A-10's maiden flight occurred in May 1972, and it officially entered service in 1976. Designed to withstand ground fire and neutralize enemy armor, the A-10 first demonstrated its combat prowess during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, destroying hundreds of Iraqi tanks. It is equipped with the GAU-8/A Avenger rotary cannon, utilizing depleted uranium armor-piercing (API) or high-explosive incendiary (HEI) ammunition to neutralize heavily armored targets. The aircraft has also proven effective in conflicts such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, and more recently in Syria, where it was deployed against Islamic State positions. Despite multiple attempts to retire the aircraft due to its age, field reports emphasize its durability, precision, and unique ability to support ground troops, qualities that continue to justify its active service.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-deploys-a-10-thunderbolt-ii-ground-attack-aircraft-squadron-to-counter-china-threats-in-the-philippines	2024-12-11T02:10:48-08:00	
Greece Prioritizes M113 Modernization Over US Bradleys and French VBCIs	According to information published by the specialized website OnAlert on December 9, 2024, the Greek military has decided to modernize its fleet of M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) rather than acquire new vehicles like the American M2 Bradleys or the French VBCIs. This decision, driven by budgetary constraints and operational requirements, represents a significant move in Greece's efforts to upgrade its armored vehicle fleet while addressing its military needs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Army soldiers conducted a convoy operation to an objective during force-on-force training at Petrochori Range, Triantafyllides Camp, Greece, as part of Olympic Cooperation 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) For years, the Greek General Staff has sought to modernize its mechanized infantry, which has faced growing obsolescence in its equipment. The Kentauros Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) project, launched in the 2000s, was abandoned, leaving Greece without a viable replacement for its aging vehicles. In 2020, a proposal was made to acquire M2A2/M2A2OD Bradleys from the United States. Although approved in 2023 for the transfer of 300 units, the refurbishment costs of the vehicles proved prohibitive. Even an offer involving 62 Bradleys free of charge and 102 more under favorable financial terms was deemed unaffordable by Athens due to budgetary limitations. Simultaneously, France proposed a compelling alternative: the immediate delivery of 120 VBCIs, with an additional 250 units to be co-produced with Greek industry. However, this option was also considered too costly. A competing offer from Rheinmetall for its KF-41 Lynx failed to secure interest for similar reasons. Ultimately, the Greek military opted for a more economical solution by modernizing its M113 fleet. This program, a collaboration between the Israeli company Rafael and the Greek firm METKA, involves upgrading over 500 M113 vehicles. The modernization includes the installation of remote-controlled weapon stations with 30mm cannons, enhanced armor, a new, more powerful propulsion system, advanced communication systems, and modern optronic sensors. The upgrades will be conducted at METKA’s facility in Magnesia, with costs significantly lower than the alternatives proposed, making this option particularly attractive for Athens. However, M113s remain APCs with a weight of 12 tons, which is significantly lighter than modern IFVs like the Bradley and VBCI, which weigh nearly twice as much and offer superior firepower. The standard M113 armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun, suitable for defense against infantry and lightly armored threats. In contrast, the VBCI is equipped with a 25mm cannon mounted on a remote turret, while the Bradley boasts a 25mm M242 cannon and can be fitted with TOW anti-tank missiles, providing substantial offensive capabilities against heavily armored targets. Regarding protection, the M113 features aluminum armor designed to withstand small arms fire and shell fragments but remains vulnerable to modern anti-tank weapons. By contrast, the VBCI and Bradley provide more robust protection against ballistic threats and improvised explosive devices. Both IFVs also incorporate advanced detection and communication systems, enhancing their battlefield efficiency. While the M113 fulfills its primary role as a troop carrier, the VBCI and Bradley surpass it in firepower, protection, and operational versatility. This choice reflects a pragmatic approach by Greece to extend the lifespan of existing equipment while addressing immediate operational needs. Modernizing the M113 fleet offers a cost-effective alternative to acquiring modern IFVs, especially considering the purchase, maintenance, and training costs associated with new vehicles. Moreover, the program supports local industry through partnerships like that with METKA, contributing to the Greek defense economy. Modernizing the M113 allows Greece to respond swiftly to operational demands. While these vehicles do not match the capabilities of Bradleys or VBCIs, upgrades such as remote weapon stations, improved armor, and advanced communication systems enhance their battlefield utility. This approach also enables Greece to deploy a larger number of modernized vehicles, reinforcing its mechanized forces quantitatively, even if qualitatively they remain behind modern IFVs. Currently, the Greek military possesses approximately 2,900 M113 APCs, including various variants acquired over decades to meet operational requirements. The decision to modernize these vehicles underscores Greece’s commitment to strengthening its military capabilities within strict budgetary limits. Although economical, this strategy raises questions about its long-term viability in addressing evolving threats and operational challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-prioritizes-m113-modernization-over-american-bradleys-and-french-vbcis	2024-12-10T23:53:47-08:00	
Analysis: With Fewer Forces Than Cold War British Army Could Collapse in 6 Months of Ukraine-Style War	Veterans Minister Al Carns, a former Royal Marine colonel, has issued a grave warning about the readiness of the British Armed Forces. He cautioned that in a conflict of the scale and intensity of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the British Army could be 'expended in six months to a year.' This stark assessment underscores significant limitations in the UK’s capacity to sustain prolonged, high-intensity military engagements, raising pressing questions about its ability to fulfill national defense obligations and meet NATO commitments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British soldiers during training exercises, highlighting efforts to maintain readiness as the Army faces historic reductions in troop numbers and challenges in sustaining prolonged high-intensity conflicts. (Picture source: British MoD) Data released earlier this year by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) lends weight to these concerns. British troop numbers have plummeted to their lowest levels since the early 1800s, with a 38% decline in recruits over the past two decades. Total personnel in the armed forces has dropped from 207,000 in 2000 to just 131,000 in 2024. The British Army now fields approximately 73,000 regular soldiers—the smallest force in its modern history—while the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force stand at 29,000 and 33,000 personnel, respectively. This dramatic erosion contrasts sharply with the Cold War, when the UK maintained robust military forces designed to counter large-scale threats such as the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the British Army was one of NATO’s strongest and most capable forces. Though smaller than the U.S. military, the UK played a pivotal role in the alliance’s defense strategy, particularly in Europe. Its reputation rested on a combination of highly trained personnel, modern equipment, and strategic positioning, bolstered by its independent nuclear deterrent. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), stationed in West Germany, exemplified this strength, consisting of four armored divisions equipped with over 800 Chieftain and Challenger 1 tanks, advanced artillery, and air defense systems like the Rapier missile. The UK’s global reach further enhanced its military power. The Royal Navy operated over 130 combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and a formidable submarine fleet. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force fielded more than 850 aircraft, including Tornado, Harrier, and Jaguar fighters, alongside robust reconnaissance and transport capabilities. Today, this once-formidable capability has been significantly diminished. The British Army now operates only 227 Challenger 2 tanks, with upgrades to Challenger 3 underway. Artillery inventories have been severely reduced, and the British Army’s ability to sustain high-volume, long-range firepower in prolonged engagements falls short of modern requirements. The Royal Navy, once boasting 130 vessels, now operates just 73, including two Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but with only 19 frigates and destroyers to escort them. Similarly, the Royal Air Force’s fleet has declined to around 500 aircraft, even as advanced platforms like the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II have entered service. The war in Ukraine vividly illustrates the resources and resilience required for sustained, high-intensity conflict. Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia has depended on continuous supplies of tanks, artillery, drones, and ammunition, much of it provided by NATO allies. If the UK faced a similar-scale conflict, the British Armed Forces would likely struggle to sustain operations beyond a few months. Insufficient ammunition stockpiles, aging equipment, and gaps in critical systems such as air defense are significant vulnerabilities. British ammunition reserves, in particular, would be quickly exhausted, given the consumption rates observed in Ukraine, where thousands of artillery rounds are fired daily. Logistical endurance remains a critical challenge. The lack of robust air defense systems capable of countering drones and precision missile strikes further exposes vulnerabilities in prolonged engagements. These deficiencies underscore the UK's challenges as it seeks to modernize its forces and rebuild its capacity. Efforts to address these issues are underway. The Future Soldier initiative aims to restructure the British Army into smaller, agile Brigade Combat Teams with enhanced digital capabilities. Procurement projects, including upgrades to Challenger 3 tanks, the acquisition of Archer self-propelled howitzers, and investments in counter-drone technologies, represent steps in the right direction. However, the pace of modernization has been slow, and the gap between current capabilities and the demands of high-intensity warfare remains substantial. Financial constraints further complicate these efforts. The UK’s defense budget for the 2023/24 fiscal year was £53.9 billion, with planned increases to £56.9 billion in 2024/25 and £59.8 billion in 2025/26. This represents an annual real-terms growth rate of 2.3%. While former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030—potentially delivering an additional £75 billion—specific plans to achieve this target remain unclear. Current allocations may be insufficient to address existing capability gaps and modernization needs. The warnings from Veterans Minister Al Carns, coupled with British MoD data and lessons from the Ukraine war, highlight the urgent need for a reassessment of the UK’s defense priorities. The sharp decline in personnel, equipment, and logistical endurance underscores a critical challenge in maintaining a credible deterrent. Heavy weaponry, robust air defenses, and sustained logistical support are essential areas for investment if the British Armed Forces are to remain effective in modern warfare. Without decisive action and adequate funding, the UK risks further erosion of its military capabilities and its standing as a global military power.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-with-fewer-forces-than-cold-war-british-army-could-collapse-in-6-months-of-ukraine-style-war	2024-12-10T09:38:27-08:00

It is used for applications such as reconnaissance, mapping, and combat missions, with compatibility for third-party controllers and onboard processing capabilities for mapping and modeling. Skydio has also started hiring a small team in Ukraine, currently comprising fewer than ten employees focused on engineering and customer support roles, as part of its strategy to expand operations in the region. CEO Adam Bry described Ukraine as a critical testing ground for drones due to its extensive use of small, commercial-style UAVs in electronic warfare conditions. Since 2022, Skydio has delivered approximately 1,000 drones to Ukraine, with the Ministry of Interior requesting additional units, including the X10D, which features multi-band radio modules, frequency-hopping technology, and modular sensor packages for thermal and radiometric imaging. The French Armed Forces have recently expanded their fleet of micro-drones to enhance reconnaissance and intelligence capabilities. In October 2022, the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA) received 200 Anafi micro-drone systems, increasing the total to 450 units delivered. In June 2024, the French company Novadem secured a significant order for NX70 micro-drones, bringing the total number in service with the French Army to over 440. Additionally, in January 2021, the DGA ordered 300 micro-drones from the French manufacturer Parrot for use in reconnaissance and intelligence operations. These purchases align with the French Armed Forces’ objectives of modernizing operational capabilities to meet the demands of contemporary conflicts. Micro-drones provide discreet, real-time surveillance, enabling critical information gathering while minimizing risks to personnel. Their efficiency in close-range intelligence enhances unit protection and tactical advantages. Moreover, their cost-effectiveness compared to traditional combat aircraft and their proven utility in recent conflicts underscore the strategic importance of these technologies in modern military operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-made-skydio-x10d-micro-drone-proves-potential-for-urban-warfare-in-french-army-trials	2024-12-10T07:22:52-08:00

Taiwan ramps up Wanjian cruise missile production to strengthen the country’s naval and air capabilities	As reported by the Liberty Times on December 7, 2024, Taiwan has completed the mass production of its domestically developed Wanjian air-to-ground cruise missile, providing new capabilities for preemptive strikes on key Chinese military positions. Over 150 units of the Wanjian-1 bomb, with a range of 200 kilometers, have been produced, and the development of an extended-range version, the Wanjian-2 with a range of 400 kilometers, is now being carried out under the Ministry of National Defense's annual budget for further testing and small-batch production.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. (Picture source: Twitter/Taepodong) The development of Taiwan's Wanjian missile, also known as the Wan Chien or the 'Ten Thousand Swords Bomb,' began in the early 2000s as a response to the growing threat posed by China's military advancements. Initiated under the codename 'Project Divine Axe' by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the missile was designed to neutralize strategic targets such as airstrips, radar installations, and troop concentrations on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Drawing inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the Storm Shadow, its development incorporated advanced features like GPS and inertial navigation guidance, as well as a turbofan engine for extended range. The missile first underwent testing in the mid-2000s, achieved combat readiness in 2010, entered service in 2011, and entered mass production in 2015 after system integration with Taiwan’s AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter jets. Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. Live-fire exercises by F-CK-1 units in Tainan and Taichung demonstrated its effectiveness, targeting simulated installations on the southeastern coast of China, including strikes targeting facilities in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces from positions near the midline of the Taiwan Strait. It supports Taiwan’s defensive strategy by enabling precision strikes on key installations beyond the reach of short-range defenses. The Wanjian bomb is integrated with the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, with each aircraft capable of carrying one missile under each wing. The missile is guided by GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain recognition (TERCOM) systems for mid-flight adjustments, along with terminal guidance technologies such as image infrared (IIR) and digital scene matching area correlation (DSMAC). The missile’s design features a square body, foldable wings for compact storage and aerodynamic performance, an X-shaped rudder for directional control, and a turbofan engine that allows subsonic speeds up to Mach 0.8. It carries a 350-kilogram warhead containing submunitions equipped with delayed fuzes. These submunitions are engineered to penetrate surfaces and detonate underground, maximizing damage to hardened targets. The development of the Wanjian-2, also known as the Extended-Range Wanjian Bomb, is now being carried out to realize precision strikes at ranges up to 400 km. Also designed for the F-CK-1 fighter, it features a cluster munition warhead capable of targeting runways, radars, and troop concentrations. The missile utilizes GPS and inertial navigation with advanced terminal guidance for enhanced accuracy. Its design includes foldable wings, an X-tail configuration, and a turbofan engine for subsonic flight. It seems that small-scale production of the Wanjian-2 variant is set to continue under Taiwan's annual defense budget to bolster long-range strike capabilities. This extended-range version will enhance strike capabilities by allowing deeper penetration into adversary-controlled areas. However, it remains in the development phase under the Ministry of National Defense’s regular budget allocations. The Wanjian draws inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the British Storm Shadow. (Picture source: NCSIST) Despite its capabilities, the Wanjian missile's reliance on a non-stealthy design and subsonic speed makes it vulnerable to modern air defense systems, particularly during low-altitude flight paths needed for accurate targeting of runways or other fixed installations. The missile's effectiveness is further constrained by the limited range and survivability of its carrier platform, the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter, which risks interception before launch in contested airspace. Additionally, dependence on civilian GPS navigation rather than military-grade systems reduces its accuracy under electronic countermeasure conditions. These factors could collectively undermine the Wanjian's operational potential in high-threat environments. In addition to its existing applications, the feasibility of adapting the Wanjian bomb for use on helicopters was proposed by Kuomintang legislators in 2019. The proposal emphasized the need to overcome the dependency on operational runways during a conflict, addressing the expected asymmetry in air force readiness caused by immediate damage to airfields. However, a feasibility assessment by the Air Force concluded that adapting the Wanjian bomb for helicopter deployment is both technically challenging and impractical. The assessment cited the size and weight of the missile, the limited payload capacity of helicopters, and the need for U.S. approval for modifications to American-made rotorcraft as significant obstacles. While the suggestion aimed to reduce dependency on runways, the Air Force stated that the Wanjian bomb’s current integration with AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo aircraft remains the optimal approach. In recent years, Taiwan has been enhancing its cruise missile capabilities through the development and deployment of several systems. For instance, the Ching Tien (擎天) supersonic cruise missile, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, has entered mass production and is being deployed by the Air Force, enabling it to reach targets north of Beijing. The Hsiung Sheng, an extended-range variant of the Hsiung Feng IIE land-attack cruise missile, is planned for deployment in 2024, offering a range of up to 1,200 kilometers to target critical sites such as the People's Liberation Army's Eastern and Southern Theater Command bases. With the production of the Wanjian missile system, these missiles are part of Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid regional security concerns. Taiwan is responding to increased military pressure from China by enhancing its defense capabilities through various measures. The United States has approved arms sales to Taiwan, including a $2 billion package featuring the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Taiwan has increased its defense budget by 7.7% for 2025, with allocations for new fighter jets and missile production. Domestically, Taiwan launched its first indigenously built submarine, the Haikun, to strengthen naval deterrence. The US Department of Defense is also working with Taiwan on deploying drone swarms aimed at deterring potential Chinese actions. These measures reflect Taiwan’s efforts to address regional security tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/taiwan-ramps-up-wanjian-cruise-missile-production-to-strengthen-the-countrys-naval-and-air-capabilities	2024-12-10T02:15:20-08:00	
Breaking News: Taiwan Launches Combat Readiness Exercises Following China's Deployment of 90 Warships	China's recent deployment of approximately 90 naval and coast guard vessels near Taiwan represents a large escalation in regional tensions, prompting a robust response from Taiwan. On December 9, 2024, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense announced the launch of combat readiness exercises to counter this unprecedented show of force, the largest in recent months. The deployment spans waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas, surpassing previous military activities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan has raised its alert level following the sighting of over 90 Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the region. However, the defense ministry has not officially classified the movements as drills. (Picture source: Taiwanese Media TV screenshot) The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has also established an emergency response center to monitor the situation closely and address all 'gray zone' incursions—non-traditional military operations designed to exert pressure without open conflict. This escalation coincides with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's recent visit to Guam, a move Beijing views as provocative due to its opposition to official interactions between Taiwan and the United States. China's actions align with its broader strategy to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, potentially through military force. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has undergone rapid modernization and expansion, significantly enhancing its power projection capabilities. Beijing's possible plans for a naval assault include several scenarios. One potential strategy is a large-scale amphibious invasion, requiring substantial lift capacity and coordination to transport troops and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. However, China's current amphibious fleet may fall short of the requirements for a full-scale invasion, potentially necessitating the use of civilian vessels. While increasing transport capacity, these vessels are more vulnerable to Taiwan’s asymmetric defenses, such as missile-armed fast attack boats and stealthy corvettes. Another strategy could involve imposing a maritime blockade to sever Taiwan's critical supply lines, aiming to force political concessions without direct confrontation. Taiwan's heavy reliance on maritime trade makes it particularly susceptible to such a strategy. Additionally, China might continue to employ gray zone tactics, such as deploying maritime militias and conducting frequent incursions into Taiwanese waters and airspace, designed to test Taiwan’s responses and exert sustained pressure without triggering outright conflict. Taiwan's Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is a critical component of its defense strategy, tasked with countering these potential threats. As of 2024, the ROCN comprises approximately 40,000 personnel and a diverse fleet. The navy operates four Kee Lung-class guided-missile destroyers, which are former U.S. Navy vessels serving as the backbone of Taiwan's surface combatants. It also operates 22 frigates, including eight Cheng Kung-class frigates (based on the U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry-class) and six Kang Ding-class frigates, offering versatile capabilities for maritime defense. Two Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvettes have been commissioned, designed for high-speed operations and equipped with advanced anti-ship missiles. The ROCN maintains four submarines, including two Hai Lung-class and two older Hai Shih-class vessels, focused on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Taiwan has launched an ambitious program to construct seven new diesel-electric submarines over the next decade, significantly bolstering its undersea capabilities. Additionally, the navy operates eight amphibious ships, including tank landing ships and a recently commissioned Yushan-class amphibious transport dock, as well as various support vessels for logistics and replenishment. Recent efforts to develop asymmetric warfare capabilities focus on smaller, stealthier vessels equipped with precision-guided weaponry to offset the PLAN's numerical superiority.The Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC), Taiwan's elite amphibious warfare unit, plays a critical role in the defense of the island nation. With a strength of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 personnel, the ROCMC is trained for specialized missions, including amphibious assaults, coastal defense, and the protection of Taiwan's offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. Equipped with a diverse array of weapons and platforms, the Marine Corps fields modern assault rifles, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers for ground operations. For amphibious missions, they rely on vehicles like the AAV-7A1 amphibious assault vehicles, capable of transporting troops from ships to shore under combat conditions. The ROCMC also trains extensively in urban warfare, jungle operations, and joint exercises with other branches of Taiwan's military to ensure interoperability. These forces are prepared to respond swiftly to invasions or incursions, emphasizing the defense of Taiwan's sovereignty and the recovery of occupied territory in a conflict scenario. China's naval forces have seen rapid growth, making the PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy - Chinese Navy) the world's largest navy, with over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface combatants. The PLAN’s modern arsenal includes advanced warships such as the Type 055 destroyers and the aircraft carrier CNS Fujian, reflecting China’s ambition to project power and assert its maritime claims.

Russia May Exchange MiG-29 and Su-27 Fighter Jets for North Korean Troops Deployed in Ukraine	Russia and North Korea have reportedly reached a strategic agreement marking a significant step in their military cooperation. This deal aligns with Moscow’s strategy to strengthen its alliances amidst Western sanctions, while Pyongyang sees a rare opportunity to modernize its outdated air force. According to information disclosed by Admiral Samuel Paparo at the Reagan National Defense Forum on December 7, 2024, North Korea would receive Russian MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets. In return, North Korea is believed to have sent approximately 12,000 soldiers to support Russian military operations in Ukraine. These troops, though not directly involved in combat, are reportedly deployed in conflict zones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This agreement offers North Korea a critical upgrade from its outdated second-generation aircraft fleet to more advanced MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) The delivery of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets is part of Russia’s broader strategy to leverage its allies to counter international pressures. While the exact number of aircraft to be transferred remains unclear, their inclusion in North Korea’s fleet would significantly bolster Pyongyang’s military capabilities. However, these jets are technically inferior to fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. This agreement comes as North Korea’s air force, historically reliant on Soviet and Chinese support, struggles with decades of stagnation and international sanctions. Its current fleet is largely composed of Soviet-era aircraft from the 1980s, many of which are no longer operational. The MiG-29, developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich, is a twin-engine, fourth-generation fighter designed for air superiority. It is equipped with a Phazotron N019 radar capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' operations. The jet’s armament includes a 30mm cannon and air-to-air missiles such as the medium-range R-27 and short-range R-73. Renowned for its exceptional maneuverability, the MiG-29 features advanced aerodynamics and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, reaching speeds of Mach 2.3 and operating at altitudes up to 17,000 meters. The Su-27, designed by Sukhoi, is a long-range air superiority fighter equipped with a Phazotron N001 Myech radar, also capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' targeting. It is armed with a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 30mm cannon and up to ten hardpoints for air-to-air missiles like the R-73 and R-27. Known for its agility, the Su-27 incorporates advanced fly-by-wire controls and can execute complex maneuvers such as the 'Cobra.' It achieves speeds of Mach 2.35 and operates at altitudes up to 18,500 meters. For North Korea, this agreement addresses a major strategic gap. Its air force currently includes over 400 combat aircraft, but a significant portion belongs to the second generation, such as the Chinese-made J-5 and J-6, copies of the Soviet MiG-17 and MiG-19. Adding MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters from the 1980s would represent a considerable technological upgrade. These jets, equipped with relatively modern radars and weapon systems for their era, would enhance Pyongyang’s defensive capabilities against advanced South Korean forces. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The deal also underscores Pyongyang’s broader interest in advanced military technologies. In addition to fighter jets, North Korea may seek Russian expertise in ballistic missile re-entry vehicles, modern submarines, and air defense systems. This cooperation could help North Korea counter South Korea’s 'three-axis' doctrine, which focuses on neutralizing North Korean threats through preemptive, defensive, and offensive measures. This exchange occurs amid heightened regional tensions between the two Koreas. In June 2024, North Korean soldiers crossed into South Korea before retreating under warning shots from South Korean forces. More recently, in October 2024, North Korea destroyed sections of roads symbolizing reunification efforts and bolstered defensive structures along the border. These incidents highlight escalating tensions, marked by border clashes and military threats. Integrating MiG-29 and Su-27 jets into North Korea’s air force could improve its air defense and air superiority capabilities. However, these aircraft remain outclassed by fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. Additionally, the operational effectiveness of these jets will depend on pilot training and maintenance, areas where North Korea faces significant challenges. While this agreement strengthens North Korea’s air fleet quantitatively, it is unlikely to shift the aerial power balance significantly in the Korean Peninsula. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China. Recently, Iran received Su-35 jets and Mi-28 helicopters, while China has benefited from increased Russian technological support in sensitive areas like submarines and missiles. These partnerships reflect Russia’s growing reliance on allies to sustain its military capabilities under international sanctions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-may-exchange-mig-29-and-su-27-fighter-jets-for-north-korean-troops-deployed-in-ukraine	2024-12-10T01:55:42-08:00	
Russia to receive newest nuclear submarine Arkhangelsk with Kalibr Missiles in summer 2025	According to information published by Russian sources on December 6, 2024, the Russian Navy is preparing to enhance its underwater warfare capabilities with the addition of the Arkhangelsk, a multipurpose nuclear-powered submarine, slated for delivery in the summer of 2025. This submarine, part of the modernized Project 885M Yasen-M class, is being constructed by Sevmash, a division of the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Arkhangelsk, Russia's advanced Yasen-M class nuclear-powered submarine, is set to join the Navy in 2025, equipped with Kalibr and Oniks missiles.

It was launched on November 29, 2023, from Sevmash's shipyard in Severodvinsk for final outfitting and floating completion. In the event of a military conflict between NATO and Russia, the Arkhangelsk submarine, as part of the modernized Yasen-M class, could play a pivotal role in shifting the balance of power in the maritime domain and beyond. Its advanced capabilities make it an asset capable of addressing several strategic and tactical objectives: The Arkhangelsk is equipped with Kalibr-PL cruise missiles, capable of striking NATO targets at long distances, including critical infrastructure, command centers, and military bases. This capability serves as a strong deterrent, as the threat of precision strikes can dissuade adversaries from escalating conflict. Additionally, its ability to launch Oniks supersonic missiles provides a credible countermeasure to NATO surface fleets, including aircraft carrier strike groups. Operating in key maritime regions such as the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, or the Arctic, the Arkhangelsk could enforce sea denial strategies, restricting NATO's freedom of movement. Its stealth capabilities enable it to approach high-value targets undetected, posing a constant threat to NATO naval operations. By deploying near NATO maritime chokepoints, the submarine could effectively challenge or block naval reinforcements. With its advanced sensors, weaponry, and stealth design, the Arkhangelsk would likely be a formidable opponent in undersea warfare. It could hunt NATO submarines, including those tasked with deploying ballistic or cruise missiles, thus undermining NATO’s strategic deterrent capabilities. The submarine’s ability to operate covertly in the Atlantic could allow it to disrupt NATO's vital maritime supply routes between North America and Europe. Striking supply convoys and transport vessels would complicate NATO’s logistical efforts, potentially delaying reinforcements and resupply operations. The Kalibr-PL missiles on board the 'Arkhangelsk' are capable of precision strikes on land-based targets. In a conflict, the submarine could launch coordinated missile barrages against NATO military installations, communication hubs, or missile defense sites, potentially neutralizing critical components of NATO’s operational network. Given its Arctic-capable design, the 'Arkhangelsk' could support operations in the increasingly contested Arctic region. Control over this region is crucial for both Russia and NATO, as it holds strategic sea lanes and natural resources. The submarine could patrol under the Arctic ice, undetected, projecting power and securing Russian claims in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-to-receive-newest-nuclear-submarine-arkhangelsk-with-kalibr-missiles-in-summer-2025	2024-12-10T01:32:35-08:00	
US Army Explores PrSM Inc. 5 Missile for Autonomous Launchers Exceeding 1000 km	The US Army is advancing its technological capabilities in long-range precision strikes with plans to develop a fifth iteration of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), designed to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers. During a December 3, 2024 event hosted by the Association of the US Army, two senior military officials shared insights into this project, which could significantly enhance the Army's strike range capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Major General Winston Brook, commander of the Fires Center of Excellence, presented a slide that identified the PrSM Increment 5 as a prospective future capability. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, explained that preliminary work on this fifth version of the PrSM has commenced, with a formal science and technology development initiative scheduled for fiscal year 2026.

These acquisitions form part of a broader effort to improve operational capabilities against criminal and insurgent activities. Ecuador is experiencing a significant security crisis driven by organized crime and drug trafficking. In January 2024, the escape of drug lord Adolfo Macias, alias Fito, exacerbated the situation. In early December 2024, ten individuals, including nine Colombians, were killed in El Guabo, El Oro Province, in an attack linked to gang conflicts. In another incident, footballer Pedro Pablo Perlaza was kidnapped in Esmeraldas but later rescued by police. Additionally, Olger Moreno, the deputy security chief of Cotopaxi prison, was assassinated in late November. Ecuador has accepted military assistance from over 38 nations, including the United States and Argentina, as part of its efforts to address these issues. A state of emergency has been declared, and military forces have been deployed to support police operations against criminal groups. Despite these measures, violence remains a concern, particularly in areas where Colombian and Ecuadorian drug trafficking organizations compete for control of cocaine production and trafficking routes along the Amazonian border. These efforts reflect Ecuador's attempt to strengthen its security infrastructure and respond to escalating threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/ecuador-deploys-over-100-new-israeli-mdt-david-and-south-african-mbombe-6-armored-vehicles-to-address-escalating-violence	2024-12-09T08:09:24-08:00

The agreement was disclosed following the state visit of Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, to the United Kingdom, where he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This decision marks a significant step in the growing partnership between the two countries, particularly in the field of defense cooperation. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Qatari government announced its intention to acquire 12 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighters. (Picture source: BAE Systems) The contract, valued at approximately £2.8 billion, will benefit the production facilities of BAE Systems in Samlesbury and Warton, ensuring continuity of operations at these key sites. This new order builds on Qatar’s 2017 purchase of 24 Typhoons and complements its diverse fleet, which also includes French Rafales and American F-15QAs. The integration of the Typhoons into the joint No. 12 Squadron, operated by the Qatari Air Force and the British Royal Air Force, underscores their strategic role in strengthening bilateral military collaborations. Qatar has significantly enhanced its military air fleet over the past decade by adopting a strategy of supply diversification to ensure its security and operational independence. In 2017, Doha signed a €5.6 billion contract for the acquisition of 24 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters from the Eurofighter consortium (BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo), reinforced by an additional order for 12 units announced in December 2024, valued at an estimated £2.8 billion. These aircraft are integrated into the joint No. 12 Squadron with the British Royal Air Force, symbolizing strengthened military cooperation between Qatar and the United Kingdom. In December 2024, during the state visit of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to the United Kingdom, the two nations strengthened their defense partnership by signing agreements to extend their collaboration on joint squadrons of Typhoon and Hawk aircraft. On this occasion, two Typhoon fighters from the joint No. 12 Squadron escorted the Emir’s aircraft as it entered British airspace, illustrating their operational synergy. This visit highlights the deepening military ties between the United Kingdom and Qatar, based on their historical relationship and shared commitment to regional security. The Typhoon offers Qatar’s armed forces a modern and versatile combat platform capable of meeting diverse operational needs. With its advanced avionics, high-speed performance (Mach 2), and exceptional maneuverability, it is perfectly suited for air-to-air combat and ground attack missions. Equipped with the AESA Captor-E radar and a wide array of precision-guided munitions, including Meteor and Brimstone missiles, the Typhoon enhances Qatar’s air superiority and strike capabilities. Additionally, its integration into the joint No. 12 Squadron between the United Kingdom and Qatar provides valuable training, NATO-standard interoperability, and a strategic partnership with a key ally, further strengthening Qatar’s defensive posture and regional influence. In parallel, Qatar has also invested in French Rafale fighters, signing an initial contract for 24 aircraft in 2015, followed by an additional order for 12 units in 2017, bringing the total cost to approximately €6.3 billion. These Rafales are expected to be upgraded to the F4 standard, adding enhanced capabilities such as advanced connectivity systems and next-generation armaments. Finally, Qatar purchased 36 American F-15QA fighters under a $12 billion contract signed in 2017. These acquisitions reflect a pragmatic strategy, balancing strategic alliances and military enhancement, with a fleet combining the strengths of major aviation powers. While the announcement surprised France, where negotiations for additional Rafales and other military equipment were ongoing, it illustrates Qatar’s delicate balance between maintaining operational readiness and developing strong relationships with major defense suppliers. This agreement is particularly significant as the Typhoon had not received recent export orders before Qatar’s renewed interest, positioning the United Kingdom as a key strategic partner for Doha in a competitive regional landscape. This development also reflects changes in Qatar’s defense procurement strategy, including its exploration of joint infantry mechanisms with the United Kingdom, potentially centered on ARTEC’s Boxer armored vehicle. By diversifying its defense assets and partnerships, this Typhoon agreement highlights Qatar’s commitment to a robust and versatile military posture aligned with NATO standards and adapted to an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Qatar’s decision not to opt for additional Rafales, despite the aircraft’s excellent performance, can be attributed to several strategic and political reasons. Firstly, Qatar already has 36 Rafales in its fleet, which may limit the immediate appeal of a new order, especially with existing aircraft undergoing upgrades to the F4 standard. In contrast, the Typhoon provides an opportunity to further diversify operational capabilities and strategic partnerships, strengthening the already solid military cooperation with the United Kingdom, particularly through the joint No. 12 Squadron. Additionally, the purchase of new Typhoons can be seen as a political decision aimed at balancing relationships with multiple major defense suppliers, avoiding over-reliance on France, which has already supplied Rafales and various military equipment. Furthermore, support for the British industry, facing challenges with the Typhoon in the international market, may have influenced the decision. This strategic choice also allows Qatar to leverage the specific advantages of the Typhoon, such as its enhanced air superiority through the Captor-E radar and Meteor missile, complementing the capabilities already offered by the Rafale. In summary, this decision seems driven more by diplomatic and strategic considerations than by any technical shortcomings of the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon operated by Qatar is a high-tech multirole fighter equipped with the most advanced technologies. It features the AESA Captor-E radar for superior target detection and tracking, along with the advanced Defensive Aids Subsystem (DASS) for enhanced survivability and modern avionics that ensure high operational versatility. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines, the Typhoon reaches a maximum speed of Mach 2 and has a combat range of over 1,500 km. Its armament systems include a wide range of air-to-air missiles, such as the Meteor, precision-guided munitions, and the Brimstone missile for ground-attack missions, making it a formidable force in modern aerial combat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/qatar-increases-air-combat-power-with-additional-order-of-twelve-new-typhoon-fighters	2024-12-09T07:28:26-08:00	
Breaking News: Dutch F-35 Fighter Jets Conduct First Interceptions of Russian Spy Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	Dutch Air Force F-35 fighter jets stationed in Estonia have successfully conducted their first operational interceptions over the Baltic Sea, showcasing the Netherlands’ commitment to NATO’s collective defense. On Friday, December 6, two Dutch F-35s were scrambled twice under the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) protocol to intercept and monitor Russian aircraft operating near NATO airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During an interception mission, a Dutch Air Force F-35A Lightning II escorts a Russian SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea, demonstrating NATO's vigilance in safeguarding its airspace. (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) During the first interception, the Dutch F-35 fighter jets identified a Russian Antonov AN-73/74 'Coaler' transport aircraft and a Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance jet. The SU-24MR specializes in electronic intelligence gathering, highlighting the persistent surveillance activities conducted by Russian forces near NATO territory. Later in the day, the QRA was activated again, with the F-35s intercepting an Ilyushin IL-20 'Coot A,' an advanced surveillance aircraft equipped for electronic monitoring. The Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' is a specialized variant of the SU-24, a supersonic, all-weather tactical bomber developed by the Soviet Union. The SU-24MR is configured specifically for reconnaissance missions, equipped with advanced sensors and electronic intelligence-gathering systems. Although the Russian planes remained in international airspace, the Dutch F-35s closely monitored and escorted them to the edge of NATO’s area of responsibility. These interceptions demonstrate NATO’s operational readiness and ability to secure its airspace amid increased tensions in the Baltic region. The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Estonia is part of NATO’s Air Policing mission, which aims to protect the airspace of its eastern members. Since December 1, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) has operated four F-35A Lightning II fighters from Ämari Air Base. This deployment underscores the Netherlands’ dedication to NATO and the security of its allies in Eastern Europe. The F-35 program has been a cornerstone of the Netherlands’ air defense modernization strategy. The acquisition process began in the early 2000s when the Netherlands joined the Joint Strike Fighter program as a Level 2 partner, contributing significantly to the aircraft’s development. The first operational F-35A arrived in the Netherlands in October 2019 at Leeuwarden Air Base. By December 2021, the RNLAF declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its fleet, signaling readiness for limited combat operations. Initially, the Netherlands planned to acquire 85 F-35As to replace its aging F-16 fleet, but budget constraints later reduced the order. As of 2022, the Ministry of Defence expanded its plans, increasing the total to 52 aircraft. The first operational deployment of Dutch F-35s occurred in April 2022 when four jets were stationed in Bulgaria to support NATO’s enhanced Air Policing mission. The F-35A’s advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and electronic warfare capabilities have made it an essential component of NATO operations. Its introduction has significantly enhanced the RNLAF’s ability to detect, monitor, and respond to threats, particularly in high-tension areas like the Baltic. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans praised the rapid response of Dutch forces during the recent interceptions. 'This is why our people are there: to protect our collective airspace against Russian threats. As was once again evident on Friday, Russian forces are active in various ways near NATO airspace. Our allies in the Baltic states are pleased with our efforts. I am proud of our people who were able to immediately demonstrate their value to our security,' he said. The Baltic region remains a hotspot for military activity, with frequent incursions by Russian aircraft testing NATO’s readiness. These incidents underscore the importance of the QRA protocol, which allows NATO fighter jets to scramble within minutes to intercept and identify potential threats. The successful interception mission by Dutch F-35s highlights NATO’s resolve to protect its members and affirms the Netherlands’ role as a critical player in the alliance’s defense strategy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-dutch-f-35-fighter-jets-conduct-first-interceptions-of-russian-spy-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2024-12-09T06:59:02-08:00	
Peru Modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean 4x4 K808 IFVs and K2 Tanks to Replace Soviet-Era Vehicles	On December 9, 2024, in Lima, the Peruvian Army unveiled the K808 'White Tiger' armored personnel carrier during the celebrations of the Battle of Ayacucho and Army Day. In May 2024, Hyundai Rotem and STX were selected to supply 30 K808 'Baekho' wheeled armored vehicles to Peru under a contract valued at $60 million. This order marks the first export of South Korean armored vehicles to Latin America. Initially planned for 30 units, the contract could expand to a total of 120 vehicles depending on the future needs of the Peruvian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Peruvian Army modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean K808 'White Tiger' IFVs. (Picture source: Peru MoD) On November 16, 2024, also in Lima, Hyundai Rotem signed a second memorandum of understanding with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian Army’s weapons and ammunition factory, for the supply of K2 'Black Panther' main battle tanks. Although financial details and the exact number of tanks have not been officially disclosed, sources suggest that Peru plans to acquire approximately 100 K2 tanks to replace its aging fleet of T-55 tanks. This initiative is part of a broader modernization program for the Peruvian Armed Forces, aimed at strengthening their operational capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment. On December 9, 2024, three K808 'White Tiger' vehicles paraded, proudly displaying the Peruvian and South Korean flags, symbolizing South Korea's growing importance to the Peruvian Armed Forces and Peru’s commitment to modernizing its aging fleet. The fleet, still largely composed of Soviet-era vehicles such as the T-55 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), demonstrates the need for modernization. The BMP-1, developed in the 1960s, is equipped with a 73mm cannon and anti-tank missile launcher but is outdated in terms of armor and weaponry by current standards. This reliance on aging equipment underscores the necessity for Peru to upgrade its armored fleet to meet the demands of modern battlefields and provide better protection and operational effectiveness for its troops. Peru has shown an increasing willingness to diversify and modernize its armed forces by turning to Western partners. This trend was reinforced in September 2024 when the government included funding for 24 new fighter jets in the 2025 budget. Among the options considered, the French Rafale emerged as a favorite, outpacing competitors like the American F-16 and Swedish Gripen. In November 2024, this shift continued with the Peruvian Congress authorizing the entry of 600 U.S. military personnel to assist with security preparations for the 2024 APEC meetings, further strengthening military ties with the United States. This shift represents a notable departure from Peru’s historical reliance on Russian military equipment. In the 2010s, the country had considered acquiring T-90 tanks to replace its aging T-55s. However, in 2023, significant challenges in obtaining spare parts for its MiG-29 fleet highlighted the limitations of cooperation with Russia. While relations with Moscow persist, decisions made between 2023 and 2024 demonstrate Peru’s growing commitment to strengthening partnerships with Western nations to meet the demands of modernizing its armed forces and aligning with contemporary military standards. Discussions about the South Korean agreements began several years ago, supported by consistent diplomatic efforts. In 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sent a letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, celebrating 60 years of bilateral relations and emphasizing the potential for increased defense cooperation. Between 2023 and 2024, Peruvian military delegations visited South Korea to witness demonstrations of the K808’s capabilities in scenarios simulating mountainous operations and counterterrorism missions. The K808, also known as 'Baekho' (White Tiger), was designed in 2003 and has proven its reliability in the South Korean Army, with over 500 units delivered. Capable of overcoming 40cm obstacles, crossing 1.5-meter trenches, and navigating waterways with its jet propulsion system, it is well-suited to Peru's challenging geography. Its central tire inflation system (CTIS) and advanced mobility make it a strategic asset for the Peruvian Armed Forces. This contract is part of a broader modernization program for Peru's armored fleet, which is still heavily reliant on outdated main battle tanks such as the T-55 and AMX-13 from the 1950s. With this initial order, the long-term outlook is promising. STX and Hyundai Rotem are already in discussions for additional orders and expanded technical collaboration with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian state arms manufacturer. This partnership, which could span several years, enhances South Korea’s strategic presence in the Latin American defense market. A Hyundai Rotem representative reaffirmed the company’s commitment to leveraging its technological expertise to ensure the success of this collaboration and support Peru’s defense objectives in the years ahead. The partnership between Hyundai Rotem and FAME S.A.C. aims to establish a lasting collaboration, paving the way for future contracts and supporting Peru’s defense modernization efforts. This agreement also solidifies South Korea’s position as a competitive player in the Latin American defense market, aligning with its global strategy for growth in the defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-modernizes-armored-fleet-with-south-korean-4x4-k808-ifvs-and-k2-tanks-to-replace-soviet-era-vehicles	2024-12-09T06:51:39-08:00	
Royal Malaysian Navy starts Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 construction in Türkiye	On December 4, 2024, the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) officially commenced the construction of its Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) at Istanbul Shipyard in Türkiye. Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. This corvette is already operational in the navies of Türkiye and Pakistan, with additional ships currently under construction for the Ukrainian Navy. The Ada-class design supports multi-role operations, including anti-surface warfare (ASuW), anti-air warfare (AAW), asymmetric warfare (ASYW), and electronic warfare (EW).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. (Picture source: STM) Other options, including South Korea's HDC-2000 design by Hyundai Heavy Industries and Italy's FCX15 design by Fincantieri, were considered for the LMSB2 program. However, the Turkish Ada-class corvette design was ultimately selected for its operational performance, compatibility with Malaysia’s requirements, and its ability to integrate future naval subsystems from over 50 Turkish defense companies. STM, the project's main contractor, is responsible for all phases, including design, project management, material procurement, assembly, testing, and integrated logistics support (ILS). This marks Malaysia's first defense acquisition through a government-to-government memorandum of understanding (G2G) with another country. STM’s previous experience with Ada-class corvettes for Türkiye, Pakistan, and Ukraine likely influenced this decision. The Ada-class corvette was originally developed under Türkiye’s MILGEM program to meet requirements for anti-submarine warfare, patrol, and maritime surveillance. It features stealth technology, a low radar cross-section, and distributed sensors and weapons systems. The LMSB2 configuration integrates these capabilities while incorporating modifications to meet RMN’s operational needs. The LMSB2 project is a significant component of RMN’s efforts to enhance maritime capabilities, providing flexible operational capacity and effective security for Malaysia’s extensive maritime domain. The ships will feature a lot of systems from Turkish defense companies. Aselsan will supply the 3D surveillance radar, fire control radar, electronic support measures (ESM), and chaff decoy systems. Havelsan will provide the combat management and gun fire control systems. Surface-to-surface missiles (SSMs) will include Roketsan’s Atmaca, while the ships will also be equipped with two quad-packed vertical launch systems (VLS) for 16 Haegung surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) from South Korea’s Lig NEX1. Armament will include a 76mm main gun, a 30mm secondary gun, and decoy launcher systems. Other equipment includes navigation systems, electronic plotting tables, and communication systems. Each Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) vessel will measure 99.56 meters in length, have a displacement of approximately 2,500 tons, and accommodate 111 personnel. They will use a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion system with four diesel engines, providing a top speed of 26 knots, a cruising speed of 14 knots, and an operational range exceeding 4,000 nautical miles. The vessels will have an endurance of 14 days and feature a helipad and hangar for a 10-ton helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicles. Construction and outfitting are expected to conclude by the end of 2027, with delivery to RMN anticipated shortly thereafter. This project aligns with Malaysia’s naval modernization program, guided by the '15 to 5' Transformation Programme, which aims to consolidate RMN’s fleet from 15 classes to five core classes for improved operational and cost efficiency. Key acquisitions include Maharaja Lela-class frigates, Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels, Littoral Mission Ships (LMS), Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), and Scorpène-class submarines. The Maharaja Lela-class program advanced with the launch of KD Maharaja Lela in June 2024. RMN recently updated its transformation plan to address current maritime security challenges and regional threats. Malaysia's extensive maritime zones, including the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, and the Sulu Sea, are critical to its national security and economic prosperity. These waters, rich in natural resources, also serve as vital trade routes but face challenges such as territorial disputes, illegal fishing, smuggling, and piracy. RMN has identified a growing mismatch between its naval capabilities and the demands of effectively securing these areas. Many RMN vessels date back to the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in increased maintenance issues and reduced readiness. To address this, RMN plans to acquire 18 LMS to bolster patrol and surveillance across its maritime zones. These ships will support diverse missions, including anti-surface warfare, mine warfare, hydrography, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. In the South China Sea, Malaysia asserts its rights over its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and conducts oil and gas exploration through Petronas, despite objections from China. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has confirmed that these operations will continue alongside diplomatic discussions with China. RMN monitors the region and reports the situation as secure, according to Admiral Datuk Zulhelmy Ithnain. In the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia collaborates with regional partners through initiatives like the Malacca Straits Patrol to counter piracy and smuggling. In the Sulu Sea, Malaysia conducts joint patrols with Indonesia and the Philippines to combat transnational crimes such as piracy and kidnapping. These efforts combine diplomacy, security measures, and regional cooperation to manage Malaysia’s maritime zones effectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-malaysian-navy-starts-littoral-mission-ship-batch-2-construction-in-tuerkiye	2024-12-09T05:44:59-08:00

(Picture source: Russian social network) According to Sergey Lagodyuk, the Deputy Chief of the Belarusian General Staff, the Oreshnik system's deployment is a response to NATO's increasing military presence in Eastern Europe, particularly the planned stationing of U.S. and German missiles. Moscow and Minsk perceive these actions as an escalation of Western military encroachment, prompting them to bolster their defense posture. The Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile system is a relatively new and advanced addition to Russia's strategic missile arsenal. While full technical specifications are not fully disclosed, the system is expected to possess several key capabilities that make it a significant threat. First, it is an intermediate-range missile capable of striking targets between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, covering much of Europe and NATO's infrastructure. This range allows it to potentially target military installations, airfields, supply chains, and key government facilities across Europe, including NATO bases in the region. The missile system is designed for precision strikes, with capabilities akin to other advanced Russian missiles, such as the Iskander and Kalibr systems, but with a much longer reach. This increased accuracy makes the Oreshnik effective against high-value targets such as command centers, radar sites, and air defense installations. Additionally, the system is expected to be deployed on mobile launch platforms, which makes it more difficult to track and counteract by enemy forces. The mobility of the system allows it to be relocated quickly, reducing the likelihood of a successful preemptive strike by adversaries. The Oreshnik is also expected to have dual-warhead capabilities, meaning it can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads. This flexibility adds a strategic dimension to its deployment, offering Russia and Belarus a powerful tool for both tactical and strategic deterrence. It could be employed for conventional warfare scenarios or, in the event of heightened tensions, as a nuclear deterrent, thereby increasing its significance in Russia's military strategy. Moreover, it is believed that the Oreshnik missile system will be integrated with Russia's existing defense network, which includes advanced air defense missile systems like the S-400 and S-500, enhancing the system’s coordination and effectiveness within the broader Russian military framework. The deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus presents a significant escalation in the ongoing security challenges facing both Ukraine and Europe. For Ukraine, the proximity of Belarus means the Oreshnik system would be capable of targeting critical military positions, supply lines, and infrastructure deep within Ukrainian territory. This is especially concerning given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where Russia and Belarus are already highly involved. The deployment of such a system further solidifies the strategic alliance between Moscow and Minsk, increasing the threat to Ukraine’s defense capabilities. The system's presence also raises the specter of further Russian provocations, as it provides a powerful tool for deep-strike capabilities against Ukraine. The Oreshnik missile represents a new threat for Europe, with its intermediate range capable of striking key NATO military sites across the continent. The decision to deploy this missile system will likely be seen as a direct challenge to NATO, particularly as the United States and Germany move forward with their own plans to deploy intermediate-range missiles in the region. This growing missile presence on both sides could lead to heightened tensions and a renewed arms race in Europe. NATO’s immediate response may involve bolstering its missile defense systems and enhancing its military deterrence measures to counter the Russian threat. Another critical concern raised by the Oreshnik missile’s deployment is its nuclear capability. As the system can be equipped with both conventional and nuclear warheads, it could increase the likelihood of nuclear escalation in the event of conflict. This threat is particularly pertinent given the proximity of Belarus to NATO member states, which would place European countries and the U.S. within potential striking distance of the missile. Belarus, as a staunch ally of Russia, may become a key forward base for Russia’s nuclear deterrence strategy, further raising concerns over the stability of European security. The presence of such a weapon in Belarus could also lead to calls for NATO to adjust its nuclear posture, potentially leading to a new arms race between Russia and the West. The deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus is a strategic maneuver that will significantly impact the military dynamics in Europe and the broader geopolitical landscape. The growing missile capabilities of Russia and Belarus pose an increasing threat not just to Ukraine, but to the entire European security architecture. In response, NATO and its allies may be forced to take stronger measures to counter these new capabilities, further complicating an already tense security environment. As the Oreshnik missile system is slated to be deployed in 2025, this development will likely become a central issue in European defense policy, driving both military preparedness and diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-new-threat-to-europe-and-ukraine-with-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-deployment-in-belarus-by-2025	2024-12-08T02:50:50-08:00

Focus: US-made F-35 Stealth Fighter Demonstrates Unmatched Combat Capabilities in Israeli Strike Against Iran	Citing a report from the Simple Flying website, British Admiral Tony Radakin spoke at a Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) lecture in London about how Israel showcased the impressive performance and capabilities of the American-made stealth F-35 fighter jet during the recent airstrikes on Iran. This operation, which targeted over 20 key Iranian military sites, underscored the extraordinary combat capabilities of Israel's fleet of F-35I aircraft, confirming the jet’s role as an unparalleled asset in modern air combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Israeli Air Force F-35 stealth fighter jet demonstrates advanced capabilities in the recent strike on Iranian targets. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The raid, which took down missile-manufacturing facilities and critical air-defense systems, highlighted the F-35’s stealth, precision, and long-range strike abilities—key factors that allowed Israel to execute a high-stakes operation with minimal exposure to risk. Israel has now received around 40 of the 75 F-35I aircraft it ordered, and these advanced jets have proven pivotal in enhancing Israel's air superiority. The F-35I, an Israeli-specific variant of the F-35 Lightning II, has been customized with Israeli avionics, software, and systems, enabling the Israeli Air Force to carry out missions with exceptional precision and efficiency. With its combination of stealth technology, cutting-edge sensors, and advanced munitions, the F-35 has set a new standard for military airstrikes, as demonstrated in the operation that Radakin described. Israel’s F-35Is were central to the success of this high-stakes operation, showcasing the fighter’s advanced stealth features, which allowed Israeli jets to penetrate Iranian airspace without being detected by the country’s sophisticated air-defense systems. The F-35's low-observable design—featuring radar-absorbing coatings, advanced shaping, and internal weapons bays—made it virtually invisible to radar, even to Iran's advanced air-defense missile systems, such as the Russian-made S-300s. This allowed Israel to strike key targets deep inside Iranian territory without exposing their aircraft to the kind of risks that conventional fighter jets would face in a similarly contested environment. The F-35’s radar and sensor systems, particularly the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, also played a critical role in the operation. These sensors allowed Israeli pilots to detect and track targets from long distances, far beyond the range of many conventional radar systems. Combined with the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), which offers a 360-degree view of the battlefield, Israeli pilots could identify targets with remarkable accuracy and engage them from a safe distance. The precision of the airstrike was made possible by the F-35’s ability to carry out precision-guided strikes on a variety of targets. With its advanced weapon systems, such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and StormBreaker bombs, the F-35 can accurately strike even highly protected or deeply buried targets. These munitions are guided by GPS, infrared, and laser systems, ensuring they hit their targets with near-perfect accuracy. In this raid, Israel used fewer than 100 munitions to take out more than 20 military sites, emphasizing the high efficiency of the operation. This operational precision stood in stark contrast to other air campaigns, such as Russia’s strikes in Ukraine, where inefficiency and missed targets have been commonplace. The F-35’s stealth and precision capabilities were crucial in executing a mission where each strike needed to count. No aircraft got within 100 miles of the target in the first wave, yet nearly the entirety of Iran's air-defense system was dismantled. This highlights the F-35’s stand-off strike capability, where weapons can be deployed from a safe distance without compromising the safety of the aircraft or pilots. Beyond its combat and strike capabilities, the F-35’s advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems were pivotal in degrading Iran’s air-defense networks. These EW systems allow the F-35 to disrupt enemy radar, communication, and targeting systems, effectively blinding or misleading adversary defenses. As Admiral Radakin noted, the strike took down 'nearly the entirety of Iran’s air-defense system,' likely facilitated by the F-35’s ability to disrupt and neutralize these defenses before they could respond effectively. Iran’s acquisition of S-300 systems from Russia posed a significant threat to any aircraft attempting to strike Iranian targets. However, Israel’s F-35s used their superior electronic warfare capabilities to target and degrade these systems, making it possible to carry out the mission with minimal risk to the aircraft. The success of this operation also speaks to the multi-role versatility of the F-35. While primarily an air-to-air and air-to-ground combat aircraft, the F-35 also serves as a platform for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). During the strike on Iran, Israeli F-35s likely performed a variety of roles, from gathering intelligence to ensuring that each target was hit with precision and efficiency. The aircraft's ability to switch between strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare roles is a key reason for its operational effectiveness in high-stakes missions like this. The F-35’s ability to carry out surgical strikes on critical infrastructure while maintaining air superiority and disrupting enemy defenses makes it the ideal platform for modern military operations, especially in hostile environments where the enemy possesses advanced air-defense capabilities. The recent Israeli operation against Iranian targets has once again demonstrated the unparalleled combat capabilities of the F-35. With its combination of stealth, precision strike systems, advanced munitions, and superior electronic warfare capabilities, the F-35 has redefined the standards for modern air combat. Israel’s use of this advanced fighter jet highlights its significant technological edge and ability to project power with minimal risk and maximum precision. As Israel continues to expand its fleet of F-35Is, the aircraft will undoubtedly play a central role in future operations, setting a new benchmark in modern military aviation. The F-35’s performance in this operation serves as a clear demonstration of how advanced technologies—stealth, precision, and electronic warfare—are transforming military air operations and ensuring that air forces can meet the complex challenges of the modern battlefield with unprecedented effectiveness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-demonstrates-unmatched-combat-capabilities-in-israeli-strike-against-iran	2024-12-06T08:51:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukraine Intel Reveals Russia Can Produce 25 Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles Annually	On December 4, 2024, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine provided an important update regarding Russia's missile production capabilities, particularly focusing on the RS-26 Rubezh, the country’s intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia can now produce up to 25 units of RS-26 Rubezh each year, including its new Oreshnik variant. This new development highlights the growing production capacity of Russia's missile forces and their focus on strengthening their medium-range missile arsenals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Test fire at Kapustin Yar: Russia's RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik variants undergo critical testing at the Astrakhan region missile launch site, enhancing Russia's strategic missile capabilities. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The RS-26 Rubezh, at the heart of Russia's modern missile capabilities, represents a strategic shift in Moscow's approach to missile warfare. Its production plays a significant role in Russia’s efforts to counter NATO's missile defense systems. The Oreshnik, a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh, has been shrouded in controversy, particularly following its use in an attack on Ukraine's Dnipro River on November 21, 2024. The RS-26 Rubezh is a crucial missile for Russia’s defense strategy. Classified as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the RS-26 is designed to carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and has a range of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 km (2,175 to 2,485 miles). This puts it within the category of medium to long-range missile systems capable of striking targets across Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Russia has invested heavily in producing the RS-26 Rubezh and its variants. The missile is manufactured at high output and can produce up to 25 units per year, a significant increase from earlier periods. This production surge follows the technical experience gained from Russia's previous RS-24 Yars ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile) program, which has informed the development of the RS-26’s advanced features, including hypersonic speed and maneuverability designed to defeat modern missile defense systems. The controversy surrounding Russia’s missile capabilities deepened after an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on November 21, 2024. During the attack, Russian forces used what they claimed to be a 'new medium-range system' that President Vladimir Putin referred to as the Oreshnik. At the time, Ukrainian officials initially identified the missile used in the strike as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), but Putin contradicted this, announcing that the missile was a new addition to Russia’s missile arsenal, designed specifically for medium-range strikes. In contrast, American officials labeled the missile as 'experimental,' suggesting that while it may have been deployed operationally, the Oreshnik was still in an advanced testing phase. According to U.S. officials, the missile appears to be a non-nuclear, hypersonic ballistic missile, a designation that aligns with previous reports of its high-speed and maneuvering capabilities. These features make the missile extremely difficult to intercept, as it travels at speeds greater than Mach 5 (over six times the speed of sound) and can follow unpredictable flight paths to bypass missile defense systems. Despite these claims of a new missile type, the Oreshnik is widely regarded as a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh—with enhancements aimed at improving its hypersonic capabilities and range. The missile's inclusion in Russia’s operational arsenal is seen as part of a broader strategy to bolster its missile forces, specifically in response to NATO’s missile defense systems in Europe. Both the RS-26 Rubezh and its Oreshnik variant undergo testing at Russia’s key missile testing sites. These include Kapustin Yar, located in the Astrakhan region, which has long been a central hub for developing and testing Russia’s missile systems, including the RS-26 and its variants. Additionally, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk region plays a critical role in missile testing. Though better known for space launches, Plesetsk is integral to Russia’s missile development and operational readiness. The international community has responded with heightened concern over the deployment of the Oreshnik missile. The United States, in particular, has expressed its reservations, labeling the missile 'experimental' and underscoring the potential escalation of tensions. The missile’s hypersonic nature and non-nuclear profile make it a versatile tool for Russia’s military, capable of striking with precision while circumventing most conventional missile defense systems, including THAAD and Aegis. The attack on Dnipro has further fueled worries that Russia may be advancing its missile technology with a focus on bypassing traditional defense mechanisms. With its ability to target high-value military and infrastructure assets over a long distance, the RS-26 Oreshnik represents a serious threat in a region already facing significant instability. For NATO and the West, the growing production of intermediate-range ballistic missiles like the RS-26 Rubezh, and the operational readiness of the Oreshnik, highlight the urgent need to adapt and modernize missile defense capabilities to respond to Russia's evolving missile threats. Russia’s ability to ramp up production of the RS-26 Rubezh, including its Oreshnik variant, signals a major shift in the strategic landscape. With up to 25 units of the RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik expected to roll out annually, Russia is significantly enhancing its missile arsenal, increasing its ability to project power over long distances. As the Oreshnik variant enters the operational phase, the growing concern about its hypersonic and maneuverability features will continue to shape global security dynamics. The missile’s potential to bypass missile defense systems, along with its strategic and tactical flexibility, makes it a formidable asset in Russia’s military planning. For the West, this development calls for reevaluating defense strategies and missile deterrence capabilities as Russia’s missile forces continue to evolve rapidly. The geopolitical implications of this missile advancement will likely influence future arms control talks and shape the future trajectory of global missile defense systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-ukraine-intel-reveals-russia-can-produce-25-medium-range-ballistic-missiles-annually	2024-12-06T08:12:52-08:00

While effective, these systems are aging and have limited operational flexibility compared to newer technologies like the Javelin. The Javelin's fire-and-forget capabilities and extended range provide a modernized edge, aligning with Tunisia’s broader efforts to modernize its defense forces. Tunisia is navigating a multifaceted geopolitical landscape, with internal political challenges and regional instability shaping its defense priorities. The consolidation of power by President Kais Saied in 2021 led to strained relations with Western allies due to perceived democratic backsliding. Nevertheless, Tunisia has maintained critical partnerships, including those with the United States, which designated it as a major non-NATO ally in 2015. Additionally, Tunisia's defense modernization is shaped by its strategic need to counter threats from neighboring Libya, where ongoing instability continues to pose risks to national security. In terms of its foreign policy, Tunisia is striking a balance between traditional alliances and new partnerships. While maintaining ties with the European Union, particularly on migration and economic issues, Tunisia has expanded cooperation with countries like China, seeking to diversify its security and economic alliances. This dual-track strategy aims to enhance sovereignty and reduce reliance on any single bloc, reflecting Tunisia’s adaptation to evolving global dynamics. The Javelin missile system is a modern addition to Tunisia’s arsenal, offering capabilities that significantly surpass its current inventory. Designed as a man-portable fire-and-forget anti-tank system, the Javelin uses advanced infrared homing to engage targets effectively from distances of up to 4,000 meters. Its tandem-charge warhead is capable of defeating modern armor, including vehicles equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA), by employing a precursor charge to neutralize the ERA before the primary warhead penetrates the base armor. The Javelin’s lightweight design and advanced LWCLU enhance operational flexibility, allowing for deployment in various environments with minimal setup time. Its fire-and-forget capability ensures greater safety for operators, as they can relocate immediately after launch. These features make the Javelin particularly suited to Tunisia’s evolving defense needs, providing its forces with a modern and versatile tool to address a wide range of armored and fortified threats. This acquisition underscores Tunisia’s commitment to advancing its military capabilities in alignment with regional security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-supports-tunisias-military-modernization-through-strategic-javelin-anti-tank-missile-deal	2024-12-06T05:51:25-08:00	
Japan Increases Defense Ties with Coastal Radars and Patrol Vessels Supplies Under OSA Program	On December 2, 2024, a Japanese government source revealed that Japan would supply specific defense equipment to the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Djibouti under its Official Security Assistance (OSA) program. This program, launched in April 2023, aims to strengthen the defense capacities of nations that share Tokyo's strategic values. For the 2024 fiscal year ending in March, the government allocated a budget of 5 billion yen ($33 million) to support these four priority countries. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mitsubishi J/FPS-3 Coastal Surveillance Radar (Picture source: Mitsubishi) In 2024, Japan decided to allocate a significant portion of this aid to the Philippines, which faces escalating Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. Tokyo plans to provide advanced maritime surveillance radar systems to Manila to enhance detection and control capabilities in this strategic area. These systems will complement the J/FPS-3 coastal surveillance radar developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, delivered in 2023, which significantly improved the security of the Philippines' territorial waters. Amid recurring confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels, these new radars aim to ensure better preparedness and a swift response to incursions. Mongolia, due to its strategic location between China and Russia, is expected to receive systems including Primary Surveillance Radars (PSR) produced by NEC Corporation, capable of detecting aircraft without transponders, and Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSR), which identify equipped aircraft and provide precise data on their altitude and trajectory. These systems will enable Mongolia to enhance its airspace monitoring capabilities and guard against potential intrusions. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Djibouti could receive Shikishima-class patrol vessels, built by Japan Marine United Corporation (JMU), or equivalent models designed to ensure maritime security and protect strategic trade routes. These vessels aim to counter illegal maritime activities in Indonesian waters and strengthen security in Djibouti's vital maritime corridor. Since its launch in April 2023, the OSA program reflects a strategic shift in Japan's international security policy. This proactive initiative aims to bolster the defense capacities of its partners in the face of growing threats, particularly China's military expansion. Through this targeted assistance, Tokyo reaffirms its commitment to promoting a free and stable Indo-Pacific while consolidating regional alliances in an increasingly tense geopolitical context. Japan's arms policy, long defined by a strict pacifist stance, is rooted in Article 9 of its 1947 Constitution adopted after World War II. This article prohibits Japan from using war as a means of resolving international conflicts and restricts its military capabilities to strictly territorial defense. For decades, this approach translated into stringent restrictions on arms exports and an exclusively defensive role for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). However, the evolving regional security environment has gradually pushed Tokyo to reassess this policy. Faced with China's growing military power, North Korea's nuclear threats, and the rising strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, several key changes have marked this transition. In 1967, the 'Three Principles on Arms Exports' established a strict ban on selling arms to communist countries, nations under UN embargo, or those involved in armed conflicts. These restrictions began to ease in 2014 when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe adopted the 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment,' allowing limited exports to countries sharing Japan's democratic values. A major turning point occurred in 2015 with the adoption of the collective security law, allowing the SDF to intervene to defend allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked. This change broadened the strictly defensive framework of Japan's military action. In 2023, Tokyo launched the OSA program, designed to provide non-lethal defense equipment to allied countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, or Mongolia. This program aims to strengthen the defense capacities of partner nations while stabilizing the region amid China's military expansion. In parallel, Japan significantly increased its military budget, reaching 2% of its GDP in 2024, in line with commitments outlined in its 2022 updated national defense strategy. This record budget marks a paradigm shift for a country that traditionally capped its military spending at around 1% of its GDP. These transformations reflect Japan's intention to play a more active role in regional and international security while asserting its commitment to ensuring a free and stable Indo-Pacific. This strategic shift marks a break from its historical pacifist stance while remaining aligned with contemporary geopolitical challenges. Outside the OSA framework, Japan has also supplied defense equipment to several countries through bilateral cooperation or specific loans. In 2016, the Philippines received TC-90 training aircraft, initially leased and later transferred permanently in 2018, to bolster maritime surveillance in the contested waters of the South China Sea. In 2020, Japan delivered patrol vessels to Vietnam via a low-interest loan, followed by a 2021 agreement to expand the export of maritime surveillance systems. In 2022, Japan concluded an agreement with Thailand for technology transfers in the defense sector, though specific systems have not been disclosed. Regarding Ukraine, while Japan has not supplied lethal military equipment, it delivered civilian drones, bulletproof vests, and other non-lethal support equipment in 2022 and 2023, underscoring its commitment to supporting Kyiv within the constraints of Japan's constitutional restrictions. These initiatives demonstrate Tokyo's intent to contribute to international security while adapting to the specific needs of its strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/japan-increases-defense-ties-with-coastal-radars-and-patrol-vessels-supplies-under-osa-program	2024-12-06T05:44:38-08:00	
First capture of intact Podlet-K1 radar by Syrian rebels could threaten Russia's air defense effectiveness	As reported by Clash Report on December 4, 2024, Syrian rebels have achieved the first recorded capture of an intact Russian 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, taken during an offensive near Hama at the headquarters of the Assad regime's 25th Special Forces Division. The system, valued at approximately $5 million and integral to the S-300PMU-2 and S-400 air defense networks, could pose a significant threat to Russian air defense effectiveness if its technology is analyzed by adversaries.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. (Picture source: Clash Report) Similar systems lost in Ukraine, such as those destroyed in Kherson and Crimea, were not seized intact. While operational use by the rebels is unlikely due to technical complexity, the most effective way to exploit its capabilities would be through detailed analysis, which could reveal vulnerabilities in Russian air defense systems, an eventuality which raises concerns among Russian analysts about its potential transfer to entities like NATO or Ukraine. Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. This information could advance the development of countermeasures, refine electronic warfare tactics, and highlight weaknesses in Russian air defense systems. The Podlet-K1's ability to detect low-altitude cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and R-360 Neptune, underscores its strategic importance. The capture occurred during a broader offensive by opposition forces in Hama province, following their takeover of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. This offensive, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), marked the first opposition control of Aleppo since 2016. After capturing several military installations, including the 87th Brigade base and a tank school, HTS forces advanced toward Hama. Although they temporarily breached the city's defenses, counterattacks by pro-Assad forces, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias, forced the rebels to retreat. The offensive resulted in significant equipment losses for both sides. Rebels reportedly seized 31 Russian-made tanks, including T-72 and T-90 models, 20 BMP armored personnel carriers, and 12 122mm artillery pieces. Additionally, they captured a Pantsir-S1, a Strela-10, and an S-125 air defense system. These acquisitions have enabled expanded drone and missile attacks on regime targets. However, intense fighting led to the destruction of other equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, though specific figures remain unverified. Among the abandoned systems was a ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures, left by the regime’s 4th Armored Division on the Khanasir-Ithrya road. This system, one of two upgraded in the Adra workshop, was filmed after its abandonment. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, rebels captured eight L-39 Albatros light training and attack jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The MiG-23, powered by a Tumansky R-29B turbojet engine, can reach speeds of up to 2,500 km/h and is designed for interception and air-to-ground missions. While these aircraft represent strategic assets, their operational potential is constrained by maintenance needs, a lack of skilled pilots, and vulnerability to airstrikes. Ground tests were attempted, but technical issues and attacks on captured bases hindered further use. The Podlet-K1 system can detect aerial targets at ranges of 10 to 300 kilometers and altitudes up to 10 kilometers, tracking up to 200 targets simultaneously. Its modular design comprises three components mounted on a KamAZ-6350 8x8 chassis: an antenna post, a mobile command post, and a power generator. It employs a phased-array S-band radar and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) technology, enabling operations against low-flying and high-speed targets. The system's deployment and pack-up can be completed within approximately 20 minutes. The capture of the Podlet-K1 radar system has drawn comparisons to a 2020 operation in Libya, where U.S. forces, in cooperation with Türkiye, extracted a Russian Pantsir-S1 system. Speculation suggests the radar could be transferred to Türkiye, given its use of Russian S-400 systems. Alternatively, Russian airstrikes might target the radar to prevent its analysis, similar to actions taken in Ukraine following the loss of a Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UAV. Despite logistical challenges, the radar’s intact condition could facilitate technical study and aid in developing countermeasures against similar systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/first-capture-of-intact-podlet-k1-radar-by-syrian-rebels-could-threaten-russias-air-defense-effectiveness	2024-12-06T05:08:14-08:00

Breaking News: US Successfully Tests MACH-TB Hypersonic Flight to Accelerate Weapons Development	On December 5, 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announced the successful execution of a key flight test for the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed (MACH-TB), which took place in November 2024. The test, conducted by the Department of Defense’s Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, marks a significant milestone in the U.S. pursuit of hypersonic technologies. The MACH-TB is designed to advance the testing and development of hypersonic systems, providing crucial insights into the performance of cutting-edge weapons that could dramatically enhance U.S. military capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Testing the future of warfare: The MACH-TB hypersonic flight test accelerates the development of advanced weapons capabilities for the U.S. military. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The MACH-TB is a next-generation hypersonic flight test vehicle developed to accelerate the testing process for hypersonic systems across multiple branches of the U.S. military and other federal agencies. Its primary purpose is to provide a reliable, commercially launched platform capable of simulating and testing hypersonic conditions in real-world flight scenarios. By employing commercial launch services, the DoD aims to reduce the costs and time associated with testing hypersonic components while simultaneously increasing the testing frequency. Mr. George Rumford, Director of the TRMC, emphasized the value of this approach: 'Leveraging commercial launch services allows our Nation to test components early and frequently, accelerating hypersonic development affordably.' This approach not only helps expedite testing but also enables rapid feedback on the performance of hypersonic technologies, making it a critical enabler for developing advanced capabilities for U.S. forces. Hypersonic weapons are defined as those that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. These weapons are particularly notable because of their ability to maneuver while traveling at extreme speeds, making them highly difficult to track or intercept with current missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability creates significant strategic advantages for any military force capable of deploying them. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare is undeniable, as they offer a range of benefits. First, their speed and precision enable hypersonic weapons to strike targets at extreme distances in a fraction of the time compared to conventional missiles, potentially rendering existing defense systems obsolete. Second, unlike ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic weapons are capable of maneuvering in flight, further complicating interception efforts. Finally, their ability to penetrate heavily defended airspace provides a significant deterrent and strategic advantage during combat situations. The development of hypersonic technologies is, therefore, seen as a crucial part of the evolving global arms race, as nations seek to gain a technological edge on the battlefield. While the United States has made significant strides in hypersonic weapons development, it is far from alone in pursuing this advanced technology. China and Russia have emerged as key competitors, each heavily investing in hypersonic systems to bolster their own military capabilities. China has made rapid progress in developing hypersonic glide vehicles, such as the DF-17, which is capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. The Chinese military has also been investing in advanced launch platforms and testing mechanisms, with a focus on increasing the speed and range of their hypersonic systems. Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has aggressively pursued hypersonic weapons as part of its military modernization program. The country has already deployed hypersonic missiles like the Avangard, which is reportedly capable of reaching speeds up to Mach 27. Additionally, Russia has developed the Zircon missile, a sea-launched hypersonic weapon intended to target both naval and land-based targets at extreme speeds. Both China and Russia have demonstrated their capabilities through successful test flights, creating a sense of urgency in the U.S. military to advance its own hypersonic development programs. In addition to China and Russia, countries such as India, France, and Australia are also pursuing hypersonic technologies, each working to integrate these systems into their defense strategies. For the U.S. military and its allies, hypersonic weapons represent a paradigm shift in the way warfare could be conducted. The strategic advantages they offer are clear. Hypersonic weapons allow for near-instantaneous strikes, significantly shortening the response time to emerging threats and providing a new tool for rapid deployment of military force. They also can penetrate traditional missile defense systems. Systems like the U.S.-developed Aegis or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) are optimized for intercepting slower ballistic missiles, but hypersonic weapons, due to their high speed and unpredictable flight paths, present a much more difficult challenge for these systems to defend against. Additionally, hypersonic systems can be adapted to various platforms, from ground-based launchers to submarines and aircraft, allowing military forces to deploy these weapons in a variety of operational scenarios. Given their speed and range, hypersonic weapons could be used in a variety of theaters, from deterring regional conflicts to countering more sophisticated threats posed by adversaries with advanced air-defense systems. Therefore, the U.S. military's focus on hypersonics is not just about keeping pace with China and Russia but also about ensuring that it retains a technological edge that will be decisive in future conflicts.

Italian Navy to commission Trieste helicopter carrier as new flagship for amphibious task group	As reported by Mer et Marine on December 5, 2024, the Italian Navy is set to commission its new Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) Trieste, the largest combat vessel constructed in Italy since World War II. The commissioning ceremony will take place on Saturday, December 7, 2024, in the port of Livorno, with the attendance of Italian President Sergio Mattarella. The Trieste will replace the aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi, decommissioned on October 1, 2024, and will become the flagship of the Italian Navy's amphibious task group.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link At 245 meters in length and 33,000 tons displacement, the Trieste, a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) built by Fincantieri, will be the largest Italian naval vessel since World War II. (Picture source: Twitter/Nicholas Drummond) The development of the Italian Navy's Trieste landing helicopter dock (LHD) began under the 2014–2015 naval program, with Fincantieri awarded the construction contract in July 2015. Steel cutting commenced in July 2017, followed by the keel laying at Castellammare di Stabia in February 2018. The hull was launched in May 2019 and subsequently outfitted at Fincantieri’s Muggiano shipyard, with maintenance conducted at the Palermo facility due to space constraints. Initial sea trials were conducted in August 2021, with additional dockyard work at Trieste in late 2023. The vessel’s construction involved three shipyards and over 1,000 personnel during the assembly and outfitting phases. Delivery, initially expected by 2022, was delayed to December 2024. Once commissioned, Trieste will replace the Giuseppe Garibaldi and serve as part of Italy's amphibious task group, supporting multiple operational roles. At 245 meters in length and 33,000 tons displacement, the Trieste, a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) built by Fincantieri, will be the largest Italian naval vessel since World War II. The ship is equipped with a CODLOG propulsion system, combining two Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines, two MAN diesel engines, and two electric motors. This system allows a maximum speed of 25 knots and a range of 7,000 nautical miles at 16 knots. Its dual-island design separates navigation and flight operations management. The ship is configured to support F-35B aircraft and various helicopters, with a 230-meter-long flight deck featuring nine landing spots and two elevators with a 42-ton capacity each. Below deck, it includes a hangar and a garage providing over 4,500 square meters of space for vehicles, along with a floodable well deck for amphibious operations. The well deck can accommodate four LCMs, one LCAC, or other amphibious vehicles. The Trieste is armed with three 76mm guns, three remote-controlled 25mm turrets, and provisions for Sylver vertical launch systems capable of deploying Aster missiles. It also features advanced electronic warfare systems and multifunction radars. Designed for multipurpose operations, the ship can carry up to 1,064 personnel, including 450 crew members and 600 embarked troops. Its onboard facilities include a hospital with 27 beds, operating rooms, and radiology and dental services, with options for containerized medical expansions. The Trieste will replace the Giuseppe Garibaldi and serve as a versatile platform for amphibious and air operations, humanitarian assistance, and joint-command roles. The Trieste differs from the Giuseppe Garibaldi and Cavour aircraft carriers primarily in its design focus and operational roles. The Garibaldi was a smaller vessel at 180.2 meters with a displacement of 14,150 tons, specialized in anti-submarine warfare and air defense, operating Harrier jets and helicopters. The Cavour, slightly smaller than the Trieste at 244 meters and 27,100 tons displacement, is dedicated to air operations as an aircraft carrier. In contrast, the Trieste, at 245 meters and 33,000 tons displacement, is a multipurpose amphibious assault ship with a floodable well deck for landing craft, expanded facilities for troop transport, and significant medical capabilities. Unlike the primarily aviation-oriented Cavour and Garibaldi, the Trieste integrates amphibious, humanitarian, and joint-command operations. This vessel is part of a broader series of modernizations to strengthen the capabilities of the Italian Navy and address current maritime security challenges.

The program includes constructing four next-generation offshore patrol vessels, with the first delivery planned for 2027 and options for two additional ships. Additionally, the Navy has commissioned two FREMM EVO multipurpose frigates, featuring anti-drone systems, through a €1.5 billion contract with Orizzonte Sistemi Navali. Submarine capabilities are also being enhanced through the U212 Near Future Submarine (NFS) program, aiming for new deliveries by 2027–2029. The acquisition of additional F-35B aircraft for both the Navy and Air Force is included, aiming to expand the joint fleet to 115 aircraft. Operationally, the Trieste's role extends beyond military functions. It is designed to operate with NATO forces and act as an alternate platform for vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft operations when the Cavour aircraft carrier is unavailable. Therefore, it supports Italy’s goals of performing roles beyond territorial defense, such as addressing piracy and managing humanitarian emergencies. Recent activities include deploying the Cavour aircraft carrier to the Indo-Pacific and participating in Australia's Exercise Pitch Black, emphasizing collaboration with allied forces. The Navy also engages in security operations, exemplified by neutralizing a Houthi drone threat in the Red Sea and safeguarding international shipping routes. These developments underline the Navy's modernization efforts and its role in securing maritime interests in domestic and global contexts. The LHD Trieste will provide the Italian Navy with new capabilities, including a floodable well deck to deploy advanced landing craft, an expanded aviation deck capable of operating F-35B fighter jets and helicopters, and a modular hospital with facilities for treating critically injured patients. It is designed for amphibious operations, force projection, joint and inter-allied command, and logistical support. The ship also features advanced propulsion systems for improved range and endurance, along with electronic warfare and radar systems to enhance situational awareness and defense. These features position the Trieste to address both military and disaster response needs in current operational contexts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/italian-navy-to-commission-trieste-helicopter-carrier-as-new-flagship-for-amphibious-task-group	2024-12-05T02:41:14-08:00	
Syrian Rebels capture Syrian Army's most modern T-90A tanks in major offensive	As reported by Tendar on December 4, 2024, Syrian opposition forces have captured several T-90 and T-90A tanks, among the most modern combat vehicles supplied by Russia to the Syrian Army. These tanks, equipped with sophisticated firepower, protection systems, and mobility features, could significantly enhance the rebels’ combat capabilities. Their acquisition occurs amid an escalating conflict, where the Syrian Army is increasingly abandoning intact, modern Russian-supplied equipment during retreats, particularly following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Of the 30 T-90 and T-90A main battle tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been abandoned by the Syrian Army and captured by opposition forces. (Picture source: Twitter/Tendar and T-90K) During a recent offensive in Syria, opposition forces, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), captured significant quantities of Russian military equipment left behind by retreating Syrian government forces. To date, this included between six and eight T-90 and T-90A tanks, a Russian-made 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, a Buk-M2 air defense system, and one of two ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' vehicles equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system was also seized. Additionally, older systems such as T-72M and T-55 tanks, BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher, two BREM recovery vehicles (BREM-1 or BREM-2), and a 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer were captured. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, opposition forces seized eight L-39 Albatros light jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The range of equipment captured highlights the extent of material losses suffered by the Syrian Army. Among the captured equipment, the T-90 and T-90A tanks are particularly significant. Of the 30 T-90 tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been captured during this new offensive. Earlier incidents also reveal a consistent pattern of equipment loss. In 2016, a T-90A was captured by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham during clashes near Aleppo, marking the first documented instance of this tank falling into opposition hands. That unit has since been observed in various operations. Another T-90 was captured in 2020 during a government retreat. These incidents underscore vulnerabilities in securing advanced equipment during Syrian Army withdrawals. The latest captures occurred amid an offensive following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. This marked the first time opposition forces had taken control of Aleppo since 2016. The offensive, led by HTS, progressed into Hama province after capturing key installations such as the 87th Brigade base and a tank school. Despite breaching Hama’s defenses, opposition forces were eventually pushed back by counterattacks from Syrian government troops, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias. The captured T-90A tank provides Syrian rebels with notable combat capabilities due to its modern design and equipment. It is armed with a 125mm 2A46M-5 smoothbore gun, capable of engaging targets at distances up to 5 kilometers with precision, including while the tank is in motion. The tank supports the use of guided missiles and various ammunition types, including armor-piercing and high-explosive shells. Its fire control system, equipped with ESSA TPV thermal imaging and night vision devices, enhances target detection and engagement in low-visibility conditions, offering operational utility in nighttime or urban environments. The T-90A's armor includes Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, which is designed to reduce the effectiveness of anti-tank projectiles and missiles. The Shtora-1 active protection system is integrated to counter guided missile threats. Its 1,000-horsepower V-92S2 diesel engine supports mobility and maneuverability across diverse terrains. The compact design facilitates repositioning during combat. These features collectively enhance the tank's functional value for the rebels in scenarios where older or less capable armor is commonly encountered. The Syrian Army continues to face challenges in safeguarding its equipment during strategic retreats. The rapid advance of HTS and allied forces, combined with logistical constraints, has resulted in the abandonment of high-value assets. The Syrian military’s reliance on Russian-supplied systems, which are not fully integrated into its operational framework, further complicates its ability to manage withdrawals. Additionally, Russia’s focus on its own military commitments, including operations in Ukraine, has limited its capacity to provide immediate support to Syrian forces. These factors have contributed to repeated equipment losses, significantly impacting the Syrian Army’s overall operational capability. On the other hand, Syrian opposition forces have shown mixed capacities in effectively using captured tanks, including advanced models like the T-90A, against the Syrian Army. These capabilities are influenced by various factors, such as technical expertise, availability of spare parts, and tactical integration. Groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) have historically captured tanks during engagements, including T-55, T-72, and more advanced T-90A models. The T-90A, equipped with advanced thermal imaging, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, and a powerful 125mm smoothbore gun, poses significant challenges for opposition forces to maintain and operate due to its sophisticated systems. Nevertheless, there have been instances where such tanks were employed effectively, including a confirmed case in 2017 where HTS militants used a captured T-90A against government forces. Recent offensives, particularly in northwestern Syria, have also resulted in the capture of additional tanks abandoned by retreating Syrian Army units near Aleppo and Idlib. However, opposition forces often struggle with sustaining these platforms due to limited access to skilled operators, logistical challenges, and an inability to repair complex damage. The integration of captured equipment is further hampered by fragmentation among opposition groups, varying levels of military training, and reliance on external support for anti-armor operations. Despite these limitations, the use of captured tanks provides a significant psychological and tactical boost, enabling rebels to counter Syrian Army advances when deployed strategically.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/syrian-opposition-captures-syrian-armys-most-modern-t-90a-tanks-in-major-offensive	2024-12-05T02:22:38-08:00

Breaking News: Russian MiG-31I fighter jet with hypersonic missile in military exercise demonstrating new threats	On December 3, 2024, the Russian armed forces conducted significant military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean, showcasing the growing integration of hypersonic missile technology into their strategic arsenal. According to Russian Press Agency TASS reports, MiG-31I fighter jets from the Russian Aerospace Forces were deployed, carrying Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. This exercise demonstrates Russia’s commitment to enhancing its military capabilities and highlights the increasing role of hypersonic missiles in modern warfare. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian MiG-31I fighter jet armed with a Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) participating in military exercises over the eastern Mediterranean. (Picture source: Russia Zvezdanews) The Kinzhal missile, which translates to 'Dagger' in Russian, is an air-launched hypersonic weapon designed to deliver unparalleled speed, precision, and power. Capable of traveling at speeds up to Mach 10 and performing evasive maneuvers during flight, the Kinzhal is a formidable weapon against both static and mobile targets. With a reported range of approximately 2,000 kilometers, it has the ability to strike critical assets such as aircraft carriers, command centers, and strategic infrastructure with minimal warning. The deployment of this missile on MiG-31I aircraft enhances Russia’s ability to project power across key regions, including the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The MiG-31I is a specialized variant of the MiG-31 interceptor, adapted to carry hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal. Compared to the original MiG-31, which was designed primarily for high-altitude interception of enemy aircraft, the MiG-31I has been optimized for carrying and launching large payloads, including hypersonic weapons. While retaining the original’s exceptional speed—capable of reaching Mach 2.8—the MiG-31I also benefits from enhanced avionics and missile integration systems tailored to the operational demands of hypersonic missile deployment. This transformation significantly expands the aircraft's combat capabilities, making it not only a high-speed interceptor but also a strategic strike platform. The operational integration of the MiG-31I and Kinzhal missiles is a continuation of Russia’s hypersonic strategy. In October 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that MiG-31 fighter jets equipped with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles would begin patrolling the Black Sea. This announcement underscored Moscow’s intent to establish a robust hypersonic deterrent in a region of heightened geopolitical tension, signaling Russia's readiness to counter perceived threats and assert its influence over contested areas. The Russian armed forces also operate another air-launched hypersonic missile system in limited service: the GZUR (Hypersonic Guided Airborne Missile). While less publicized than the Kinzhal, the GZUR is designed for tactical roles and can be deployed from multi-role fighter jets, expanding the operational flexibility of Russia’s hypersonic arsenal. Together, these two systems—the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and the GZUR—form the backbone of Russia’s air-launched hypersonic capabilities, ensuring both strategic and tactical coverage in modern warfare. Hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal and GZUR are revolutionizing modern warfare by challenging existing defense systems and reshaping strategic paradigms. The extreme speeds of hypersonic weapons drastically reduce the reaction time available to adversaries, making them difficult to intercept with conventional missile defense systems. Their ability to maneuver mid-flight further complicates defensive measures, effectively rendering many current systems obsolete. The proliferation of hypersonic weapons has also intensified the global arms race. As Russia advances its capabilities, other nations, including the United States and China, are accelerating the development of their own hypersonic systems. This technological race not only raises the stakes in global power competition but also introduces new risks, including the potential for miscalculation or unintended escalation in conflict zones. The deployment of hypersonic missiles in active theaters, such as the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, also poses emerging threats. The dual-use capability of hypersonic weapons, which can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, adds ambiguity to their deployment. This uncertainty increases the risk of misinterpretation, particularly in high-stakes confrontations, potentially triggering disproportionate responses. Furthermore, the spread of hypersonic technology raises concerns about its potential acquisition by non-state actors, amplifying the threat to global security. Russia’s demonstration of its hypersonic capabilities in the Mediterranean is a clear message to both regional and global adversaries. By integrating advanced weapon systems like the Kinzhal and GZUR into its strategic arsenal and pairing them with high-performance aircraft like the MiG-31I, Moscow is not only solidifying its position as a leader in hypersonic technology but also reshaping the future of warfare. As these weapons continue to evolve, their role in military strategy is poised to grow, heralding a new era where speed, precision, and unpredictability define the battlefield.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-russian-mig-31i-fighter-jet-with-hypersonic-missile-in-military-exercise-demonstrating-new-threats	2024-12-05T01:26:23-08:00

As part of its latest military aid package to Ukraine, the United States will provide three land mine systems designed to enhance Ukraine’s ability to secure critical terrain and impede enemy movement. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ADAM 155mm (Area Denial Artillery Munition) is a precision-guided artillery shell designed to deploy anti-personnel mines over a wide area, creating rapid minefields for area denial. (Picture source: US RDECOM) These land mine systems include the M692/M731 Area Denial Artillery Munition (ADAM), the M131 Modular Pack Mine System (MOPMS), and the M136 Volcano mine-laying system. Each of these remotely delivered or manually deployed technologies offers unique capabilities: the ADAM delivers a rapid minefield using 155mm artillery, the MOPMS is a flexible, portable system for infantry use, and the Volcano is a vehicle-mounted dispenser capable of laying large-scale minefields over vast areas. Together, these systems will give Ukraine a powerful toolkit to fortify its defenses and slow the advance of Russian forces.1. M692/M731 ADAM: 155mm Area Denial Munition The M692/M731 ADAM is a 155mm artillery shell designed to deploy anti-personnel mines quickly across a broad area. This system, part of the U.S. Army's 'Family of Scatterable Mines' (FASCAM), was developed during the 1980s to enhance battlefield control by creating instant minefields. Each artillery round fired from a Howitzer delivers 36 mines, which are equipped with self-destruct features to minimize long-term risks to civilians. These mines either deactivate or self-destruct after a pre-determined period—typically 4 to 48 hours—ensuring that they do not pose a persistent threat once hostilities have subsided. Tripwires activate the mines in the ADAM system and feature a spherical warhead designed to create deadly shrapnel patterns. Upon activation, the warhead is launched to a height of 1 to 2 meters and detonates, releasing approximately 600 fragments that can incapacitate or kill enemy personnel within a wide radius. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance, addressing ongoing humanitarian concerns related to land mines.

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) 2. M131 MOPMS: Modular Pack Mine System The M131 Modular Pack Mine System (MOPMS) is a portable and flexible mine-laying system designed for rapid deployment by infantry or engineer units. It is primarily used for creating both anti-personnel and anti-vehicle minefields in various tactical scenarios. The system consists of modular packs, each containing a set of mines and components necessary for deployment. These packs are lightweight, typically weighing between 13 to 18 kg (30 to 40 pounds), allowing soldiers to carry and place them in the desired locations easily. MOPMS can deploy multiple types of mines, including M14 anti-personnel mines and M16 anti-tank mines. The mines can be configured to detonate either upon impact or after a set delay, providing tactical flexibility. The impact-triggered mines are designed to activate when a vehicle or personnel come into contact with them, while the timed mines can be set to explode after a specified delay, allowing troops to control the exact timing of the detonation. This feature enables military forces to adapt the minefield to the specific needs of the battlefield, such as blocking enemy movement, securing routes, or defending key positions. One of the key features of the MOPMS is that the mines it deploys are self-neutralizing. This means they either self-destruct or deactivate after a set period, which reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance harming civilians or friendly forces after the conflict. This self-destruct feature is an essential part of the system, addressing humanitarian concerns related to landmines in post-conflict zones. The system’s modular design also allows for flexibility in how it is deployed. Infantry units can manually place the mine packs in various configurations depending on the operational needs of the moment. Whether laying a minefield in dense forests, urban environments, or along critical choke points like roads or bridges, the MOPMS offers versatility in minefield creation. Furthermore, the system is compatible with military vehicles, enabling quicker deployment during larger operations. A U.S. Army vehicle-mounted M136 Volcano mine dispenser rapidly deploys a wide-area minefield, creating an effective barrier to block enemy movement. The system ejects mine canisters containing anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, dispersing them across a large area to deny access to critical routes and infrastructure. (Picture source U.S. DoD) 3. M136 Volcano: Vehicle-Mounted Mine Dispenser The M136 Volcano is a highly effective, vehicle-mounted mine-laying system designed to rapidly deploy anti-personnel and anti-tank mines across large areas. It is commonly mounted on various military vehicles, such as armored personnel carriers, engineering vehicles, and trucks, providing flexibility in deployment across different operational environments. The Volcano system uses M87 mine canisters, which hold up to six mines each. Depending on the configuration of the vehicle, the system can carry up to 24 canisters, allowing it to deploy a significant number of mines in a very short time. Once activated, the Volcano system rapidly disperses the mines in a predetermined pattern over a wide area, usually between 30 to 60 meters from the vehicle. This wide dispersion helps create a dense minefield that can block or disrupt enemy movement. The mines deployed by the Volcano include M14 anti-personnel mines and M15 anti-tank mines, both of which are designed to deny access to key areas, such as roads, fields, and critical infrastructure like bridges or supply routes. A critical feature of the Volcano system is its ability to set self-destruct or self-neutralizing functions for the mines. Each mine is equipped with a timer, ensuring that it either self-deactivates or self-destructs after a certain period—typically ranging from a few hours to several days—minimizing the risk of unexploded ordnance. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces long-term hazards to civilians or friendly forces once the immediate military need has passed. The system can be deployed from both ground and air platforms. While most commonly mounted on vehicles, it can also be delivered via helicopters, giving military commanders the flexibility to deploy minefields in a variety of terrains and scenarios. The Volcano can lay a minefield in just a few minutes, making it a highly efficient tool for creating instant area denial during combat operations. Tactically, the Volcano system is particularly valuable for halting enemy advances, especially in high-traffic areas like roads or chokepoints. The dense minefields it creates can slow down or halt both enemy infantry and armored vehicles, allowing friendly forces to secure key positions or gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, its rapid deployment and large mine-laying capacity make it a force multiplier for armored or mechanized units operating in concert with engineers. The provision of these mine-laying systems provides Ukraine with a broad range of options to disrupt and delay Russian forces. The ability to deploy mines remotely—either via artillery, vehicle, or infantry—gives Ukrainian forces flexibility in controlling and denying key terrain. These mine systems will be especially valuable in slowing Russian advances, protecting key infrastructure such as bridges and supply routes, and securing defensive positions. The U.S. has also ensured that these systems are 'non-persistent,' meaning that the mines will self-neutralize or self-destruct after a short time, reducing the risks to civilians after the mines' operational use. For Ukrainian commanders, the new systems significantly enhance their battlefield capabilities. The ADAM system provides rapid mine deployment over a large area, while the MOPMS and Volcano systems allow for more tactical, localized minefields. Together, these tools will help Ukraine to delay, disrupt, and inflict casualties on Russian forces, providing a force-multiplying effect on the battlefield. The addition of the ADAM, MOPMS, and Volcano mine-laying systems to Ukraine’s arsenal represents a strategic enhancement to its defensive capabilities. By providing both rapid, artillery-based and manual mine-laying solutions, the United States is enabling Ukraine to create powerful, flexible minefields that will impede enemy movements and protect vital positions. With these systems, Ukraine gains an important advantage in the ongoing conflict, ensuring that it can better control its territory and slow the advance of Russian forces while minimizing long-term humanitarian risks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-what-are-the-three-us-land-mine-systems-adam-mopms-and-volcano-for-ukraine	2024-12-03T08:57:56-08:00	
Focus: What is Lockheed Martin’s Secret X-59 Experimental Supersonic Aircraft?	This article explains the Lockheed Martin X-59, an experimental supersonic aircraft developed with NASA to address the disruptive sonic boom. Designed to make commercial supersonic travel over land possible, the X-59’s innovative technologies could also revolutionize military aviation, offering advanced stealth and high-speed capabilities. We'll examine the aircraft’s aerodynamic design, challenges, and potential to transform civilian and military aviation.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On January 12, 2024, NASA and Lockheed Martin publicly unveiled the X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft at a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The key to the X-59’s success lies in its unique aerodynamic design. Built by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works® division, the X-59 features an elongated fuselage and a specially designed long, pointed nose, which are critical to reducing the shockwaves that produce the sonic boom. These shockwaves are often heard as a loud, disruptive boom when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, especially near the ground. The X-59, however, aims to reshape those shockwaves into a softer, less noticeable 'thump', making the noise barely perceptible to the human ear. At the core of the X-59’s quiet supersonic flight technology is its ability to minimize the intensity of shockwaves that occur during the aircraft's supersonic passage. The aircraft achieves this through its unique design that ensures smooth airflow and minimizes disruptions that create noise. Its long, slender fuselage and forward-swept wings ensure that the aircraft flies efficiently at high speeds while reducing the loudness of any sonic disturbances. This quieter supersonic flight could open the door to a new era of high-speed air travel, making it possible for travelers to fly from New York to London in about three hours, halving the time of current commercial flights. On January 12, 2024, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works® marked a significant milestone in the X-59 program with a rollout ceremony held in Palmdale, California. This event celebrated not only the completion of the aircraft but also the culmination of years of research, development, and collaboration between Lockheed Martin and NASA. During the ceremony, John Clark, Vice President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works®, expressed his excitement about the project, stating, 'We’re thrilled to take on this challenge alongside NASA, whose quiet supersonic technology mission will have lasting, transformational impacts for people around the world. This project is just one example of the broader ingenuity of our industry as we continually strive to push the envelope of what’s possible.' The X-59 is a unique technology demonstrator aircraft, designed to generate a quieter, less disruptive sonic boom that would make supersonic travel over land feasible once again. The data collected from X-59 flight tests will be pivotal in shaping new aviation regulations for supersonic noise, which have traditionally been a barrier to commercial supersonic flight over populated areas. This data is expected to influence FAA and international regulators, potentially leading to the lifting of the ban on commercial supersonic flights over land, a restriction that has been in place since the retirement of the Concorde in 2003. While the primary focus of the X-59 is on commercial supersonic travel, its cutting-edge technology and aerodynamic innovations could have significant future applications in both the military and combat aviation sectors. The aircraft’s quiet supersonic flight capabilities may serve as a foundation for developing stealthier high-speed military aircraft. The X-59's low-noise supersonic flight is achieved by minimizing the shockwaves that lead to sonic booms, an approach that could be adapted to enhance the stealth capabilities of future military aircraft. A quieter supersonic jet would be harder to detect by enemy sensors, especially in high-speed combat scenarios where detection and evasion are critical. The ability to fly at supersonic speeds with reduced acoustic signatures would provide military aircraft with a distinct advantage, particularly in strike missions or reconnaissance over adversary territory. Moreover, the X-59's aerodynamic design, including its advanced wing and fuselage configuration, could significantly influence the development of next-generation fighter jets and bomber aircraft, where speed, agility, and stealth are paramount. The X-59's design's maneuverability and high-speed performance could provide valuable insights into optimizing future military aircraft for rapid, high-speed missions. The X-59’s advanced flight control systems, which ensure stability during high-speed flight, may also offer enhancements for future unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), contributing to more precise and efficient drone strikes or surveillance operations in hostile environments. Despite its remarkable promise, the X-59 faces the challenge of establishing new global aviation regulations allowing supersonic flight to resume over land. The current regulatory framework, established in the 1970s and reinforced by the Concorde’s retirement, bans commercial supersonic flights over land due to the disruptive impact of sonic booms. By generating a quieter, less intrusive sonic thump, the X-59 could prove that commercial supersonic flight is no longer an environmental burden, potentially leading to new international standards for acceptable supersonic noise levels. If successful, the X-59 could help set the foundation for the development of commercial supersonic airliners capable of providing faster-than-sound travel without disturbing people on the ground. It would also be a critical step in revolutionizing air travel by enabling airlines to offer shorter flight times, drastically reducing travel times between distant cities. The X-59 is a groundbreaking initiative in the field of supersonic aviation, and its successful development could bring about profound changes in the aviation industry. By overcoming the sonic boom challenge, Lockheed Martin and NASA are opening up new possibilities for supersonic air travel — ones that are faster, quieter, and more efficient than ever before. Beyond its civilian applications, the X-59’s innovative technologies could have major implications for military aviation, offering stealth and high-speed capabilities that could redefine modern combat strategies. As the X-59 moves into its flight test phase, it stands as a symbol of the future — a future where supersonic flight is not only a reality but one that is quiet, efficient, and transformational for both commercial and military aviation alike. With the world eagerly awaiting the X-59's test flights, this aircraft is setting the stage for the next generation of high-speed air travel and combat aviation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-is-lockheed-martins-secret-x-59-experimental-supersonic-aircraft	2024-12-03T08:29:45-08:00

Iran’s F-14 Tomcat era ends with the arrival of new Russian Su-35SE fighters	According to Flugrevue on November 29, 2024, Iran received its first two Sukhoi Su-35SE fighter jets from Russia as part of a deal to replace aging US-made F-14 Tomcat jets. These jets were officially handed over to the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) on November 18, 2024, during a private ceremony at the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant (KnAAPO). The two aircraft were transported disassembled on an Antonov An-124-100 cargo plane to Mehrabad Airport in Tehran. After arrival, they were moved to the 3rd Tactical Air Force Base near Hamadan for assembly. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Iran has also undertaken efforts to modernize its F-14 Tomcat fleet, originally acquired in the 1970s, to extend their operational capability until at least 2030. (Picture source: Airliners.net/Shahram Sharifi) Initially, the order was for 25 Su-35SE aircraft to replace the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF)’s US-made Grumman F-14A Tomcats stationed in Isfahan, but it was later expanded to 50 units to also replace F-4E Phantom II aircraft based in Hamadan. The negotiations for advanced Russian fighter jets date back to 2007 when Iran explored acquiring Su-30MKs. However, United Nations sanctions and Russian hesitations over Tehran’s nuclear program halted the potential deal. Renewed discussions in 2015 for Su-30SM jets, including a request for domestic production rights, were similarly unsuccessful. The eventual agreement for the Su-35SE was enabled by a combination of factors, including Russia’s need for Iranian drones like the Shahed-131 and Shahed-136 during the conflict in Ukraine. Following the lifting of UN restrictions on ballistic missile transfers in October 2023, Iran and Russia finalized the Su-35SE deal, which reportedly also included discussions about Iranian ballistic missiles and Russian Mi-28NME attack helicopters. The Su-35SE is a multirole fighter jet equipped with an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar and capable of operating at a maximum speed of Mach 2.25 with an operational range of 3,600 kilometers. It can carry a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, including R-37M long-range missiles.

The aircraft will be deployed to the 81st Tactical Fighter Squadron in Isfahan and the 31st Tactical Fighter Squadron in Hamadan. To accommodate these new aircraft, the IRIAF has constructed and is expanding reinforced hangars at the Hamadan base. In preparation for the Su-35SE, the IRIAF has been training pilots on Yak-130 advanced trainers, which were delivered in 2022. The first batch of Su-35SE pilot trainers is expected to graduate in December 2024, with further training conducted domestically using simulators and Yak-130 aircraft. The gradual integration of the Su-35SE into the IRIAF will coincide with the decommissioning of the last operational F-14A Tomcats, which have been plagued by spare part shortages and reduced availability. The IRIAF plans to have 25 operational Su-35SE jets by the end of 2025, with deliveries continuing through the late 2020s to complete the 50-unit order. (Picture source: Russian social media) Reports from October 2024 indicate that Iran has secured a license to domestically produce Su-30 and Su-35 aircraft under an agreement likely reached during the BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia. The production target is 48 to 72 Su-35 jets, while the number of Su-30 units remains unspecified. These developments align with Iran’s efforts to modernize its fleet and establish a more self-reliant defense industry. The IRIAF plans to have 25 operational Su-35SE jets by the end of 2025, with deliveries continuing through the late 2020s to complete the 50-unit order. In addition, Iran continues to operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, including U.S.-made F-14 and F-4 jets, Russian MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft, and domestically produced platforms such as the HESA Saeqeh and Kowsar.

The Su-35SE is a 4.5-generation multirole fighter featuring thrust-vectoring engines, the Irbis-E radar capable of tracking multiple targets at extended ranges, and advanced avionics. In contrast, Iran's F-14AMs are upgraded versions of the 1970s-era F-14A Tomcats, incorporating domestic avionics and compatibility with various missiles, including the R-73E and AIM-54A. While these upgrades have extended the operational life of the F-14AMs, they do not match the technological advancements of the Su-35SE. Therefore, the integration of the Su-35SE is expected to substantially enhance Iran's air combat proficiency and overall military effectiveness. Iran has also undertaken efforts to modernize its F-14 Tomcat fleet, originally acquired in the 1970s, to extend their operational capability until at least 2030. This program includes upgrades to avionics, radar systems, and weaponry, allowing the aircraft to carry various air-to-air missiles, such as the domestically produced Fakour-90, derived from the AIM-54 Phoenix. Modifications also enable precision strike roles, supporting ordnance payloads of up to 3,000 kg. Despite challenges posed by international sanctions and the aging of original components, Iran has maintained around 10 operational F-14s through domestic engineering and reverse-engineering methods. Russia and Iran have increased their military cooperation, transitioning from a supplier-client relationship to a more reciprocal partnership. Their collaboration includes joint military operations, such as their support for President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, along with intelligence sharing and coordinated strategies. Iran has provided drones and ballistic missiles to Russia, reportedly used in the Ukraine conflict. The two countries are negotiating a new bilateral defense agreement, with plans for Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian to visit Russia to finalize it, although the date remains undetermined. Both nations appear to align strategically against Western influence while seeking to enhance their military capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/irans-f-14-tomcat-era-ends-with-the-arrival-of-new-russian-su-35se-fighters	2024-12-03T02:01:10-08:00

The South China Sea has long been a region of geopolitical tension, with overlapping territorial claims between China, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian nations. The Philippine government has been increasingly concerned about China's assertiveness in the region, and it has seen frequent encounters with Chinese naval and coast guard vessels. The presence of a Russian submarine further complicates the security landscape, especially given Russia and China’s growing military cooperation, including joint naval exercises conducted in the region. While the Ufa 490 was not directly involved in any conflict, its presence adds to the complexity of regional security, signaling a broader international interest in the South China Sea. The Kilo-class submarine, to which the Ufa 490 belongs, is one of the most advanced and stealthiest diesel-electric submarines in service today. Known for its relatively quiet operation, the Kilo-class has been a key asset for the Russian Navy since the 1980s. The submarine is 74 meters long, 9.9 meters wide, and has a draught of 6.2 meters. It is designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and reconnaissance missions. The Ufa 490 is equipped with advanced sonar systems and can carry a variety of torpedoes for both defensive and offensive purposes. Its quiet operation makes it difficult to detect, an important feature for strategic patrols in contested waters like the South China Sea. Despite being a diesel-electric boat, the Kilo-class has proven effective in a variety of operational environments, especially in anti-submarine roles, thanks to its ability to operate covertly for extended periods​. For the Philippine Navy, the sighting of the Ufa 490 underscores the importance of maintaining vigilance in its maritime zones. The BRP Jose Rizal, one of the Philippine fleet's newest and most advanced ships, was tasked with monitoring the Russian submarine’s movements. The Jose Rizal is a Jose Rizal-class frigate equipped with modern combat systems, including surface-to-air missiles, radar systems, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities. These capabilities enable the frigate to detect and track submarines, providing the Philippine Navy with a credible defense against underwater threats. The Jose Rizal is equipped with a sonar system, capable of detecting submerged threats, and also has the ability to deploy anti-submarine missiles and torpedoes. In addition, the frigate can operate in conjunction with other maritime assets, including aircraft, to enhance its surveillance and response capabilities in situations like the one involving the Ufa 490​. The Philippine Navy’s enhanced monitoring and tracking of foreign military assets in the South China Sea is part of its broader efforts to safeguard its national interests, particularly its maritime territories and vital shipping lanes. Tensions in the region have been exacerbated by China’s growing presence, as well as its continued militarization of disputed islands. In response, the Philippines has strengthened its defense ties with the United States and other regional partners, such as Japan and Australia, conducting joint military exercises and modernizing its naval forces. This collaboration includes upgrading the Philippine Navy’s capabilities in anti-submarine warfare, which is seen as essential for countering not just Chinese naval forces, but also other foreign military activities in the region​. The incident involving the Ufa 490 serves as a reminder of the strategic importance of the South China Sea, both in terms of natural resources and its role as a key shipping route. As geopolitical dynamics evolve, the Philippines will continue to monitor foreign naval activity closely, ensuring that it is prepared to defend its waters and uphold its maritime rights in this increasingly complex and contested region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-philippine-navy-tracks-russian-submarine-in-south-china-sea-amid-growing-regional-tensions	2024-12-02T05:15:24-08:00	
French Army Successfully Tests Thales' New Generation SMK-Eco 120 mm Rifled Smoke Munitions	On November 30, 2024, Thales announced the successful completion of the first dynamic firings of its new-generation 120 mm rifled smoke munition, the SMK-Eco, developed in-house. These tests, conducted on November 30, 2024, exceeded the initial requirements, marking an important step toward the operational deployment of this munition in line with the company’s societal and environmental commitments. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Thales 120mm SMK-Eco Rifled Smoke Munition (Picture source: French MoD) Fully developed with internal funding, Thales’ smoke munition is designed to be fired from a rifled mortar, whether towed or mounted on the 2R2M system. This new generation of munitions allows for the rapid creation of a dense and effective smoke screen on the battlefield, providing essential strategic coverage to support frontline forces and protect troops on the ground. The rifled design of the munition ensures increased stability and accuracy during firing, thereby optimizing its operational effectiveness. Development of the SMK-Eco began in January 2022, with a focus on reducing the environmental impact of smoke munitions. After the prototyping phase completed in the summer of 2023, the first laboratory tests were carried out in September 2023. In March 2024, Thales initiated dynamic field trials with partner military units. These tests, completed in July 2024, confirmed the performance and reliability of the SMK-Eco, particularly its ability to generate a dense and stable smoke screen. The SMK-Eco is a 120 mm rifled munition designed to be fired from the 2RM mortar system. It utilizes eco-friendly chemical compounds, reducing toxic emissions and post-use residues. The rifled design enhances in-flight stability, ensuring better accuracy and uniform smoke coverage. These features enable the SMK-Eco to provide effective coverage while minimizing its ecological footprint in operational areas. The SMK-Eco uses smoke agents based on environmentally friendly chemical mixtures. Unlike traditional smoke munitions that often rely on halogenated compounds or other toxic substances, the SMK-Eco incorporates non-toxic smoke agents such as glycol-based and biodegradable resin mixtures. These agents produce dense and persistent smoke while reducing the emission of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. This formulation allows for effective coverage without compromising the health of soldiers or damaging local ecosystems. Thales designed the SMK-Eco smoke munition not only to deliver optimal military performance but also to minimize its environmental impact. A key aspect of this approach is the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions generated during the combustion of propellants and smoke agents. Below is an overview of Thales’ efforts to limit the CO₂ weight emitted by the SMK-Eco and the technologies employed to achieve this. The SMK-Eco uses specially formulated chemical propellants designed to burn cleaner than traditional propellants. These low-emission propellants are based on advanced organic compounds that optimize combustion, thereby reducing the amount of CO₂ produced per munition. Although precise figures on the CO₂ weight emitted per shot are not publicly available, Thales claims that the SMK-Eco propellant formulation allows for a significant reduction in emissions compared to conventional smoke munitions. This reduction is achieved through more complete combustion and the use of less carbon-intensive chemical materials. Compatibility with the 2RM mortar system, introduced in September 2023, allows for seamless integration of the SMK-Eco into military operations. The 2RM, renowned for its versatility, facilitates the rapid deployment of the smoke munition across various terrains. The SMK-Eco is scheduled to enter service in the first quarter of 2025, providing armed forces with a reliable and sustainable coverage solution that complies with strict environmental standards. Thales emphasizes the importance of sustainability in the development of the SMK-Eco. By incorporating biodegradable materials and eco-friendly manufacturing processes, Thales meets international environmental protection standards. This initiative is part of the company’s overall strategy to balance military performance with environmental responsibility, thereby reinforcing its position as an innovative leader in the defense sector. As a reminder, the return to high-intensity warfare requires infantry to be equipped with armored combat vehicles possessing sufficient firepower to support future mechanized brigades and tactical groups. Thales’ 120 mm rifled mortar system (2R2M) perfectly meets this need by offering exceptional mobility and optimized firing and movement capabilities. Highly automated, the 2R2M allows for semi-automatic loading and firing of 10 rounds per minute, ensuring operational efficiency from the first salvo. Additionally, its advanced design guarantees a very high level of crew protection, enhancing safety in combat zones. The 2R2M stands out for its improved accuracy, being three times more precise than a traditional smoothbore mortar, and for its maximum range of 8 to 13 kilometers. This increased accuracy allows for effective neutralization of enemy targets while minimizing the risk of accidental fires. Tested in the field across various operational theaters, the 2R2M has already been adopted by six NATO member countries, with over 170 systems deployed as part of military operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/french-army-successfully-tests-thales-new-generation-smk-eco-120mm-rifled-smoke-munitions	2024-12-02T05:13:13-08:00

USS Zumwalt stealth destroyer to become first hypersonic missile warship in US Navy	As reported by the Associated Press on November 30, 2024, the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), the lead ship in the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers of the US Navy, is currently being modified at Huntington Ingalls Industries' shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The ship is undergoing an upgrade to integrate the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) missile system, which will make it the first US warship capable of deploying hypersonic weapons. This modification involves replacing its original Advanced Gun System (AGS) with four large-diameter missile tubes, each accommodating three hypersonic missiles, for a total capacity of 12 missiles per ship.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), the lead ship in the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers of the US Navy, is currently being modified to provide the United States with the ability to execute precision-guided conventional strikes globally within one hour. (Picture source: US DoD) Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII)’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division has played a significant role in the modernization of Zumwalt-class destroyers. On August 29, 2023, it was awarded a $154.8 million contract to upgrade the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000), including the integration of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system. This follows earlier contracts, including a $10.5 million award in January 2023 for the modernization planning of USS Zumwalt and USS Michael Monsoor (DDG 1001). HII has also been involved in outfitting Zumwalt-class destroyers with advanced Mk 57 vertical launch systems under a $74 million contract awarded in April 2024. Leveraging nearly $1 billion in infrastructure investments, HII continues to enhance the combat capabilities and technological sophistication of these stealth warships. The Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) program, initially referred to as Prompt Global Strike, is designed to provide the United States with the ability to execute precision-guided conventional strikes globally within one hour. CPS utilizes technologies such as hypersonic glide vehicles and surface-, air-, and submarine-launched missile platforms. Potential delivery systems include rockets akin to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic cruise missiles, and kinetic weapons launched from orbit. A key objective is to address rapid-response scenarios and expand options beyond nuclear strikes. Testing milestones include the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon's 2011 flight, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body tested in 2020, and integration plans for Zumwalt-class destroyers in 2024. Design measures aim to differentiate CPS from nuclear systems to mitigate risks of misinterpretation by adversaries. The CPS upgrade program involves multiple defense contractors. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor responsible for final missile assembly, which takes place in Courtland, Alabama, integrating components manufactured by Northrop Grumman and Dynetics. Northrop Grumman builds the missile boosters and payload module, while Dynetics constructs the hypersonic glide body. Funding and oversight for the program are managed by the DDG-1000 Program Office. However, the cost of these systems has raised concerns. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that producing and maintaining 300 hypersonic missiles over 20 years could cost nearly $18 billion, averaging $60 million per missile. Critics argue that the expense may exceed the value of many potential targets. Proponents counter that hypersonic weapons extend operational range and precision beyond the reach of conventional systems, providing an advantage in contested environments. The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a guided missile destroyer and the lead ship of its class, named after Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. It displaces 14,564 tons, measures 600 feet in length, and is powered by an Integrated Power System generating 78 MW, enabling speeds of 33.5 knots. Initially equipped with two 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems designed for Long Range Land Attack Projectiles, the cancellation of ammunition rendered the guns inoperable, leading to a shift from land attack to surface warfare. The vessel features 80 Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launch System cells for various missiles, a radar cross-section designed for reduced detection, and an automation-focused design for a smaller crew. Commissioned in 2016, the Zumwalt has undergone modifications, including the planned replacement of the Advanced Gun Systems with hypersonic missile launch systems during a modernization period that began in 2023. The Zumwalt-class destroyers were conceived during the DD-21 program, launched in the 1990s, as a 21st-century solution for naval fire support, a role previously filled by battleships. The program aimed to develop multi-mission warships with a focus on land attack, anti-surface warfare, and reduced radar detection, aligning with Congressional mandates for enhanced naval firepower. Due to rising costs and evolving military priorities, the program was restructured into the DD(X) initiative, and the number of planned ships was reduced from 32 to 3. At an estimated total program cost of $22.5 billion, the Zumwalt-class represents a shift toward smaller, more technologically integrated fleets, as well as an attempt to balance technological innovation with fiscal and operational challenges, amid a global race for the hypersonic superiority. In fact, hypersonic capabilities are now considered essential by the United States for maintaining strategic parity with competitors such as Russia and China, who have made significant advancements in this field. China tested its DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle between 2014 and 2016, reportedly entering service by 2019 along with other hypersonic weapons like the DF-27 and the YJ-21. Russia has pursued analogous technologies, including the Avangard hypersonic weapon system, which began series production in 2018, and the OPreshnik, recently used in Ukraine. Concerns about strategic stability and misidentification have been raised internationally, particularly by Russia, which has responded with upgraded missile defenses, precision weapons, and continued strategic nuclear modernization.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uss-zumwalt-stealth-destroyer-to-become-first-hypersonic-missile-warship-in-us-navy	2024-12-02T03:04:14-08:00

US Navy's future F/A-XX sixth-generation fighter to address current gaps in strike and air superiority	As reported by Zona Militar on November 27, 2024, the US Navy is advancing towards the development of the F/A-XX, its sixth-generation fighter program, to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler while complementing the F-35C in carrier air wings. The program is being developed independently of the US Air Force’s Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative, as Rear Adm. Michael Donnelly, director of the Air Warfare Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, recently stated that the F/A-XX is focused on affordability, versatility, and multirole functionality, differing from the NGAD program’s focus on air superiority.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F/A-XX will operate within carrier air wings as part of the US Navy’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) family of systems, cooperating with unmanned aircraft. (Picture source: Boeing) The US Navy has chosen a propulsion strategy for the F/A-XX based on derivative engine technology rather than the adaptive-cycle engines under development for the Air Force’s NGAP initiative. This approach aligns with the Navy’s specific operational needs and aims to mitigate risks associated with unproven technologies. According to Donnelly, this decision reduces the likelihood of delays and cost overruns that have affected other programs, maintaining consistency with the Navy’s overall acquisition strategy. The F/A-XX is being designed as a multirole aircraft capable of fulfilling air-to-surface missions while retaining air-to-air capabilities. This design reflects the Navy’s preference for platforms that can address multiple mission scenarios within the existing carrier air wing structure. Although some analysts have raised concerns about potential gaps in the Navy’s deep-strike capabilities, particularly in the absence of a replacement for the retired A-6E Intruder, the Navy maintains that the F/A-XX will meet its long-range strike and fleet defense requirements. The platform is expected to integrate with unmanned systems, such as the Boeing MQ-25 Stingray, as part of a move toward incorporating hybrid air wings combining manned and unmanned systems. Initial concepts included both manned and unmanned variants, but the current focus is on a fully manned design.
