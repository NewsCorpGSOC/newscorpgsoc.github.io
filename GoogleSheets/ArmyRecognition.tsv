NATO Surveillance Mission French Aircraft Faces Russian Hostility in Baltic Sea	As reported by Le Figaro, a high-tension incident occurred on January 16, 2025, during an aerial surveillance mission over the Baltic Sea. A French Navy Atlantique 2 (ATL2) operating under NATO's framework was targeted by Russian forces while conducting a surveillance flight in response to recent undersea cable damage. The French Armed Forces General Staff confirmed this event, which an AFP journalist witnessed firsthand onboard the aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Atlantique 2 is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) The aircraft departed Brittany earlier that day and was tasked with inspecting approximately 200 vessels operating in international waters near Sweden and the Baltic states. During the mission, the plane encountered electronic jamming and was designated by a fire-control radar, a procedure known in military terms as ' illumination.' According to Colonel Guillaume Vernet, spokesperson for the General Staff, this act signals hostility, even though it is not uncommon in this strategically sensitive region. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions. It is an evolution of the Breguet Atlantic, featuring advanced operational capabilities, robust endurance, and notable maneuverability. Its bilobed fuselage houses a pressurized cabin and a large weapons bay, supporting its versatility.

Its armament includes AM39 missiles, MU90 torpedoes, and laser-guided bombs, supported by a 12-member crew handling systems, intelligence, and mission execution. The professionalism of the French crew was pivotal in preventing escalation despite the heightened tensions. Colonel Vernet emphasized that Russia’s radar illumination aimed to express restrained hostility, stopping short of direct military action. An attack on a NATO aircraft would have risked triggering a severe and uncontrollable escalation with the Alliance. This incident occurs amid growing suspicions of sabotage targeting critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Over recent months, several undersea communication and power cables have been damaged. On December 25, the EstLink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia, along with several telecommunication lines, were compromised shortly after similar events in Swedish waters. Finnish authorities suspect Russian involvement and have seized the Eagle S, a tanker under the Cook Islands flag, allegedly part of a Russian 'ghost fleet.' General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, described the event as 'serious,' noting that such provocations are not confined to Europe. Experts, including former military aviator Xavier Tytelman, highlighted the risks of miscalculation or immediate responses in such situations, which could inadvertently lead to significant escalation. Despite these provocations, the ATL2 completed its mission without identifying suspicious vessels. However, the incident underscores the persistent confrontations in the Baltic region, where hybrid warfare tactics and intimidation measures are prevalent. NATO continues to heighten its vigilance, reflecting the ongoing challenges to maritime security and regional stability posed by geopolitical rivalries. The Baltic Sea has long been a hotspot for tensions between Russia and NATO member states, characterized by frequent interceptions of military aircraft. Russian planes, such as Su-27 Flankers and Il-20s, often operate without flight plans or active transponders in international airspace, complicating their identification and endangering air safety. In response, NATO interceptors, including German and British Eurofighters, are routinely deployed to escort these aircraft out of the area. While these encounters are typically handled professionally, they exemplify the heightened geopolitical strains fueled by the Ukraine conflict and intensified military activities on both sides.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/nato-surveillance-mission-french-aircraft-faces-russian-hostility-in-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T00:09:01-08:00

The missile, which has been in development for several years, is part of a broader strategy to enhance Iran's ability to deter and defend against maritime threats. These new launcher units will be integrated into both the Iranian Navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy, providing a new layer of operational flexibility and reach for the country’s defense forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new mobile launcher unit for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship missile, delivered to the Iranian Navy on January 16, 2025, enhances Iran's naval strike capabilities with increased mobility and operational flexibility (Picture source: X Account Hamid) First unveiled in August 2020, the Abu Mahdi cruise missile is a domestically developed long-range anti-ship weapon with a striking range of over 1,000 kilometers. Named after the influential Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the missile has been designed to deliver both anti-ship and land-attack capabilities, providing Iran with a versatile tool to challenge naval forces operating in its strategic waters. One of the most significant features of the Abu Mahdi missile is its long range, which at over 1,000 kilometers, is approximately three times the range of Iran's previous most capable anti-ship missiles, such as the 350 km Raad missile and the 300 km Qadir missile. This substantial increase in range allows Iran to project its power much further, complicating the ability of adversaries to operate near its coastline. The Abu Mahdi missile is equipped with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)-powered guidance, which allows it to perform advanced maneuvering in-flight, avoiding radar detection through low-altitude flight patterns and unpredictable course alterations. These features make the missile particularly effective against heavily defended targets such as aircraft carriers and naval vessels equipped with advanced air defense systems. This combination of long-range capabilities and high precision makes the Abu Mahdi a formidable tool in Iran's naval arsenal. The newly delivered mobile launcher units will allow the Abu Mahdi missiles to be deployed quickly and efficiently from various locations, enhancing their operational flexibility. These launchers can fire multiple missiles at short intervals and from diverse fixed and mobile platforms, enabling Iranian forces to strike multiple targets simultaneously and with a variety of attack trajectories. The dual-mode seekers on the Abu Mahdi, which combine both active and passive radar homing systems, are designed to ensure high precision even in the face of electronic warfare attempts. The integration of mobile launchers with the missile system further complicates adversaries' attempts to neutralize Iran's capabilities. The delivery of these launcher units significantly extends Iran's naval deterrence capabilities. With the Abu Mahdi missile, Iranian forces now possess a weapon that can strike enemy ships from a distance well beyond their shores, effectively forcing foreign military assets, such as aircraft carriers, to stay at least 1,000 kilometers from Iranian waters. This ability to deny access to large swathes of the Persian Gulf and beyond significantly alters the regional naval balance of power. As Iranian defense officials have emphasized, the Abu Mahdi missile is a crucial component of Iran's strategy to defend its maritime borders and exert influence over the Strait of Hormuz, through which a substantial portion of global oil shipments pass. The missile's advanced guidance systems and ability to operate from various platforms, including coastal installations and ships, further enhance its role in Iran's defense strategy. The importance of anti-ship missile capabilities for Iran cannot be overstated, especially in the context of its current strategic environment. Iran is located in a region where maritime security is a constant concern, with the strategic Strait of Hormuz being a chokepoint for global oil transport and a focal point for international tension. In recent years, Iran's adversarial relations with Israel have intensified, with both countries accusing each other of hostile actions and interventions. Israel's growing presence and alliances in the region, particularly in the Mediterranean and around the Gulf, have heightened Iran's concerns over its maritime sovereignty and the security of its critical oil exports. In this volatile context, the Abu Mahdi missile system represents a crucial component of Iran's broader military strategy to deter any foreign military intervention, particularly by Israel and its allies. With the ability to strike naval assets at ranges previously beyond Iran's reach, these missiles bolster Tehran’s strategic posture, allowing it to challenge the naval superiority of regional adversaries, including Israel, and create a formidable defense against any attempts to restrict its maritime access. The Abu Mahdi missile, with its ability to target enemy vessels from a distance and evade advanced radar systems, ensures that Israel and other regional powers would have to stay far out of range to avoid devastating strikes. This increases the deterrence effect, complicating any military planning and making any potential naval engagement in the Persian Gulf a highly risky endeavor. The successful integration of mobile launchers into Iran's naval strategy underscores the increasing sophistication of its military assets, positioning it as a formidable maritime force in the Middle East. The delivery of these mobile launchers for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship cruise missiles represents a major leap in Iran's naval defense capabilities. Iran has significantly bolstered its deterrence capabilities by enhancing its range, precision, and flexibility of its missile forces, making it better positioned to defend its territorial waters and project power in the region. With these new assets in place, Iran’s military is now more capable of challenging foreign naval forces and asserting its dominance in the strategically vital waters of the Persian Gulf.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-strengthens-anti-ship-arsenal-with-new-mobile-abu-mahdi-missiles-launchers	2025-01-16T08:23:52-08:00

US Expresses Concern Over Pakistan's Development of Long-Range Ballistic Missiles	During a speech delivered on December 19 at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Jon Finer, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor, described Pakistan’s ballistic missile program as an 'emerging threat' to the United States. He highlighted that Pakistan is developing advanced missile technologies, such as high-powered rocket engines, which could eventually enable Islamabad to strike targets well beyond its region, potentially including the U.S. territory. This statement underscores the growing strain in U.S.-Pakistan relations, already fraught with tensions exacerbated by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and Washington's closer strategic alignment with India. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Shaheen-III long-range ballistic missile (Picture source: IISS) Pakistan’s ballistic missile arsenal, traditionally focused on regional deterrence against India, has undergone significant modernization in recent years. Among its systems, the Shaheen-III, still in development, is the longest-range missile in Pakistan’s inventory, with a range of 2,750 kilometers. Designed to target strategic areas such as India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this two-stage, solid-fueled missile can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads. Its mobility, provided by a Chinese transporter-erector-launcher, enhances its strategic flexibility. Speculation suggests it may eventually be equipped with multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to counter missile defenses. This modernization effort is bolstered by close technical cooperation with China and past collaborations with North Korea and Iran. Despite these advancements, U.S. officials assess that Pakistan’s ability to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of targeting the U.S. homeland remains years away. However, they express concern over the broader implications of Pakistan’s efforts for regional and global stability. On December 18, a day before Finer’s speech, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned National Development Complex, which plays a central role in missile development. Three additional entities were sanctioned for supplying critical materials for the program. These measures aim to curb the proliferation of missile technologies, although U.S. proposals for confidence-building measures, such as telemetry data sharing and test range limitations, were rejected by Islamabad. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in a statement issued on December 19, neither confirmed nor denied the development of long-range ballistic missiles but defended its strategic capabilities as essential for safeguarding sovereignty and maintaining peace in South Asia. The ministry also accused the U.S. of discriminatory practices undermining nonproliferation efforts and exacerbating regional military imbalances. This development signals a potential shift in Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence doctrine, historically focused on countering India. Such advancements may indicate ambitions to extend its strategic reach beyond the region, potentially complicating global nonproliferation efforts and contributing to a broader arms race. Meanwhile, India continues to develop its long-range missile systems, including the Agni-V with a range exceeding 5,200 kilometers, and is working on the Agni-VI to counter China’s capabilities. U.S. accusations regarding Pakistan’s missile program highlight a significant decline in bilateral relations once characterized by strategic cooperation. These revelations and subsequent sanctions intensify geopolitical tensions in South Asia, raising questions about Islamabad’s long-term strategic goals. As mutual distrust deepens, the prospect of a broader arms race threatens to reshape the regional and global strategic balance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-expresses-concern-over-pakistans-development-of-long-range-ballistic-missiles	2025-01-15T06:59:41-08:00	
Russian Navy’s Grisha-Class Corvette Neutralizes Naval Drones in Pacific Fleet Exercises	According to information published by национальная служба новостей on January 14, 2025, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the small anti-submarine warfare (ASW) ship Ust-Ilimsk, part of Project 1124 Al'batros, successfully neutralized unmanned surface and aerial drones during recent exercises. The drills took place in Avacha Bay, a key maritime zone of the Pacific Fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Grisha-class corvette Ust-ilimsk. (Picture source: Russian MoD) During the exercise, the crew detected high-speed targets approaching the entrance to Avacha Bay, home to a critical base for the Pacific Fleet. Upon identification as unmanned surface vessels, the crew engaged and destroyed the targets using heavy machine guns and automatic weapons. Aerial drones were similarly intercepted at low altitudes using the ship’s AK-630 artillery system, a rapid-fire weapon designed for close-range defense against small and fast-moving threats. The Ust-Ilimsk demonstrated its versatility during the operation, employing its advanced arsenal to secure the fleet’s operational zones. The vessel, part of the Pacific Fleet, is specifically designed for anti-submarine warfare but is also well-suited for countering aerial and surface threats. Its armament includes a range of systems such as the Osa-MA air defense system, AK-630 and AK-176 artillery, torpedoes, and the RBU-6000 'Smerch-2' rocket launcher. These capabilities allow the ship to address modern challenges posed by unmanned systems, which are increasingly used in global naval operations. Drone threat The Russian Navy has encountered an unprecedented set of challenges stemming from Ukraine’s strategic and innovative use of drone technology in the ongoing conflict. Unmanned systems, particularly drones, have emerged as a key factor in naval warfare, reshaping the dynamics of power projection and maritime security. The Black Sea, long considered a strategic stronghold for Russia, has become a theater for showcasing the disruptive potential of drones. Ukraine has effectively weaponized unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and aerial drones to target Russian naval assets and infrastructure. These drones have been employed to great effect in precision strikes, surveillance, and as a psychological tool to unsettle Russian naval operations. One of the most notable incidents involved a Ukrainian sea drone destroying a Russian Mi-8 military helicopter near Crimea, underscoring the lethality and operational flexibility of unmanned platforms. Moreover, persistent drone attacks have compelled the Russian Navy to relocate many of its ships from Sevastopol in Crimea, a critical naval hub, to ports like Novorossiysk. This strategic withdrawal highlights the profound impact that drones have had on the operational calculus of one of the world’s most formidable naval forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-navys-grisha-class-corvette-neutralizes-naval-drones-in-pacific-fleet-exercises	2025-01-15T06:44:41-08:00

Pakistani Dutch relations Since the 1960s, the Netherlands has been involved in development cooperation with Pakistan, focusing on areas such as water management, education, and governance. This collaboration laid the groundwork for broader bilateral relations, including defense. An aspect of Dutch-Pakistani defense relations is naval cooperation. In the early 1980s, the Royal Netherlands Navy introduced the Alkmaar-class minehunters, known internationally as the Tripartite-class. These vessels were a product of a collaborative effort between France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In 2021, the Netherlands agreed to transfer two of these minehunters, HNLMS Haarlem and HNLMS Middelburg, to Pakistan. The ships were transported to Pakistan in late 2022. High-level visits have further strengthened defense ties. In October 2024, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Chief of the Naval Staff of Pakistan, visited the Netherlands. During his visit, he met with senior Dutch military officials, including Vice Admiral René Tas, Commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy, and Vice Admiral Boudewijin Boots, Deputy Chief of Defence. Discussions focused on enhancing bilateral naval collaboration, joint exercises, and training exchange programs. Admiral Ashraf also visited the DAMEN Shipyard and a Zeven De Provinciën-class frigate. Foreign built ships The Pakistan Navy’s fleet includes several foreign-built warships, with countries like China, Turkey, the Netherlands, France, and the United States. From China, the Navy has added multi-role Tughril-class and Zulfiquar-class frigates, both equipped for a range of missions, including anti-surface and anti-submarine operations. China has also supplied Azmat-class fast attack craft, designed for coastal defense and swift engagements, and Hangor-class submarines. Turkey has provided MILGEM-class corvettes, primarily for anti-submarine and patrol operations, and collaborated on the construction of the fleet tanker PNS Moawin, used for logistical support and extended missions. The United States transferred the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate PNS Alamgir, originally built for the U.S. Navy, to Pakistan as part of a military assistance program.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/damens-pns-yamama-empowers-pakistan-navy-to-secure-exclusive-economic-zone	2025-01-15T05:32:07-08:00

For example, monthly output of 155mm projectiles has risen from 14,400 to 40,000 units, representing a 178% increase. Other key systems, such as HIMARS and PAC-3 MSE missiles, have also seen significant production expansions to meet both current and long-term demands. European nations have equally stepped up their contributions. France and Sweden have announced plans to double their capacity for ammunition and explosive loading by 2025, while Germany and other European countries are establishing new facilities to produce up to 700,000 artillery shells annually by 2025. In Romania, a new gunpowder factory funded through a European Commission project is set to enhance the continent's supply chain further. Collaborative efforts extend beyond Europe, with initiatives like the Czech-led €1.7 billion consortium to source 500,000 artillery rounds globally by the end of 2024. The European defense industry’s Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) aims to increase annual ammunition shell production to 2 million units by 2025, covering critical components such as explosives, powders, and testing. Ukraine’s domestic defense industry has also seen remarkable growth. The country has increased its annual production of mortar and artillery ammunition from 1 million to 2.5 million rounds in just one year. International partnerships, such as those between Ukraine and companies like Northrop Grumman, Rheinmetall, and the Colt CZ Group, are further driving co-production efforts. These collaborations include the establishment of ammunition factories, maintenance centers, and production lines for critical defense components. Scaling up munitions production for Ukraine has revealed several significant challenges, underscoring the complexities of rapidly increasing defense manufacturing capabilities in response to modern conflicts. Among the most pressing issues are bureaucratic delays. Many governments and defense firms face lengthy approval processes for contracts and export licenses, creating bottlenecks in the supply chain. Additionally, fragmented policies among European Union member states complicate coordinated efforts, further delaying critical deliveries. Supply chain disruptions remain another major hurdle. The global shortage of key raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and rare-earth elements, has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Countries relying on imported components, including explosives and propellants, find themselves vulnerable to international trade instability, which has driven up costs and limited access to necessary resources. The absence of long-term contracts between governments and defense manufacturers further undermines efforts to scale up production. Manufacturers need multi-year agreements to justify investments in new facilities or technologies, but uncertainty surrounding the conflict's duration has made governments hesitant to commit. This short-term focus hinders the development of sustainable production capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/how-nations-are-scaling-up-munitions-production-for-ukraine	2025-01-14T04:23:11-08:00

Japan Plans to Acquire Kamikaze Drones to Strengthen Its Position in East China Sea	The Japanese military is preparing to integrate kamikaze drones into its arsenal for the first time, signaling a significant evolution in its military strategy. The Ministry of Defense announced that approximately 310 small attack drones will be introduced during the 2026 fiscal year. According to the Japanese newspaper The Sankei Shimbun on January 12, 2025, operational tests are underway with models manufactured in Israel, Australia, and Spain, with a competitive bidding process set to determine the final selection. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kamikaze drones could strengthen the defense of the vulnerable Nansei Islands between Kyushu and Taiwan (Picture source: Arquimea) These kamikaze-type drones, equipped with explosives, are designed to destroy specific targets such as armored vehicles and small vessels. This strategic move aligns with the evolution of modern conflicts, where drones have played a central role, as evidenced by recent warfare in Ukraine. Their autonomous and destructive capabilities provide high operational efficiency at a relatively low cost, a crucial advantage in asymmetric or prolonged conflicts. Japan faces an increasingly tense regional environment and aims to bolster its defensive posture in response to potential threats from neighboring countries. China has intensified military activities in the region, particularly around contested areas in the East China Sea, while North Korea continues to advance its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. In this context, kamikaze drones could play a pivotal role in reinforcing the defense of the Nansei Islands, a strategically important archipelago extending between Kyushu and Taiwan, which remains particularly vulnerable to incursions. Integrating these drones into the infantry units of the Ground Self-Defense Forces (GSDF) will not only modernize Japan’s operational capabilities but also reduce reliance on combat and reconnaissance helicopters. These traditional assets, which are costly and require extensive maintenance, will be gradually replaced by drones, offering a more flexible and practical solution for current needs. The Japanese government has allocated 3.2 billion yen in the 2025 fiscal budget to fund this acquisition. This initiative aligns with the objectives outlined in three key security documents adopted in December 2022, which emphasize the development of defense capabilities relying on unmanned systems. The Ministry of Defense plans to invest approximately 1 trillion yen over five years, starting in 2023, to expedite the deployment of drones and other advanced technologies. These unmanned systems also address Japan’s demographic challenges. Declining birth rates and early retirements within the Self-Defense Forces have reduced available personnel. By automating dangerous missions, drones minimize risks to human lives and help mitigate workforce shortages. Kamikaze drones also present economic advantages. Their acquisition costs are lower than traditional weaponry, and their deployment does not require extensive operator training. This pragmatic approach optimizes military expenditures while enhancing operational effectiveness. The modernization effort extends beyond the GSDF. The Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces are also advancing their respective drone programs. These include advanced reconnaissance drones, larger offensive drones transportable by vehicles, and logistics drones capable of operating in isolated or contested areas. These systems diversify Japan’s military capabilities, enabling quicker and more effective responses to emerging threats. Japan’s acquisition of kamikaze drones carries significant geopolitical weight. By modernizing its military capabilities, Tokyo sends a clear message to both regional partners and rivals: it is committed to defending its interests and taking a more proactive role in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific region. This approach aims to deter potential aggression while supporting allies, particularly the United States, in ensuring regional stability. However, this decision may also be perceived as a military buildup, potentially drawing criticism from neighboring countries, particularly China. Such perceptions could lead to increased regional tensions and further accelerate military development programs among Japan’s neighbors, contributing to an arms race in the region. The introduction of kamikaze drones into Japan’s arsenal marks a significant step in the transformation of the Self-Defense Forces. These unmanned systems, both efficient and cost-effective, provide Japan with tools to address contemporary security challenges while optimizing its human and material resources. This initiative reflects a comprehensive strategy to modernize military capabilities while adapting to demographic and budgetary constraints. As regional tensions continue to escalate, these drones offer Japan a means to strengthen its defense and contribute actively to the security of the Asia-Pacific. How this move will impact the balance of power in the region and provoke responses from other nations remains to be seen.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/japan-plans-to-acquire-kamikaze-drones-to-strengthen-its-position-in-east-china-sea	2025-01-14T03:25:40-08:00	
Slovakia Reconsiders Military Modernization Plans and Considers Swedish CV90120-T Light Tanks	Slovakia is revisiting its military modernization strategy, with Defence Minister Robert Kaliňák confirming that the country is considering alternatives to the initially proposed Leopard 2A8 main battle tanks. The consideration of CV90120-T light tanks or fire support vehicles comes in response to the high costs associated with acquiring fully-equipped main battle tanks. This shift in focus reflects both budgetary constraints and operational objectives linked to NATO commitments.

Flash Info: Denmark Plans Major Arctic Defense Boost with New Vessels Patrols and F-35 Fighter Jets in Greenland	On January 10, 2025, Denmark unveiled a comprehensive plan to significantly boost its military presence in Greenland, a strategically critical Arctic territory that has become the center of geopolitical attention due to growing interest from the United States. According to Danish TV channels DR and TV2, this expansion is primarily motivated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's continued focus on Greenland, underscoring its importance for U.S. security interests in the Arctic region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kangerlussuaq Airport in Greenland: A Strategic Hub for Military Operations and Future F-35 Deployments. (Picture source: Wikimedia) In response to U.S. ambitions, Denmark has proposed the purchase of two new Arctic inspection vessels to replace its aging fleet of four vessels currently operating in the region. These vessels are crucial for monitoring Greenland’s vast maritime borders, which span more than 2.1 million square kilometers, an area four times the size of France. The new ships will be better equipped to handle the demanding Arctic conditions, enhancing Denmark’s surveillance capabilities in a region that is increasingly becoming a hotspot for geopolitical rivalries. Alongside the new vessels, Denmark also plans to increase its dog sled patrols from the current 12, reinforcing its surveillance network across Greenland's rugged and ice-covered terrain. Dog sled patrols, although limited in reach, offer unmatched access to remote areas that are difficult to navigate with conventional vehicles. By expanding these patrols, Denmark aims to strengthen its monitoring and response capabilities in some of the most challenging environments on Earth. A key element of Denmark's military modernization involves the proposed upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport, a former U.S. military base in western Greenland. The plan includes making the airport capable of accommodating advanced F-35 fighter jets, a move that would significantly enhance Denmark’s air surveillance and rapid-response capabilities in the Arctic. Kangerlussuaq's strategic location near Greenland’s western coast, along the shortest route from North America to Europe, has long made it an attractive site for military operations. With the upgrades, Denmark would be able to deploy state-of-the-art aircraft for air patrols, surveillance, and deterrent operations, further bolstering its defense capabilities in the region. As part of its overall strategy to strengthen surveillance and intelligence in the Arctic, Denmark has committed $400 million to improve its long-range drone capabilities. These drones will be deployed to cover the vast, remote expanses of Greenland, providing critical real-time intelligence on military movements, environmental changes, and potential threats. This investment will help Denmark maintain a strategic edge in an increasingly contested region, especially as the Arctic's rapidly changing climate opens new shipping routes and access to natural resources. The ability to track and monitor these developments is essential to safeguarding Denmark's interests in the area. This strategic military buildup comes in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated remarks about Greenland's geopolitical importance. Trump has long expressed interest in Greenland, even suggesting in 2019 that the United States should purchase the island from Denmark. While this proposal was firmly rejected by both Denmark and Greenland’s leadership, Trump has continued to view Greenland as a critical asset to U.S. security. His recent statements in early January 2025 reaffirmed his belief that controlling Greenland is essential for U.S. national security. While not explicitly advocating for the island's purchase this time, Trump’s rhetoric signals an ongoing effort to assert U.S. influence in the Arctic, a region that is increasingly pivotal due to resource exploration, military competition, and climate change. Denmark, which holds responsibility for Greenland’s defense and security, has historically maintained limited military capabilities on the island. The existing forces include aging inspection vessels, a Challenger surveillance plane, and dog sled patrols, all tasked with monitoring a vast and inhospitable territory. These resources, though functional in the past, have proven insufficient to address the growing security concerns in the Arctic. The Danish government has acknowledged this limitation and, under increasing pressure, has begun to modernize its defense infrastructure to ensure Greenland’s protection in the face of rising external threats. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, is strategically located at the heart of Arctic geopolitics, a region where nations like Russia, Canada, and the United States are vying for influence. Denmark’s military investments reflect a concerted effort to secure Greenland’s sovereignty while preserving its semi-autonomous status. The island’s vast resources and strategic location make it a highly contested area, and as the U.S. seeks to bolster its military presence in the Arctic, Denmark faces the challenge of balancing its sovereignty over Greenland with maintaining strong defense ties to NATO, particularly with the U.S. In conclusion, Denmark's plan to invest in modernizing its military infrastructure in Greenland marks a crucial step in ensuring the island’s defense amidst growing geopolitical tensions. The proposed acquisitions of new Arctic inspection vessels, the expansion of dog sled patrols, and the upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport to accommodate F-35 jets demonstrate Denmark’s commitment to strengthening its Arctic defense. These measures not only respond to Donald Trump’s renewed interest in Greenland but also acknowledge the changing dynamics in the Arctic, ensuring Denmark remains a key player in the region's security as global powers vie for control over its resources and strategic assets.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-denmark-plans-major-arctic-defense-boost-with-new-vessels-patrols-and-f-35-fighter-jets-in-greenland	2025-01-14T02:39:35-08:00

Recently, the 3rd Combat Helicopter Regiment (3e RHC) conducted an initial experiment integrating an FPV drone aboard a Gazelle helicopter. The drone was remotely piloted from the helicopter, marking a significant step toward effective collaboration between manned and unmanned platforms. The experiment pursued two key objectives: enhancing reconnaissance and combat support capabilities while testing the concept of 'air-launched devices' (ELA). This concept involves deploying drones for kinetic or non-kinetic missions at distances of 20 to 50 kilometers from the host helicopter. These drones could eventually operate in synergy with future Guépard helicopters, developed under the HIL program, which will gradually replace the Gazelle fleet. The FPV drones tested stand out for their agility and their ability to provide real-time video feeds to the operator through a virtual reality (VR) headset. Although specific details about the drones used have not been disclosed, images show an operator aboard the Gazelle using typical commercial drone control equipment adapted for military applications. Tactical uses include urban reconnaissance, target identification, guiding precision strikes, as well as electronic jamming or laser designation for artillery. Another crucial aspect is the compatibility of these drones with existing artillery systems, such as the Nexter CAESAR self-propelled howitzer. Drones could enhance intelligence loops by offering target acquisition and destruction capabilities at long range, thereby shortening the time between detection and action. In parallel, in January 2025, the French Army presented the DT-46 drone, a versatile platform designed for reconnaissance and tactical support missions. This convertible drone, weighing less than 30 kilograms, can take off vertically with its four rotors before transitioning to horizontal flight, covering distances of up to 100 kilometers with an endurance of five hours. Its ability to be assembled in 15 minutes and operated by a small team of four highlights its adaptability. Equipped with a retractable electro-optical turret, it is designed to meet the demands of modern combat environments. General David Cruzille, commander of the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT), highlighted that this initiative aligns with a combined employment doctrine for helicopters and drones, conceived 15 years ago but only now feasible due to technological advancements. This approach aims to reduce risks for crews while enhancing operational capabilities in complex and hostile environments. However, General Pierre Schill, Chief of Defense Staff, emphasized the continued importance of manned platforms. According to him, manned helicopters remain essential, particularly in scenarios involving disrupted communications or operations requiring rapid and adaptive human decision-making. These experiments represent the beginning of a broader transformation. With the goal of full 'drone enablement' by 2040, the French Army aims to develop innovative solutions that will redefine aerial operations in Europe and beyond. The integration of drones with manned platforms promises to improve mission effectiveness while reducing costs and risks to personnel. The test involving Gazelle helicopters and FPV drones is a critical step toward this future. It demonstrates the potential of drones as tactical force multipliers while laying the groundwork for an operational doctrine suited to contemporary challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/france-relies-on-fpv-drones-to-redefine-role-of-its-gazelle-combat-helicopters	2025-01-14T02:22:34-08:00	
Will three new ships deployed by Sweden prevent attacks on underwater infrastructure?	According to information published by Associated Press on January 12, 2025, Sweden will contribute up to three warships to a NATO-led initiative aimed at enhancing the alliance's presence in the Baltic Sea. The move is part of an effort to guard against potential sabotage of vital underwater infrastructure, the Swedish government announce.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Swedish Navy submarine rescue ship HSwMS Belos. (Picture source: Finnish MoD) In addition to the warships, Sweden’s military will deploy an ASC 890 surveillance aircraft to enhance situational awareness in the region. The Swedish Coast Guard will also play a significant role, with four ships dedicated to monitoring the Baltic Sea and an additional seven vessels on standby for rapid response. This marks Sweden's first operational contribution to NATO’s defense and deterrence efforts as a member of the alliance. The country formally joined NATO in March, becoming its 32nd member. Sweden's accession followed that of neighboring Finland and was spurred by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which significantly altered the security landscape in Northern Europe. The decision to strengthen NATO's presence in the Baltic comes amid a series of incidents in the region, raising concerns about possible Russian activities. The Baltic Sea, a crucial economic and strategic corridor, is crisscrossed by undersea cables and pipelines that connect Nordic, Baltic, and Central European nations. These infrastructures facilitate trade, enhance energy security, and, in some cases, reduce reliance on Russian energy resources. Sweden’s participation in this NATO operation comes at a pivotal moment for the alliance, which has been focusing on fortifying its eastern flank in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The Baltic Sea has become a focal point for these efforts, given its strategic location and the vulnerabilities of its underwater infrastructure. Comments Monitoring undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is particularly challenging due to the region's unique characteristics and the nature of the threats involved. The Baltic is one of the busiest maritime zones globally, with over 2,000 ships navigating its waters daily, including commercial cargo vessels, oil tankers, and fishing trawlers. This high density of maritime activity creates significant obstacles for identifying vessels that might pose a deliberate or accidental risk to undersea cables. The sheer volume of traffic makes it difficult to discern routine activities from those potentially harmful. The technological limitations in the detection and surveillance of undersea infrastructure further compound the problem. Current systems struggle to provide real-time monitoring of extensive cable networks, which often span hundreds or thousands of kilometers. The deep-sea environment adds complexity, with cables often lying on the seabed in remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor. Damage to cables can be caused by natural phenomena, such as seabed shifts or underwater currents, but deliberate sabotage, such as anchor dragging or the use of specialized underwater drones, is increasingly suspected. The covert nature of these activities makes attribution particularly difficult, leaving authorities reliant on indirect evidence or post-incident investigations. Jurisdictional and legal challenges also play a major role. Undersea cables frequently traverse international waters, where no single nation has the authority to enforce protective measures. This limits the ability of individual countries to act decisively against potential threats. Even within territorial waters, enforcement can be difficult due to overlapping national interests and the need for coordination between multiple stakeholders. Moreover, laws governing undersea infrastructure security are often outdated or insufficiently comprehensive, leaving gaps in enforcement and response capabilities. Adding to these challenges, the Baltic Sea itself poses unique geographical difficulties. Its relatively shallow depths, brackish water, and numerous islands create a complex maritime environment that can obscure monitoring efforts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/will-three-new-ships-deployed-by-sweden-prevent-attacks-on-underwater-infrastructure	2025-01-14T01:58:02-08:00

Breaking News: Iran Deploys New Air Defense Systems to Protect Nuclear Facility Amid Threat of Israeli Airstrikes	On January 7, 2025, Brigadier General Ghader Rahimzadeh, the Iranian commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base, announced that Iran's air defense units, under the command of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Aerospace Force, are actively securing the Shahid Ahmadi Roshan nuclear site—commonly known as the Natanz facility—against potential aerial threats. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Anti-aircraft guns Samavat 35mm guarding Natanz Nuclear Facility, Iran. (Picture source: Wikimedia) This move comes as Iran continues to bolster its defense posture amid escalating tensions with Israel and ongoing concerns about its nuclear program. Rahimzadeh emphasized that both army and IRGC (Islamic Revolution Guards Corps) air defense units have been deployed near critical sites such as Natanz, enhancing their ability to detect and neutralize aerial threats. The air defense systems in place reportedly include new and advanced technologies, reflecting the country's determination to safeguard its sensitive nuclear infrastructure. The Natanz facility, a cornerstone of Iran's uranium enrichment program, has long been a focal point of international contention due to concerns over its potential role in the development of nuclear weapons. Iran's air defense upgrades signal its increasing focus on protecting such facilities and its broader preparedness for aerial challenges amid the complex security landscape. Rahimzadeh also stated that the air defense measures are part of a wider national strategy, with upcoming exercises planned to strengthen the country’s air defense capabilities. These drills will be conducted under the command of the integrated air defense network, an initiative designed to consolidate and enhance the effectiveness of Iran’s military and defensive resources. On January 8, 2025, the Defense Mirror website reported that Iran had ramped up its defense posture by conducting large-scale military exercises to protect its nuclear sites. These exercises come amid growing concerns over Israel's military stance and its potential for action against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Israel, which has consistently voiced its opposition to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, is said to be preparing for a military strike, fearing that Iran’s nuclear program could eventually lead to the development of nuclear weapons. The perceived threat from Iran’s nuclear program has been compounded by its ongoing support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, whose missile and drone attacks on Israel have heightened security concerns in Tel Aviv. These attacks have been attributed to Iranian assistance to the Houthi group, further fueling Israel’s fears of an expanding nuclear threat. In this context, Israeli defense officials are reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, with a sense of urgency mounting ahead of the upcoming change in the U.S. presidency. In October 2024, Israel conducted airstrikes against Iranian missile-production sites around Tehran. These strikes targeted key facilities, including the Parchin military complex, the Khojir military base, the Shahrud missile site, and a factory in the Shamsabad Industrial Zone. These attacks were seen as part of Israel's broader strategy to disrupt Iran's missile development and its nuclear capabilities. The airstrikes are believed to have been a direct response to what Israel perceives as a growing threat from Iran’s expanding missile and nuclear programs. The threat of an Israeli military response has been compounded by uncertainties surrounding the new U.S. administration, as President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January 2025. Israeli officials fear that Trump may prioritize diplomatic engagement with Iran over military action, which has created a sense of urgency in Tel Aviv to neutralize what it views as an existential threat before the transition of power. Iran's nuclear program has been a point of contention for over two decades, with the country maintaining that its nuclear activities are intended solely for peaceful purposes, such as energy production. However, the international community, particularly Israel and Western powers, has expressed concerns that Iran's nuclear ambitions could ultimately result in the development of nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has monitored Iran’s nuclear activities, issuing reports that have raised questions about Tehran’s compliance with international agreements. Despite the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), designed to limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, tensions have remained high, especially following the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in 2018. Since then, Iran has resumed some of its nuclear enrichment activities, increasing uranium enrichment levels beyond the limits set by the JCPOA. These developments have sparked renewed concern from the international community, with the United Nations and the European Union calling for greater transparency and accountability in Iran’s nuclear program. In the face of these growing concerns, Iran has invested heavily in its defense systems, particularly air defense, to protect its nuclear facilities from external threats. This includes the deployment of advanced missile defense systems around sensitive sites like Natanz. By enhancing its military capabilities, Iran seeks to send a clear message about its resolve to maintain its nuclear sovereignty, despite the international pressure to curtail its nuclear program. The strategic considerations of regional powers like Israel and global players like the United States further complicate the situation surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. The potential for military confrontation remains high, with Israel reportedly preparing for the possibility of an attack on Iran's nuclear sites. The trajectory of this crisis will largely depend on the actions of key stakeholders, including the new U.S. administration under President Trump, Israel’s military strategy, and Iran’s willingness to engage in further diplomacy or continue its nuclear activities. As Iran continues to strengthen its defenses and conduct military exercises to safeguard its nuclear infrastructure, the risk of an escalation in the region remains significant. The potential for a military confrontation, especially between Israel and Iran, could have far-reaching implications not only for the Middle East but for global security as a whole. With the situation continuing to evolve, the international community must closely monitor developments in Iran's nuclear program and its military posture, while also considering diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-deploys-new-air-defense-systems-to-protect-nuclear-facility-amid-threat-of-israeli-airstrikes	2025-01-10T09:09:30-08:00	
US Defense Secretary Announces Continued US Military Presence in Syria to Combat Terrorist Group ISIS	On January 8, 2025, according to information released by the Associated Press (AP), U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that U.S. troops will remain in Syria as part of ongoing efforts to prevent the Islamic State (ISIS) from reconstituting itself. The announcement comes amid mounting concerns about the potential resurgence of ISIS in the region, as well as the continued instability in northeastern Syria, which has been a hotbed for insurgent activity. Secretary Austin’s remarks underscore the U.S. commitment to ensuring that ISIS does not regain a foothold in the region, while also supporting the broader stabilization efforts in Syria.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A U.S. Army Bradley Fighting Vehicle Commander controls the vehicle during a partner force presence patrol in Northeast Syria on December 12, 2024. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) As of December 19, 2024, the U.S. military maintains approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, as part of Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR), a mission aimed at countering ISIS (Islamic State) and stabilizing the region. This troop level represents a significant increase, with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) reporting a surge of about 1,100 troops compared to previous estimates. This increase reflects the evolving security challenges faced by U.S. forces in Syria, particularly as ISIS remnants continue to pose a threat. Despite suffering major territorial defeats in recent years, ISIS remains active in insurgent operations, and military officials continue to express concerns about the group’s potential to regroup and escalate its activities in the region. Secretary Austin’s statement reflects the Biden administration's commitment to supporting regional partners and ensuring that ISIS does not regain its former strength. The decision to maintain this increased troop presence is driven by the ongoing instability in Syria's northeast, where ISIS continues to exploit a fractured political and military landscape. The group, while no longer holding large swaths of territory, remains capable of conducting attacks and insurgent operations, making it essential for U.S. forces to maintain a presence to disrupt these efforts and provide security for local populations. Secretary Austin's remarks highlight the importance of the mission, which not only targets ISIS but also works in concert with local forces and international partners to bring stability to the region. The Pentagon has also reassured the public that U.S. military operations in Syria will continue despite potential fiscal challenges. On December 19, 2024, U.S. Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder issued a statement confirming that even if a partial government shutdown were to occur, military missions abroad, including those in Syria, would remain unaffected. This reflects the Pentagon’s priority to maintain critical security operations in the region, particularly in light of the persistent threats posed by ISIS and other terrorist organizations. The operational readiness of U.S. forces in Syria is vital, as instability in the region could have far-reaching implications for U.S. interests in the Middle East. As part of CJTF-OIR, U.S. forces continue to collaborate with local Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces, as well as international coalition partners, to ensure that ISIS is defeated and that regional stability is supported. The ongoing U.S. commitment to the mission demonstrates the broader strategic importance of the region to U.S. national security. In addition to the personnel deployed in Syria, the U.S. military maintains a robust presence of advanced combat equipment to support its mission. According to images released by the U.S. DoD in December 2024, U.S. soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division are stationed in Syria, equipped with a variety of combat vehicles to aid in operations. These include Bradley M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) and M-ATV MRAPs (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles), which are critical for both offensive and defensive operations in the region's challenging terrain. The Bradley M2A3 IFVs, known for their firepower and mobility, are highly effective in urban combat scenarios, providing essential support to local partner forces on the ground. These vehicles are designed to engage enemy forces in complex environments, offering enhanced capabilities for infantry support and protection. On the other hand, the M-ATV MRAPs are specially designed to withstand the threat of roadside bombs and ambushes, a constant danger in areas where insurgent tactics, such as mines and IEDs, remain prevalent. These armored vehicles ensure the safety of U.S. personnel and enable the forces to carry out their missions with greater security and effectiveness. The presence of such advanced military equipment highlights the ongoing need for a well-equipped and highly capable force in Syria. The U.S. Army’s deployment is part of a broader strategy to apply sustained pressure on ISIS while providing support to local forces and ensuring the safety of local populations affected by the prolonged conflict. These military assets underscore the U.S. commitment to ensuring that its forces can operate in some of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world. As the situation in Syria remains fluid, U.S. military officials continue to monitor developments closely. U.S. Secretary Austin’s announcement indicates the long-term nature of the U.S. mission in Syria, emphasizing that the United States and its allies are determined to ensure ISIS does not rebuild its caliphate. The U.S. military presence in Syria is expected to evolve in response to the changing security environment, but the overarching goal of countering ISIS and supporting regional partners remains unchanged. The strategic importance of Syria in the fight against terrorism means that U.S. forces are likely to maintain a significant footprint in the region for the foreseeable future. This presence is essential for combating ISIS and navigating the broader geopolitical challenges that continue to shape U.S. defense priorities in the Middle East. In the coming months, U.S. forces in Syria will face ongoing challenges, both in combating terrorist cells and navigating the complex political landscape of Syria and its neighbors. However, the core mission of ensuring that ISIS is permanently defeated remains a central priority for the U.S. military. This commitment, alongside efforts to maintain regional stability and support local populations, reflects the broader U.S. strategy to protect national security interests and contribute to international peacekeeping and counterterrorism efforts in a region that continues to bear the scars of decades of conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-defense-secretary-announces-continued-us-military-presence-in-syria-to-combat-terrorist-group-isis	2025-01-10T08:22:04-08:00	
Syria Blocks Russian Evacuation Ship Sparta II at Strategic Tartus Port	According to information published by UAWire on January 10, 2025, Russia’s evacuation of military assets from Syria has hit a critical roadblock, as the cargo ship Sparta II has been denied access to the port of Tartus by the country’s new authorities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian cargo ship Sparta II remains stranded off the Syrian coast as new authorities deny port access, stalling Moscow's evacuation of military assets from Tartus. (Picture source: OBL) This development follows a regime change in Syria that saw the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, casting uncertainty over Russia’s future in the region. The ship, which arrived off the Syrian coast on January 5 after departing Russia’s Kaliningrad region in December, remains adrift as negotiations falter. The Tartus port, home to Russia’s only naval base outside its borders, is a linchpin in Moscow’s regional strategy. However, the vessel’s controversial history, including prior sanction-listed activities such as transporting military equipment from Crimea to Syria, has likely contributed to the denial. This impasse has effectively stalled Russian evacuation efforts, forcing reliance on alternative routes, such as air operations through Khmeimim airbase, to withdraw personnel and smaller assets. Satellite imagery has revealed an extensive buildup of Russian military equipment at Tartus, including dismantled air defense radar systems and over 100 trucks staged for removal. Despite this readiness, no ships are currently docked at the port to load these assets, leaving significant resources stranded. The lack of maritime access underscores the severity of the challenge facing Moscow as it attempts to recalibrate its presence in Syria. The broader geopolitical context further complicates the situation. Russia’s withdrawal of its fleet from Tartus in December followed the rapid advance of Syrian rebels toward Damascus, signaling a major shift in the country’s power dynamics. The overthrow of Assad’s regime has prompted Moscow to engage in negotiations with the new authorities to secure its remaining footholds in Syria, particularly the Tartus naval base and Khmeimim airbase. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has confirmed these talks, highlighting the strategic importance of these installations to Russia’s influence in the region. Meanwhile, international attention on the situation has intensified. A U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft has been deployed to monitor the Sparta II and broader developments in the Mediterranean, reflecting heightened interest in the implications of Russia’s repositioning. The vessel’s continued delay adds to the uncertainty, amplifying concerns over Russia’s ability to protect and extract its military assets under shifting regional dynamics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/syria-blocks-russian-evacuation-ship-sparta-ii-at-strategic-tartus-port	2025-01-10T07:55:15-08:00	
Analysis: Croatia Enhances Air Power Capabilities with French Rafale Fighter Jets Replacing Soviet-made MiG-21	In December 2024, Croatia’s air defense capabilities took a monumental leap forward with the arrival of eight French Dassault Rafale fighter jets at the 'Colonel Marko Živković' barracks in Pleso, marking the largest and most significant strategic project in the history of the Croatian Air Force. This milestone is part of Croatia’s ongoing effort to modernize its military assets and align more closely with NATO standards, positioning the country as a stronger, more capable member of the alliance.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Croatia’s Air Force strengthens its capabilities with the acquisition of French Dassault Rafale jets, marking a new era of modernization and NATO integration. (Picture source: Croatia MoD) The Rafale program follows the signing of a major defense contract in 2022, when Croatia finalized an agreement with France to purchase a fleet of 12 Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft. The deal, valued at approximately €999 million, was a crucial step in Croatia’s broader military modernization strategy. The contract also includes comprehensive training programs for Croatian pilots and maintenance personnel, as well as logistical and technical support to ensure the aircraft's long-term operational readiness. This agreement was a part of Croatia’s effort to replace its aging fleet of MiG-21 fighter jets, which had been in service since the early 1990s. Croatia’s decision to purchase the Rafale jets was driven by the need for a more modern, capable fighter to meet the growing security challenges in Europe. After considering a variety of options, including the Swedish Gripen and American F-16, the Croatian government selected the Rafale due to its multirole capabilities, advanced avionics, and proven combat performance. The French government, in turn, supported Croatia's acquisition of the Rafale, reinforcing the strategic partnership between the two nations within NATO. The purchase is seen as a significant step in enhancing Croatia’s air defense capabilities and aligning its military forces with NATO’s evolving standards. The Rafale’s advanced radar and electronic warfare systems, coupled with its versatility in both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, offer Croatia enhanced capabilities that are vital in contemporary security environments. The first batch of Rafale aircraft arrived in Croatia in April 2024, with the full fleet expected to be operational by 2025. This modernization is not just a leap in terms of technology, but also in strategic importance. By equipping its air force with one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, Croatia is enhancing both its defensive and offensive capabilities. The Rafale is equipped with state-of-the-art radar and electronic warfare systems, giving it a technological edge that far surpasses the MiG-21s, which have long been outclassed in terms of performance. The Rafale program signifies the replacement of the aging MiG-21 fleet, which has served as the backbone of the Croatian Air Force for decades, notably during the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995). The MiG-21s were instrumental in the formation of Croatia's air force, as the nation had no official air combat capability at the beginning of the conflict. Over time, a fleet of MiG-21s was acquired, playing a pivotal role in reconnaissance, air superiority, and close air support missions. Despite challenges with limited resources and spare parts, these aircraft were critical in the country's struggle for independence. Croatia replaces its MiG-21, in service since the 1990s, with French Rafale fighter jets to enhance air defense capabilities. (Picture source Wikimedia) By the time Croatia joined NATO in 2009, the MiG-21s had undergone several upgrades, including improved avionics, to meet the alliance’s interoperability standards. However, as the MiG-21 fleet aged and its operational limitations became more apparent, it became clear that the aircraft could no longer provide the level of performance needed to support Croatia’s growing defense requirements. Consequently, the Croatian government set in motion a process to replace the MiG-21s with modern, advanced fighter jets capable of performing a wide range of missions in line with NATO expectations. The MiG-21 was designed in the 1950s and has remained in service with various countries well beyond its intended lifespan. While it served as a reliable platform during the Croatian War of Independence, its capabilities have become increasingly outdated in the context of modern aerial warfare. The MiG-21 is limited in terms of payload capacity, radar and avionics sophistication, and operational range. Additionally, its single-engine design and older airframe technology provide reduced survivability compared to modern fighter jets.The Rafale, on the other hand, represents a significant leap in air combat capabilities. With a maximum speed of Mach 1.8, a range of 3,700 km, and a ceiling of 15,240 meters, the Rafale can operate in a variety of roles, including air superiority, ground attack, reconnaissance, and nuclear deterrence. Its advanced radar system, the Thales RBE2 AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, provides superior tracking, targeting, and situational awareness, far exceeding the radar systems available on the MiG-21. The Rafale is also equipped with electronic warfare capabilities and can carry a much wider array of modern, precision-guided weapons, including air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground munitions, and a range of bombs. One of the key advantages of the Rafale over the MiG-21 is its multirole flexibility. The MiG-21 was primarily designed as a lightweight interceptor and was only adapted for ground attack missions later in its service life. In contrast, the Rafale was built from the ground up as a multirole platform, capable of seamlessly transitioning between different combat missions without compromising performance. This makes the Rafale more versatile, allowing Croatia’s Air Force to conduct a broader range of missions with a single type of aircraft. Beyond performance, the Rafale also offers Croatia substantial improvements in terms of survivability and operational effectiveness. The aircraft's stealthy design, low radar cross-section, and advanced electronic countermeasures make it significantly harder to detect and engage than the MiG-21. Its advanced cockpit and avionics systems enhance pilot situational awareness, while the aircraft’s ability to carry out long-range strikes with precision-guided munitions further expands Croatia's offensive capabilities. Beyond boosting national defense, the Rafale program is designed to integrate Croatia more effectively into NATO’s defense framework. NATO interoperability is a key component of Croatia’s strategic defense objectives, and the Rafale’s advanced systems are fully compatible with NATO's operational standards. As NATO continues to adapt to evolving global security challenges, Croatia’s enhanced capabilities will allow it to contribute more effectively to alliance operations, including air policing, rapid-response missions, and collaborative defense initiatives. Until the full operational readiness of Croatia’s Rafale fleet, NATO has supported the country's airspace protection efforts through Air Policing missions carried out by the Italian and Hungarian Air Forces. This interim arrangement has allowed the Croatian Air Force to focus on intensive training for its pilots and ground crews as they prepare to integrate the Rafales into their operations. The retirement of the MiG-21s by the end of 2024 will mark the conclusion of an era for the Croatian Air Force. While these aircraft hold a special place in the country’s military history, particularly for their role during the Croatian War of Independence, the decision to phase them out is driven by the need for more modern, capable, and versatile aircraft to address the complex security landscape of the 21st century. The MiG-21s will forever be a symbol of Croatia’s resilience and ingenuity in the face of adversity. Despite the limitations of the aircraft and the severe resource constraints during the war, the Croatian Air Force managed to achieve remarkable successes, establishing itself as a respected entity within the region. However, as Croatia looks to the future, the Rafale represents a major step in reinforcing the country’s air defense capabilities and ensuring its security within the broader NATO framework. With the arrival of the Rafale, Croatia has entered a new chapter in its military modernization efforts, underlining the country’s commitment to enhancing its national defense while playing a more active role in regional and NATO security. The Croatian Air Force's modernization plan, which includes the Rafale fleet and other ongoing upgrades, will position the country as a key player in NATO's defense posture in Southeastern Europe. As Croatia moves into 2025, the full integration of the Rafale fighter jets will not only strengthen its national defense but also solidify its strategic role within NATO, ensuring that the Croatian Air Force is prepared to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving global security environment. The Rafale program is a clear statement of Croatia’s resolve to protect its sovereignty, contribute to NATO's collective defense, and maintain peace and stability in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/analysis-croatia-enhances-air-power-capabilities-with-french-rafale-fighter-jets-replacing-soviet-made-mig-21	2025-01-10T06:53:16-08:00

Greek frigate Hydra quietly deploys to Red Sea with upgraded anti-drone system amid Meko modernization debate	According to information published by Christian Mazanitis on January 10, 2025, the Greek frigate HYDRA has quietly set sail for the Red Sea, embarking on its fourth mission in the region to join Operation ASPIDES.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Navy's Hydra-class frigate Hydra in April 2024. (Picture source: European Union) This European Union-led mission aims to protect maritime trade routes from terrorist threats, particularly those posed by Yemen's Houthi rebels. Unlike its previous deployments, the HYDRA’s departure from the Salamis Naval Base was marked by an unusual lack of ceremony, with no formal send-off by the Chief of the Hellenic Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral Dimitrios-Eleftherios Katarras, or any public announcement from the Navy’s press office. The deployment comes nearly a year after the frigate’s last mission in the Red Sea, but with a key upgrade: the installation of an advanced anti-drone system, KENTAVROS. This domestically developed system builds on lessons learned from the frigate’s earlier encounters with Houthi drone attacks, including a close call with a kamikaze drone during its first mission. The KENTAVROS system, first installed on the frigate PSARA and later on SPETSAI, now equips the HYDRA for a more robust response to emerging aerial threats. Despite its operational importance, the HYDRA’s deployment highlights the urgent need for modernization of Greece's four MEKO-class frigates. Commissioned in 1992, the HYDRA is now 33 years old, operating with outdated electronics from the 1980s. Successive delays in modernization efforts have left the frigates struggling to match contemporary naval threats. Initially, the cost of upgrading the MEKO-class ships was projected at €1 billion, including new weapons systems under a U.S. Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) proposal four years ago. That proposal faced backlash and was shelved in favor of acquiring FDI Belharra frigates, which were celebrated as a game-changer for the Hellenic Navy. However, escalating costs and emerging security demands have forced a reconsideration of the MEKO upgrade program. The latest reports suggest a scaled-down modernization plan with a 60% cost reduction, capping expenses at €100 million per ship, or €400 million for the entire fleet. This 'surface-level' modernization will focus on installing the KENTAVROS anti-drone system across all four frigates, alongside upgraded radar systems for improved threat detection. While these upgrades aim to extend the ships' operational life by 10 to 12 years, they fall short of comprehensive overhauls. The MEKO-class frigates are expected to assume secondary roles behind the newly acquired FDI Belharra ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/greek-frigate-hydra-quietly-deploys-to-red-sea-with-upgraded-anti-drone-system-amid-meko-modernization-debate	2025-01-10T01:01:37-08:00

US Congress Warns of Rising Costs and Challenges in US Navy's 2025 Shipbuilding Plan	According to information published by the US Gov on January 6, 2025, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released its analysis of the U.S. Navy’s ambitious 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, highlighting significant increases in costs and challenges in execution. The plan envisions a modernized fleet to address evolving maritime threats, but the financial and logistical demands underscore the scale of the undertaking.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Virginia-class submarine USS Texas at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. (Picture source: US DoD) The Navy aims to expand its current fleet of 295 battle force ships to 390 by 2054, while also integrating 134 unmanned surface and undersea vessels. However, the fleet is expected to shrink in the near term, dropping to 283 ships by 2027 due to planned retirements before rebounding in subsequent years. This strategy aligns with the Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations concept, which emphasizes spreading offensive and defensive capabilities across a larger number of platforms. The costs of implementing the 2025 plan are projected to average $40.1 billion annually, adjusted for inflation, over the next three decades. This represents a 46 percent increase compared to the Navy’s recent funding levels. The CBO’s projections are significantly higher than the Navy’s estimates, reflecting differing assumptions about labor, materials, and inflation trends in shipbuilding. For example, the CBO estimates the cost of Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers will be billions more than the Navy projects. Challenges within the shipbuilding industrial base compound the difficulties of meeting the Navy’s goals. Shipyard production rates have slowed dramatically, with construction times for destroyers and submarines extending to nearly a decade. Labor shortages and an aging supplier base further complicate efforts, particularly as shipyards face increasing demands for complex vessels like nuclear-powered submarines. To address these issues, the Navy has committed $10 billion to improve the submarine industrial base, including investments in workforce development and infrastructure. The plan also emphasizes the construction of six Ford-class carriers to replace aging Nimitz-class vessels, a continued investment in attack submarines, and the development of next-generation destroyers and smaller combatants. However, delays in new ship classes and cost overruns could impact the Navy’s ability to meet its long-term objectives. For example, the introduction of the next-generation attack submarine has been postponed to 2040, while production rates for the Virginia-class submarines have not yet met planned targets. While the Navy’s focus on unmanned systems signals a strategic pivot toward future warfare, these platforms remain largely in the development phase, with unclear costs and capabilities. The integration of unmanned vessels into the fleet will be critical to achieving the Navy’s vision of a hybrid force, but questions remain about the technological readiness and operational role of these systems. The CBO’s analysis serves as a sobering reminder of the challenges inherent in such an ambitious plan. The envisioned fleet reflects the Navy’s response to growing geopolitical threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, but the realization of this vision will require careful navigation of fiscal constraints, industrial limitations, and strategic priorities. As Congress reviews the 2025 Shipbuilding Plan, the balance between ambition and feasibility will be a focal point. The decisions made in the coming years will shape the future of the U.S. Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-congress-warns-of-rising-costs-and-challenges-in-us-navys-2025-shipbuilding-plan	2025-01-09T01:58:31-08:00	
UAE could transfer up to 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets to Morocco with France’s consent	On January 8, 2025, LeDesk reported that discussions are progressing on a possible transfer of 30 Mirage 2000-9E fighter jets from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Morocco, contingent upon France’s agreement. According to Emirati sources, Abu Dhabi could cede half of its Mirage 2000-9E fleet to the Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) once the UAE begins receiving deliveries of Rafale F4 jets from Paris, scheduled for 2027.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. (Picture source: Army Recognition) This prospect was initially deemed unlikely four years ago, but it has gained momentum following the visit of Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita to France in April 2024, along with reports mentioning King Mohammed VI’s private stay in Abu Dhabi. A three-year suspension initially delayed the Mirage sale, mostly because the original 1998 contract stipulates that any transfer of these aircraft requires French consent for re-export. The potential transfer of Emirati Mirage 2000-9 aircraft to Morocco gained additional attention when the French government reportedly explored the option of buying back some UAE Mirages to provide them to Ukraine. This requirement complicated the transaction, but the UAE’s preference leaned toward selling part of its fleet, with 30 Mirage 2000-9s intended for Morocco and a portion for Egypt. While an agreement in principle appears to exist, no official statements have confirmed the final steps, delivery schedule, or upgrade packages. Emirati sources state that the cession of 30 Mirage 2000-9E aircraft was not confirmed in April of the previous year but could be endorsed soon, as the UAE’s decision depends partly on the timeline for its new fighter acquisitions. Abu Dhabi signed a significant contract with France in December 2021 for 80 Rafale F4 jets and 12 military helicopters, valued at about $18 billion, marking the largest international order for Rafale fighters since their introduction in 2004. With the UAE set to retire some Mirage 2000-9s in favor of the Rafale F4, several countries, including Iraq, Greece, Egypt, and Morocco, have been mentioned in discussions about receiving secondhand Mirage 2000s. On the Moroccan side, the RMAF currently operates around two-dozen upgraded Mirage F-1MF2000 aircraft, about two-dozen F-5s, and approximately two-dozen F-16C/D Block 52+ fighters. Morocco has also ordered an additional 25 F-16C/D Block 72 jets for delivery between late 2025 and 2027 and has been mentioned as potentially becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire the F-35 Lightning II from the United States. As reported on January 8, 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense may finalize a deal for 32 F-35 fighters for Morocco, with an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, including procurement and maintenance. If concluded, this acquisition would introduce fifth-generation capabilities to the RMAF, which analysts believe is motivated by Morocco’s rivalry with Algeria, especially concerning Western Sahara. Algeria has reportedly signed a contract for 14 Russian Su-57 fighters, complementing Su-30MKA and Su-35 jets in its inventory. This purchase is part of a broader effort in Algiers to maintain what it perceives as a necessary regional balance. Diplomatic friction persists between Morocco and Algeria, particularly following the 2021 severing of ties and ongoing disagreements over Western Sahara and the Polisario Front.

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Meanwhile, the presence of Emirati Mirage 2000-9s in different theaters has drawn scrutiny from various governments. On July 24, 2024, at least seven Emirati Mirage 2000-9DAD/EAD fighter-bombers were deployed to a People’s Liberation Army Air Force base in Xinjiang province, China, for the Falcon Shield 2024 exercise. Supported by C-17A Globemaster III transports and an A330 MRTT tanker, the UAE contingent cooperated with Chinese forces for the second consecutive edition of these drills. Analysts in the United States expressed concern that Beijing could gain insights into Western aviation technology through such interactions. UAE-China defense cooperation has already produced tensions, with the suspension in 2021 of negotiations to sell 50 F-35 Lightning II fighters to Abu Dhabi, reportedly due to disagreements over technical requirements, cost issues, and concerns about Chinese involvement in UAE military affairs. The UAE Air Force, which also operates over 70 F-16 Block 60 fighters of American origin, has thus diversified its fleet with Western and Chinese systems, including Hongdu L-15 trainers and Wing Loong drones. The Mirage 2000-9 is based on Dassault’s Mirage 2000 design, featuring an advanced modular avionics architecture, a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan engine, and a delta-wing configuration. Its technical enhancements include the RDY-2 or RBY-2 radar, integration of MICA air-to-air missiles, and capacity for precision-guided munitions such as the Shehan (or Shehab) laser-designation pod, guided bombs, and the Black Shaheen cruise missile, which is the export version of the SCALP-EG. Originally designed to offer an upgrade over the Mirage 2000-5, the 2000-9 includes a digital autopilot, advanced electronic warfare systems, and a cockpit arrangement similar in some respects to that of the Rafale. Historical records indicate that 62 Mirage 2000-9s were ordered new or upgraded from older Mirage 2000 airframes in the UAE’s previous contracts. Enhanced maintenance and modernization work have been carried out since 2019, through deals signed by Dassault Aviation, Thales, and MBDA, extending the service life of these aircraft into the 2030s. The Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 920 knots, a wingspan of 9.1 meters, a height of 5.2 meters, a length of 14.4 meters, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. The aircraft is powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner. Its RDY-2 radar allows both air-to-air and air-to-surface operations, with maximum detection ranges cited at more than 140 kilometers. The model’s armament options include MICA EM and IR missiles, up to 2,000-liter drop tanks, the Black Shaheen cruise missile, laser-guided bombs such as the BGL-1000, and other guided weapons, often linked to Thales or MBDA systems for targeting and electronic warfare. Maintenance and upgrade programs have involved not only Dassault but also engine manufacturer Snecma (now Safran) and electronics firms such as Thales, Smiths, Elettronica, and others. Powered by a single Snecma M53-P2 turbofan delivering 9,990 kgf with afterburner, the Mirage 2000-9 possesses a maximum speed of 1,700 km/h, a maximum payload of 6,300 kilograms, and a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kilograms. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Dassault Mirage 2000 itself was developed in the 1970s to replace older Mirage III fighters in French service. The single-engine, delta-wing Mirage 2000 first flew in March 1978, eventually evolving into multiple variants, including the Mirage 2000C, the nuclear-oriented Mirage 2000N, and the Mirage 2000D specialized in conventional strikes. The 2000-5 introduced enhancements for multirole operations, while the 2000-9 for the UAE included more sophisticated avionics, radar upgrades, and an expanded suite of weapons. Dassault’s official literature also highlighted the aircraft’s modular avionics design, improved digital flight controls, high maneuverability, and multiple weapons integrations. Over 600 Mirage 2000s of all variants were produced, entering service in countries such as France, the UAE, India, Greece, Taiwan, Egypt, Peru, Qatar, and Brazil. Some have been retired in favor of newer platforms like the Rafale or F-16, but others remain in active service with regular upgrades. The Dassault Mirage 2000’s historical backdrop includes extensive use by the French Air Force in NATO missions and various operations. The type served in the Gulf War, the Bosnian conflict, and over Kosovo. It was also deployed in Afghanistan, with the Mirage 2000D variant performing precision strikes in conjunction with Allied forces. France continues to operate the Mirage 2000-5 and Mirage 2000D, though it has gradually introduced the Rafale to replace older models. In 2011, French Mirage 2000s participated in operations over Libya. More recently, France committed aircraft to combat the Islamic State group, though some have been replaced by newer Rafales. Discussions arose in 2024 regarding Mirage 2000s and the possibility of sending them to Ukraine, but no official confirmation came from France’s Ministry of Defense despite inquiries. In other nations, including India, the Mirage 2000 saw notable use in the 1999 Kargil conflict and ongoing modernization. India’s fleet is designated the Vajra and has undergone an upgrade to near-2000-5 levels, with new radars, weapons, and electronic warfare suites. Other operators such as Greece, Taiwan, Qatar, Egypt, and Peru either still deploy the Mirage 2000 or have done so in recent decades, occasionally pursuing local upgrades or additional weapon integrations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/uae-could-transfer-up-to-30-mirage-2000-9e-fighter-jets-to-morocco-with-frances-consent	2025-01-09T01:49:23-08:00

(Picture source Lockheed Martin) The afterburner test phase is a crucial component of the X-59's broader performance evaluation, as it assesses the aircraft's ability to accelerate to supersonic speeds with minimal environmental impact. The afterburner itself is a key technology used in supersonic and hypersonic aircraft, adding fuel to the exhaust stream after combustion to generate additional thrust, often resulting in higher speeds. The X-59’s design, however, incorporates advanced modifications to its afterburner system aimed at minimizing the loud sonic boom typically associated with supersonic flight. This test is a critical step toward Lockheed Martin’s and NASA’s goal of achieving a breakthrough in supersonic travel that could lead to a future where commercial airlines are capable of flying faster than the speed of sound without producing the disruptive sonic booms that have historically been a deterrent for passengers and communities on the ground. The X-59, as part of the QueSST program, has been designed with a sleek, long fuselage and a unique tail configuration that allow it to cut through the air more efficiently, reducing shockwaves that normally result in the loud 'boom' heard when conventional supersonic aircraft break the sound barrier. As part of the ongoing testing process, the X-59 has been undergoing a series of engine runs, structural tests, and evaluations of its aerodynamics and acoustic emissions. The aircraft's design features, including its elongated nose and specialized engine nacelles, are specifically optimized to reduce the intensity of the sonic boom to a mere 'sonic thump' that would be barely noticeable to people on the ground. Lockheed Martin’s video provides a glimpse into the rigorous testing process that has been conducted, including capturing the afterburner ignition and the aircraft’s ability to maintain supersonic speeds while producing significantly lower noise levels. The successful completion of the afterburner tests is seen as a major leap forward for the X-59 program, bringing the aircraft closer to its next phase of testing, which will involve flight tests at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center. There, engineers and researchers will conduct supersonic flight tests over a series of designated test sites, collecting data on the aircraft's acoustic emissions and evaluating the community’s reaction to the reduced sonic boom. If these tests prove successful, the X-59 could pave the way for commercial supersonic flights over land in the near future. The development of the X-59 is particularly timely as the global aviation industry has been exploring ways to reduce travel times and improve efficiency in air travel, with supersonic transport offering the potential for significantly faster journeys. The aircraft’s success could ultimately lead to a new generation of supersonic jets capable of operating within the confines of modern noise regulations, potentially revolutionizing air travel. Lockheed Martin has expressed its commitment to continuing the testing phase in close collaboration with NASA, with the ultimate goal of certifying the X-59 for commercial use. Should the project succeed, it could open the door for future supersonic transport aircraft that are quieter, more efficient, and capable of dramatically shortening flight times on long-haul routes. Beyond its commercial prospects, the X-59's innovative design and advanced technologies also hold significant potential for military applications. The aircraft's ability to fly at supersonic speeds while minimizing the sonic boom could be a game-changer for military operations, especially in reconnaissance, strike missions, and rapid response scenarios. Traditional supersonic military aircraft, such as the Concorde-based supersonic bombers or fighter jets, generate substantial noise when breaking the sound barrier, often alerting adversaries to their presence. The X-59's reduced sonic signature would enable military forces to conduct high-speed operations without the usual warning signs, offering enhanced stealth and surprise. Furthermore, its ability to maintain supersonic speeds over long distances without compromising operational efficiency could make it an ideal platform for rapid strategic deployment, long-range reconnaissance, or even covert strikes. These capabilities, combined with its potential to reduce flight time across vast areas, could transform modern military operations, providing forces with a significant edge in both conventional and asymmetric warfare environments. This latest development highlights the increasing strides being made in the field of supersonic aviation, as aerospace companies work toward creating faster, quieter, and more sustainable aircraft to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving aviation market.

Analysis: Why Donald Trump wants Greenland for US missile defense and rare earth supplies	On January 8, 2025, the BBC reported that Donald Trump reaffirmed his intention for the United States to acquire Greenland, emphasizing its importance for national security and economic interests. Trump did not rule out using military or economic measures to pursue this objective, highlighting Greenland's strategic significance for Arctic defense and resource extraction. Greenland’s leadership, supported by Denmark, strongly rejected the proposal, reiterating that the territory is not for sale and emphasizing the principle of self-determination.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The M1A2 SEP V3 Abrams tank integrates advanced systems that require rare earth elements for components like electronics, sensors, and communication systems, though the specific rare earths involved are not publicly detailed. (Picture source: US DoD) Donald Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland is driven by its strategic military significance and abundant natural resources. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. Additionally, the island's vast reserves of minerals, including rare earth elements, present substantial economic opportunities. Trump views acquiring Greenland as essential for countering geopolitical rivals like Russia and China, who are increasing their presence in the Arctic region. The United States has shown interest in Greenland since 1867, when Secretary of State William H. Seward explored purchasing both Greenland and Iceland, though Congress opposed the idea. After World War II, in 1946, the U.S. offered Denmark $100 million in gold bars for Greenland, citing military necessity, but Denmark declined. During the Cold War, the U.S. established the Thule Air Base in Greenland, underscoring the island's strategic importance. Trump's recent proposals echo these historical attempts, emphasizing both security and economic factors. Reactions to Trump's proposal have been predominantly negative. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dismissed the idea as unrealistic, stating that Greenland is not for sale. Greenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede reiterated that the island is not on the market, emphasizing Greenland's autonomy and the importance of self-determination. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also rejected the notion, stressing the need to respect allies' sovereignty. These responses reflect a consensus that Greenland's future should be determined by its inhabitants, rather than external actors. The discussion surrounding Greenland is tied to the importance of critical raw materials (CRMs), including rare earth elements. These materials are essential for manufacturing technologies such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and renewable energy systems, as well as defense systems. CRMs are categorized by their economic value and their unique properties, which are often irreplaceable in high-tech applications, coupled with their limited availability and the complexities associated with their extraction and processing. For instance, the European Union identified 34 such materials in its latest 2024 Critical Raw Materials Act. More importantly, such materials are vital for the production of most modern military vehicles, which require specific CRMs for structural, electronic, and propulsion components. Greenland's location in the Arctic is pivotal for national security, hosting the Pituffik Space Base, a crucial element of the U.S. missile early warning system. (Picture source: US DoD) For example, critical raw materials (CRMs) are essential to producing tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, such as the Swedish-made CV90. Infantry fighting vehicles heavily rely on aluminum for structural components and graphite for electronic systems, ensuring functionality under diverse operational conditions. Beryllium is used in connectors and onboard electronics due to its lightweight and conductive properties. Titanium and iron/steel are employed for armor and propulsion systems, with the latter providing durability and structural strength. Copper supports communication systems, while tungsten enhances precision-guided mechanisms and armament effectiveness. Fighter aircraft, like the American F-16 and F-35, require a broad array of CRMs due to their high-performance demands. Aluminum and graphite are key for airframes, including the body, wings, and tail, due to their lightweight and strength. Titanium is widely used in propulsion systems, including turbines and nozzles, for its heat resistance and strength. Copper is applied in electro-optical and control systems, while nickel is used in airframes and propulsion systems for heat resistance. Rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium enable advanced avionics and control systems. Borates and gallium are crucial for radar, sensors, and electronic warfare systems, highlighting the reliance on materials with specific electromagnetic properties. Warships depend on a narrower but critical set of materials. Aluminum is used for decks, superstructures, and propulsion shafts, while titanium and iron/steel form the hulls and structural reinforcements for their corrosion resistance and strength. Copper supports propulsion systems and onboard electrical components. Lithium and silver are utilized in battery technologies for submarines and torpedoes, enabling energy storage and propulsion. Nickel and cobalt are integral to electronic systems, navigation radars, and sonar, providing reliability in marine environments. These materials collectively ensure the vessels' operational effectiveness in various naval scenarios. China leads the global production of rare earth elements, accounting for 69% of output in 2023, with a mine production of approximately 240,000 metric tons. The United States produced 43,000 metric tons (12.3% of global production), followed by Myanmar (38,000 metric tons), Australia (18,000 metric tons), Thailand, India, and Russia in smaller quantities. China also dominates refining and processing capabilities, which are critical for transforming raw materials into usable components for high-tech and defense industries. In December 2023, China imposed an export ban on rare earth extraction and separation technologies, citing national security concerns. The ban aimed to preserve China's technological edge and limit other nations' ability to achieve independence in this sector. Additional measures in 2024 included production and export quotas aimed at preserving domestic supplies for priority industries. China has declared rare earth resources state-owned and has used export restrictions in trade negotiations and geopolitical disputes, solidifying its influence over global supply chains. The U.S. defense industry heavily relies on Chinese rare earth materials, which constitute approximately 80% of the supply used in defense systems. The embargo affects the production of technologies such as F-35 fighter jets, which require rare earth magnets, creating risks of supply chain disruptions, delays in manufacturing, and increased costs. To address this, the U.S. is exploring alternative sources and increasing domestic investment in rare earth production to reduce dependency and strengthen supply chain resilience. Donald Trump's latest announcements on Greenland, while seemingly extreme, may therefore seem logical from a purely strategic point of view.

Strategic Leap: Japan Acquires V-BAT UAVs for Naval Surveillance	According to information published by ShieldAI on January 7, 2025, Japan is set to acquire advanced V-BAT unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from U.S. defense company Shield AI. An allocation of 4 billion yen (approximately $25 million) has been designated for this procurement. The V-BAT, renowned for its compact vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) system, is suited for deployment aboard smaller naval vessels, offering operational flexibility and endurance for monitoring expansive maritime territories.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan acquires V-BAT UAVs to elevate maritime patrols with VTOL technology and extended operational endurance. (Picture source: ShieldAI) The V-BAT UAV is renowned for its vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, requiring minimal space for deployment—specifically, a 12-foot square area (about 3.7 meters). This feature makes it particularly suitable for operations on naval vessels with limited deck space. Once airborne, the V-BAT transitions to horizontal flight, utilizing its wings for lift, and can sustain operations for up to 10 hours. This endurance is crucial for extended surveillance missions over Japan's vast maritime territories. In the context of a potential conflict with China, the V-BAT UAV could play a pivotal role in bolstering Japan’s maritime security and operational readiness, especially in contested areas such as the East China Sea. These waters, including the Senkaku Islands (claimed by both Japan and China), are a hotspot for geopolitical tensions. A conflict scenario would demand rapid, precise, and sustained intelligence-gathering and situational awareness, areas where the V-BAT excels. China’s naval strategy emphasizes anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities, bolstered by advanced missile systems, large surface fleets, submarines, and maritime militias. To counter this, the JMSDF must rely on persistent ISR and agile platforms like the V-BAT UAV to maintain awareness and provide actionable intelligence. The V-BAT’s ability to operate from smaller patrol ships, frigates, and remote bases gives Japan a distinct advantage in deploying assets near contested areas without escalating tensions. During a conflict, the V-BAT’s long-endurance surveillance can be used to monitor and track Chinese naval activities, such as movements of destroyers, submarines, and amphibious assault ships. This real-time intelligence is crucial for countering aggressive maneuvers or amphibious landings. Its ability to relay this data to JMSDF command and allied forces ensures a coordinated and informed response, which is critical in managing the fast-paced dynamics of naval engagements. In anti-submarine warfare, the V-BAT can assist in detecting Chinese submarines operating near Japanese waters. The East China Sea is a known transit area for Chinese submarines heading into the Pacific, and the V-BAT, equipped with synthetic aperture radar or magnetic anomaly detectors, could provide an additional layer of defense by identifying submarine locations and relaying their movements to JMSDF assets. The UAV’s stealthy design and low radar signature make it ideal for covert ISR missions in sensitive zones. For instance, it could be deployed to shadow Chinese vessels or maritime militia ships operating near the Senkaku Islands, documenting activities for strategic decision-making. In scenarios where China employs swarming tactics using smaller vessels or drones, the V-BAT can provide overwatch for JMSDF vessels, identifying threats early and coordinating countermeasures. Its modular payloads can also be adapted for electronic warfare, such as jamming Chinese communications or gathering electronic intelligence to disrupt their operational cohesion.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/strategic-leap-japan-acquires-v-bat-uavs-for-naval-surveillance	2025-01-08T05:24:48-08:00

The plan includes the systems, their ten-year integrated logistics support, ammunition, trucks, communication and information systems, and infrastructure adaptations. The aim is to counter rockets, artillery, mortars, unmanned aircraft systems, and loitering munitions, thereby providing very short-range protection for personnel and critical infrastructure in Italy and for contingents deployed abroad. These four C-RAM systems fulfill commitments made to the Alliance and are described in the Defense Planning Document (DPP) as Skynex, a Rheinmetall-produced system that integrates separate airspace surveillance components and effectors, accommodates radar technologies from multiple manufacturers, and employs programmable 35 mm Ahead ammunition resistant to electronic countermeasures. This new capability is expected to deter threats posed by rockets, artillery, and mortars, as well as drones and loitering munitions, especially for contingents deployed in operational theaters. Reports indicate that Italy’s short-range air defense program (GRIFO), managed by the Italian Army and already involving the CAMM-ER missile, may integrate the Skynex 35 mm system to address low-altitude and short-range threats. In May 2024, MBDA announced tests of the CAMM-ER missile with the GRIFO system’s Command Post and Engagement Module, confirming its capability against a simulated enemy aircraft attack. Combining multiple solutions ensures that aerial targets of varying ranges and altitudes can be addressed, strengthening national defense sovereignty and industrial partnerships. This purchase also aims to secure technological expertise within Italy’s domestic defense sector, as the Skynex system is manufactured in Rome’s Tiburtina Valley. Several Italian publications have reported on Skynex production for Ukraine. Originally developed in Switzerland by Oerlikon, Skynex is now built at Rheinmetall Italia, circumventing Swiss restrictions on direct exports of completed war materials while adhering to regulations permitting the transfer of technological know-how. This approach facilitated deployment to Ukraine under a contract financed by the German government. By the end of 2023, two Skynex systems, financed by the German government and valued at 183 million Swiss francs, were delivered to Ukrainian forces. Germany subsequently placed orders for three more units, bringing the total value to around 500 million euros. Some systems even arrived ahead of schedule via the Polish logistics hub in Rzeszow. Following the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, Rheinmetall announced shorter delivery times for Skynex due to investments in personnel and infrastructure, reducing the timeline from two years to approximately one year. Rheinmetall Italia invested €100 million in 2023 and an additional €20 million in 2024 to expedite production and address increased demand. Personnel numbers are expected to grow from 450 to about 550 by early 2025, and the supplier roster expanded from 467 in 2022 to 762 in 2024. Italy’s short-range air defense program (GRIFO), managed by the Italian Army and already involving the CAMM-ER missile, may integrate the Skynex 35 mm system to address low-altitude and short-range threats. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Italy’s decision to invest in four systems follows NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte’s visit to Rheinmetall Italia’s Rome headquarters on November 5, 2024. This visit coincided with his meetings with President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and focused on reviewing new air defense technologies, such as Skynex, which Germany financed and donated to Ukraine. Rheinmetall AG is also collaborating with Leonardo to produce the Panther tank and Lynx tracked vehicle for the Italian Army, a partnership valued at over €23 billion over fifteen years. This cooperation aims to develop new heavy tanks, known as Main Battle Tanks, and address future European requirements under the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program. The Rome plant now plays a pivotal role in Rheinmetall’s global operations, overseeing major radar and cannon production. The company’s turnover in Italy exceeds one billion euros, with six plants nationwide. The Skynex air defense system includes several modular components designed for short-range and very short-range operations. It features four Revolver Gun Mk3 cannons, each capable of firing 1,000 rounds per minute with a range of up to 4 kilometers. The system utilizes programmable 35 mm Ahead ammunition, resistant to electronic countermeasures, for precise target engagement. Its CN-1 command module enables centralized control, while the X-TAR3D X-band radar ensures 360-degree target acquisition, classification, and tracking. Mobility is supported by HX trucks, and the modular design allows the integration of additional sensors and effectors, such as the SkyKnight missile, which extends the engagement range to 10 kilometers. The distributed component design reduces the risk of significant damage from single strikes. The Skynex system can address various aerial threats, including rockets, artillery, mortars (RAM), NATO-class I drones, and loitering munitions. Its radar provides continuous 360-degree coverage, enabling tracking and classification in diverse environmental and electronic conditions. The programmable 35 mm ammunition creates a dense projectile pattern, ensuring an effective engagement of small, fast-moving targets. Rheinmetall Italia cited the success of Germany’s Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft gun in Ukraine as validation of cannon-based short-range defense systems. The company emphasizes the lower cost of 35 mm munitions compared to missiles and the rounds’ resistance to electronic interference. The modular architecture supports adaptability to mission-specific needs, allowing the integration of effectors like high-energy lasers or missiles to counter saturation attacks. These features make Skynex suitable for protecting critical infrastructure and deployed forces, enabling a robust response to evolving threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/italy-purchases-four-skynex-35mm-air-defense-systems-to-counter-low-altitude-and-short-range-threats	2025-01-08T04:09:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukrainian F-16 Fighter Jet Pilot Sets Historic Record by Destroying Six Missiles in a Single Mission	According to a report published on January 7, 2025, by the Air Force Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, a Ukrainian pilot flying an F-16 Fighting Falcon has achieved a remarkable feat by destroying six enemy cruise missiles in a single combat mission. This historic achievement occurred during a massive missile and drone attack in December 2024, marking a milestone in the F-16’s capability to engage and eliminate high-speed missile threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image: A Ukrainian pilot in front of an F-16 Fighting Falcon donated by Ukraine's international allies. (Picture source: Social Network) The Ukrainian pilot successfully intercepted and destroyed four cruise missiles using the F-16’s air-to-air missiles (AAMs) and then proceeded to eliminate two more missiles using the M61 Vulcan cannon. The F-16’s radar systems, including the AN/APG-68 radar, proved crucial in tracking the fast-moving missile targets, even those equipped with electronic countermeasures (REBs). This made the mission not only historically significant but also a testament to the high skill of the Ukrainian pilot and the versatile nature of the F-16 as a missile defense platform. While the Ukrainian F-16 pilot’s success is unprecedented, other F-16 pilots have also engaged in missile interception missions in previous combat scenarios, offering valuable insight into the aircraft’s ability to neutralize aerial threats. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, F-16s were used to intercept and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles, though their success in directly destroying these missiles was limited. F-16s were primarily tasked with striking missile launchers and air defense systems, but they also worked in tandem with Patriot missile defense systems to counter ballistic missile threats. The AIM-7 Sparrow missiles and radar systems on the F-16 allowed for some interception capabilities against the low-flying Scud missiles. This mission highlighted the F-16’s adaptability in missile defense operations, even in high-risk scenarios. Similarly, during Operation Allied Force in 1999, F-16s were integral in the broader NATO missile defense strategy, which involved targeting and neutralizing Serbian missile launchers and air defense sites. While the F-16 was not directly involved in intercepting incoming missiles, it provided essential offensive strikes against missile launch sites that posed significant threats to NATO aircraft. F-16 pilots contributed to air superiority by eliminating missile systems and supporting the overall missile defense efforts. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has extensive experience in missile defense operations, including using the F-16 to engage airborne missile threats. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Israeli F-16s were involved in countering Katyusha rockets and other short-range missiles fired by Hezbollah. Though the F-16 did not directly intercept these rockets with its cannon or air-to-air missiles, it played a critical role in eliminating missile launch sites and providing surveillance, which allowed other defense systems like the Iron Dome to neutralize the threats. The F-16’s precision strikes and close air support proved to be vital in controlling the airspace and eliminating missile launch points. In Turkey, during the Syrian Civil War, Turkey’s F-16s were actively used in countering ballistic missile threats from Syria. While Patriot missile systems served as the primary missile defense, F-16s were tasked with surveillance and offensive strikes against missile launchers and ground-based missile systems. These missions further demonstrated the F-16’s versatility in dealing with missile threats, often working in conjunction with other air defense systems to provide comprehensive protection. The M61 Vulcan cannon mounted on the F-16 is a 6-barrel, 20mm rotary cannon capable of firing at 6,000 rounds per minute. While it is commonly used in close-range dogfights and against aerial targets like enemy aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), its application against missiles is extremely rare and highly challenging. The cannon’s high rate of fire and short-range effectiveness make it a difficult tool to use against fast-moving missiles, which often require precise tracking and engagement at very close distances—typically under 500 meters. In the case of the Ukrainian pilot’s mission, the M61 Vulcan was used against two incoming cruise missiles, which required the pilot to close the distance and engage the target with great precision. While the primary method of missile interception in the F-16 is through air-to-air missiles (AAMs) like the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the cannon proved useful in situations where close-range engagement was necessary, especially in scenarios where the aircraft's missiles had already been expended or the threat was in the final stages of approach. The historic achievement by the Ukrainian F-16 pilot in destroying six missiles in one mission is a significant moment in the evolution of missile defense using F-16s. The aircraft’s radar systems, air-to-air missiles, and M61 Vulcan cannon allow for a range of interception options against high-speed aerial threats, from cruise missiles to ballistic projectiles. The experiences of other F-16 pilots in past combat situations, including the U.S., Israel, and Turkey, further highlight the fighter's versatility in missile defense roles, whether in directly destroying missiles or supporting broader air defense strategies. The success of the Ukrainian F-16 pilot underscores the growing capabilities of the F-16 Fighting Falcon in modern warfare, particularly in high-intensity conflicts where missile threats are increasingly sophisticated. With continued training, technology upgrades, and combat experience, the F-16 is proving to be a formidable weapon in the global fight against missile proliferation and aerial threats.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-jet-pilot-sets-historic-record-by-destroying-six-missiles-in-a-single-mission	2025-01-08T03:11:10-08:00

ATLA explained that Boeing Japan was uniquely positioned to carry out this project due to its exclusive access to the required simulation software, along with the necessary technical resources and expertise. Japan's interest in combat UAVs is not a recent development. As early as December 2022, the Ministry of Defense (JMOD) announced plans to develop 'combat support UAVs' capable of collaborating with manned aircraft. These efforts are also part of the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a joint initiative between Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft. In December 2023, JMOD also signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to conduct research on artificial intelligence for UAVs to ensure seamless integration with Japan's future fighter jets. The concept of collaborative UAVs, often referred to as 'loyal wingman' or 'collaborative combat aircraft' (CCA), aims to create autonomous drones capable of supporting manned aircraft in a range of missions, including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), electronic warfare, and combat operations. One prominent example is Boeing Australia's MQ-28 Ghost Bat, a multi-role UAV developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. Designed as a 'force multiplier,' the Ghost Bat features advanced artificial intelligence and a modular nose section that can be customized to meet specific operational requirements. In July 2024, it was announced that Australia’s Ghost Bats would prioritize ISR capabilities over weapon systems, partially due to Boeing's unsuccessful bid for an autonomous combat jet program in the United States. Nevertheless, the Ghost Bat remains a viable candidate for Japan’s combat support UAV program, given its adaptability and role in multi-domain missions. Japan is also pursuing additional UAV development independently. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is working on two collaborative UAV concepts: one focused on tactical combat and another aimed at supporting manned aircraft operations. Both are being designed to integrate with the GCAP next-generation fighter, underscoring Japan’s commitment to incorporating cutting-edge technologies into its defense systems. In parallel with Boeing Japan's research, ATLA continues to explore other initiatives to advance autonomous capabilities. This month, the agency issued public bids for the development of stealth UAVs for aerial refueling and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) designed for explosive handling and mine countermeasures. The outcomes of Boeing Japan's simulation tests will play a crucial role in shaping ATLA and JMOD’s decisions on selecting UAVs that best align with Japan's defense requirements. These efforts reflect the country’s focus on modernizing its military through international partnerships and autonomous technological advancements. This contract between Boeing Japan and ATLA highlights a pivotal moment in Japan’s development of autonomous military capabilities. As the country invests in collaborative technologies for its future aircraft, partnerships with nations like the United States emphasize the importance of a strategic approach to addressing evolving defense challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/development-of-combat-uavs-in-japan-through-strategic-partnership-with-boeing	2025-01-08T02:30:36-08:00

Morocco could soon become the first Arab nation to acquire US-made F-35 stealth fighter jets	According to Identité Juive on November 22, 2024, Morocco is reportedly progressing toward becoming the first Arab and African country to acquire F-35 stealth fighter jets from the United States. The U.S. Department of Defense is expected to finalize an agreement for the delivery of 32 F-35 Lightning IIs, at an estimated cost exceeding $17 billion over 45 years, covering both procurement and maintenance. If confirmed, this acquisition would expand the Royal Moroccan Air Force’s inventory, which is currently centered on fourth-generation F-16 aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, the Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. (Picture source: US DoD) To date, Arab African nations show mixed outcomes regarding the acquisition of F-35 fighter jets. Türkiye ordered 30 F-35As, with plans for up to 100, but purchases were halted in 2020 due to U.S. sanctions over Türkiye’s procurement of the Russian S-400 missile system. Four jets were delivered but remain withheld at Luke Air Force Base, and the U.S. stated in February 2024 that Türkiye could be readmitted to the F-35 program if it resolves the S-400 issue. The United Arab Emirates signed a deal in January 2021 for 50 F-35s as part of a $23 billion arms package, but in December 2021, the UAE unilaterally suspended the agreement, citing technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost concerns. A senior UAE official indicated in September 2024 that discussions with the U.S. over the F-35 are not expected to resume. Qatar expressed interest in the F-35 in 2020, but U.S. policy to maintain Israel's qualitative military edge has prevented progress. Saudi Arabia has shown interest in the F-35 since 2012 but has not advanced toward an agreement, with obstacles including U.S. concerns about regional stability, human rights issues, and Israel’s military edge, leading to the potential acquisition of 100 Turkish KAAN fighters. Regarding Morocco, negotiations for the deal reportedly took place between 2020 and 2022, with Morocco seeking Israel’s assistance to facilitate discussions with U.S. authorities. A meeting in November 2021 between Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Moroccan Defense Minister Abdellatif Loudiyi is cited as instrumental in advancing these negotiations. Rising tensions with Algeria—particularly regarding the Western Sahara conflict and Algeria’s support for the Polisario Front—are considered major factors driving Morocco’s interest in these aircraft. Algeria’s acquisition of Russian Su-57 stealth fighters has also reportedly influenced Morocco's decision. Algeria is reported to have signed a contract for the acquisition of 14 Su-57 fighter jets from Russia as part of a broader military agreement that includes Su-34 and Su-35 aircraft. The Su-57, designated as a fifth-generation stealth fighter, incorporates features such as reduced radar cross-section, advanced avionics, and enhanced maneuverability. This reported procurement would add to Algeria's existing fleet of Su-30MKA and Su-35 aircraft, reflecting its effort to modernize its air force. If the agreement is implemented, Algeria could become the first country outside Russia to receive the Su-57. This acquisition aligns with Algeria’s strategy to maintain a regional military balance with Morocco amid ongoing tensions over Western Sahara. Algeria’s potential acquisition of the Su-57 is considered a significant factor influencing Morocco’s decision to modernize its forces with a comparable or superior fifth-generation stealth fighter, such as the F-35. (Picture source: Russian social media) Since Morocco annexed the region in 1975, Algeria has supported the Polisario Front, which advocates for Western Sahara’s independence, by providing political backing and hosting Sahrawi refugees. Algeria frames this support as consistent with its regional policies and anti-colonial stance. Morocco claims Western Sahara as part of its territory and has proposed limited autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. Diplomatic relations between the two countries worsened in August 2021, when Algeria severed ties with Morocco, citing what it called 'hostile actions' related to the conflict. Morocco’s interest in the F-35 is therefore part of a broader effort to strengthen its defense capabilities in collaboration with Western allies, including the United States and Israel. This effort also includes acquisitions such as AH-64E Apache helicopters, M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks, Bradley armored vehicles, and MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. The F-35 was prominently featured at the 7th Marrakech Air Show, held from October 30 to November 2, 2024, under the High Patronage of King Mohammed VI and with the support of the Royal Moroccan Air Force. The event showcased over 300 exhibitors and hosted 100 international delegations. Morocco also displayed its first Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopter at the event, part of an order for 24 units currently in production. In a hypothetical aerial engagement between Algeria's Su-57 and Morocco's F-35 fighter jets, several factors would determine the outcome. The Su-57 is a fifth-generation stealth aircraft designed by Russia, capable of achieving speeds over Mach 2 and equipped with thrust-vectoring engines for enhanced maneuverability. The F-35, developed by the United States, prioritizes stealth and advanced avionics, with a low radar cross-section and integrated sensor fusion for improved situational awareness. The Su-57's agility could provide an advantage in close-range combat, while the F-35's stealth and sensor capabilities may allow it to detect and engage the Su-57 at a greater distance before being detected. This balance suggests that the F-35 could hold an advantage in beyond-visual-range scenarios, depending on the operational context and pilot expertise. The potential acquisition of Su-57 fighter jets by Algeria and F-35 aircraft by Morocco could shift the military balance in North Africa. Algeria's interest in the Su-57 appears aimed at countering Morocco's existing fleet of F-16s and its potential procurement of F-35s, raising the likelihood of a regional arms race. This development might prompt neighboring countries, such as Spain, to reassess their defense strategies, including the possible acquisition of F-35s to maintain strategic balance. The introduction of these advanced aircraft could impact the military equilibrium, increase tensions, and influence diplomatic relations within the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/morocco-could-soon-become-the-first-arab-nation-to-acquire-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-jets	2025-01-08T02:05:30-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands (Picture source: Naval Group) In 2023, orders amounted to €8.2 billion, a modest figure compared to the €27 billion recorded in 2022. Although this decline was disappointing, the Ministry of the Armed Forces emphasized that annual fluctuations are largely influenced by the signing of major contracts. Notably, the global context remained favorable, with military expenditures reaching a record $2.443 trillion, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). In 2024, the French defense industry rebounded strongly, with exports exceeding €18 billion. During a speech delivered at the Invalides courtyard on January 7, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu described 2024 as the 'second-best year in our history,' surpassing the €14 billion achieved in 2016. These results were driven by key platforms, including Rafale fighter jets, with significant contracts signed with Indonesia and Serbia, as well as Black Sword Barracuda submarines, four of which were ordered by the Netherlands. Despite these achievements, the minister emphasized the need to sustain efforts, pointing to promising prospects for 2025. Among them, he confirmed the sale of 14 Caracal helicopters to Iraq, though this figure raises questions. In September, Baghdad had announced a contract for 12 H225M Caracals, suggesting a potential additional order, though no further details have been provided. Looking ahead, Lecornu outlined priorities that include surface ships, particularly defense and intervention frigates, submarines, radars, artillery systems, helicopters, and Rafale jets. He also highlighted the strategic importance of the next-generation SAMP/T medium-range ground-based air defense system, designed to counter increasing ballistic threats, particularly from Iran and Russia. The minister reiterated that arms exports are critical for the BITD. Beyond supporting the trade balance and generating employment across France, they ensure national sovereignty by sustaining an industrial model developed in the 1960s. The results achieved in 2024 reflect the resilience and adaptability of the French defense industry. However, maintaining this momentum requires continued vigilance, particularly in a global context of evolving military expenditures and strategic challenges. With major opportunities already emerging, 2025 has the potential to further consolidate France’s position as a global leader in arms exports.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rafale-fighter-jets-and-barracuda-submarines-propel-french-arms-sales-in-2024	2025-01-08T01:53:54-08:00

Türkiye's acquisition of the S-400 system, finalized in 2017 after a failed attempt to obtain the U.S. Patriot system, has long been a point of friction in its relations with the United States and NATO. The $2.5 billion deal was partly motivated by Turkey’s desire for technology transfer and local production capabilities, which were not included in the U.S. Patriot offer. In contrast, the Russian offer allowed Turkey to access both the system and the possibility of locally producing similar technologies. Despite international opposition, including Türkiye's exclusion from the F-35 program and subsequent sanctions, the acquisition of the S-400 is seen by Ankara as essential to strengthening national defense. Türkiye's deployment of four S-400 batteries in strategic locations, including the southern border with Syria, is designed to protect critical infrastructure and strengthen air defense against regional aerial threats. As Türkiye continues to integrate the S-400 into its defense framework, it also signals a broader shift in its relations with NATO. The visit of NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to TUSAŞ, the Turkish aerospace company responsible for the development of the KAAN fighter jet, underscores the growing cooperation between Türkiye and the alliance. The integration of advanced defense technologies, such as the S-400, strengthens Turkey's position within NATO while contributing to the alliance's collective defense capabilities. Looking ahead, the S-400 system is expected to become a key element of Türkiye's air defense strategy, providing the country with a robust capability to counter a wide range of aerial threats. Its range of up to 400 kilometers makes it an indispensable tool for defending the geographically complex region Turkey occupies. The ongoing development of Turkey's multi-layered defense network, which includes the S-400, the SIPER system, and other technologies, will enhance its deterrence capabilities and solidify its defense posture in the face of evolving threats. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar summed up Türkiye's position by stating: 'Türkiye will continue investing in advanced technologies and protecting its national security, regardless of external pressures.' This commitment to strengthening its defense infrastructure through the integration of systems like the S-400 reinforces Türkiye's position as a key player in the international defense landscape. The integration of the S-400 into Türkiye's air defense network is not just a technical achievement but a strategic step toward enhancing national security.

Exclusive Analysis: North Korea’s Latest Hypersonic Missile Test Points to Possible Advanced Hwasong-16B Model	On January 6, 2025, North Korea successfully conducted the test launch of a hypersonic missile described by state media as a 'new model,' signaling a significant leap in its missile development program. The missile is similar to the Hwasong-16B hypersonic Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM), first unveiled in April last year, though it appears to have been upgraded with advanced materials and technologies. The missile reportedly traveled approximately 1,500 km (932 miles) at speeds exceeding Mach 12, reaching an altitude of nearly 100 k before striking a designated target in the East Sea. Defense analysts suggest this latest test underscores North Korea’s progress in refining its hypersonic capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korea's newly tested hypersonic missile, described as a 'new model,' shares similarities with the Hwasong-16B IRBM, first unveiled in April last year. (Picture source: North Korea press agency KCNA) The Hwasong-16B is considered one of North Korea's most advanced hypersonic missile systems, featuring a solid-fuel propulsion system that offers rapid launch readiness and greater mobility compared to traditional liquid-fuel missiles. This capability reduces detection and interception risks, giving the missile a strategic advantage. The upgraded version tested on Monday reportedly incorporates carbon-fiber composite materials, which enhance structural strength, thermal resistance, and aerodynamic efficiency. These improvements are particularly critical for sustaining hypersonic flight and ensuring successful re-entry during high-speed maneuvers. The latest design is believed to support a maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), a component aimed at evading missile defense systems with unpredictable flight paths. Hypersonic missiles are considered one of the most dangerous modern weapons due to their speed, maneuverability, and precision. Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic missiles can change course mid-flight, making them extremely difficult to detect and intercept. Traveling at speeds exceeding Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), they drastically reduce the reaction time available to adversaries. When equipped with conventional or nuclear warheads, their precision and destructive potential pose a severe threat to military assets, infrastructure, and population centers. This capability significantly destabilizes the global security landscape, as existing missile defense systems struggle to cope with the unique challenges posed by hypersonic weapons. Globally, several countries are investing heavily in hypersonic missile technology, driving an arms race in this domain. The United States is developing systems like the Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) and the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) to maintain its technological edge. These programs focus on precision-strike capabilities and the ability to target heavily defended regions. Russia, on the other hand, has operationalized systems like the Avangard and Kinzhal, boasting nuclear-capable hypersonic weapons with intercontinental reach. China has also achieved significant milestones, with the development of the DF-17, a medium-range missile equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle, highlighting its commitment to regional dominance. North Korea’s advancements in this field align with global trends, but its rapid progress raises concerns about unchecked proliferation. Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are also developing hypersonic systems, though their focus has been more on defensive applications and precision targeting. South Korea, for instance, is utilizing advanced ramjet propulsion and high-precision guidance systems to counter North Korea's growing missile threats. The race to develop hypersonic technology is fueled by its potential to disrupt existing military doctrines. Hypersonic missiles provide a combination of speed, range, and maneuverability that can bypass traditional air and missile defense systems, reshaping strategies for both offense and defense. As a result, these weapons are regarded not only as game-changers in modern warfare but also as destabilizing factors, intensifying global military competition and raising the risk of escalation in conflicts. While North Korea describes its new missile as a groundbreaking advancement, verification of its claimed performance metrics remains ongoing. Nevertheless, the refinement of the Hwasong-16B demonstrates Pyongyang’s clear intention to bolster its strategic deterrence capabilities and maintain its relevance in the hypersonic arms race. The increasing sophistication of hypersonic weapons worldwide underscores the need for international dialogue and cooperation to address the threats posed by this transformative technology.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-analysis-north-koreas-latest-hypersonic-missile-test-points-to-possible-advanced-hwasong-16b-model	2025-01-07T07:45:18-08:00

While these upgrades represent a technological improvement, some concerns have been raised regarding the weight of the new tanks and their effectiveness in preventing a potential Chinese amphibious landing. Troops arrived in armored personnel carriers, supported by Apache and S-70 helicopters providing reconnaissance and covering fire. Army Captain Chuang Yuan-cheng, of the 542nd Armored Brigade, explained that current capabilities allow a communication officer to coordinate aerial attacks from the ground. This ensures synchronization between ground and airborne firepower, reflecting efforts to enhance the interoperability of Taiwan's forces. The drills will continue on Wednesday with a demonstration of the Patriot III missile defense system, designed to counter Chinese ballistic missile threats. They will conclude on Thursday with anti-submarine exercises near Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest port. This strategically important area is considered a potential target for Chinese forces seeking to establish a supply foothold in the event of a conflict. Held annually ahead of the Lunar New Year, these exercises aim to reassure the Taiwanese public about the military's defensive capabilities while also supporting recruitment efforts. Concurrently, Taiwan is pursuing an ambitious military modernization program, including pending U.S. arms orders worth approximately $20 billion, upgrades to its F-16 fighter jets, and the development of domestically-produced submarines. Additionally, mandatory military service has recently been extended to one year to bolster troop numbers. However, a legislative proposal from the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, in cooperation with the Taiwan People's Party, threatens to reduce the defense budget by 28%. By altering the distribution of funds between the central and local governments, this measure could undermine Taiwan's ability to sustain its defense efforts. National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu has warned that such reductions might also weaken the willingness of allies like the United States, Japan, and the Philippines to assist Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China. Currently, Taiwan allocates approximately 2.4% of its GDP—around $20 billion—annually to defense spending. This investment regularly draws criticism from Beijing, which views U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as provocative. Although China has issued repeated warnings, calling these sales a 'dangerous game,' its responses have so far been limited to targeted economic sanctions on involved companies and frequent military displays near Taiwan. Despite this pressure, most Taiwanese continue to support the current state of de facto independence. In conclusion, these military drills take place in a context of rising internal and external tensions. While Taiwan strengthens its defensive capabilities to counter potential threats from China, uncertainties surrounding defense funding raise questions about the sustainability of its military posture in the long term.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/taiwan-conducts-military-drills-amid-concerns-over-defense-budget-cuts	2025-01-07T06:12:57-08:00

India to Upgrade Soviet-Era Anti-Aircraft Guns to Counter Drone Threats Along Borders	As part of its defense modernization strategy and efforts to address the growing threats posed by drones, India has initiated the development of specialized ammunition for two Russian-origin anti-aircraft systems, the ZU-23 and Schilka. This initiative aims to enhance the Indian Army's capabilities against the increasing drone threat while reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These munitions, designed for use with the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, will incorporate proximity fuse technology, enabling them to detonate near enemy drones (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) On January 2, 2025, the Indian Ministry of Defense issued a Request for Information (RFI) inviting local companies, both public and private, to submit proposals for the production of 23-mm anti-drone ammunition. These munitions, designed for use with the ZU-23 and Schilka systems, will incorporate proximity fuse technology, enabling them to detonate near enemy drones. This advancement seeks to address the limitations of existing munitions, which require a direct hit to neutralize targets. The ZU-23-2 is a Soviet-designed towed anti-aircraft gun adopted by India in the 1960s to bolster its close-range air defense. This system features two 23-mm automatic cannons mounted on a mobile platform, providing a combined rate of fire of approximately 2,000 rounds per minute. It uses 23 x 152 mm ammunition, including high-explosive incendiary tracer (HEI-T) and armor-piercing incendiary tracer (API-T) rounds. Primarily, the ZU-23-2 is deployed against low-flying aircraft and helicopters, as well as light ground targets. The ZSU-23-4 'Shilka' is a self-propelled anti-aircraft system introduced into the Indian arsenal in the 1970s. Mounted on a tracked chassis, it is armed with four 23-mm AZP-23 'Amur' automatic cannons, delivering a total firing rate of 3,400 rounds per minute. The Shilka is equipped with the RPK-2 'Tobol' radar, which provides aerial target detection and tracking capabilities over a range of up to 20 km.

Analysis: North Korea’s Hypersonic Missile Test Escalates Regional and Global Security Threats	On Monday, January 6, 2025, North Korea conducted a test launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) tipped with a hypersonic warhead, a move that has sharply elevated security concerns in the region and beyond. The missile, reportedly traveling 1,500 kilometers at a velocity of Mach 12—12 times the speed of sound—represents a significant escalation in Pyongyang’s missile technology. The test, personally supervised by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was described by state media as a pivotal step in bolstering the country’s defensive capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link North Korea test-fires a hypersonic missile on January 6, 2025, escalating regional and global security threats (Picture source: North Korea press agency) According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the hypersonic missile is designed to 'reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state.' The South Korean military, which detected the launch, confirmed the missile’s trajectory from the Pyongyang area and noted it flew approximately 1,100 kilometers before landing in the East Sea (Sea of Japan). This marked North Korea’s first missile test of 2025 and underscored its intent to continue advancing its weapons programs despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts. The test’s strategic implications are profound, particularly due to the hypersonic technology employed. Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5, but their defining feature is their ability to maneuver unpredictably during flight. This combination of speed and agility makes them exceptionally difficult to detect, track, and intercept using existing missile defense systems. North Korea’s reported success in achieving a speed of Mach 12 amplifies these challenges, as regional defense systems, such as the U.S.-deployed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea or Japan’s Aegis-equipped destroyers, would have little time to respond. The missile’s range of 1,500 kilometers also underscores its potential to strike critical U.S. military installations in the Pacific, including those in Guam. These bases serve as key hubs for U.S. operations in the Indo-Pacific, providing logistical and strategic support to regional allies. A credible hypersonic missile capability targeting these installations fundamentally shifts the balance of power in the region, directly challenging U.S. military supremacy and deterrence. For South Korea, the proximity to North Korea amplifies the threat. Hypersonic missiles reduce detection and response times to such an extent that key South Korean cities, military installations, and infrastructure are left highly vulnerable. South Korea’s current political instability further complicates the situation. Following a failed attempt to impose martial law, President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached, leaving the nation’s leadership in disarray. This internal crisis has weakened South Korea’s ability to respond cohesively to North Korea’s provocations, exposing significant gaps in its national security. The test also sends a strong message to the United States, which is in a transitional political phase as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office on January 20, 2025. Analysts suggest the timing of the test was deliberate, aimed at leveraging the period of U.S. political uncertainty to demonstrate North Korea’s growing military prowess. By showcasing its hypersonic capability, Pyongyang is signaling its readiness to challenge the new U.S. administration while positioning itself for future negotiations. The test’s implications for Japan are equally alarming. The missile’s flight path into the East Sea (Sea of Japan) highlights Japan’s vulnerability to North Korea’s missile arsenal. As a close U.S. ally and a key regional security player, Japan will likely face intensified pressure to upgrade its missile defense systems to counter the hypersonic threat. This could trigger a broader arms race in the Indo-Pacific as nations seek to develop advanced defensive and offensive capabilities in response to North Korea’s actions. On a broader scale, North Korea’s successful hypersonic missile test threatens to destabilize the regional security environment. Hypersonic weapons pose unique challenges to the existing global security architecture, as their speed and maneuverability undermine traditional missile defense systems. This development could accelerate the proliferation of hypersonic technologies, with other nations racing to match or counter North Korea’s advancements. The international community, particularly through the United Nations Security Council, faces the difficult task of addressing this latest provocation. However, longstanding divisions among major powers such as China, Russia, and the United States complicate the prospect of unified action. Meanwhile, regional allies like South Korea and Japan will need to invest heavily in next-generation missile defense systems, including space-based sensors and counter-hypersonic technologies, to address this emerging threat. The risks of miscalculation are also rising. The combination of North Korea’s provocative actions, South Korea’s political turmoil, and the U.S. leadership transition creates a volatile environment where even minor incidents could spiral into more significant conflicts. Monday’s hypersonic missile test marks a turning point in North Korea’s weapons program, signaling its growing capability to threaten regional stability and global security. As Pyongyang continues to refine its hypersonic technology, the urgency for a coordinated response by the United States, its allies, and the broader international community has never been greater. Without decisive action, North Korea’s advancements risk emboldening the regime and heightening tensions in an already precarious Indo-Pacific region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-north-koreas-hypersonic-missile-test-escalates-regional-and-global-security-threats	2025-01-07T01:00:27-08:00

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) program was initiated by the U.S. Marine Corps to modernize its amphibious assault capabilities, replacing the aging Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV), which had been in service since 1972. The contract for the ACV program was awarded to BAE Systems in 2018 after a competitive bidding process. The Marine Corps signed a $198 million contract with BAE for the production of the ACVs, which was later expanded to more than $5 billion to cover full-rate production and the procurement of over 1,000 vehicles. The ACV is designed to provide enhanced protection, mobility, and firepower, making it a crucial asset for modern amphibious operations. The vehicle is capable of carrying a 13-man infantry squad while offering greater survivability and faster speeds than its predecessor, the AAV. The ACV family includes multiple variants to address various operational needs, such as the ACV-1.1 (the base amphibious assault vehicle), ACV Command &amp; Control, ACV Recovery, and ACV Engineer variants. Additionally, the Marine Corps has plans to develop an ACV-30 variant equipped with a 30mm cannon to provide greater fire support in amphibious and ground combat operations. The ACV’s 8x8 wheeled chassis provides significant mobility both in water and on land, with the vehicle capable of speeds up to 45 mph on land and 8-10 knots in water. This program is a cornerstone of the Marine Corps' modernization efforts, ensuring that Marines can project power quickly and effectively in contested littoral zones and maintain a flexible, responsive presence across the globe. The ACV program began with the fielding of the new platform in Fleet Marine Force units at Camp Pendleton, California, in November 2022. The ACV has undergone nearly two years of rigorous testing and evaluation, designed to provide enhanced mobility, survivability, and operational capabilities compared to the aging AAV. Its first overseas operational deployment took place in Okinawa, Japan, with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) on June 24, 2024. Just a few days later, on June 29, III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) units received their own ACVs, marking the start of a new chapter in the Marine Corps’ amphibious operations. The Marine Corps has long recognized the need for robust amphibious capabilities, which remain central to its role as the nation’s expeditionary force in readiness. The ability to project power from the sea and conduct amphibious assaults is a core tenet of U.S. military doctrine, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, where contested littoral zones, rapid maneuvering, and the need for crisis response are critical. The transition from the AAV to the ACV is a response to these evolving demands, enhancing the Marine Corps’ ability to project power quickly and effectively from the sea to shore. The ACV was developed to modernize the Marine Corps’ amphibious assault capabilities. Unlike the AAV, which had limitations in terms of survivability, mobility, and communications, the ACV is designed with enhanced protection against land-based and maritime threats, greater speed, and improved maneuverability. It also offers superior communications capabilities, allowing Marines to maintain connectivity in challenging environments. The ACV can operate in a wide range of environments, including high-threat areas, urban combat zones, and areas with harsh environmental conditions, making it a versatile and essential asset for modern amphibious operations. The Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) is the U.S. Marine Corps’ next-generation amphibious assault platform, designed to replace the aging Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV). (Picture U.S. The performance of the ACV at Kushi Crossing was a critical part of its integration into ongoing training and operations in Okinawa. According to 1st Lt. Jacob Yehl, the ACV platoon commander of 4th Marines, the mission was to validate the suitability of various training areas and beach landing sites (BLSs) for ACV operations. 'Since the ACV has been fielded here in July, these training areas have not yet been transited by ACVs or validated,' Yehl explained. 'Our mission here today, and on this rotation, is to make sure all of those training areas and BLSs are trafficable and supportable for ACV operations in the future.' The operation involved conducting amphibious exercises under varying conditions, including low tide, high tide, and low-light situations, ensuring that ACVs can perform effectively in a wide range of operational environments. Kushi Crossing is a particularly important site in Okinawa, as it provides the only entry point into the Central Training Area, a critical region for the integration of ACVs into larger training exercises. The ability of the ACVs to operate effectively at this location demonstrates their versatility and operational readiness. The ACV platoon’s central mission is to provide ship-to-shore lift for infantry and support the reinforcement of their assault as they move inland to key objectives. The transition from the AAV to the ACV is a significant one for many Marines, who have years of experience operating the older platform. Staff Sergeant Juwan White, a section leader in the ACV platoon, shared his perspective on this transition. 'I remember eight years ago I was driving an AAV from Recon Beach, Camp Schwab here to Kushi, regularly,' White recalled. 'Now here I am today doing the same thing with an ACV for the very first time for the next generations of Marines to do.' This shift reflects a broader modernization effort within the Marine Corps, ensuring that future Marines will be equipped with more capable and advanced vehicles for amphibious assault missions. The Marine Corps’ emphasis on maintaining robust amphibious capabilities is reflected in the strategic importance of units like the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The ACVs from the 4th Marine Regiment are attached to the 31st MEU, which is based at Camp Hansen, Okinawa. The 31st MEU is the Marine Corps' rapid-response force in the Indo-Pacific region, capable of responding to a wide range of contingencies, from humanitarian assistance to full-scale combat operations. The addition of the ACVs to the 31st MEU significantly enhances the unit’s amphibious capabilities, particularly in conducting ship-to-shore lift and supporting combat operations on land. As a rapid-response force, the 31st MEU is poised to provide a flexible and capable presence in the region, capable of responding quickly to emerging crises or conflicts. In addition to their role with the 31st MEU, the ACVs play a crucial part in the Marine Corps’ larger strategy for crisis response and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. The region is home to key U.S. allies, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, and is increasingly the focus of geopolitical competition. With tensions rising in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and other strategic areas, the Marine Corps’ ability to project power from the sea through amphibious operations is seen as a critical component of U.S. national security. The ability of the ACV to operate effectively in the Indo-Pacific region is crucial for maintaining the U.S. military’s amphibious capabilities and strengthening partnerships with regional allies. Staff Sgt. White emphasized the significance of the recent training at Kushi Crossing, stating, 'The primary message of the training we conducted is that we’ve proven and shown that ACVs belong here in Okinawa for III MEF to have at their disposal.' This reflects the growing confidence in the ACV as a reliable and integral part of the Marine Corps’ amphibious operations. As the ACV program continues to expand and evolve, it will play a central role in the U.S. Marine Corps’ strategy for amphibious warfare, ensuring that Marines are equipped with the most advanced and capable platforms for responding to future threats. The successful completion of the training mission in Okinawa demonstrates the operational effectiveness of the ACV and highlights its importance for future military operations in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. With its enhanced protection, mobility, and operational flexibility, the ACV is poised to play a key role in the Marine Corps’ ongoing efforts to maintain a strong and responsive amphibious force capable of confronting any challenge in today’s complex security environment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-marines-amphibious-combat-vehicle-completes-first-open-water-amphibious-movement-in-japan	2025-01-06T02:06:37-08:00

Iran to Enter Russian Su-35 Fighter Jets into Service by 2025 Strengthening Air Power	Based on a report from the Iran Observer X account on January 4, 2025, Iran is preparing to integrate Russia's cutting-edge Su-35 fighter jets into its air force by 2025. The Sukhoi Su-35, a multirole 4.5-generation fighter, will bolster Iran's aging fleet, significantly enhancing its aerial capabilities. This move follows a growing military partnership between Iran and Russia, especially in light of their close cooperation during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Su-35 fighter jet will enter service with the Iranian Air Force by 2025, enhancing Iran's air power amid growing military cooperation with Russia. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The Russian Su-35 fighter jets deal, which has been in the works for several years, is a key milestone in the evolving defense relations between Iran and Russia. The announcement of this delivery follows earlier reports that Russia would supply these advanced fighter jets to Iran in exchange for Tehran's support in the form of military supplies, notably drones. Satellite imagery has confirmed the construction of special shelters at Iran's 3rd Tactical Air Base near Hamadan, designed to accommodate the Su-35s.While Iranian officials have not confirmed the exact number of Su-35s to be delivered, various reports suggest the first batch could consist of around 24 aircraft. The jets are expected to be in service by 2025, with the potential for further acquisitions in the future. This acquisition marks a substantial upgrade for the Iranian Air Force, which has long struggled with outdated fighter jets. The Su-35, often referred to as the 'Flanker-E,' is one of Russia's most advanced fighter jets. It is a multirole, twin-engine, air superiority aircraft capable of engaging in both aerial combat and ground attack missions. The Su-35 is equipped with a powerful Irbis-E radar, advanced avionics, and the ability to carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. This gives it a significant edge over many of Iran's current aircraft, such as the aging F-4 Phantom and MiG-29 fighters. The Su-35's thrust vectoring engines allow for superior maneuverability in combat, while its long-range radar and ability to engage multiple targets at once make it a formidable opponent. Its advanced electronic warfare capabilities and data fusion systems will also enhance Iran's overall air defense network. Currently, the Iranian Air Force operates a mixed fleet of mostly older jets, many of which date back to the 1970s and 1980s. The F-14A Tomcat, acquired before the 1979 revolution, is still a core component of Iran's air force, though it has suffered from technical issues and limited operational readiness. In addition to the F-14s, Iran flies F-4 Phantom IIs, MiG-29s, and Soviet-era Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, all of which are nearing the end of their operational life. Iran's reliance on these older aircraft has made air superiority a challenge, especially in the face of modern, western-supplied aircraft in neighboring countries. The arrival of the Su-35s will provide a much-needed boost to Iran’s air capabilities and help it assert greater control over its airspace. The delivery of Su-35s to Iran is part of a broader shift in military cooperation between the two countries. Iran has been supplying Russia with advanced drones for use in the Ukraine conflict, and in return, Russia has provided Iran with significant military technology. The Su-35 deal is a further sign of the growing strategic alignment between Tehran and Moscow, driven in part by their mutual interests in countering Western influence in the Middle East and the broader region. This partnership comes at a time when Russia is increasingly isolated on the global stage due to its actions in Ukraine, and Iran, too, has faced extensive sanctions. Both nations are turning to each other for defense supplies, with Russia also providing Iran with sophisticated air defense systems like the S-400 and the Tor-M2. Integrating Su-35s into the Iranian Air Force marks a new phase in the country's military modernization. While the acquisition will undoubtedly enhance Iran’s combat capabilities, experts note that the number of Su-35s may still be insufficient to fully rival regional adversaries' air power. However, the strategic value of the jets, combined with Iran’s increasing drone capabilities, suggests that Tehran will be better equipped to deter potential threats and assert its regional ambitions. As Iran continues to strengthen its air capabilities, the implications for regional security will be profound, with neighboring countries likely reassessing their defense postures in light of these developments. The deeper military ties between Iran and Russia may also lead to further arms deals, creating a new dynamic in the Middle East's volatile security environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/iran-to-enter-russian-su-35-fighter-jets-into-service-by-2025-strengthening-air-power	2025-01-05T07:57:46-08:00

The Mirage 2000-5F is also known for its exceptional agility and performance. Lighter and more maneuverable than the heavier MiG-29 and Su-27, the Mirage 2000-5F offers Ukrainian pilots greater precision and flexibility in close combat situations. This advantage will prove vital as they face Russia's fast-moving fighter jets and complex air defense systems. Additionally, the Mirage 2000-5F has an extended operational range, allowing it to conduct deeper strikes into Russian-held territory or provide extended air cover for Ukrainian ground forces, making it more effective in various operational contexts than the MiG-29 and Su-27, which have more limited ranges. The introduction of the Mirage 2000-5F into Ukraine’s air force is not only a boost to its aerial combat capability but also a significant shift in the balance of air power in the region. With its advanced radar, missile systems, and overall performance, the Mirage 2000-5F will give Ukraine a strategic tool to challenge Russia’s aerial dominance in the ongoing conflict. While Ukraine has already received various Western-supplied aircraft, including French-designed Mirages will further complement existing systems and improve interoperability with NATO forces, whose equipment and tactics Ukraine is increasingly adopting. The final delivery of the Mirage 2000-5F is expected to mark another step in the growing military cooperation between France and Ukraine, cementing France's role as a key supporter of Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty. As additional Western support is expected to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities throughout 2025, the arrival of these advanced fighter jets represents a key milestone in Ukraine's efforts to strengthen its military infrastructure in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/breaking-news-france-to-deliver-first-mirage-2000-5f-fighter-jets-to-ukraine-by-march-2025	2025-01-05T07:31:09-08:00	
Exclusive report: Israeli Special Forces Unveil Secret Operation Many Ways Targeting Iranian Missile Factory in Syria	On January 2, 2025, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) revealed an extraordinary operation in Syria on September 8, 2024, through a video publication showcasing the historic mission. The operation, dubbed 'Operation Many Ways,' involved a daring and highly secretive assault aimed at dismantling an Iranian-funded underground missile production facility located in the Masyaf region, Syria.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from IDF video showing Israeli Special Forces from the Shaldag Unit infiltrating the Iranian missile development site in Syria during 'Operation Many Ways. (Picture source: Israeli Defense Forces) The video, released by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), provided exclusive footage and insights into the complexity and success of this high-stakes operation. The target, known as 'Deep Layer,' was a key site in the development and production of precision-guided munitions used by Iranian-backed forces and supplied to Hezbollah in Lebanon. The operation was conducted by an elite Israeli special forces unit, the Shaldag Unit, in coordination with the Israeli Air Force (IAF) and the Israeli Navy. The Shaldag Unit is part of Israel’s air force and specializes in special operations, including counter-terrorism, intelligence gathering, and sabotage missions behind enemy lines. Their role in this mission was vital, as the operation required highly skilled soldiers capable of conducting high-risk covert operations. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The operation, which has now been disclosed to the public, was a joint effort by multiple Israeli military branches, including the elite Shaldag Unit of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), as well as the IAF and Israeli Navy. With intelligence confirming that the Syrian regime, still under Bashar al-Assad's control at the time, had allowed Iranian forces to use this facility, the IDF decided to take decisive action. The mission aimed to eliminate one of Iran’s flagship projects for arming Hezbollah and other regional adversaries. The Israeli commandos, numbering approximately 120 soldiers, included a substantial contingent from the Shaldag Unit, an elite air force special operations unit, as well as members from Unit 669, an expert combat search-and-rescue force. The mission’s objective was to destroy the 'Deep Layer' facility, a subterranean complex that had been a critical hub for Iran’s missile production activities in Syria. In the evening hours of September 8, 2024, Israeli forces initiated their covert operation. The target site was located more than 200 kilometers from the Israeli border, deep within Syrian territory and around 45 kilometers from the Syrian coast. The team, comprising 100 Shaldag soldiers and 20 Unit 669 operators, embarked on the mission aboard four large transport helicopters. The operation’s execution was as complex as it was daring. The transport helicopters, along with two additional helicopters providing close air support, made their way across the Mediterranean Sea, skirting Lebanon’s coastline before crossing into Syria. To provide maximum support, the IDF mobilized 21 fighter jets, five drones, and 14 reconnaissance aircraft. The latter, along with additional Israeli aircraft kept in reserve, provided surveillance, air cover, and immediate response capabilities in case the operation encountered unexpected resistance. As the helicopters approached the Syrian coastline, the IDF forces maintained a low altitude flight to avoid detection by Syrian radar and anti-aircraft defenses. The 18-minute flight from the Lebanese coast to the target area was executed under complete secrecy, with additional bombing operations carried out by the IAF and the Israeli Navy to create distractions and mask the movements of the special forces. Upon reaching the facility, the commandos swiftly infiltrated the underground complex and planted explosives to neutralize the target. The mission was executed with precision, and the explosives were detonated in a massive blast that was felt by some soldiers like a 'mini-earthquake.' The entire operation lasted approximately two and a half hours, and it was reported that at least 30 Syrian soldiers guarding the facility were killed during the attack. Remarkably, the operation resulted in no casualties on the Israeli side. None of the Shaldag Special Forces or Unit 669 personnel were injured during the mission, despite the dangerous and high-risk environment they were operating in. The precision of the assault, coupled with the overwhelming air and ground support provided by the Israeli military, ensured that the special forces completed their task without facing significant resistance. The Israeli military confirmed that, following the operation, the 'Deep Layer' facility was rendered non-operational and that Iran had completely withdrawn from Syria after the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. The site, once a critical asset in Iran's efforts to supply advanced weaponry to Hezbollah, was no longer in use, marking a significant strategic victory for Israel in its ongoing efforts to counter Iranian influence in the region. 'Operation Many Ways' represents a major achievement for the Israeli military, underscoring the effectiveness of Israel's Special Forces and its ability to carry out highly sophisticated operations deep behind enemy lines. With the destruction of the 'Deep Layer' missile production facility, the IDF dealt a significant blow to Iran's efforts to arm its regional proxies, particularly Hezbollah. The success of the operation also serves as a testament to the tight coordination between Israeli military units, the IAF, and the Israeli Navy, ensuring that Israel’s national security interests are safeguarded in an increasingly volatile region. As the situation in Syria continues to evolve, the consequences of this operation reverberate across the Middle East, sending a clear message to Iran and its allies about Israel's determination and capability to act swiftly and decisively against any threats to its security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-report-israeli-special-forces-unveil-operation-many-ways-targeting-iranian-missile-factory-in-syria	2025-01-05T03:51:40-08:00

When weather conditions allowed, the helicopter conducted surveillance and captured imagery of both the Russian ships and HMS Somerset’s operations. Context The Russian shadow fleet represents a covert network of vessels employed by Russia to bypass international sanctions, particularly targeting its oil exports. This fleet has grown substantially following the imposition of sanctions in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, now comprising over 1,100 vessels, including many aging tankers acquired to sustain oil transportation. Operating under flags of convenience from countries with lax maritime regulations and employing opaque ownership structures, the fleet uses deceptive practices such as disabling Automatic Identification Systems, conducting ship-to-ship transfers in remote waters, and falsifying cargo documentation. These activities enable the fleet to obscure the origins and destinations of shipments. The shadow fleet poses significant risks across various domains. Environmentally, its reliance on old and poorly maintained vessels raises the potential for spills and other ecological disasters, as seen in incidents like the December 2024 oil spill in the Black Sea. From a maritime safety perspective, the clandestine nature of its operations, including AIS blackouts, increases the likelihood of collisions and accidents, threatening maritime traffic and coastal communities. There is also a security dimension, as the fleet could be leveraged for military purposes, such as transporting equipment or personnel, heightening concerns among NATO members and other global powers. Efforts to counter the shadow fleet include initiatives by Western nations to disrupt its operations and enforce sanctions more rigorously. However, despite these measures, the fleet continues to operate.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-warships-monitored-near-uk-by-hms-somerset-over-holidays	2025-01-03T06:18:18-08:00
