Poland and US Inaugurate New NATO Missile Defense Base Previously Criticized by Russia	On October 13, 2024, American and Polish officials inaugurated a NATO Aegis Ashore missile defense base in Poland, marking a significant step forward in security for both the region and NATO as a whole, amid the ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine. Located in Redzikowo in northern Poland, the base was originally conceived under the George W. Bush administration to counter potential ballistic threats from Iran. For Poland, however, this installation primarily serves as a strategic shield against Russia—a priority that has intensified following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Equipped with the advanced Aegis Ashore system from the U.S. Navy, the base is designed to detect, track, and intercept ballistic missiles in flight, enhancing NATO's airspace security in Europe. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Redzikowo now becomes the second ground-based installation in Europe to feature the Aegis Ashore system, complementing the site in Deveselu, Romania, which has been operational since 2016 (Picture source: NATO) The Aegis Ashore system, central to Redzikowo's defense capabilities, relies on the AN/SPY-1 radar, a multifunctional radar with electronic scanning that can simultaneously detect and track numerous airborne and surface targets, providing continuous 360-degree surveillance. The SM-3 interceptors are anti-ballistic missiles specifically designed to destroy enemy missiles in their mid-flight phase, intercepting them while still in the exo-atmospheric layer. These interceptors use direct-impact technology to collide with the target at high speed, effectively neutralizing potential threats. Together, these elements provide Redzikowo with a robust defense against ballistic missile threats, reinforcing the security of Poland and NATO overall. Polish leaders, along with the U.S. ambassador and senior officials, have described the inauguration as a historic moment, viewing it as an increased U.S. commitment to European security. Polish President Andrzej Duda, present at Redzikowo, emphasized that the base demonstrates Poland’s departure from the Russian sphere of influence, declaring that 'the entire world will clearly see that this is no longer within Russia’s sphere of interest.' Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz further described the base as a 'remarkable' milestone for the security of Poland, the United States, and NATO, also noting the current conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that underscore the importance of modern air defense systems. Redzikowo now becomes the second ground-based installation in Europe to feature the Aegis Ashore system, complementing the site in Deveselu, Romania, which has been operational since 2016. This missile shield is part of a broader defense network that includes U.S. Navy destroyers stationed in Rota, Spain, also equipped with similar Aegis defense capabilities, as well as an advanced radar in Kurecik, Turkey. Together, these installations enhance NATO's capacity to intercept short- to medium-range ballistic missiles, providing an additional layer of protection for European populations, territories, and allied forces. On the Russian side, this new installation has not been well received. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denounced the facility, asserting that it challenges Russia’s security. He accused the United States of using the 'ephemeral' threat from Iran as a cover for its true purpose, suggesting that the base actually aims to contain Russia militarily. According to Moscow, advancing American military infrastructure closer to Russian borders is an attempt to curb its strategic capabilities, prompting Russia to consider 'parity' measures to restore balance. Despite NATO’s assurances that this is a purely defensive installation, military sources indicated that the system in Poland is currently calibrated to counter missiles from the Middle East. To intercept Russian missiles, a reconfiguration of the radar would be required—a complex operation that would also entail a defense policy revision. Polish Defense Minister Kosiniak-Kamysz has expressed interest in expanding the shield’s operational scope, a subject that will be discussed with NATO and the United States to better address current security needs in Eastern Europe. In this context, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is scheduled to meet with President Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Warsaw to further strengthen security cooperation among member states. Ultimately, the Redzikowo base stands as a powerful symbol of military cooperation between Poland and the United States—a partnership Poland considers essential to its national defense amid recent political uncertainties. It not only bolsters Poland’s security but also contributes to the broader security of Europe, adding a strategic layer of deterrence amid ongoing tensions with Russia and underscoring NATO’s commitment to regional stability.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-and-us-inaugurate-new-nato-missile-defense-base-previously-criticized-by-russia	2024-11-14T03:09:37-08:00

Lockheed Martin Develops New Rocket Launcher to Modernize US Army Artillery Capabilities	During the US Army’s Human-Machine Integration Summit IV, held at Texas A&amp;M University, Lockheed Martin recently introduced a mobile launcher concept. This new launcher, capable of carrying up to 24 227mm guided artillery rockets, is designed for integration on a 10×10 Marine Corps LVSR truck, potentially supporting various munitions. Among the compatible systems could be surface-to-air interceptors, ATACMS short-range ballistic missiles, and PrSM missiles. If implemented, this launcher may provide both offensive and defensive capabilities through a mobile logistics platform.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lockheed Martin displayed the launcher on a Marine Corps MKR18 LVSR truck, structurally similar to the Army’s M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS), both produced by Oshkosh Defense. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin via The War Zone) The prototype displayed uses the Marine Corps MKR18 LVSR truck, a vehicle similar in structure to the Army’s M1075 Palletized Load System (PLS), with both vehicles produced by Oshkosh Defense. There are suggestions of a potential connection to the earlier Palletized Field Artillery Launcher (PFAL) program, aimed at enhancing logistical vehicles with artillery functions. The launcher’s expanded capacity, potentially carrying up to 24 rockets, quadruples the payload of current HIMARS systems. This modular design could support munitions from the MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM), such as GMLRS, ATACMS, and PrSM missiles. Initial configurations may allow for six GMLRS rockets, two PrSMs, or one ATACMS per module, with potential expansion to PrSM variants, including those with ranges up to 1,000 kilometers and options for anti-ship targeting. The U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC) has ongoing modernization projects that could align with this launcher’s capabilities. Among these are the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) initiative, targeting a range increase from the existing 30 kilometers to over 70 kilometers, and the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), operational since 2023, intended as a replacement for the ATACMS. The PrSM program may evolve to include the capability for engaging moving targets. AFC is also working on the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), which aims to engage distant, high-value targets. Another AFC project, the Autonomous Multi-Domain Launcher (AML), involves an unmanned HIMARS variant designed to improve operational flexibility while minimizing personnel exposure. The launcher’s configuration allows for potential integration of various interceptors, indicating a dual capability for both artillery and air defense. Compatible interceptors may include those from the PAC-3 family, AIM-9X, and Tamir interceptors used in Iron Dome systems. The LVSR platform has previously demonstrated capacity for large payloads, such as serving as a launcher for DARPA’s OpFires hypersonic missile project. If integrated as projected, this launcher would connect with the Army’s Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), facilitating coordination with radar and sensor networks to provide a comprehensive defense against aerial and missile threats. However, its larger structure might reduce mobility in comparison to the HIMARS system, which is optimized for deployment via C-130 transport. The U.S. Army Futures Command is actively focused on advancing MLRS capabilities to enhance range, precision, and adaptability. The ERCA system aims to extend artillery reach beyond 70 kilometers, a significant increase from current systems’ ranges. The PrSM, compatible with both the M270 MLRS and M142 HIMARS, is designed to double the missile capacity per launcher while providing improved accuracy. With operational capability achieved in 2023, the PrSM may be adapted in the future for engaging moving targets. The LRHW program, a collaborative project across military branches, is focused on developing a ground-launched hypersonic missile system for engaging high-value targets over extended ranges. Finally, the AML initiative involves developing unmanned, remote-controlled HIMARS variants to improve operational flexibility and reduce personnel risks in artillery missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/lockheed-martin-develops-new-rocket-launcher-to-modernize-us-army-artillery-capabilities	2024-11-14T01:39:54-08:00	
First Combat Deployment of US F-35C Fighters in Strategic Strikes Against Houthis in Yemen	Amid rising tensions in the Middle East, the United States mobilized its air power for targeted strikes against military infrastructure controlled by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. On the night of November 10–11, 2024, combat aircraft, including F-35Cs from the U.S. Marine Corps deployed aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, participated in an operation led by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). This mission marked the first combat engagement of F-35Cs in an active theater. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35C Lightning II from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 joined the USS Abraham Lincoln in 2022 to deploy as part of Carrier Strike Group 3 (Picture source: US DoD) The F-35C Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole fighter designed for carrier-based operations. It features advanced stealth technology for low radar visibility and is powered by the F135-PW-100 engine, enabling it to reach speeds of up to Mach 1.6. With a wingspan of 13.1 meters and a length of 15.7 meters, it can carry up to 8,160 kg of payload, including AIM-120C/D and AIM-9X air-to-air missiles, GBU-31 JDAM and GBU-12 LGB guided bombs, as well as AGM-154 JSOWs. Equipped with the AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the F-35C provides advanced detection and tracking capabilities. Its AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare suite offers protection against electronic threats, while the AN/AAQ-40 electro-optical targeting system (EOTS) ensures precise targeting. These systems, along with sophisticated sensor fusion, grant the F-35C unparalleled situational awareness, enhancing its lethality and survivability in combat. The targets included weapons storage facilities in Houthi-controlled areas, where advanced conventional arms used to target both military and civilian vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden were reportedly stored. According to Pentagon spokesperson General Pat Ryder, these strikes directly responded to Houthi attacks on American, commercial, and allied vessels. Ryder stated that the U.S. would maintain pressure on the Houthis to prevent future attacks. This operation involved multiple aircraft, including the F-35C, F/A-18F Super Hornet, and EA-18G Growler electronic warfare plane, all deployed from the USS Abraham Lincoln. While the strikes were initially attributed to the Navy, it was later confirmed that the F-35Cs involved were part of the Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 (VMFA-314), the 'Black Knights,' the first F-35C squadron to be deployed aboard the Lincoln. The deployment of the F-35C in combat represents a significant milestone for this stealth aircraft variant, which was first operational in 2019 and had its initial deployment in 2021. Until this mission, the F-35C had not seen active combat, unlike the earlier F-35B and F-35A versions, which were deployed in 2018 and 2019 for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively. In response, the Houthis launched an extensive attack on November 11. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance were targeted by eight kamikaze drones, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and three anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were successfully intercepted without damage or casualties. The military capabilities of the Houthis, bolstered by Iranian weapons and technology transfers, continue to raise international concern. A recent U.N. report highlighted that Iranian support has enabled the Houthis to become a formidable military force with capabilities far beyond those of a typical armed group. It is also suggested that Russia may be providing intelligence and anti-ship missiles to the Houthis. These American strikes and recent interceptions underscore the complex security landscape in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The United States has strengthened its military posture to secure these critical maritime routes amid increasingly sophisticated threats. The deployment of F-35Cs in this conflict reflects a strategic evolution in U.S. military presence in the region and demonstrates its ability to counter diverse threats posed by Iran-backed Houthi forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/first-combat-deployment-of-us-f-35c-fighters-in-strategic-strikes-against-houthis-in-yemen	2024-11-14T01:37:09-08:00

Teledyne FLIR Defense wins US Army contract to upgrade NBCRV Sensor Suite for CBRN Threat Detection	According to a PR published by Teledyne FLIR Defense on November 12, 2024, the subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, has secured a substantial $168.3 million Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with the U.S. Army for the modernization of the Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) Sensor Suite on the M1135 Stryker platform.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The NBCRV sensor suite includes the FLIR Defense R80D SkyRaider UAV integrated with FLIR's MUVE B330 biological detection payload, designed for small unmanned aerial systems. (Picture source: US Army) The initial delivery order under this contract, valued at $7.5 million, paves the way for low-rate initial production of the upgraded NBCRV Sensor Suite, with work scheduled to continue through 2029. The modernization program aims to provide autonomous detection capabilities, significantly improving the effectiveness and speed of identifying and mitigating hazardous substances in operational environments. Teledyne FLIR Defense is at the forefront as the lead integrator for these sensor upgrades, introducing advanced CBRN sensors with enhanced automation features to ease the cognitive load on military personnel and improve decision-making. Prior to this contract, Teledyne FLIR had delivered prototype sensor suites for government testing, which produced successful outcomes, leading to this substantial production contract. A standout feature of the upgraded NBCRV system is its integration of the FLIR Defense R80D SkyRaider™ drone, equipped with the MUVE™ B330 biological detection payload. This configuration enables a robust small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) platform designed for remote biological detection, enhancing the mobility and reach of the NBCRV’s CBRN capabilities. A comprehensive command and control system developed by FLIR will centralize and streamline the operation of all sensors and devices on the NBCRV platform. This system employs sensor fusion and automation to improve situational awareness, reduce operational strain on troops, and accelerate response times. This modernization of the NBCRV Sensor Suite will serve as a critical line of defense for U.S. military personnel, enhancing mission safety and operational efficacy in hazardous and complex environments. In the context of the battlefield, NRBC threats—covering nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical dangers—pose significant and complex challenges to military operations. These threats require a comprehensive approach to ensure the safety and effectiveness of military personnel under high-risk conditions. Nuclear and radiological threats involve both the devastating explosive power of nuclear devices and the contamination hazards associated with dispersed radioactive materials, creating long-term risks to health and environment. Such hazards can severely impact military logistics and limit troop movement in affected areas, as the long-lasting contamination zones disrupt both operational strategy and area security. Biological threats, by contrast, use infectious agents to disable or kill through disease outbreaks, often with a stealthy onset that complicates early detection. These pathogens can spread quickly, endangering troops and civilians alike, necessitating rapid medical response and quarantine measures. Chemical threats, using toxins to cause immediate physical harm, challenge forces to act under restrictive conditions where protective suits, masks, and decontamination protocols are essential but often burdensome.

Türkiye Continues to Strengthen Its Air Force with Acquisition of 40 F-16 Viper Fighters	Türkiye’s Defense Minister, Yaşar Güler, has confirmed the signing of a contract to purchase 40 F-16 'Viper' fighter jets from the United States, marking a new milestone in defense relations between Türkiye and its American allies. This contract, announced in an interview by TV100, on November 12, 2024, follows several years of discussions and changes in Türkiye’s acquisition plans, which were initially disrupted when Türkiye was excluded from the F-35 program due to its purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-16 'Viper' fighter jets from the United State. (Picture source: US DoD) Following its exclusion from the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program in 2019, Türkiye initially demanded $1.4 billion in compensation. However, in 2021, Türkiye reoriented its strategy, seeking authorization to acquire 40 F-16 Vipers along with 79 modernization kits for its fleet of older-generation F-16s. This proposal encountered resistance within the U.S. Congress, although it received support from the Biden administration, which viewed the sale as leverage to encourage Türkiye to facilitate Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) had given its approval for this potential sale, which included not only the F-16Vs but also AIM-9X Block II missiles, AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles, and GBU-39/B bombs, with an estimated value of $23 billion. However, Türkiye adjusted its plans and, in addition to the F-16 order, expressed its intention to procure 40 Eurofighter Typhoon EF-2000s, with support from the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, despite initial opposition from Germany. German authorities ultimately lifted their objections, paving the way for a potential order of the Typhoons. Yaşar Güler, speaking in an interview with TV100, stated, 'Currently, our relations with our American friends are very positive. The contracts for the acquisition of 40 F-16 Vipers are signed. We will also acquire 40 Eurofighter Typhoons.' However, he did not specify the total contract amount or the delivery schedule for these new aircraft. Meanwhile, Türkiye continues to develop its fifth-generation fighter, the Kaan, which made its maiden flight last February. However, without new fighter acquisitions, the modernization of Türkiye’s air force could face challenges amidst regional threats, especially as Iran encounters similar issues. For its part, Greece, a historical rival of Türkiye, has already taken steps to bolster its capabilities by ordering Rafale jets and upgrading part of its F-16 fleet to the 'Viper' standard. The F-16 Block 70/72 'Viper' is equipped with advanced technology, including an APG-83 SABR active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an advanced mission computer, a 'Center Pedestal Display' for terrain following, and enhanced connectivity via Link 16, making it particularly suitable for modern operations. This new equipment is expected to provide the Turkish Air Force with increased operational capability, enabling Ankara to strengthen its role within NATO while diversifying its defense procurement sources. The dual acquisition of F-16s and Eurofighter Typhoons underscores Turkey's determination to maintain high-level air capabilities in a strategic environment where regional rivalries and alliances play a crucial role.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/tuerkiye-continues-to-strengthen-its-air-force-with-acquisition-of-40-f-16-viper-fighters	2024-11-14T00:47:42-08:00	
Belgium Discusses Arming MQ-9B SkyGuardian Drones in Defense Committee	The debate over arming military drones has resurfaced in Belgium, with discussions held on November 13, 2024, during a Defense Committee meeting considering the possibility of equipping the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones with offensive capabilities. Currently, these drones are used exclusively for observation missions, but advocates for their armament argue that it could significantly enhance Belgium’s defense capabilities in an increasingly volatile international landscape. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In June 2024, the Belgian army announced that the first six Belgian crews had completed their initial training at General Atomics in North Dakota, with additional training scheduled (Picture source: Belgian Army) At the center of these discussions are the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, which Belgium acquired in 2018 at a total cost of 160 million euros, purchasing two units. Developed by General Atomics, the MQ-9B is a next-generation remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) designed for medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) missions. With a wingspan of 79 feet (24 meters), the drone can fly over the horizon for 40+ hours in all weather conditions, while safely integrating into civil airspace. Equipped with the Lynx Multi-mode Radar, advanced electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors, and automatic takeoff and landing features, the SkyGuardian provides robust surveillance capabilities. The SkyGuardian’s design allows it to carry up to 2,155 kg in payload across nine external hardpoints and an internal bay, suitable for integrating various sensors and precision-guided munitions. It reaches a maximum speed of 210 KTAS and boasts a range exceeding 6,000 nautical miles. Compliant with NATO standards (STANAG 4671) and civil airspace regulations, the MQ-9B includes a detect and avoid system, de-ice/anti-ice capabilities, and an airframe built to endure up to 40,000 hours of operation, making it versatile for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions—and potentially offensive operations if armed. The ongoing discussions emphasize the utility of armed drones in recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, where such systems have shown rapid and effective response capabilities on the battlefield, reducing risks to soldiers. Proponents argue that arming drones could offer Belgium a strategic advantage, modernizing its defense posture and aligning it more closely with the practices of NATO allies. The topic of arming the SkyGuardians has been debated in Belgium since their acquisition in 2018, with various discussions over the years exploring both tactical benefits and ethical implications. In 2021, a strategic committee highlighted the advantages that armed drones could bring to Belgian defense forces, but concerns around ethical and political issues kept them restricted to surveillance missions. In early 2024, a proposal to arm the drones was presented but faced opposition due to ethical and legal considerations, leading to its temporary withdrawal. Later, as discussions continued, an alternative parliamentary majority showed interest in advancing the measure, but ultimately, caution prevailed, and the decision was deferred to the current executive's ongoing evaluations. Following recent elections, a working group within the Belgian Defense Committee has resumed the examination of armed drones as part of broader considerations around 'autonomous weapons.' If approved, arming Belgium’s drones could offer significant strategic advantages. Operationally, this shift would provide precision strike capabilities, reducing reliance on fighter jets, which are costly and logistically challenging to deploy. Armed drones could also deliver close air support to ground forces, boosting their security and operational reach. Additionally, with their long-endurance capabilities, these drones would allow continuous monitoring of sensitive areas, ready to respond immediately to identified threats. Aligning Belgium’s drone capabilities with NATO allies would strengthen interoperability, enhancing coherence in joint military operations, particularly in scenarios that require precision strikes to secure intervention zones.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/belgium-discusses-arming-mq-9b-skyguardian-drones-in-defense-committee	2024-11-14T00:26:46-08:00	
Towards Armed Drones for Belgian Army? N-VA Revives Debate in Defense Committee	The debate over arming military drones has resurfaced in Belgium. On November 13, 2024, during a Defense Committee meeting, the N-VA introduced a resolution aimed at equipping the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, acquired by the Belgian army, with offensive capabilities. These drones are used exclusively for observation missions, but the N-VA advocates arming them to bolster Belgium’s defense effectiveness in an increasingly unstable international landscape. This proposal marks a significant moment in the national discussion on drone use, dividing those who view this technology as a modernization tool for the armed forces and those concerned about its ethical and political implications. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In June 2024, the Belgian army announced that the first six Belgian crews had completed their initial training at General Atomics in North Dakota, with additional training scheduled (Picture source: Belgian Army) At the heart of this debate are the MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones, acquired by Belgium in 2018 for a total of 160 million euros, with two units purchased. Developed by General Atomics, these MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) drones are highly capable, and designed for long-duration surveillance missions. The SkyGuardian can carry a payload of up to 2,155 kg, making it suitable for carrying various types of weaponry, such as missiles and precision bombs. Despite this capability, Belgian drones remain unarmed, limited solely to intelligence-gathering operations. The resolution, introduced by Peter Buysrogge and supported by other N-VA members on November 13, explicitly calls on the government to 'break the taboo' on arming the SkyGuardian drones and to move 'without delay' toward offensive armament. The N-VA argues that recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine, underscore the effectiveness of armed drones for rapid, effective responses on the ground, minimizing risks to soldiers. Supporters see drone armament as a strategic shift that would modernize Belgium’s military capability, better positioning it to face contemporary threats and aligning it with NATO allies. The question of arming the SkyGuardians is not new in Belgium. From the time of their acquisition in 2018, the issue has sparked debate within the De Croo government (Vivaldi coalition), with some considering it a step towards a more aggressive military stance. In 2021, a strategic committee led by Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder recommended arming the SkyGuardians, highlighting the tactical benefits for Belgian forces. However, this recommendation was dismissed due to ethical and political concerns, and the drones remained limited to surveillance missions. At the beginning of 2024, a proposal to arm the drones was put forward by Jasper Pillen (Open VLD) and later amended by Tim Vandenput, but it was blocked by opposition from Ecolo-Groen, whose members raised ethical and legal concerns about armed drone use. This blockage led to the proposal’s withdrawal from the Defense Committee’s agenda in May. Later that year, an alternative majority in Parliament—composed of the N-VA, MR, Open VLD, CD&amp;V, Les Engagés, and Vlaams Belang—considered pushing the measure through before the June elections. Ultimately, caution prevailed, and the decision was deferred to negotiations under the new executive. The 'Arizona' coalition formed after the elections has reignited the debate with a specialized working group on 'autonomous weapons,' which includes armed drones. Arming Belgium’s drones would offer multiple strategic advantages, extending beyond mere military modernization. Operationally, this move would enable precise and rapid strike capabilities, reducing Belgium’s reliance on fighter jets, which are costly and challenging to mobilize in certain situations. Armed drones could provide close air support to ground troops, significantly enhancing their security and operational effectiveness. Additionally, the long endurance of these drones would allow continuous surveillance over sensitive areas, with the capacity to intervene immediately in response to identified threats. This evolution would also bring Belgium in line with NATO allies, fostering greater interoperability and coherence in joint military operations, especially in contexts where precision strikes are required to secure intervention zones.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/towards-armed-drones-for-belgian-army-n-va-revives-debate-in-defense-committee	2024-11-14T00:26:46-08:00

French Aircraft Carrier Charles de Gaulle Refines Self-Defense with Anti-Drone Exercise	According to information published by the French MoD on November 12, 2024, in a recent high-intensity anti-drone defense exercise, the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle collaborated with the 31F Flotilla to refine critical skills in combating unmanned aerial threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Navy's aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. (Picture source: NATO) Countering drone threats from an aircraft carrier involves a layered defense strategy, integrating advanced detection, interception, and neutralization capabilities to address a broad range of unmanned aerial threats. Carriers rely heavily on sophisticated radar and sensor networks, such as AN/SPY-6 or AESA radars, capable of detecting small, fast-moving drones at considerable distances. To enhance accuracy, these radar systems work alongside infrared and electro-optical sensors, providing comprehensive tracking even in challenging environmental conditions. Artificial intelligence further augments this capability by analyzing flight patterns, categorizing drones by threat level, and enabling the defense team to prioritize their responses effectively. Electronic warfare (EW) plays a pivotal role in countering drones, with systems like the AN/SLQ-32 or SEWIP being instrumental in jamming communication links or disrupting GPS signals. Such jamming tactics are particularly effective against drone swarms that aim to overwhelm carrier defenses. In addition, EW systems can employ spoofing techniques, confusing a drone’s navigation system by altering its GPS or control signals, which often leads to the drone crashing or veering off course. Carriers are also equipped with kinetic and non-kinetic interceptors to neutralize drones that breach outer detection layers. Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS), such as Phalanx or SeaRAM, provide robust short-range defenses, using rapid-fire projectiles or missiles to engage small, low-flying drones. In parallel, directed energy weapons (DEWs), such as lasers or high-power microwaves, offer scalable responses, incinerating or disabling drones at close range with precision. Anti-air missiles, like the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile or ESSM, are deployed against larger drones that could carry explosives or reconnaissance equipment, providing a longer-range engagement option. Defensive drone systems add an additional layer of response, allowing carriers to deploy their own UAVs to intercept and neutralize hostile drones before they reach the fleet. Defensive drones are often used in swarm-on-swarm tactics to counter incoming drone swarms. These swarms of defensive drones coordinate their actions to intercept hostile UAVs effectively, using either kinetic force or electronic jamming. The success of counter-drone operations depends on an integrated command and control (C2) system that centralizes communication between detection, EW, and weapon systems. This networked C2 system ensures rapid coordination, allowing operators to manage multiple threats in real-time. Carriers also communicate securely with their escorting vessels, creating a unified defense that maximizes the chance of intercepting hostile drones. Regular training and simulation exercises simulate a variety of drone threats, such as swarm attacks and complex flight maneuvers, ensuring that crews are prepared for a range of possible scenarios. Overall, a multi-layered defense, combining early detection, electronic warfare, kinetic interceptors, and networked command systems, is critical for carriers to protect themselves against the evolving challenges of drone warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-refines-self-defense-with-anti-drone-exercise	2024-11-13T06:59:42-08:00

Additionally, the incorporation of Digital RF Memory (DRFM) technology further enhances its countermeasure abilities, enabling Digital Shark to create sophisticated decoys and deceptive signals to outmaneuver even advanced radar systems. Digital Shark’s deployment underscores Rafael's growing portfolio in naval EW and defense solutions, which also includes its C-GEM active decoy system. Together, these capabilities represent a comprehensive EW suite, providing NATO fleets with a tactical edge in increasingly complex maritime threat environments. Naval Electronic Warfare (EW) is a critical component of modern maritime operations, encompassing the use of electromagnetic spectrum technologies to detect, intercept, and counteract threats. It involves three primary subdivisions: Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Protection (EP), and Electronic Warfare Support (ES). Electronic Attack (EA) involves offensive measures to disrupt or degrade enemy electronic systems, such as radar and communications, through jamming or deception techniques. For instance, the U.S. Navy's Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) is designed to replace the aging ALQ-99 system, providing advanced capabilities to counter sophisticated threats. Electronic Protection (EP) focuses on safeguarding friendly forces from adversary EW activities. This includes implementing measures to ensure the resilience and reliability of one's own electronic systems against jamming or interference. Techniques such as frequency hopping and spread spectrum communications are commonly employed to enhance EP. Electronic Warfare Support (ES) entails actions to detect, intercept, and identify electromagnetic emissions from potential threats. This intelligence is vital for situational awareness and informs decision-making processes. Modern naval forces utilize sophisticated ES systems to monitor and analyze the electromagnetic environment effectively. Advancements in naval EW are ongoing, with significant investments in research and development. For example, the Royal Navy is pursuing the Maritime Electronic Warfare Programme (MEWP) to enhance its EW capabilities over the next two decades. Similarly, the U.S. Navy is integrating the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) to upgrade its shipboard EW systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/rafael-wins-nato-contract-for-advanced-digital-shark-naval-electronic-countermeasure-system	2024-11-13T06:02:47-08:00	
Poland Develops Interceptor Missile to Counter Russian-Used Shahed-Class Drones	During the first International Armaments Congress held from October 21-25 in Krakow, the Wojskowy Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia (WITU) unveiled an ambitious new initiative aimed at developing an economical defense solution against enemy drones, as reported by Defence24. At the center of this presentation was a concept for a low-cost anti-drone missile, specifically designed to intercept attack drones like those of the Shahed class, which have become a significant threat due to their extensive use in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This development represents a step forward for the Polish armed forces, seeking a viable solution to counter drone swarm attacks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ukrainian soldiers have discovered an almost completely intact Shahed-136, a kamikaze drone employed by the Russian military to strike critical infrastructure. (Picture source: Ukrainian Army) The primary focus in designing this anti-drone missile is cost-effectiveness. WITU aims to produce an interceptor with a price comparable to that of Shahed attack drones, which Russia has deployed extensively against Ukraine. These drones are valued at approximately $193,000, a relatively affordable price for weapons of this type. In response, WITU proposes a 105 mm caliber munition, measuring 1800 mm in length with a wingspan of 328 mm. With a launch weight of about 20 kg, including a 4.2 kg warhead, this missile is designed to be lightweight and maneuverable. Unlike conventional anti-air missiles, this Polish model is uniquely tailored for drone combat. It boasts an average speed of around 200 m/s, peaking at 250 m/s, making it a rapid yet moderately maneuverable interceptor. The missile’s specifications include an interception range of 0.5 to 15 kilometers and a maximum altitude of 1,500 meters, making it well-suited for effectively countering drone attacks within a defined area. An intriguing aspect of the project is the choice of guidance method, which remains unspecified at this stage. However, it is possible that the missile may utilize reflected laser beam guidance, a technology already used in Polish anti-tank missile systems such as the JACK-S and Pirat complexes. This type of guidance would help keep costs down while ensuring sufficient accuracy for drone interception. WITU’s initiative aligns with a broader goal of developing an economical and accessible system capable of meeting the growing demand for anti-drone defense. The designers emphasize that this missile is particularly suited for countering swarm attacks, an essential capability as drone swarm tactics continue to evolve. To realize this project, WITU is currently seeking an industrial partner to assist in finalizing and mass-producing the missile, prioritizing the needs of the Polish armed forces. This project reflects a trend seen in recent years, where low-cost combat drones and interceptor missiles have become strategic assets in modern military arsenals. In 2021, the Ukrainian design bureau 'LUCH' launched a project for the RK-10 anti-aircraft missile complex, specifically tailored for combating Shahed-type drones. Poland could thus benefit from a similar solution, optimized for its own strategic needs. The development of a cost-effective anti-drone interceptor by the Wojskowy Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia (WITU) addresses the growing need to counter attack drones, such as those of the Shahed class, which are widely used in modern conflicts. These drones, often deployed in swarms, present significant challenges to traditional defense systems. A low-cost interceptor would allow for efficient neutralization of these threats, avoiding the need to deploy more expensive missiles against relatively low-cost targets. This approach is essential for maintaining sustainable air defense in the face of saturation attacks, where the cost-effectiveness of countermeasures becomes a critical factor. Moreover, the specific design of this interceptor, with a range of 0.5 to 15 km and a maximum altitude of 1,500 meters, makes it particularly suited for neutralizing drones operating at low and medium altitudes. Its lightweight and maneuverable nature facilitates rapid and flexible deployment, offering a tailored response to emerging threats. Integrating laser-guided technology, already proven in other Polish systems, could ensure increased accuracy while keeping costs manageable. In this way, the interceptor provides a strategic advantage for the Polish armed forces, enhancing their capability to effectively protect national territory from hostile drone incursions. To address the growing threat posed by Shahed-class drones used in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Poland is seeking to develop a defense solution. This project meets a strategic need for an economical defense against these aerial threats, which, due to their numbers and low cost, often overwhelm conventional defense systems. With a range of 15 kilometers and potentially laser-based guidance, this missile could offer a sustainable and affordable solution for the Polish armed forces. Poland could also consider supporting Ukraine in protecting its airspace by providing such missiles, even as its Chief of General Staff recently announced that Poland will not shoot down Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-develops-interceptor-missile-to-counter-russian-used-shahed-class-drones	2024-11-13T05:54:53-08:00

Equipped with a payload that includes eight air-to-ground missiles, the design and functionality of the Z-20T suggest it may fulfill a role similar to the US MH-60L 'Direct Action Penetrator' (DAP), a gunship helicopter specifically used for special operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Z-20T Assault Eagle supports different mission requirements by accommodating payloads such as rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles, or by increasing the range through auxiliary fuel tanks. (Picture source: Weibo) The Z-20 helicopter, developed by the Harbin Aircraft Industry Group, was created in response to the People's Liberation Army Air Force's (PLAAF) need for a high-altitude medium utility helicopter since the 1980s, particularly for operations in China's mountainous regions. After acquiring a limited number of Sikorsky S-70 helicopters from the U.S. in 1984, further imports were restricted following the 1989 Tiananmen protests, prompting China to start an indigenous 10-ton helicopter project in 2006. The Z-20 made its first flight in 2013, drawing design inspiration from the S-70 Black Hawk but featuring domestic modifications such as fly-by-wire controls, a five-bladed rotor, improved engines, and high-altitude capabilities, enabling it to serve across different PLA branches and support various military operations. The Z-20 has several variants designed for specific roles. The base Z-20 serves as a transport helicopter for the PLA Army. The Z-20T is an assault version with hardpoints for weapons, while the Z-20S specializes in search and rescue operations. The Z-20K, Z-20KA, and Z-20KS are variants for the PLAAF, with roles in airborne corps, air assault, and search and rescue, respectively. Naval versions include the Z-20J for utility transport and the Z-20F for anti-submarine warfare, featuring radar and dipping sonar capabilities. The Z-20 PAP variant serves the People’s Armed Police, and a dedicated attack version, the Z-21, is configured with additional weaponry and avionics for combat missions. In this new variant, the ESSS (External Stores Support System) short wings enable it to carry additional weapon systems and auxiliary fuel tanks, enhancing its operational flexibility. This design supports different mission requirements by accommodating payloads such as rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles, or by increasing the range through auxiliary fuel tanks. The Z-20T’s short wings also provide extra lift, reducing the load on the main rotor, which could support higher flight speeds.

This initiative was previously structured under Supreme Decree No. 007-2023-DE, which authorized government-to-government defense contracts valued at approximately $62.9 million, or 238.8 million Peruvian soles. The current approach, however, consolidates the acquisition under domestic management, thereby reinforcing the defense relationship between Peru and South Korea. The K808 White Tiger, referred to as Baekho in South Korea, is an armored vehicle developed by Hyundai Rotem primarily for the South Korean Army. First delivered in 2016, the K808 was designed for use in difficult terrains and frontline operations. Its 8×8 configuration enhances maneuverability, with run-flat tires and a central tire inflation system (CTIS) to adjust tire pressure according to the terrain, which is essential for crossing rivers and uneven ground. Built with a modular platform, the K808 can be adapted for different missions and is compatible with various weapons systems, including options for 12.7 mm or 30 mm remote-controlled weapon stations. In South Korea, over 500 units of the K808 have been delivered to the Army, where the vehicle is used for transport and reconnaissance missions, often in coordination with main battle tanks like the K1A1 and K2. The recent Peruvian acquisition marks Hyundai Rotem’s first export of the K808 outside of South Korea and introduces the vehicle into the Latin American defense market. Demand for similar vehicles in Central and South America is on the rise, attributed to security and counterterrorism requirements, positioning Hyundai Rotem to potentially expand further in the region. The K808 incorporates components developed by Hyundai Motors, such as a V6 diesel engine based on Hyundai’s commercial models, adapted to military specifications. Its design supports network-based command and control systems, enabling it to serve as a command post in mobile operations. Hyundai Rotem, having previously exported its K2 tank to Poland, continues to enhance its defense product line for broader export markets, with an emphasis on meeting operational standards across varied environments. Peru and South Korea have significantly strengthened their military relations through various defense agreements and acquisitions in the last months. In April 2024, Hyundai Heavy Industries signed a contract to construct four naval vessels for the Peruvian Navy, including a 3,400-ton frigate modeled after South Korea's Daegu-class, with expected delivery by 2030. In May 2024, Hyundai Rotem was selected to supply K808 White Tiger 8×8 wheeled armored combat vehicles to enhance the Peruvian Army's ground mobility and defense capabilities. Additionally, in July 2024, Peru entered advanced negotiations with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to acquire 20 to 24 FA-50 light combat aircraft to modernize its air force.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-confirms-acquisition-of-30-south-korean-k808-white-tiger-amphibious-armored-vehicles	2024-11-13T02:34:02-08:00

Indra's longstanding partnerships with global shipyards and navies have greatly influenced the development of its SIGINT technology. The company’s systems are already installed on high-profile vessels such as the F100 frigates and the LHD Juan Carlos I of the Spanish Navy, and Indra is currently developing sensors for Spain’s upcoming F110 frigates. These sensors, to be housed within an integrated mast designed for stealth, will further advance the ship's radar reduction capabilities. The new SIGINT system provides robust situational awareness by monitoring the entire electromagnetic spectrum and detecting low-probability intercept (LPI) signals. These signals, often used by stealthy vessels like submarines, are challenging to detect but vital for identifying adversaries attempting to operate covertly. Indra’s extensive signal library enhances the system’s threat-detection capabilities, as it can quickly classify various radar and communication profiles to inform the crew about nearby hostile or suspicious units. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) plays a crucial role in the naval sector by intercepting and analyzing electronic signals to gain insights into adversaries' activities, capabilities, and intentions. This intelligence is essential for maritime operations, as it enables navies to monitor communications, radar emissions, and other electronic signals, providing a real-time picture of potential threats. Naval SIGINT has evolved significantly over time. During World War II, High-Frequency Direction Finding (HF/DF), also known as 'huff-duff,' enabled Allied forces to locate enemy submarines by intercepting radio transmissions. This early technology paved the way for modern SIGINT systems, which today have become highly advanced. For instance, the U.S. Navy's AN/SLQ-32 system allows ships to detect and classify enemy radars and communication signals, enhancing electronic support measures.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/next-gen-sigint-by-indra-offers-comprehensive-threat-detection-for-navies	2024-11-13T02:32:34-08:00

Germany Authorizes Sale of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon Fighter Jets to Türkiye	On November 13, 2024, Türkiye’s Defense Minister Yasar Guler officially announced, according to the Turkish newspaper Türkiye Today during a live interview on the Turkish news outlet TV100, that Germany has authorized the sale of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets to Türkiye. This decision follows intense negotiations between Türkiye and the Eurofighter consortium partners, including the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, who played a key role in securing Germany’s approval. This acquisition aims to enhance Türkiye’s air capabilities and modernize its military fleet. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BAE Systems/Leonardo Eurofighter Typhoon Fighter Jet (Picture source: X) The Turkish Defense Ministry’s announcement of Germany's authorization to sell 40 Eurofighter Typhoons marks a significant turning point in defense relations between Türkiye and several European countries. This process began several years ago when Türkiye expressed interest in strengthening its air fleet, with the Typhoon as a leading option. However, Germany’s hesitations, which surfaced as early as 2021, slowed the negotiations, driven by concerns over human rights issues and Turkish military operations in sensitive areas like Syria. Active support from the United Kingdom, one of the primary Eurofighter backers, followed by Italy and Spain, emerged in 2023, increasing pressure on Germany to reconsider its stance. Since their introduction in the 1980s, F-16 fighters have been the backbone of the Turkish Air Force. With over 240 aircraft in service over the decades, the F-16 Fighting Falcon has played an essential role in Türkiye’s military operations, supporting air surveillance, national defense, and regional interventions. However, over time, Türkiye’s defense needs have grown, requiring more advanced technology and expanded capabilities to meet an increasingly complex security environment. To meet these modernization needs, Türkiye explored new options for its air fleet in the early 2020s. Although Ankara initially considered upgrading its F-16s or acquiring fifth-generation F-35s, Türkiye’s participation in the F-35 program was suspended in 2019 due to diplomatic tensions with the United States related to Ankara’s acquisition of the Russian S-400 air defense system. In this context, the Eurofighter Typhoon emerged as a credible alternative, backed by European partners such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, who seek to strengthen strategic ties with Ankara. Other aircraft were briefly considered, but none offered the same balance of operational performance and political cooperation. The acquisition of Eurofighter Typhoons takes place in a complex geostrategic context, marked by increased tensions with Greece, Türkiye’s historic neighbor and rival. This choice can be seen as a direct response to the modernization of the Greek fleet, which has recently integrated French Rafales and is considering the acquisition of American F-35s. These developments enhance Greece's air capabilities, potentially altering the balance of power in the region. Additionally, the Eurofighter offers Türkiye a strategic alternative to diversify its defense supply sources and reduce its reliance on American systems. In parallel, Türkiye has also initiated the development of its own fifth-generation fighter jet, the TAI KAAN, aiming for increased long-term autonomy in its air defense. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a multi-role combat aircraft developed by a consortium of European aerospace companies, including Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo. Designed for a wide range of air operations, the Typhoon features a delta wing and canard configuration, providing significant maneuverability. The aircraft is intended to meet both current and future operational needs, with continuous upgrades keeping it updated with combat aviation technology. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 23,500 kg and a maximum speed of Mach 2.0. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 afterburning turbofan engines, each providing 60 kN (13,000 lbf) of thrust dry and 90 kN (20,000 lbf) with an afterburner, the Eurofighter Typhoon can reach a maximum speed of 2,125 km/h or Mach 2.35 at high altitude and 1,530 km/h or Mach 1.25 at sea level. It has a supercruise capability at Mach 1.5, a maximum range of 2,900 kilometers, and a service ceiling of 19,812 meters (65,000 feet). The Typhoon's armament includes a 27 mm Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon with 150 rounds and 13 hardpoints (8 under-wing and 5 under-fuselage) capable of carrying over 9,000 kg of payload. In air-to-air combat, the Eurofighter Typhoon can climb at a rate of 315 meters per second (62,000 feet per minute). It is equipped with advanced radar and targeting systems, including the Captor-E AESA radar, capable of tracking up to 20 targets simultaneously and engaging them with precision. Its armament includes air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, MBDA Meteor, IRIS-T, AIM-132 ASRAAM, and AIM-9 Sidewinder for beyond-visual-range (BVR) engagement. The Eurofighter Typhoon also performs well in air-to-ground missions. It can carry precision-guided munitions, including Paveway IV laser-guided bombs, Storm Shadow cruise missiles, Brimstone anti-tank missiles, Taurus air-to-surface missiles, and AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missiles. Its targeting pod, the LITENING III, allows for accurate identification and engagement of ground targets under various weather conditions. This capability supports roles such as close air support, interdiction, and strategic strike missions. Furthermore, the Typhoon can also carry anti-ship missiles such as the Marte ER and the Joint Strike Missile (JSM). The technical comparison between the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Eurofighter Typhoon highlights two different approaches in the design and capabilities of multirole fighters, each offering specific advantages in terms of performance, technology, and suitable missions. The F-16, developed by General Dynamics (now Lockheed Martin), is a fourth-generation fighter widely adopted since the 1980s for its versatility, maneuverability, and relatively low operating costs. Its single-engine design makes it light and particularly agile, making it an effective aircraft for ground attack and air superiority missions. In contrast, the Eurofighter Typhoon, designed by a European consortium (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain), is an advanced fourth-generation fighter with a twin-engine design, providing greater power and acceleration suitable for high-altitude air superiority missions. The Eurofighter is equipped with advanced electronic systems, particularly its Captor-E AESA radar (Active Electronically Scanned Array), which offers increased detection range, better coverage, and the ability to track multiple targets simultaneously. The F-16, though upgradeable, lags in this regard, initially lacking AESA technology (only available in modernized versions). The Eurofighter also has better electronic warfare and defense capabilities, allowing it to operate in more hostile environments and against more sophisticated aerial threats. The F-16 remains a versatile, economical, and effective fighter for traditional missions, including ground attack and air defense, but its lack of stealth and advanced detection systems makes it less suited to modern high-intensity warfare environments. The Eurofighter, designed for air superiority missions, excels in long-range engagements and can perform air-to-ground missions, although it is primarily optimized for air defense environments where the ability to detect and engage distant targets is crucial. In summary, the F-16 and the Eurofighter meet different needs: the more economical and maneuverable F-16 is suited for versatile, cost-effective operations, while the Eurofighter Typhoon, with its advanced systems and ability to operate in hostile environments, is a preferred choice for high-intensity air superiority missions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/germany-authorizes-sale-of-40-eurofighter-typhoon-fighter-jets-to-tuerkiye	2024-11-13T01:10:30-08:00

Taiwan Eyes F-35 and Patriot Missiles to Show Defense Resolve to Trump in Face of China	As tensions intensify across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan is evaluating a substantial arms procurement from the United States, aiming to solidify its defense capabilities and affirm its commitment to self-defense. According to reports from the Financial Times, Taiwan is considering a $15 billion investment that would include the acquisition of 60 F-35 fighter jets, 400 Patriot missiles, four E-2D Hawkeye early warning aircraft, ten second-hand warships, and the Aegis combat system. This proposed purchase, aside from enhancing Taiwan’s defense, is intended to signal to the U.S., specifically to the incoming Trump administration, Taiwan's willingness to independently fortify its defenses amid growing Chinese military assertiveness. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan is particularly interested in the F-35B model, which can perform short takeoffs and vertical landings (Picture source: US DoD) The Lockheed Martin F-35 is central to Taiwan's potential purchase, seen as a significant deterrent against Chinese aggression. A fifth-generation stealth fighter, the F-35 is highly capable of air superiority and strike missions, featuring advanced stealth technology, supersonic speed, and superior maneuverability. The aircraft is equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, featuring the AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and the Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), all of which enhance situational awareness and targeting precision. Armament options encompass a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, AIM-9X Sidewinder, and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). The F-35's radar systems, particularly the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, provide advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including radar warning, targeting support, and jamming functions. Among the three F-35 variants, Taiwan is particularly interested in the F-35B model, which can perform short takeoffs and vertical landings (STOVL). The STOVL capability is crucial in Taiwan’s context, as it would enable operations from short runways or emergency airstrips if major airbases were compromised by Chinese missile strikes. However, while the F-35 represents an advanced technological edge, experts are questioning its viability as the best strategic option for Taiwan, primarily due to the high costs involved and the risk of delayed delivery, potentially extending beyond 2027. This timeline is significant as experts estimate a potential Chinese military action around that year, increasing the urgency for Taiwan to evaluate its options carefully. Alongside the F-35, Taiwan has prioritized upgrading its missile defense systems, particularly the Patriot missiles. The MIM-104 Patriot system, developed by Raytheon, is a mobile surface-to-air missile system that plays a crucial role in air and missile defense for several countries. It is designed to detect, track, and engage various aerial threats, including tactical ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. It uses components such as the AN/MPQ-53 or AN/MPQ-65 radar sets and sophisticated guidance systems. The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) variant is especially relevant for Taiwan, providing extended range and improved accuracy, and Taiwan has actively sought to bolster its Patriot system in recent years. A recent U.S. proposal in December 2022 offered Taiwan up to 100 advanced Patriot missiles, valued at $882 million, further underlining Taiwan's commitment to strengthening its missile defense capabilities in response to potential threats. Despite Taiwan’s intent to modernize its forces, some defense analysts argue that other systems might offer more immediate strategic value at a lower cost. For instance, Taiwan has shown interest in acquiring decommissioned American warships, such as Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruisers and Perry-class frigates. These naval platforms could serve as effective access-denial (A2/AD) assets in the event of an invasion, providing Taiwan with the capability to disrupt and delay a potential Chinese assault. This kind of deterrent strategy is particularly suited to the unique geographic and military constraints Taiwan faces in the Taiwan Strait. Additionally, other assets, like HIMARS artillery and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, which were included in prior U.S. arms sales, align closely with Taiwan's defensive needs and offer an effective means of resisting amphibious incursions and protecting its coastline. Under the Trump administration's first term, several large arms packages to Taiwan were approved, totaling over $21 billion, including F-16 Viper fighter jets, M1 Abrams tanks, HIMARS rocket systems, and Harpoon missiles. However, Trump's pragmatic stance on international relations—exemplified by his comments suggesting that Taiwan should 'pay the U.S.' for its security, likening the relationship to an insurance policy—has raised concerns in Taiwan about the stability and commitment of U.S. support. Despite these arms deals, doubts persist regarding the likelihood of a direct U.S. military intervention in defense of Taiwan, particularly given Trump's comments and recent global shifts in U.S. defense policy. Compounding these strategic uncertainties, Taiwan’s role in global semiconductor production, especially through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), adds another layer of complexity. As the world leader in advanced chip production, TSMC occupies a critical position in the global supply chain, particularly for the United States and its allies, as well as for China. This economic leverage makes Taiwan a focal point in the ongoing U.S.-China rivalry, as Beijing could use Taiwan's semiconductor sector as a pressure point to influence international responses to a Taiwan conflict. Taiwan's strategic interest in F-35 fighter jets and additional Patriot missile batteries signals a clear commitment to enhancing its defense posture, but uncertainties remain about the efficacy of these acquisitions in meeting Taiwan’s immediate defense needs. Delivery timelines and high costs may limit the F-35's impact in the short term, suggesting that investments in access-denial systems and naval defenses could more effectively serve Taiwan’s security interests. Ultimately, Taiwan’s strategic choices are shaped by a complex interplay of regional tensions, economic considerations, and the evolving U.S.-China dynamic, underscoring the island’s need for a nuanced and adaptable defense strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/taiwan-eyes-f-35-and-patriot-missiles-to-show-defense-resolve-to-trump-in-face-of-china	2024-11-13T00:06:56-08:00

Taiwan eyes acquisition of Aegis destroyers from US as strategic signal to Trump Administration	According to information published by the Financialt Times on November 11, 2024, Taiwan is considering the procurement of Aegis destroyers from the United States as a central component of a significant defense package aimed at strengthening its maritime security capabilities in response to the growing threat from China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Japanese Navy's Maya class destroyer JS Haguro during the at-sea phase of Exercise Rim of the Pacific 2024. (Picture source: Dvids) At the heart of Taiwan’s proposed defense package is Lockheed Martin’s Aegis destroyer—a powerful multi-mission warship equipped with advanced radar and missile systems capable of tracking and intercepting multiple threats simultaneously. Known for its effectiveness in air and missile defense, the Aegis system would provide Taiwan with a significant upgrade to its naval capabilities, especially in terms of defending against airborne and ballistic missile threats from China. For Taiwan, acquiring Aegis destroyers would not only enhance its defensive posture in the Taiwan Strait but also solidify its role as a capable security partner for the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. The Aegis system’s interoperability with U.S. and allied forces in the region could facilitate joint defense initiatives, strengthening Taiwan’s strategic partnerships. The consideration for acquiring Aegis destroyers comes as Taiwan and other U.S. allies face renewed pressure to increase their defense spending and capacities amid rising tensions with China. Advocates within the U.S. have called for Taiwan to step up its defense investments, emphasizing the importance of Taiwan’s readiness to defend itself. The Trump administration’s first term saw a series of significant arms sales to Taiwan, signaling a strong U.S. commitment to Taiwan’s security. Should Trump return to office, Taiwan’s pursuit of the Aegis destroyer may find favorable support, especially as the U.S. continues to seek stronger alliances to counterbalance China’s influence in the region. The Aegis destroyers could be a crucial asset to Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, thanks to their advanced radar, missile defense, and combat capabilities. The Aegis Combat System, the heart of Aegis destroyers, allows for unparalleled air defense and ballistic missile interception capabilities. This system is paired with the AN/SPY-1D phased-array radar, capable of detecting and tracking multiple aerial threats over 300 kilometers away. The Aegis-equipped destroyers are fitted with Standard Missile (SM) series interceptors, such as the SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6, which can intercept various threats from aircraft to short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. In a potential invasion scenario, Chinese missile and aircraft threats would likely overwhelm Taiwan's limited defenses, and the addition of Aegis-equipped destroyers could create a robust shield, protecting critical locations and infrastructure. Chinese submarines are a significant threat in any Taiwan Strait conflict, as they could block Taiwan’s ports and sever sea lines of communication. Aegis destroyers are equipped with sophisticated ASW capabilities, including the AN/SQQ-89 sonar suite and Mk 54 torpedoes, and often operate with embarked MH-60R helicopters, further enhancing their ASW range. With these assets, Aegis destroyers could assist Taiwan in identifying, tracking, and neutralizing Chinese submarines attempting to penetrate Taiwan’s maritime boundaries or blockade essential routes. The Aegis Combat System's networked battle management capabilities would offer Taiwan a strategic advantage. The Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) and Link 16 enable Aegis destroyers to share data in real-time with allied forces, creating a comprehensive situational awareness environment. In collaboration with Taiwan’s existing air and naval defenses, Aegis destroyers could form part of a decentralized but highly integrated defense network. This network would improve Taiwan’s capacity to detect, track, and respond to incoming threats efficiently, distributing decision-making and maximizing resilience against Chinese electronic warfare or cyber-attacks on Taiwan's command and control infrastructure. The presence of Aegis destroyers could serve as a strategic deterrent against China by projecting a credible threat to Chinese forces, particularly when positioned near the Taiwan Strait. Their ability to launch Tomahawk missiles and other long-range anti-ship missiles provides a flexible strike capability, giving Taiwan the potential to respond to Chinese naval actions preemptively. Such capability could force China to reconsider or delay an invasion, knowing the heavy costs Aegis destroyers could inflict on amphibious or naval assets in the initial phases of an assault.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-eyes-acquisition-of-aegis-destroyers-from-us-as-strategic-signal-to-trump-administration	2024-11-12T03:10:19-08:00

In contrast, the manned Independence-class LCS leverages modular adaptability for versatility across various mission types, while the RV Triton remains a vital precursor in demonstrating the potential of trimaran warships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinas-jari-usv-a-orca-unmanned-vessel-with-vls-revealed-at-zhuhai	2024-11-12T02:14:56-08:00	
Pakistan to develop indigenous active protection system to protect entire tank fleet	Pakistan’s Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT) recently initiated a project to develop an Active Protection System (APS) for main battle tanks (MBTs), marking a significant step toward enhancing the capabilities of its armored fleet. The project is managed by HIT’s Advanced Research Development and Information Center (ARDIC), which issued a tender on October 14, 2024, seeking lab testing and equipment necessary for the APS's development. This tender specifies requirements for a lab measurement unit, a radar emulator unit, and two radar sensing units, which are critical components in establishing the APS's core functionality through precise testing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The APS project also represents a continuation of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to localize defense technologies, particularly for its Haider, a variant of the Chinese VT-4 tank. (Picture source: HIT) The proposed Active Protection System (APS) aims to shield tanks from advanced threats such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) and loitering munitions. Modern APS systems typically include sensors for detecting incoming threats and countermeasures to neutralize them, often classified as ‘soft-kill’ or ‘hard-kill’ solutions. A soft-kill system deploys measures like smoke or directional infrared emitters to disrupt the targeting system of an incoming munition, while a hard-kill solution engages the threat directly, using either intercepting munitions or explosively formed penetrators to neutralize it before impact. HIT’s approach, as indicated by the tender, appears to focus on radar-based detection, though specific details about the threat-neutralizing component remain unspecified. The tender outlines a structured procurement process, with a single-stage, two-envelope method for bid submission. To qualify, firms must provide a range of documents, including valid National Tax Number (NTN) certificates, bank statements, audit reports from the last three fiscal years, and assurances that they are not defaulters or blacklisted. Interested firms must submit their bids by November 14, 2024, with technical assessments set to begin the same day. The equipment will undergo rigorous testing to ensure durability and adherence to technical standards, while companies are required to provide a warranty covering all aspects of maintenance for at least two years, with additional marks awarded for extended warranty offerings. Furthermore, HIT mandates confidentiality measures and restricts participation from firms linked to countries deemed ineligible, specifically India and Israel, to safeguard the project’s integrity. The APS project also represents a continuation of Pakistan's ongoing efforts to enhance and localize defense technologies across its entire tank fleet. As of 2024, Pakistan’s fleet of main battle tanks (MBTs) includes 2,537 units, comprising approximately 300 Al-Khalid (MBT 2000), an estimated 110 Al-Khalid I, 315 T-80UD, around 500 Al-Zarrar, 400 Type-69, 268 Type-85-IIAP, 44 VT-4, and an estimated 600 ZTZ-59 tanks. Developing an indigenous APS is a strategic move to strengthen the operational capabilities of these units, ensuring they can counter modern threats and remain effective in diverse operational scenarios. This APS initiative reflects Pakistan’s drive to reduce reliance on foreign defense technologies and increase the self-sufficiency of its armored forces. The development of an APS aligns with Pakistan’s defense strategy, as the region faces a rise in sophisticated ATGMs and loitering munitions across various operational scenarios. The adoption of such systems is not only a response to these threats but also a reinforcement of Pakistan’s position in South Asia’s evolving defense landscape. As the project progresses, HIT aims to ensure that the APS meets operational requirements and withstands diverse threat environments, reinforcing Pakistan’s armored capabilities with localized, state-of-the-art defensive technologies. Active Protection Systems (APS) have become a focal point in modern armored warfare, aiming to enhance the survivability of tanks against advanced anti-tank weaponry. Israel's Trophy system, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, has been operational since 2011 and has demonstrated effectiveness in intercepting various threats, including anti-tank guided missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. The system utilizes radar to detect incoming projectiles and deploys countermeasures to neutralize them before impact. As of 2023, production has scaled up, with 40 Trophy systems and 500 countermeasures being produced monthly. Russia has also advanced its APS technology with the development of the Arena system by the Kolomna Engineering Design Bureau. Arena employs a Doppler radar to detect incoming threats and launches defensive rockets to destroy them mid-air. The modernized Arena-M variant claims to intercept munitions from all directions, including top-attack missiles like the Javelin. In 2023, reports indicated plans to equip T-90M and T-80BVM tanks with Arena-M, with considerations for installation on T-72B3 and T-72B3M models. These developments underscore a global trend toward integrating APS into armored vehicles to counter evolving battlefield threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/pakistan-to-develop-indigenous-active-protection-system-to-protect-entire-tank-fleet	2024-11-12T01:30:59-08:00

Legislative Resolution N° 9122/2024-PE, which authorized the donation, was presented to Congress in alignment with Peru’s National Multisectoral Policy to Combat Organized Crime 2019-2030 and the National Policy Against Drugs to 2030. Congresswoman Auristela Obando Morgan, the committee chair, noted that integrating these helicopters into the PNP’s Aviation Directorate aligns with the Ministry of the Interior's strategic goals in counter-narcotics operations. Discussions around the transfer of U.S. helicopters to the PNP began in June 2018, initially focusing on a proposed donation of 15 UH-1H Huey II helicopters. Subsequent negotiations with the U.S. Embassy considered various configurations and quantities, culminating in a revised proposal from the Peruvian Ministry of the Interior in August 2023 for 24 UH-1H helicopters. In January 2024, the U.S. Embassy informed the Peruvian government that the 24 UH-1Hs would be decommissioned, offering instead a package of nine UH-60 Black Hawks, including training for 14 Peruvian crews, support equipment, tools, and spare parts. The finalized agreement was signed on August 13, 2024. The program for integrating these helicopters into the PNP includes a five-year transition period, with the United States providing Peru with support in maintenance, training, contractual assistance, and quality control. A Joint Aviation Working Group will coordinate monthly on the Black Hawk program, including monitoring minimum flight hours. After this period, Peru will assume full ownership and insurance responsibilities for the helicopters. The estimated annual program cost, including operations and maintenance, is $20 million. Peru’s financial contributions will progressively increase from $4 million in the second year to the full $20 million by the fifth year, at which point it will assume the program's entire cost. Additionally, Peru will establish a supply chain to maintain the helicopters in accordance with Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary. This agreement, which awaits final approval, is based on the provisions of articles 56 and 102.3 of the Peruvian Political Constitution governing international treaties, as outlined in the October 3 letter submitted by President Dina Boluarte, Council of Ministers President Gustavo Adrianzén, and Foreign Minister Elmer Schialer.

New Falcon 70 system fills gaps in China’s short and medium-range air defense capabilities	On November 11, China unveiled the new Falcon 70 short- and medium-range air defense system at the Zhuhai Air Show 2024. Developed by the Shanghai Academy of Space Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), this system integrates detection, guidance, and interception capabilities, allowing it to operate independently. Yang Guang, a representative from the Shanghai Academy, highlighted the system’s multi-role configuration aimed at intercepting aerial threats that penetrate medium- and long-range air defense networks, such as cruise missiles, air-to-ground missiles, guided bombs, rockets, and aircraft, including fixed-wing planes, helicopters, and drones.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Although currently equipped with a Volvo 6x2 chassis, the platform could be integrated with other configurations based on client requirements, enabling its potential use by different branches of China’s military, including the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Rocket Force. (Picture source: Weibo) In its design, the Falcon 70 addresses limitations observed in previous air defense systems, particularly challenges posed by swarm attacks. China's air defense infrastructure previously relied heavily on systems like the HQ-16 and HQ-7B, which have relatively limited missile capacities, constraining their ability to handle dense aerial threats without a reload. Russia's experiences in Syria and Ukraine with the Pantsir-S1 system, which encountered difficulties intercepting successive UAV swarms, further demonstrate these challenges. The Falcon 70 system responds to such needs by supporting 21 missiles per vehicle, offering greater resistance to saturation attacks. In a battalion configuration, a Falcon 70 unit can launch over a hundred medium- and short-range missiles, surpassing the engagement capabilities of comparable systems, including Israel's Spyder and Russia’s latest Tor-M2 and Buk-M2 systems. While primarily intended for export, the Falcon 70 is also viewed by CASC as a potential upgrade for China’s own air defense capabilities. China's medium- and short-range air defense currently comprises the HQ-16 and HQ-17 systems, with the HQ-16 tasked with protecting larger operational zones and the HQ-17 focused on battlefield proximity defense. The Falcon 70 provides a system capable of bridging the 15–70 km range gap between existing short- and mid-range systems, as well as offering a higher missile capacity per battery and an adaptable platform. The Falcon 70 system's response to emerging air assault tactics includes 'soft and hard' kill methods to counter UAV and loitering munition swarms. It is equipped with electronic countermeasures that disrupt communication links and GPS signals of incoming swarm drones, reducing their effectiveness and causing them to lose coordination. The growing threat posed by UAVs and loitering munitions has led to similar developments in nearby regions. For instance, Taiwan has developed the Jian Xiang anti-radiation drone, reportedly to counter Chinese air defense systems, while India has invested in anti-radiation and loitering munitions, acquiring Israeli-made Harpy and Harop drones. The Falcon 70’s features align with these trends, incorporating anti-swarm capabilities to address drone threats. Accordingly, the Falcon 70 includes a phased-array radar and electro-optical tracking mounted on its combat vehicle, enabling it to detect and track targets independently and maintain mobility during operations. The vehicle can be deployed in both field and point-defense roles, designed to protect long-range convoys and critical infrastructure. The LY-70 medium-range missile, a key component of the Falcon 70, uses composite guidance (including inertial navigation, data links, and active radar), providing reliable targeting against various aerial threats, while the FB-10A short-range missile employs infrared imaging guidance for strong multi-target capabilities and anti-jamming performance, with an interception range of up to 18 kilometers. Together, these missiles reportedly achieve a high probability of target destruction, reaching up to 90%. The Falcon 70 system’s flexibility is reflected in its modular vehicle platform, which can be adapted to various operational needs by mounting on different vehicles, such as tracked or armored vehicles. Although currently equipped with a Volvo 6x2 chassis, the platform could be integrated with other configurations based on client requirements, enabling its potential use by different branches of China’s military, including the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Rocket Force. The recent introduction of the Falcon 70, SWS2, and HQ-19 air defense systems at the Zhuhai Air Show 2024 collectively strengthens China's multi-layered defense capabilities. The Falcon 70 addresses medium- and short-range aerial threats, including drones, with autonomous operational features. The SWS2, which combines a 35mm cannon with missile launchers, provides flexible close-range defense, and the HQ-19 focuses on intercepting medium-range ballistic missiles, enhancing China's missile defense comparable to systems like THAAD. Together, these systems offer comprehensive defense against a range of threats, from drones and cruise missiles to ballistic missiles, reinforcing China’s strategic air defense infrastructure.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/new-falcon-70-system-fills-gaps-in-chinas-short-and-medium-range-air-defense-capabilities	2024-11-12T01:14:36-08:00	
KNDS Delivers First Next-Gen Leopard 2A8 Tank to Norway to Counter Russia	On November 6, 2024, Ralf Ketzel, director of KNDS Germany, revealed that the company has already started delivering Leopard 2A8 battle tanks to Norway, with delivery initially planned for the end of the decade or 2026 now moved forward. These tanks are part of an order for 54 units placed by Norway with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), now part of KNDS, which also includes the former French company Nexter. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link KNDS Leopard 2A8 Main Battle Tank (Picture source: KNDS) Norway signed a procurement contract with KNDS to modernize its battle tank fleet, ordering 54 Leopard 2A8 tanks from Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), a German partner of KNDS that includes the French defense company Nexter. This contract reflects Norway's desire to strengthen its defense capabilities against a potential Russian invasion. Initially, the country planned to acquire the Leopard 2A7 model, but operational requirements and technological advancements led to the choice of the more modern and efficient 2A8 version. Signed in 2022, the contract originally scheduled deliveries between 2026 and the end of the decade, but KNDS has accelerated its timeline, with the first units delivered as early as November 2024. Ritek, a Norwegian company, has also been incorporated into the project to handle maintenance for the new tanks, ensuring technical autonomy in their management. This acquisition is part of a broader initiative by the Norwegian armed forces to modernize and strengthen their military capabilities in response to current geopolitical challenges. In addition to Norway, other European countries, including Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Lithuania, also plan to acquire this upgraded version of the Leopard. Croatia recently announced an order for 50 units, while the Czech Republic has ordered 77 tanks, the Netherlands 50, and Lithuania may acquire up to 94. The Leopard 2A8 is designed to be one of the most advanced main battle tanks currently on the market. It can reach a combat weight of around 70 tons and is equipped with a 120mm L55A1 cannon, capable of firing programmable HE (High-Explosive) rounds and new KE (Kinetic Energy) rounds for increased battlefield effectiveness. Among notable improvements, its fire control system will be fully digital and will benefit from a power system independent of the main engine, providing at least 20 kW of continuous power. The Leopard 2A8, with its cutting-edge technology, offers increased resilience against modern threats encountered in conflicts like Ukraine, where drones and anti-tank missiles are widely used. The tank is notably equipped with the EuroTrophy active protection system, an adaptation of the Israeli Trophy system, designed to detect and neutralize incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles and rockets, before they reach the vehicle. This proactive defense capability enhances crew safety and reduces the risk of direct impact. In response to increasing aerial threats, especially drones, the Leopard 2A8 features advanced detection systems that allow it to quickly identify hostile drones. It is also equipped with a roof-mounted Remote Controlled Weapon Station (RCWS), armed with machine guns or automatic grenade launchers, which enables it to neutralize these drones at close range, thus adding an active defense layer against close aerial attacks. The armor of the Leopard 2A8, made from a composite of advanced materials such as steel, tungsten, composites, and ceramics, provides enhanced protection against ballistic projectiles, improvised explosive devices, and artillery fragments, thereby increasing the survival of the vehicle and its crew against direct impacts. Additionally, the tank is equipped with sophisticated optical and infrared sensors for the early detection of threats, including drones and anti-tank missile teams. Some jamming systems may also be integrated to disrupt enemy communications and drone guidance systems, thereby reducing their operational effectiveness. From a firepower perspective, the Leopard 2A8 is equipped with the Rheinmetall Rh-120 L/55A1 120mm cannon, an advanced version of the L/55 model already present on the 2A7. This cannon can use programmable HE (High-Explosive) rounds, in addition to new KE (Kinetic Energy) rounds, which significantly enhances the tank's ability to effectively engage a wide range of targets, from lightly armored vehicles to fortifications. This versatility is a major asset in combat environments where targets can quickly vary, requiring munitions adapted to each situation. On the technology front, the Leopard 2A8 includes an advanced energy management system with an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) independent of the main engine. This energy autonomy allows the tank to keep its systems active without generating noise or a significant thermal signature, offering valuable discretion during ambush or static defense operations. Furthermore, its fire control system is fully digital and incorporates fusion sensors for optimized target acquisition and tracking. The tank's optics are also enhanced: the PERI-R 17 A2 panoramic sight for the commander and the EMES 15 sight for the gunner provide improved situational awareness and increased precision. For Norway, the modernization process has accelerated in recent years through the renewal of its military equipment, following several major initiatives, including the purchase of 52 F-35 fighters in 2018 to replace its aging F-16s, thereby ensuring air superiority against potential regional threats. In 2019, Norway also strengthened its naval fleet by ordering four new U212CD conventional submarines in cooperation with Germany, to secure its waters and enhance its maritime deterrence capabilities. The deployment of the first Leopard 2A8s in 2024, much earlier than planned, reflects Norway's commitment to rapidly adapting its ground forces to the demands of modern warfare, characterized by an increased use of sophisticated technologies, such as drones and precision anti-tank weapons. Through these initiatives, Norway confirms its commitment to a robust and effective defense, aiming to protect its national sovereignty while contributing to the stability of the Nordic region and the NATO Alliance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/knds-delivers-first-next-gen-leopard-2a8-tank-to-norway-to-counter-russia	2024-11-12T01:13:07-08:00

New US Navy Arleigh Burke class Destroyer USS John Basilone Joins Fleet	According to information published by the US DoD on November 9, 2024, the U.S. Navy's latest Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, USS John Basilone (DDG 122), was officially commissioned. The ceremony, held at the historic pier between the USS Intrepid and New York's cruise terminal, welcomed the newest guided-missile destroyer to the fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Commissioning ceremony of the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS John Basilone. (Picture source: US DoD) In comparison to their international counterparts, these U.S. Navy destroyers feature a balanced design that combines advanced technological systems, multi-mission flexibility, and substantial firepower, making them a staple of the U.S. surface fleet. In terms of air defense capabilities, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers leverage the Aegis Combat System paired with the SPY-1 or SPY-6 radar (in the latest Flight III versions), providing robust anti-air and missile defense capabilities. Japanese Maya-class destroyers also utilize the Aegis system, enhancing their BMD capability for regional defense against evolving threats. The South Korean Sejong the Great-class destroyers share similar systems, but with a higher VLS (Vertical Launch System) cell count of 128 compared to the Arleigh Burke's 96, making them particularly well-suited for heavy multi-role missions, including land-attack and anti-air operations. In contrast, China’s Type 052D Luyang III-class destroyers, while also equipped with phased-array radar systems, generally lack the advanced radar sensitivity of the SPY-6 but remain formidable within China's A2/AD (anti-access/area denial) strategy, especially in the South China Sea. The U.K.’s Type 45 Daring-class destroyers focus heavily on air defense, designed to protect carrier strike groups and equipped with the Sampson radar and Sea Viper system for high-efficiency air-defense roles. While the Arleigh Burke class is equally capable in air defense, it is better suited for a multi-role environment, thanks to a wider range of missiles housed in its 96 VLS cells, which support land-attack, anti-surface, and anti-submarine operations. In anti-ship and land-attack roles, Russia’s Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates present a unique challenge due to their hypersonic Zircon missiles, which offer significant regional strike capabilities. Although the Gorshkov-class VLS capacity is lower, its missile technology remains a potent factor in regional engagements. The Arleigh Burke class, however, brings a balance of capability with Tomahawk land-attack missiles, SM-series air-defense missiles, and ASROC anti-submarine missiles. While all of these vessels are powerful in their own rights, each nation’s destroyer class reflects its specific defense priorities. Japanese, South Korean, and British destroyers emphasize air defense, reflecting regional security needs, while the Chinese Type 052D is optimized for near-seas defense as part of a broader strategy to assert control over the South China Sea. Russia’s Admiral Gorshkov, focused on anti-ship missions, serves to project power within contested regions. The Arleigh Burke class, in comparison, is a globally deployable asset capable of performing in various mission profiles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/new-us-navy-arleigh-burke-class-destroyer-uss-john-basilone-joins-fleet	2024-11-12T00:37:08-08:00

(Picture source: Philippine Coast Guard) The acquisition is expected to enhance the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)’s response efficiency in various mission areas, including search and rescue, environmental protection, maritime law enforcement, and disaster response. NEDA Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan stated that the project supports the government’s goal of strengthening maritime security, addressing illegal activities, and maintaining maritime sovereignty. PCG Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gavan noted this purchase as the largest in the PCG’s modernization efforts, with a goal of deploying at least two patrol boats per district. The PCG’s modernization is further supported by proposed legislation from Senator Bong Go, introducing the Philippine Coast Guard Modernization Act. This act proposes a trust fund to support capability improvements across the PCG's core mission areas: maritime safety, search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental protection. If passed, the fund, administered by the DOTr, would finance equipment acquisitions, facility development, and personnel training, with a focus on resources such as marine-environment-resistant weapons, remotely operated submersibles, and interoperable communication systems. Although specific details about the patrol vessels have not been publicly disclosed, it is notable that France, through its shipyards, has previously supplied patrol boats to other nations. For example, French shipbuilder OCEA has delivered FPB 72-type fast patrol boats to various countries, including the Philippines. However, it remains unconfirmed whether the new patrol boats will be of the same type or a different model. This acquisition comes amid heightened tensions in the South China Sea, where incidents involving Chinese vessels have been reported. Strengthening the PCG’s capabilities is thus viewed as a strategic measure to protect Philippine maritime interests and assert sovereignty in contested areas. Recent incidents in the West Philippine Sea have underscored the need to update the PCG’s capabilities to address ongoing challenges in the region. Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) and Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) vessels have engaged in actions such as harassment, blocking maneuvers, use of water cannons, and collisions that have impacted Philippine vessels. These incidents, near Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) and Ayungin Shoal, have caused structural damage to PCG and civilian vessels and disrupted routine patrols and resupply missions. CCG and CMM vessels have deployed high-pressure water cannons and conducted blocking maneuvers, creating operational challenges and safety risks for PCG personnel. Multiple reported events indicate an ongoing pattern of obstruction by CCG and CMM actions against Philippine humanitarian and routine maritime operations. Examples include the deployment of barriers by CCG vessels at locations like Scarborough Shoal and Ayungin Shoal, as well as collisions with PCG and civilian vessels causing various damages. Additional tactics have included the use of laser devices and flares directed at PCG and Philippine Air Force patrols, further complicating operations in these areas. The recent approval by the Philippine government to acquire new fast patrol craft and upgrade PCG equipment aims to enhance maritime law enforcement and meet operational needs in contested regions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/philippines-to-acquire-40-fast-patrol-craft-with-french-support-to-counter-chinese-incursions	2024-11-08T03:07:42-08:00

South Korea Responds to North Korean Provocations with Hyunmoo-II Ballistic Missile Launch	In response to North Korea’s recent missile launches, South Korea fired a Hyunmoo-II ballistic missile toward the Yellow Sea, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) announced on November 8, 2024. This live-fire exercise took place the previous day in the coastal region of Taean, 108 kilometers southwest of Seoul, following a series of North Korean short-range ballistic missile launches on Tuesday and a recent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test of the Hwasong-18 last week. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launch of the Hyunmoo-II missile in South Korea on November 7, 2024 (Picture source: JCS) The exercise simulated a scenario in which North Korea launched a ballistic missile, prompting a South Korean missile unit to respond by firing a Hyunmoo-II short-range ballistic missile at a sea target designed to represent the origin of the North Korean missile launch. The Hyunmoo-2A is a South Korean short-range ballistic missile powered by solid fuel and developed to counter North Korean threats. Integrated into South Korea’s 'Kill Chain' preemptive strike and 'Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation' (KMPR) retaliatory strategies, it is capable of precisely targeting strategic sites within North Korean territory. Measuring over 12 meters and weighing 5,400 kg, the Hyunmoo-2A has a maximum range of 300 km and can carry a payload of nearly one ton. The two-stage solid propulsion gives the Hyunmoo-2A high stability and swift responsiveness. Developed by South Korea’s Agency for Defense Development (ADD), the missile shares some design features with the Russian Iskander-M, though this is likely due to similar capability requirements rather than a direct technological exchange. With a circular error probable (CEP) of 30 meters, it provides effective precision for targeted strikes, bolstering South Korea’s deterrence against potential threats from North Korea. Operational since 2008, the Hyunmoo-2A has been deployed in military exercises responding to North Korean missile tests, such as in 2017 when it simulated strikes on strategic sites in North Korea. Although the exact number of Hyunmoo-2A missiles South Korea possesses is classified, the missile and its variants play a crucial role in national defense strategy, enabling precise retaliatory strikes and forming a core component of South Korea's counter-provocation measures in response to escalating military actions from the North. This exercise aimed to demonstrate South Korea's ability to respond accurately and assert its resolve to counter any provocation from Pyongyang. The JCS noted that this was a clear display of the South Korean military's capacity to conduct precise strikes on strategic targets. In cooperation with the United States, South Korea continues to closely monitor North Korea’s military activities, maintaining a state of readiness for an 'overwhelming' response to any new provocation. Last Tuesday, North Korea launched a salvo of short-range missiles into the East Sea, mere hours before the U.S. presidential election. These launches appeared to involve North Korea's 600 mm multiple rocket launcher system, known as the KN-25 by allied forces, a system that Pyongyang has claimed can be equipped with tactical nuclear warheads since October 2022. This round of short-range missile launches followed a test of the Hwasong-19, a new-generation solid-fuel ICBM that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un touted as having 'unmatched strategic nuclear strike capability.' In response, the United States, South Korea, and Japan conducted a joint air drill, mobilizing a U.S. B-1B bomber and fighter jets from all three nations over waters east of South Korea's Jeju Island. Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un’s influential sister, later condemned this drill in North Korean state media, describing it as 'indisputable proof of the need and urgency to strengthen nuclear forces.' South Korea continues to expand its ballistic arsenal, recently unveiling the Hyunmoo-5, a 'bunker buster' ballistic missile capable of carrying an eight-ton warhead. This missile forms part of Seoul’s 'three-axis strategy,' which includes preemptive strikes under the 'Kill Chain' system, air and missile defense systems, and measures to incapacitate North Korea’s leadership in the event of an imminent attack. At a recent air show in Sacheon, South Korea also presented a supersonic air-to-ground missile, designed for deployment on the FA-50 light attack fighter as well as the next-generation KF-21 aircraft. Intended for both export and strengthen South Korea’s air capabilities, this missile underscores Seoul’s growing military posture in response to the increasing threat from its northern neighbor.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-responds-to-north-korean-provocations-with-hyunmoo-ii-ballistic-missile-launch	2024-11-08T01:07:39-08:00

Chinese Navy increases anti-submarine warfare with its new Y-8Q aircraft	On November 7, the Chinese Navy’s Y-8Q anti-submarine patrol aircraft arrived in Zhuhai for a static display at the 15th China Airshow, as reported by official Chinese media. The Y-8Q, also known as Gaoxin-6, GX-6, Yun-8Q or Kongqian-200, represents China’s first generation of fixed-wing anti-submarine patrol aircraft. Developed by Shaanxi Aircraft Corporation, this aircraft is based on the Y-8F-600 platform, also designated as Y-9, and powered by four WJ-6C turboprop engines, each featuring six-bladed JL-4 composite propellers. Since its induction in 2015, the Chinese PLANAF (People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force) has acquired over 50 units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Y-8Q performs a range of anti-submarine roles, including patrol, inspection, on-call deployment, and target indication, thanks to a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) extending from the tail. (Picture source: Weibo) The Y-8Q performs a range of anti-submarine roles, including patrol, inspection, on-call deployment, and target indication. It is equipped with various specialized systems for these missions, including a spherical radar dome at the nose, a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) extending from the tail, and a forward fuselage electro-optical turret that houses a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera, CCD/TV camera, and laser rangefinder. Openings on the aircraft allow for sonobuoy deployment (including SQ-4 and SQ-5 models), and a weapons bay can carry anti-submarine grenades, torpedoes, and depth charges. Reports from military sources provide context for the Y-8Q’s capabilities relative to other models. The Y-8Q surpasses previous Chinese anti-submarine aircraft like the Be-6 and Shuihong-5 in its range, hovering time, and speed but has limitations in comparison to other international models. With a patrol range of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 kilometers and a maximum speed of around 700 km/h, the Y-8Q is somewhat constrained compared to the U.S. P-8A Poseidon’s 8,300-kilometer range and 910 km/h speed. Furthermore, while the P-8A is equipped with under-wing anti-ship missile capabilities, no evidence suggests that the Y-8Q currently has similar capacity. Recent information from Chinese military media also confirms the Y-8Q’s anti-submarine weaponry, which includes self-guided aerial depth charges with sonar guidance. These depth charges, similar to Russia’s Zagon-2, are designed to be cost-effective, weighing around 120 kg with a 35 kg warhead. They incorporate a sonar-guided system and deploy a parachute for descent, enabling them to engage submarines at depths up to 600 meters. These charges provide a less expensive alternative to anti-submarine torpedoes and can be deployed in larger numbers, creating a pattern along a submarine’s anticipated route to restrict movement. The Y-8Q’s arrival at Zhuhai for the airshow provides a broader view of China’s anti-submarine strategy and the role of the Y-8Q within it. Previously, the Chinese Navy had limited fixed-wing anti-submarine capabilities, relying on helicopters like the Z-9C, Ka-28, and Z-18. Although the Y-8Q operates on a transport-based platform, which restricts its performance, it fills a key role in shore-based anti-submarine operations with the benefit of increased patrol range and payload capacity compared to these helicopters. In recent years, PLAN has distributed the Y-8Q across its three major fleets—the East China Sea, South China Sea, and North Sea Fleets—to strengthen their shore-based anti-submarine capacities. China’s military reports suggest a target deployment of between 100 and 200 Y-8Q units across its fleets. The development of a more advanced aircraft remains a long-term objective, with potential advancements to be drawn from domestic airframes such as the C919. Such an aircraft would aim to address current limitations by improving the Y-8Q’s patrol range, payload, and overall capability in anti-submarine operations. In addition to its core anti-submarine functions, the Y-8Q has demonstrated secondary capabilities in recent military exercises, where it deployed depth charges against surface targets. This capability aligns with PLAN’s strategy to develop versatile, lower-cost systems to support its various maritime defense needs. Observers note that the Y-8Q may serve in this capacity until more advanced platforms become available, providing PLAN with continued coverage for shore-based anti-submarine patrols and operational flexibility in its current state. Although the Y-8Q operates on a transport-based platform, which restricts its performance, it fills a key role in shore-based anti-submarine operations with the benefit of increased patrol range and payload capacity compared to military helicopters.

Additionally, these missiles could be adapted for next-generation European platforms, including those under the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), a collaboration involving the UK, Italy, and Japan, and the SCAF/FCAS program, jointly developed by France, Germany, and Spain. This year’s achievements include radar signature testing on the TP15 subsonic missile prototype, supersonic wind tunnel testing on the RJ10 variant’s propulsion system, and advanced trials on missile seekers, warheads, and fuzing systems. Belleau noted that the TP15 prototype integrates a turbojet engine designed by Rolls Royce and Safran, highlighting MBDA’s commitment to advancing global missile technology. These recent assessments demonstrate the impressive technical strides made, positioning MBDA at the forefront of missile technology. Despite ongoing UK acquisition reviews ahead of the 2025 Strategic Defense Review (SDR), MBDA remains optimistic about the program’s continuation, underscoring deep-strike as a critical defense priority. In July, the UK reaffirmed its partnership with MBDA through a new £6.5 billion ($8.4 billion) Portfolio Management Agreement to support 'complex weapons' development, reinforcing the importance of deep-strike capabilities. In addition to FC/ASW, MBDA introduced the new Exocet SM40 submarine-launched anti-ship missile at Euronaval. With a J-band RF seeker and a turbojet engine, the SM40 offers twice the range of previous Exocet models, underscoring MBDA’s ongoing commitment to innovation across various defense platforms. The return of high-intensity conflict in Europe, notably with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has highlighted the critical importance of air and missile defense systems to protect infrastructure and populations. Deep-strike capabilities have become essential for neutralizing adversarial threats before they reach the front lines, allowing armed forces to target command centers, logistics hubs, and strategic assets beyond immediate combat zones. In this context, MBDA’s FC/ASW program is positioned as a crucial element in bolstering European security, ensuring that European forces have access to advanced, sovereign deep-strike solutions in an increasingly contested global environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/euronaval-2024-mbda-strengthens-european-deep-strike-capability-with-fc-asw-program	2024-11-07T05:07:25-08:00	
Lockheed Martin’s X-59 QueSST experimental aircraft reaches key step toward first supersonic flight	On November 6, 2024, the NASA announced that Lockheed Martin’s X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology (X-59 QueSST) experimental aircraft reached a critical development milestone with its first engine run at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. This milestone marks the beginning of engine-run tests, which commenced on October 30, 2024, allowing the X-59 team to confirm that the aircraft’s systems function effectively when powered by its own engine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Lockheed Martin X-59 QueSST’s engine, a modified F414-GE-100, generates 98 kN of thrust and is positioned atop the aircraft to reduce noise impact. (Picture source: NASA) During earlier stages, the team used external power sources to conduct preliminary tests. These tests are integral to NASA’s X-59 QueSST mission, aimed at reducing the noise impact of supersonic flight over land, potentially informing future regulations for commercial supersonic travel as well as leading to improvements in stealth aircraft. Engine-run tests are being conducted in phases. In the initial phase, the X-59’s engine was rotated at a low speed without ignition to detect any leaks and confirm that systems were synchronized and operating correctly. Subsequently, the team fueled the aircraft and conducted low-power engine tests, ensuring that the engine, along with hydraulic, electrical, and environmental control systems, operated without malfunctions or leaks when powered directly by the engine. Jay Brandon, NASA's X-59 chief engineer, described this stage as preliminary verification to ensure that all systems were operational before advancing to full engine operation. Designed to mitigate sonic booms, the X-59 is intended to produce a quieter sonic effect, which NASA describes as a 'thump,' even at supersonic speeds. This feature is central to the X-59 QueSST mission’s goal of assessing public perception of reduced noise, with data that could eventually help regulators review current restrictions on supersonic flight over land. The X-59’s engine, a modified F414-GE-100, generates 98 kN of thrust and is positioned atop the aircraft to reduce noise impact. This design enables the X-59 to reach Mach 1.4, or roughly 1,488 kilometers per hour, at an altitude of approximately 16,764 meters. The engine’s placement and thrust facilitate meeting mission objectives by enabling supersonic flight with reduced noise impact at ground level. These tests are part of a series of ground evaluations required for the aircraft’s safe progression toward flight. Following initial engine tests, the team will proceed with more rigorous evaluations, including high-power tests, rapid throttle changes, and flight condition simulations. This phase will lead to aluminum bird testing, during which the aircraft’s systems are monitored under various operating scenarios, including normal and failure conditions. The team will conduct taxi tests, during which the X-59 will move on the ground to verify its handling capabilities. Designed to mitigate sonic booms, the X-59 is intended to produce a quieter sonic effect, which NASA describes as a 'thump,' even at supersonic speeds. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The X-59, measuring approximately 30.4 meters in length with a wingspan of 9 meters, has been in development since NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a preliminary design contract in 2016. Although initially projected to begin flight tests in 2021, the schedule has been adjusted, with the first flight now expected in early 2025. The X-59’s design includes an enhanced flight vision system (EVS) with an external vision system (XVS) that provides a forward view to compensate for the limited visibility due to the aircraft’s extended nose. Supplied by Collins Aerospace, this visibility technology integrates multispectral imaging systems to enhance situational awareness, particularly during landing. With a target cruising speed of Mach 1.42 (around 1,510 kilometers per hour), the X-59 aims to reach a ground noise level of 75 effective perceived noise decibels (EPNdB), comparable to the sound of a car door closing. This would be significantly quieter than the Concorde’s supersonic boom, estimated between 105 and 110 EPNdB. By using a long, narrow airframe and a top-mounted engine intake, the X-59’s design is intended to reduce the intensity of the sonic boom experienced on the ground. In addition to its primary noise reduction features, the aircraft is equipped with components such as a cockpit, canopy, and ejection seat from a Northrop T-38, and landing gear from an F-16. The X-59 QueSST mission’s testing phase will include community evaluations across U.S. cities from 2023 to 2025. These tests will collect feedback on noise perception from residents, contributing data that will be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by 2027. These findings could inform regulatory discussions regarding commercial supersonic flight over land, potentially opening new supersonic travel routes by 2028. The X-59 development has comprised multiple stages, including wind tunnel testing, structural assembly, and system integration conducted over recent years. With its 98 kN of thrust, the aircraft is projected to reach a maximum speed of Mach 1.5 or 1,593 kilometers per hour, with a cruise speed of Mach 1.42 or 1,510 kilometers per hour at 16,764 meters. Further evaluations will proceed as NASA continues toward the planned first flight, currently targeted for early 2025. Curiously, the engine-run tests of the X-59 are taking place at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, a site also linked to the development of another high-profile and highly classified project: the SR-72 hypersonic aircraft. The X-59, which seeks to achieve quieter supersonic flight, involves advanced noise-reduction technologies, a modified engine configuration, and complex system integrations—features that are also pertinent to hypersonic and high-speed aircraft design. As the SR-72 aims to reach speeds of up to Mach 6, insights into high-speed aerodynamics, minimizing ground-level impact, and integrating advanced propulsion systems will be crucial. Observations from the X-59’s testing could support approaches to challenges anticipated in the SR-72 program, such as maintaining structural integrity at high speeds and managing the thermal and acoustic effects associated with hypersonic flight. The X-59’s tests, therefore, may contribute valuable data and engineering insights for the SR-72’s development trajectory. With a target cruising speed of Mach 1.42 (around 1,510 kilometers per hour), the X-59 aims to reach a ground noise level of 75 effective perceived noise decibels (EPNdB), comparable to the sound of a car door closing.

Lockheed Martin’s unmanned stealth tanker concept signals new era for US Air Force	As reported by The War Zone on November 6, 2024, Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division has introduced a conceptual design for a stealthy, pilot-optional aerial refueling tanker. This design aligns with the U.S. Air Force’s Next Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) plans, which are part of the broader Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) ecosystem aimed at addressing evolving operational needs as the Air Force refines requirements for a 'system of systems.' However, budget constraints are challenging the fulfillment of modernization goals, including this new refueling capability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The NGAS is expected to include traditional tankers like the KC-46 and KC-135, with the possible addition of refueling drones to allow uncrewed tankers to operate closer to contested areas, reducing risk to human crews. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin Skunk Works) The tanker concept features a swept-wing configuration with canted vertical stabilizers and stealth-enhancing elements, such as a chine line wrapping around the fuselage and saw-tooth paneling. A shrouded exhaust with serrated edges is positioned at the rear, which may help reduce radar and infrared detectability. In the rendering released by Lockheed Martin, the tanker is shown refueling two F-35A Joint Strike Fighters using refueling booms mounted near the wingtips. Although the Air Force primarily uses the boom method for refueling, it remains uncertain whether this tanker concept could also support the Navy and Marine Corps’ probe-and-drogue method. A retractable boom could enhance radar stealth but might compromise the boom’s structural integrity, posing potential operational challenges. The design’s pilot-optional configuration offers flexibility, with provisions for both crewed and uncrewed operations. This adaptability reflects a broader trend, as Skunk Works has previously proposed advanced tanker concepts, including blended-wing body designs. A Lockheed Martin representative confirmed that Skunk Works is exploring configurations intended to balance survivability, affordability, and autonomy in refueling capabilities. The NGAS is expected to include traditional tankers like the KC-46 and KC-135, with the possible addition of refueling drones for a networked approach. This model would allow uncrewed tankers to operate closer to contested areas, reducing risk to human crews. Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has noted the need for stealthy tankers capable of operating near anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) zones, potentially extending the range of Air Force missions without compromising tanker safety. Skunk Works’ design is depicted as capable of mid-air refueling itself, a feature that could extend its operational range. Alongside Skunk Works’ concept, Boeing has proposed a land-based variant of its MQ-25 Stingray drone, initially developed for the U.S. Navy, as a potential NGAS solution. The Air Force is also exploring 'buddy store' refueling pods, which could enable other aircraft to function as small tankers within the refueling ecosystem. Incorporating stealth tankers with uncrewed platforms and NGAD systems could help sustain operations near forward zones, providing flexibility in high-threat environments. Kendall has emphasized the need for stealthy refueling assets, especially in regions like the Pacific, where the long operational distances may place current tanker fleets at risk. At the recent ATA symposium, Kendall discussed the financial pressures facing NGAS and NGAD initiatives, noting how these costs intersect with other priorities, such as the planned sixth-generation stealth fighter and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) drones. The Air Force is reassessing the NGAD program, including whether the fighter should be crewed or uncrewed, in response to budget concerns. Kendall indicated that the Air Force expects to finalize NGAS requirements by the end of the year and has issued a request for information from industry on refueling and mission systems to support a competitive vendor pool. Skunk Works, known for its history of rapid prototyping, has developed aircraft like the P-80, U-2, and F-117 Nighthawk using a process focused on quickly achieving prototype status. This approach has facilitated projects such as the X-55A and the P-175 Polecat drone. However, transitioning these concepts from prototype to operational production has often been challenging, as demonstrated by the F-35 program. Production-phase issues highlighted concerns about 'concurrency,' in which problems identified during development were addressed simultaneously on production units, leading to delays and increased costs. The Air Force is also exploring other refueling methods, including Agile Combat Employment, to reduce reliance on aerial refueling when possible. Gen. Kevin Schneider of Pacific Air Forces noted that, while ground-based refueling is being considered, aerial refueling remains a priority to support dispersed operations. As the Air Force advances its NGAS initiative, the focus on adaptable and survivable refueling solutions will remain central to its strategy. Skunk Works’ latest tanker concept, along with the Air Force’s exploration of innovative refueling systems and integration of stealth and autonomous capabilities, underscores ongoing efforts to maintain effective aerial refueling support in high-threat scenarios.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/lockheed-martins-unmanned-stealth-tanker-concept-signals-new-era-for-us-air-force	2024-11-07T00:44:58-08:00

This law is designed to create a financing mechanism for this strategic industry, with particular support for Polish ammunition manufacturers to scale up their production of large-caliber rounds. According to the government, this production boost aims to ensure the Polish Armed Forces have the necessary stockpiles for national defense. Funding for this initiative will primarily come from the Capital Investment Fund, which will receive around 3 billion zlotys through this legislation. The Ministry of National Defense will contribute 2 billion zlotys from its budget, while the Ministry of State Assets will facilitate the transfer to the Capital Investment Fund. Part of this amount will come from state securities currently held by the Strategic Reserves Agency, which will be reallocated to support this industrial expansion. Through this arrangement, the Ministry of State Assets will acquire equity in the relevant companies on behalf of the State. This increase in ammunition production capacity aligns with Poland’s broader goal of achieving autonomy in its strategic munitions and arms supplies. In October, Poland’s WB Group signed an agreement with South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace to establish a joint venture focused on missile production. This partnership, based on a memorandum of intent signed in September, aims to manufacture surface-to-surface missiles, potentially for K239 Chunmoo launchers, known as Homar-K in Poland. Although initially dedicated to missile production, the plant may eventually extend to artillery shell production. Poland’s efforts to strengthen its ammunition production capabilities not only address domestic needs but also explore export opportunities. Polish companies are closely collaborating to integrate new technologies that support increased industrial production of munitions. Current projects, such as the factory with Hanwha Aerospace, reflect a commitment to innovation and self-sufficiency in a sector critical to national security. Poland has undertaken a significant modernization of its defense industry, raising military spending to nearly 4% of GDP in 2024. This initiative aims to bolster military capabilities amid increasing geopolitical threats. Warsaw has forged strategic partnerships with countries like South Korea, particularly for the production of K2 Black Panther tanks. Additionally, Poland has invested heavily in military equipment acquisitions, including Leopard 2A5 tanks and Patriot missile defense systems. These efforts are intended to modernize the Polish Armed Forces and strengthen the national defense industry. The threat from Russia, heightened by the invasion of Ukraine, poses a direct risk to Poland, which borders the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The November 2024 election of Donald Trump has raised concerns over a potential reduction in U.S. aid to Ukraine, which could embolden a more aggressive Russian stance in the region. In response to these challenges, Poland is reinforcing its defense capabilities and diversifying international partnerships to ensure national security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/poland-accelerates-ammunition-production-in-response-to-russian-threat-and-uncertainty-of-ukraine-support	2024-11-06T05:13:16-08:00

Breaking News: Trump Elected President Signals Shift in US Military Strategy and Ukraine Aid	Donald Trump's return to the White House is set to bring significant changes to U.S. military and foreign policy, with major implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly questioned the scale and focus of American support for Ukraine, suggesting he would reduce or reevaluate aid to Kyiv. His previous administration had a complex relationship with Russia and NATO, leading to uncertainty among allies about America’s long-term commitments. Now, his re-election suggests a shift towards a more isolationist approach that prioritizes U.S. interests over international military engagements.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Ukraine Defense Contact Group attendees are welcomed at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, on March 19, 2024, with Ukrainian and U.S. flags symbolizing the strong international support for Ukraine's defense efforts. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has become Kyiv's leading military supporter, committing over $54 billion in security assistance to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russian forces. This support includes sophisticated systems such as Patriot missile batteries, HIMARS rocket artillery, Abrams tanks, and a range of air defense and anti-tank weapons essential for countering Russian advancements. The aid has been crucial in strengthening Ukraine's defensive capabilities on multiple fronts, allowing it to push back against Russian troops and protect vital urban areas. Despite bipartisan support in Congress for Ukraine funding, Trump’s return to office signals a potential reevaluation of this strategy, with the former president indicating that he would convert some aid to loans and possibly reduce overall funding, a move that has drawn both support and criticism from NATO allies and within U.S. political circles concerned about maintaining Ukraine’s resilience. Trump has pledged to bring a quick end to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, asserting he could negotiate a peace settlement 'within 24 hours' of taking office. However, the details of this strategy still need to be clarified. His stated approach involves high-stakes negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, potentially including cuts to U.S. military assistance as a means to pressure both sides toward an agreement. While this aligns with the preferences of some of Trump’s voter base—many of whom support reducing aid to Ukraine—critics warn that such a move could embolden Russian ambitions and potentially destabilize the region further if it compromises Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty. Trump’s stance on foreign aid comes amid a broader reorientation of U.S. defense priorities, with the fiscal year 2024 defense budget projected to be a record $842 billion. This budget reflects a shift toward modernization and high-priority technologies to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. For example, significant funding has been allocated to nuclear arsenal upgrades, advanced cyber capabilities, and expanding U.S. military presence in Asia. Under Trump, this trend may accelerate, potentially reducing the American military footprint in Europe while focusing on domestic and Indo-Pacific security interests. NATO allies, already preparing for a potential reduction in U.S. support for Ukraine, are exploring mechanisms to ensure continuity in assistance independent of American aid to maintain Ukraine’s defenses in the face of these potential shifts. Trump’s re-election has spurred NATO and European allies to prepare for potential shifts in the U.S.-led support structure. During his previous term, Trump urged NATO members to increase their defense contributions, and he is expected to renew those demands. Recently, NATO has been working to assume a more direct role in coordinating military aid for Ukraine, a step seen as a means of maintaining consistent support even if U.S. contributions are curtailed. European allies, including Germany and France, have expressed a commitment to uphold assistance for Ukraine’s defense, regardless of the U.S.’s level of engagement. However, Trump’s approach may strain transatlantic relations, as allies brace for possible adjustments in U.S. defense strategy. As Trump’s administration prepares to reenter the global stage with new policies, Ukraine’s allies are weighing how these changes might impact Kyiv’s ongoing fight against Russian aggression. European governments are poised to fill potential gaps in military aid, and NATO is adjusting its strategy to ensure continuity in Ukraine’s defense. Meanwhile, Ukrainian leaders brace for potentially significant shifts in the diplomatic relationship with Washington, anticipating that the coming months may bring both challenges and new avenues in their efforts to secure peace.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-trump-elected-president-signals-shift-in-us-military-strategy-and-ukraine-aid	2024-11-06T02:31:01-08:00

However, the HELMA-P system’s deployment is not without challenges. Maintaining high-energy performance over extended periods requires efficient power and cooling solutions, especially when integrated into mobile platforms. Atmospheric conditions such as fog, rain, and dust can also impact the system’s effectiveness, underscoring the need for continued research into adaptive optics and beam stabilization technologies. Moreover, as directed-energy weapons enter the military domain, establishing clear engagement protocols becomes essential. Laser weapons like HELMA-P demand strict safety standards to prevent unintended harm, particularly in complex operational theaters. Navigating these operational and technical challenges will be crucial as HELMA-P and similar systems transition into regular use, requiring collaboration across defense and research sectors to optimize performance and adaptability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/euronaval-2024-france-develops-helma-p-laser-weapon-to-counter-new-aerial-threats-in-wake-of-ukraine-war	2024-11-06T02:21:48-08:00	
China develops new J-15T naval fighter optimized for electromagnetic catapult takeoff	At the Zhuhai Air Show 2024, China introduced the J-15T, a new variant of its J-15 carrier-borne fighter jet, which is designed for use on the Chinese Navy’s (PLAN) Fujian aircraft carrier. This variant represents the PLAN’s first catapult-capable model of the J-15 and aligns with the Fujian's electromagnetic catapult-assisted takeoff system. The J-15T’s arrival with the tail number 1518 marks the first appearance of a PLAN naval fighter jet at a public event in Zhuhai, underscoring the Navy’s interest in highlighting this aircraft within its carrier fleet. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Chinese J-15T was first sighted in 2014 as a CATOBAR (catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery) adaptation of the Russian Su-33 Flanker-D, modified for the Chinese Navy’s upcoming Fujian aircraft carriers with electromagnetic catapults. (Picture source: Weibo) The Shenyang J-15T Flying Shark incorporates various structural and functional modifications suited to catapult-assisted launches and arrested recoveries, differentiating it from the J-15B, which is limited to ski-jump carriers. Equipped with reinforced front landing gear, a launch bar, and a tail hook, the J-15T is designed to withstand the stresses of catapult launches. This adaptation allows it to operate from both ski-jump and catapult-equipped carriers, providing increased versatility in line with the PLAN's evolving carrier capabilities. Visual changes include a straight wingtip pylon designed for the PL-10 air-to-air missile, a new IRST (infrared search and track) system located at the nose, and a modified diffraction HUD (head-up display) in front of the cockpit. The aircraft is also identifiable by its grey-white radome and modified exhaust nozzles from the WS-10B 'Taihang' engines, which replace the AL-31 engines previously supplied by Russia. These modifications indicate a shift towards domestic production of key components. The J-15T variant was first reported in 2014 as a CATOBAR (catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery) adaptation of the Russian Su-33 Flanker-D, modified for PLAN’s upcoming Type 003 Fujian aircraft carriers with electromagnetic catapults. This variant achieved its maiden flight in July 2016, followed by ground-based electromagnetic catapult tests in November at the Huangdicun Naval Air Base, an indicator of China’s increasing interest in integrating catapult-assisted launches with its carrier fleet. A recent video of the J-15T, initially posted on China’s Weibo platform, provided an early public look at this version, showcasing its reinforced landing gear and other modifications needed for catapult launches. The footage highlighted several of the J-15T’s features, including operational PLAN grey paint, calibration markings for test data collection, and distinctive structural elements on the landing gear. One of the aircraft featured in the video, a prototype with a yellow primer, is reportedly retired from active testing, indicating its extended use in the development process. Further distinguishing itself from the earlier J-15 models, the J-15T includes updated avionics, which may incorporate an AESA (Active Electronically Scanning Array) radar, along with weight reductions in the airframe. These changes suggest increased capacity for payloads, enabling the aircraft to carry additional fuel, weaponry, or equipment. Reports indicate the J-15T could support SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) missions with long-range air-to-air missiles, potentially broadening its role within the PLAN’s carrier air wing. A minor but interesting detail is that the J-15T’s wingtip pylons for the PL-10 air-to-air missiles are slightly reprofiled compared to the standard layout seen on the J-16, hinting at adjustments tailored for carrier-based operations. The J-15T may operate in a future mixed air wing alongside stealth drones and other carrier-capable aircraft. Analysts speculate that these could include the Shenyang J-35A, a new stealth fighter model which, along with the J-15T, may complement the PLAN’s carrier operations. A potential two-seat J-15D variant, configured for electronic warfare with jamming pods on its wingtips, similar to those on the U.S. Navy’s EA-18G Growler, has also undergone testing, reflecting PLAN’s exploration of various carrier-based aircraft configurations to enhance electronic warfare capabilities. If produced, this electronic warfare variant may share CATOBAR compatibility with the J-15T. With four aircraft carriers planned, including the Fujian, the PLAN’s requirements for carrier-capable aircraft are increasing. The J-15T, alongside support and advanced strike variants, may meet the PLAN’s demand for versatile, adaptable naval aircraft. The development of the J-15T and other carrier-based aircraft indicates an ongoing focus on expanding and modernizing the PLAN’s air wing capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-develops-new-j-15t-naval-fighter-optimized-for-electromagnetic-catapult-takeoff	2024-11-06T01:40:56-08:00	
France Positions to Equip Cyprus with Leclerc Tanks and Mistral Missiles in Response to Turkish Ambitions	In the context of strengthening the military arsenal of the Republic of Cyprus in response to Turkish ambitions, France is working to maintain a significant influence within the Cypriot National Guard, as reported by the Cypriot daily Kathimerini on October 13, 2024. Competing directly with Germany, Paris is promoting several advanced weapon systems for Cyprus, including Leclerc tanks and Mistral missiles. Now reaching the end of its operational cycle within the Cypriot forces, the latter system could be removed from the island's arsenal and redirected to Ukraine, thereby allowing partial renewal with more modern French equipment. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France is also urging Cyprus to consider acquiring Leclerc tanks, competing directly with Germany’s military industry for a potential €250 million contract (Picture source: French MoD) Among the French equipment already supplied to Cyprus are attack helicopters, marking an initial step in military cooperation between the two nations. France now also targets the market for Cypriot battle tanks, aiming to replace the T-80U of Russian origin. This market is particularly competitive, with Germany offering its Leopard tanks. To reinforce its position, France has extended a broader offer that includes additional military systems. A key element of the negotiation revolves around Mistral missiles, acquired forty years ago and primarily used for training. Paris has proposed reclaiming these now-obsolete missiles to reallocate them to Ukraine, where they could see a second operational life. Currently, the National Guard possesses between 150 and 170 of these short-range anti-aircraft systems, which have reached the end of their operational life. In exchange, France would offer Cyprus financial benefits, such as discounts on new Mistral missiles or other French-made equipment. Although this offer appears attractive, Cypriot officials have expressed their intention to negotiate better terms, particularly in terms of compensation, before making a final decision. Beyond the Mistral systems, France is also urging Cyprus to consider acquiring Leclerc tanks, competing directly with Germany’s military industry for a potential €250 million contract. The exact nature of the proposed Leclerc tanks, whether new or used, remains unclear, but France may consider providing second-hand units from a lot previously sold to the United Arab Emirates. Drawing on its past support during the U.S. arms embargo on Cyprus, when France was one of the few countries supplying modern weapons, Paris hopes to leverage this privileged relationship to secure a position in this market. France and Cyprus have a longstanding military cooperation, with several French systems holding an important place within the National Guard's arsenal. Over the past decade, Cyprus has invested approximately €310 million in French military equipment. Recent acquisitions include upgraded Mistral and Exocet systems, along with anti-tank missiles and French armored vehicles. The range of French systems, including attack helicopters, rocket systems, tanks, and self-propelled guns, underscores France's commitment to securing long-term defense contracts with Nicosia. The competition to renew Cypriot military equipment is intensifying as Germany, with its Leopard tanks, competes with Paris for strategic contracts. However, France relies on its historic support during the U.S. embargo, hoping to persuade Nicosia to choose French equipment for its next acquisitions. These proposals, submitted before last summer, have not yet received a formal response. However, they could enable Cyprus to continue modernizing its forces in response to Turkey's growing ambitions in the region, marked by frequent military exercises and regular reinforcement of Turkish forces on the island. Beyond simply providing armaments, France views this military cooperation as an opportunity to affirm its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean, where strategic interests are increasingly contested.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-positions-to-equip-cyprus-with-leclerc-tanks-and-mistral-missiles-in-response-to-turkish-ambitions	2024-11-06T01:36:29-08:00

Focus | What to know about China’s new J-35A stealth fighter as a potential US F-35 competitor	On November 5, 2024, Colonel Niu Wenbo of the Air Force Equipment Department confirmed that China’s latest medium-sized stealth multi-purpose fighter, the J-35A, will be showcased at the 15th China Air Show, scheduled for November 12–17, 2024. Following the press conference, an official photo of the J-35A was released, marking its first public unveiling and signaling its readiness for operational service within the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link With the addition of the J-35A to the J-20, China becomes the second country, after the United States, to possess two operational stealth fighter models simultaneously. (Picture source: Weibo/CCTV News) The development of the J-35A traces back to the J-31/FC-31 Gyrfalcon, a project initiated by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) as a self-funded, export-oriented model. The J-31 prototype first appeared in 2012, generating considerable interest. Over time, the J-31 underwent multiple design changes, including forward-swept intake ramps, DSI bumps, and oblique vertical stabilizers, aiming to create a competitive fighter for the global market. Initially targeted for export, the model eventually attracted attention from the PLA, particularly the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which evaluated a carrier-capable version under the designation J-35. The naval variant completed its maiden flight on October 29, 2021, featuring modifications like a launch bar and folding wings for carrier operations. Significant changes between the earlier FC-31 demonstrator and the J-35A, a land-based variant of the J-35 naval fighter, include a new radome without a pitot tube, an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), updated nose and main landing gear bay doors, a modified Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI), and a redesigned canopy. The airframe now includes a gun pod, a wide-area heads-up display, and a Luneburg lens to assist with radar signature management. Observations indicate that the fighter’s twin vertical stabilizers and twin-engine configuration include a serrated nozzle, which could be powered by either the WS-13 or the RD-33-derived WS-21 engines, both of which offer similar performance levels. Alongside the domestic J-35A variant, an export version, the J-35E, has been developed. However, the carrier-based J-35 variant currently lacks an international market, as few nations possess the extensive resources required for naval operations. The naval J-35 version could provide carrier-based capabilities, though this would be feasible mainly for nations with catapult launch systems, thus narrowing its potential market. Military analyst Li Li, quoted by China Central Television News, states that the J-35A’s induction marks an expansion in the PLAAF’s stealth capabilities, positioning it alongside the J-20. This step could align PLAAF’s capabilities with the U.S. Air Force, which operates the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. Within the PLAAF, the J-35A joins an informal fleet lineup known as the 'Four Musketeers,' comprising the J-10C, J-16, J-20, and the new J-35A. Notably, this reveal coincides with the 75th-anniversary celebrations of the PLAAF, during which the air force will feature 36 different types of equipment through flight demonstrations and static displays. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. Images depict the J-35A positioned in a shelter typically used by the PLAAF, emphasizing its role as a land-based model. However, the new J-35A could potentially serve as a main carrier aircraft in a naval variant, which would align with China’s expanding capabilities in both aerial and maritime domains. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. (Picture source: US DoD and CCTV News) Reports over the years have noted speculation that the J-31’s development, which led to the J-35A, may have drawn on data from the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program, which led to the F-35, though these claims remain unverified. Some Russian aviation experts have asserted that the J-31 is a domestic design, independent of existing Western aircraft. The design's evolution, including stealth capabilities and multi-role features, indicates a continued focus by China on producing advanced fifth-generation fighters. The F-35 and J-35A display clear visual distinctions that suggest differences in design priorities and potential roles. The F-35 has a rounded, gently sloped nose, while the J-35A's nose is sharper with a more defined chine line. This difference is also evident in the canopy shape: the F-35 features a single-piece, bubble-style canopy with a smooth curve, whereas the J-35A’s canopy is slightly more angular and has a flatter profile. In terms of engine exhaust nozzles, the F-35 uses a polygonal design intended to enhance certain performance characteristics, while the J-35A, typically seen with a rounder exhaust, reflects a different approach in nozzle configuration. The intake designs also vary, with the F-35 featuring larger, straight-sided intakes positioned close to the fuselage, and the J-35A’s narrower intakes angled slightly outward, giving it a distinctive shape. The wing shapes and positions add further contrast between the two aircraft. The F-35’s trapezoidal wings integrate with the fuselage in one configuration, while the J-35A’s trapezoidal wings are larger and have a different placement, possibly reflecting considerations for carrier-based operations. The tail fin design diverges as well: the F-35’s vertical stabilizers are shorter and blend closely into the fuselage, while the J-35A’s stabilizers are taller and angled outward, resembling other designs in China's stealth aircraft lineup, such as the J-20. Finally, the landing gear differs in structure and placement. The F-35 has thicker landing gear, positioned in alignment with its structural design, while the J-35A’s landing gear may be adapted for carrier operations, following certain design conventions observed in other Chinese aircraft. These distinctions suggest each aircraft's design reflects specific operational requirements and design philosophies, with the F-35 and J-35A each incorporating elements that align with their respective priorities and roles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-to-know-about-chinas-new-j-35a-stealth-fighter-as-a-potential-us-f-35-competitor	2024-11-05T02:45:23-08:00

The Middle East has seen several notable incidents this year, including repeated strikes between Iran and Israel. In April, an Iranian attack followed an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, and in October, further actions purportedly in retaliation for targeted eliminations of Iranian-aligned leaders raised concerns over potential escalation. In response, the U.S. aims to strengthen its deterrent posture in the region, with the B-52s playing a central role due to their long-range strike capacity. The presence of B-52 bombers underscores the strategic flexibility of the U.S., as these aircraft can deliver both conventional and nuclear payloads and perform a variety of missions such as strategic attack, close air support, air interdiction, and maritime operations. This heightened military presence comes at a time of increased regional tensions, with Israel recently deploying approximately 100 fighter jets, including F-35s, in strikes targeting Iranian bases, and Iran responding in October with a substantial missile strike against Israel, claiming it as retaliation for attacks on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. The deployments are expected to continue over the coming months, even as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, stationed in the region since August, is set to depart. Meanwhile, the U.S. has bolstered Israel's missile defense capabilities with the deployment of a THAAD system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, and accompanied by 100 U.S. service members for operation support. The B-52 is not the only strategic bomber currently mobilized. In parallel, the U.S. deployed the B-1B Lancer to the Korean Peninsula, conducting trilateral exercises with South Korean and Japanese fighters in response to North Korea's recent intercontinental ballistic missile test. This deployment alongside Asian allies also emphasizes a shared commitment to counter North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. The increased presence of strategic bombers in both regions demonstrates the U.S.'s rapid deployment capability to deter adversaries in sensitive global areas, including Iran, North Korea, and China. In June 2024, B-52s were deployed to Guam for a live-fire test involving the AGM-183 hypersonic weapon, highlighting their strategic role in the Pacific. In summary, the deployment of B-52 bombers to the Middle East reflects the U.S.'s commitment to maintaining regional stability amid persistent threats from Iran and its allies. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s message remains clear: any attack on U.S. interests will be met with prompt and proportionate defensive measures. These actions underscore the U.S.'s resolve to protect its interests and support its partners during a period of heightened regional tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-air-force-strengthens-its-presence-in-middle-east-with-deployment-of-new-b-52h-bombers-amid-tensions-with-iran	2024-11-05T01:52:06-08:00

Exclusive: Israeli Army Explores Formation of Anti-Tank Units with Seized Hezbollah Kornet and Almas Missiles	In a report published on November 4, 2024, by Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, the Israeli army is reportedly examining the potential to create specialized anti-tank units equipped with seized Hezbollah anti-tank weaponry, including thousands of Russian-made Kornet and Iranian-made Almas anti-tank missiles. This move would be part of a broader Israeli defense strategy aimed at leveraging captured enemy equipment to enhance tactical flexibility and reduce acquisition costs for advanced armament.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During a Golani Brigade operation in the Western Sector of Lebanon, Israeli forces uncovered weaponry, a tunnel system, and underground bunkers that were used by the terror organization Hezbollah. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) The use of captured enemy equipment by the Israeli armed forces is not a new tactic. Since the country’s founding, Israel has seized and integrated various types of enemy material, dating back to conflicts such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1967 Six-Day War. Captured Arab armor and artillery were commonly refurbished and used to supplement Israel’s limited military resources. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, for example, Israel captured Soviet-origin T-54 and T-55 tanks from Syrian and Egyptian forces. These tanks were later refurbished and repurposed, providing Israel with additional armor strength during critical periods of regional conflict. Similarly, in the 1980s, Israel repurposed Soviet-made weaponry captured from various adversaries, particularly during the Lebanon conflict. Captured equipment is often studied intensively to understand its capabilities and limitations, enabling the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to develop effective countermeasures and, if feasible, repurpose this hardware for their own operational needs. The Kornet and Almas anti-tank missiles, seized in recent operations against Hezbollah, represent potent assets in Israel’s anti-tank arsenal. Initially developed by Russia, the Kornet (ATGM 9M133) is a laser-guided anti-tank missile system known for its range, armor-penetrating capability, and precision. With a maximum effective range of up to 5,500 meters, the Kornet can penetrate up to 1,200 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) with its tandem-warhead design, making it a serious threat to modern armored vehicles and even fortified positions. Hezbollah’s use of the Kornet missile in previous conflicts with Israel demonstrated its ability to penetrate even Israel’s Merkava main battle tanks, a lesson the IDF has not forgotten. The Iranian-made Almas missile, another advanced anti-tank weapon, has similar capabilities to the Kornet, boasting high penetration power and a range that allows for significant standoff engagement. Reports indicate that the Almas missile was designed as an indigenous Iranian effort to replicate and even surpass some of the Kornet's capabilities, with a range of up to 8 kilometers in its most recent configurations. The acquisition of these missiles allows the IDF to significantly enhance its ground unit capabilities without procuring similar systems externally. If the IDF formalizes the creation of anti-tank units armed with Kornet and Almas missiles, it could represent a strategic shift in how Israel conducts anti-armor operations. These missiles would allow Israeli forces to engage armored threats at greater distances and in diverse terrains, an asset particularly useful in the hilly and urbanized areas where conflicts with Hezbollah frequently take place. Establishing these units would enable Israel to maximize the efficiency of seized weapons, making them a cost-effective means of bolstering national defense. Moreover, deploying such units could potentially reduce Israel's dependence on more expensive, domestically produced anti-tank systems, such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems' Spike family of missiles. Integrating Kornet and Almas missiles would also provide a tactical advantage in scenarios where these systems are already familiar to enemy forces but are now used against them by IDF personnel. The IDF’s consideration of using captured Kornet and Almas missiles aligns with a long-standing practice of repurposing enemy weapons, which allows Israel to turn adversarial capabilities against their original owners effectively. With tensions high in the region, particularly with Hezbollah in Lebanon, this development underscores the IDF’s commitment to adapting its resources and strategies to emerging threats. By potentially fielding anti-tank units using seized equipment, Israel not only strengthens its own defenses but also leverages an innovative approach that could serve as a model for other nations facing similar strategic challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-israeli-army-explores-formation-of-anti-tank-units-with-seized-hezbollah-kornet-and-almas-missiles	2024-11-04T06:50:46-08:00

French German Railgun Reaches Hypersonic Speeds A New Era of Defense	According to information published by Opex360 on November 3, 2024, the French Navy is set to unveil its new electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at speeds reaching Mach 8.7. This innovation, led by the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) under the Defense Innovation Agency (AID) represents a groundbreaking shift in naval weaponry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unveiling the Future of Naval Artillery: The electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at Mach 8.7, promises unprecedented speed, range, and precision in maritime defense. (Picture source: ISL) Other nations, however, have continued exploring the EMRG’s potential. China, for instance, reportedly tested a railgun from its amphibious assault ship Haiyang Shan, though these claims remain unverified. Japan has also joined the race, with its Ministry of Defense’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA) achieving a first successful test in October 2023, firing a 40 mm projectile at Mach 6.5 with a 5-megajoule railgun. Europe, recognizing the strategic advantages of EMRG technology, has pursued joint projects to bolster its defense capabilities. The European Union tasked the ISL with coordinating the PILUM project (Projectiles for Increased Long-range Effects Using Electromagnetic Railgun), which successfully demonstrated the potential for long-range, high-precision projectile launches over several hundred kilometers. The project’s success led to the establishment of the THEMA (Technology for Electro-Magnetic Artillery) program in June 2023, funded by a €15 million grant from the European Defense Fund (EDF). In a recent move to accelerate development, Japan entered a partnership with France and Germany, signing a Terms of Reference (TOR) agreement. This partnership paves the way for collaboration between Japan’s ATLA and the ISL, aiming to advance electromagnetic weapons technology across borders. The French General Directorate for Armament (DGA) has initiated an ambitious program to develop an electromagnetic railgun for the French Navy, known as the RAILGUN project. This project aims to strengthen the Navy's capabilities against evolving maritime threats, particularly hypersonic and saturation attacks. Leveraging electromagnetic energy to propel projectiles at extreme velocities, the railgun is designed for high precision over extended distances, with a reported range exceeding 200 kilometers. This impressive range, coupled with the railgun’s reduced projectile flight times, provides distinct advantages in defensive operations, especially in intercepting fast-moving aerial threats. As detailed by AID (Agence de l'Innovation de Défense), the RAILGUN system is set to bring notable advancements to French naval warfare. Positioned on a vessel's bow, the system would maximize anti-air efficacy by decreasing engagement times and allowing for rapid, high-velocity impacts that increase the likelihood of neutralizing incoming threats. Additionally, since railgun technology eliminates the need for conventional explosive propellants, it can reduce space requirements for ammunition storage on board, enabling vessels to carry more rounds and potentially reduce resupply needs. ISL, for its part, confirmed that the railgun presented at Euronaval can accelerate projectiles to 3,000 meters per second – equivalent to 10,800 km/h or Mach 8.7. Given that speeds above Mach 5 qualify as hypersonic, this weapon stands as a formidable advancement in naval defense technology. The mechanics of an electromagnetic railgun involve creating a magnetic field between two conductive rails through a high-intensity electric current. This field accelerates the projectile, itself a conductor, via the Lorentz force. However, achieving such extreme velocities presents significant challenges. The materials used must withstand intense mechanical stress, and the system requires an immense energy source capable of instantaneous release. As the French Navy moves forward with the RAILGUN project, the electromagnetic railgun could revolutionize naval artillery, setting a new standard in range, speed, and firepower.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-german-railgun-reaches-hypersonic-speeds-a-new-era-of-defense	2024-11-04T05:49:42-08:00

Al Qaria vs Remus 600: How Houthi’s New Drone Mirrors US Underwater Tech	According to information published by Russian sources on October 29, 2024, Yemen's Houthi forces, or Ansar Allah, have introduced a new, highly lethal submersible drone, dubbed the 'Al-Qaria' — a name inspired by a Koranic term symbolizing a 'Great Calamity' or 'Great Disaster.'This innovative underwater vehicle represents the latest addition to the Houthis’ arsenal, previously consisting of ballistic missiles, aerial drones, and explosive surface vessels, all of which have already proven effective in disrupting Red Sea trade routes.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Houthi forces unveil the Al-Qaria submersible strike drone, a new underwater threat designed to disrupt Red Sea maritime security, escalating tensions for both commercial and military vessels in the region. (Picture source: Houthi Media) Footage released by the Houthis’ media channels over the weekend shows the Al-Qaria conducting drills, during which it swiftly skims the water’s surface before executing a precision strike on a stationary target ship. In a coordinated move, a surface drone boat then approaches to finish off the simulated damaged vessel, demonstrating a lethal combination of underwater and surface attack capabilities. The Al-Qaria operates via remote control, guided by an onboard camera mounted on an extendable rod at the rear of the tube-shaped vessel. This feature enables the drone to survey its surroundings by briefly surfacing to gather visual bearings, after which it submerges again to evade detection. Although the footage reveals a vivid yellow-and-black color scheme, it's expected that combat-ready versions would use colors suited to the marine environment, adding to the drone’s stealth by blending into underwater surroundings. From the footage, the drone appears relatively small, only a few meters in length, enhancing its ability to evade visual detection, especially in low-visibility or nighttime conditions. The Al-Qaria’s size and submersible nature make it challenging to detect using traditional surveillance methods, likely necessitating advanced sonar systems to track its approach. This stealthy profile positions it as a significant threat to merchant vessels and warships navigating through the Red Sea. Analysts have observed a resemblance between the Al-Qaria and the US Navy's Remus 600 underwater reconnaissance drone, which the Houthis reportedly captured in 2018. The Remus 600, used by the US for seabed mapping and mine detection, features a bright color scheme and an extendable camera scope, similar to those seen on the Al-Qaria. However, the Houthis’ version sports unique design elements, such as a distinct propeller configuration, protective ring housing for the propeller, and a streamlined nose cone. These features suggest that the Al-Qaria was either modified from the Remus 600 to suit local capabilities or constructed from scratch, with the US design serving as a foundational reference. The Al-Qaria’s unveiling coincided with large-scale Houthi military drills across land and sea, which a Yemeni military source described as part of 'preparation and readiness for any upcoming confrontation with Washington and its tools in Yemen.' The Houthis’ missile and drone capabilities have continued to evolve, attracting international attention for their increasing range and precision. Recent instances underscore their prowess: a Houthi missile narrowly missed the USS Eisenhower supercarrier last summer, while another forced the USS Gravely destroyer to deploy its Close-In Weapons Systems (CIWS) in a last-ditch attempt to neutralize the projectile. This latest weapon could complicate security dynamics in the Red Sea. In October 2023, the Houthis launched missile and drone attacks against Israeli targets and subsequently disrupted Red Sea trade in solidarity with Gaza. The group has vowed to maintain pressure on Israel and its allies until military actions in Gaza and Lebanon cease. The Houthis' unveiling of the Al-Qaria demonstrates a commitment to refining asymmetric warfare tactics, potentially complicating maritime security for both commercial and military vessels in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/al-qaria-vs-remus-600-how-houthis-new-drone-mirrors-us-underwater-tech	2024-11-04T01:36:43-08:00

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) According to information revealed by Brandon Tseng, president and co-founder of Shield AI and published by the Defense One website, in August 2024, Ukrainian special operators near Dnipro encountered a critical challenge when Russian electronic warfare (EW) systems disrupted their traditional reconnaissance drones. As a solution, they employed the V-BAT, a drone specifically designed to endure the heavy electronic interference that has become prevalent on the Ukrainian battlefield.Operating from 40 kilometers behind the front line, the V-BATs flew beyond enemy lines to locate and track a SA-11 Buk-M1 air defense missile system over 100 kilometers away. Once targets were identified, the drones relayed precise coordinates to artillery units, enabling the HIMARS Multiple Launch Rocket System to execute successful strikes. The V-BAT's mission marked a significant test of its operational capability, as the drone not only collected and transmitted targeting data but did so under severe EW conditions. According to Tseng, this coordination—gathering real-time intelligence and relaying it to long-range artillery systems—demonstrated the V-BAT's unique adaptability in a modern electronic warfare environment. Unlike other drones capable of evading EW systems through onboard autonomy, the V-BAT offers data transmission over extended ranges, making it ideal for coordinating with high-powered artillery like the Lockheed Martin HIMARS. The V-BAT’s extended range of up to 483 km (300 miles) and prolonged loitering capabilities gave Ukrainian forces a tactical advantage. Tseng emphasized that the Ukrainian troops previously relied on drones with limited endurance and range, often restricted to 60 to 100 kilometers and operational durations as brief as 10 to 15 minutes. In contrast, the V-BAT can loiter for eight to 11 hours, allowing for sustained surveillance and the ability to identify multiple targets over a single deployment. The V-BAT is an advanced vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial system (UAS) developed by Shield AI, a San Diego-based technology company specializing in autonomous defense solutions.

This is especially relevant for Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces as the nation aims to reinforce its nuclear triad capabilities. The Knyaz Pozharskiy and other Borei-A-class submarines underscore Russia’s resolve to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent, even as geopolitical tensions rise. Increased submarine deployment enhances Russia’s strategic posture in the Arctic and North Atlantic, areas where Russia has expanded its military footprint in recent years. The Northern Fleet operates in these remote and strategically significant regions, conducting extensive patrols and maneuvers. Equipped with improved stealth capabilities, submarines like the Knyaz Pozharskiy are well-suited for Arctic operations, patrolling under ice and evading detection by NATO forces in the North Atlantic. The K-555 'Knyaz Pozharskiy' signals a milestone in Russia’s nuclear submarine modernization efforts. Once fully commissioned, it will bolster Russia’s underwater strike capabilities, reinforcing its commitment to a strong nuclear deterrent at sea. The return of the Knyaz Pozharskiy to Severodvinsk exemplifies Russia's intent to enhance its submarine-based strategic capabilities and maintain its influence in the global strategic landscape.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russias-powerful-new-borei-a-class-submarine-knyaz-pozharskiy-returns-from-sea-trials	2024-11-01T09:49:48-07:00

Armed with a 20mm Hispano-Suiza Type 804 cannon and accommodating a crew of three with space for eight infantry soldiers, the PBV 302 blends protection with combat support, essential for safely delivering troops to active zones. The recent training for Ukrainian soldiers focuses on operational and maintenance skills to ensure seamless integration into active duty. This comes as Sweden’s support efforts continue to evolve in response to Ukraine’s changing battlefield needs, reinforcing its defense with critical equipment and resources. In addition to the PBV 302, Sweden has supplied a wide range of military equipment that has proven valuable in Ukrainian operations. In September 2024, Sweden delivered 50 Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90) units, a sophisticated tracked infantry fighting vehicle equipped with advanced armor and a 40mm autocannon, ideal for both transport and frontline engagements. The CV90s have proven highly effective for Ukraine’s forces, and to maintain their combat readiness, Sweden has committed to procuring additional 40mm ammunition specifically for these vehicles. Sweden’s latest aid packages have further expanded Ukraine’s armored capabilities. Support Package 16 included over 200 PBV 302s, significantly strengthening the volume of armored personnel carriers available to Ukrainian forces. Meanwhile, in an effort to enhance operational security, Sweden's upcoming Support Package 17 will include specialized camouflage equipment tailored for both PBV 302 and CV90 vehicles. This camouflage technology is intended to provide Ukrainian units with better concealment in diverse operational environments, boosting their capacity to execute covert maneuvers and improve battlefield survivability. Since February 2022, Sweden’s total military aid to Ukraine has reached close to €2 billion, covering a comprehensive range of needs. In addition to the PBV 302 and CV90s, Sweden’s contributions include Stridsvagn 122 main battle tanks, RBS 70 air defense systems, Archer 155mm self-propelled howitzers, and Robot 17 anti-ship missiles. By addressing Ukraine’s operational requirements through various aid packages, Sweden has consistently bolstered Ukraine’s defenses, enhancing its mobility, firepower, and strategic advantage. The provision of these armored vehicles, combined with camouflage equipment and sustained ammunition support, highlights Sweden’s commitment to maintaining Ukraine’s defensive resilience amid ongoing hostilities. Sweden’s defense support not only strengthens Ukraine’s military capacity but also reflects a broader partnership, aligning with NATO-aligned nations in upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty and security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-swedish-ddonated-pbv-302-armored-personnel-carriers-enter-service-with-ukrainian-forces	2024-11-01T09:07:32-07:00
