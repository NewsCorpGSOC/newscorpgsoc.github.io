Focus: What Could Be the Option for Canada to Replace F-35 Fighter Jet Acquisition After Political Tensions with US?	Canada is actively looking at potential alternatives to the U.S.-built F-35 stealth fighter and will hold conversations with rival aircraft makers, Canadian Defence Minister Bill Blair said late on March 14, 2025. This shift comes as concerns grow regarding the unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy under the U.S. President Trump administration, as well as broader strategic considerations regarding defense relationships and technological dependencies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The CF-18 Hornet fighter jet, which has been in service with the Royal Canadian Air Force since 1982, was planned to be replaced by the U.S.-built F-35 as part of Canada's defense modernization efforts. (Picture source: Canada DoD) Canada's contract for the U.S. F-35 fighter jets is valued at C$19 billion ($13.2 billion), with the deal finalized in 2023. The agreement, which aims to replace Canada’s aging fleet of CF-18 Hornets, involves the purchase of 88 F-35s. Lockheed Martin emerged victorious in the bidding process, beating out Saab AB and Boeing Co. The contract is divided into tranches, and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 jets. This deal marks a significant step in Canada's defense modernization efforts, ensuring the Royal Canadian Air Force remains capable of meeting contemporary security challenges. The current fighter jet in service with the Canadian Air Force is the CF-18 Hornet. Canada operates approximately 76 CF-18s, which have been in service since 1982. These aircraft were originally acquired to replace the aging fleet of CF-100 Canucks and were designed as multirole fighters capable of both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. Although the CF-18s have been modernized over the years with upgrades to avionics, radar, and weapons systems, they are nearing the end of their operational lifespan and are being replaced by the F-35 as part of Canada's ongoing defense modernization efforts. The F-35 program, led by the United States and developed by Lockheed Martin, has been a cornerstone of many NATO nations' defense strategies. Canada, which has been in negotiations to procure these advanced jets for several years, is now reassessing its commitment to the project. This re-evaluation is largely driven by a desire to reduce dependency on the U.S. military-industrial complex, especially as Washington’s foreign policy direction under the Trump administration has become increasingly unilateral and unpredictable. Canada’s longstanding military and defense alliance with the United States has been one of the cornerstones of its national security strategy. However, in recent years, particularly under President Donald Trump, there has been growing unease over Washington's approach to global security and defense commitments. The 'America First' doctrine and the U.S.'s increased focus on domestic priorities have led to a perceived erosion of the traditional partnership that has long defined North American defense. Minister Blair’s remarks signal Canada’s desire to explore other options that might offer greater control over its defense strategy, autonomy in procurement, and a more stable geopolitical environment. The F-35, with its high cost and reliance on U.S.-centric maintenance and logistics, represents a symbol of this dependency. Blair’s statement also points to broader concerns regarding technological sovereignty. As one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, the F-35 is a highly integrated system that relies on global logistics, intelligence-sharing, and technical support from its U.S. manufacturer. For Canada, the prospect of being locked into a system that is not only expensive but heavily reliant on U.S. infrastructure raises questions about long-term sustainability and security. The political and economic turbulence surrounding the Trump administration, coupled with increasing calls within Canada for more autonomous defense capabilities, has spurred the search for alternatives. The notion of reducing Canada’s reliance on foreign military technologies could lead the country to investigate options such as the French Rafale, Sweden’s Gripen, or even pursuing indigenous development projects. Canada’s current fleet of fighter jets consists of the CF-18 Hornet, which has been in service since the 1980s and is reaching the end of its operational lifespan. The CF-18 was originally designed as a multirole fighter, capable of both air superiority and ground attack missions, and has served Canada well in various international operations. However, its age and increasing maintenance demands are making it less viable for the future. As a result, Canada has been actively seeking to replace the CF-18 with a more modern and capable aircraft. The Swedish Saab Gripen fighter jet has long been regarded as a possible alternative to the F-35 for Canada. Known for its flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and proven performance, the Gripen offers an appealing balance between modernity and operational independence. With Canada’s existing defense relationships with European countries, including Sweden, the Gripen could align with Canada's strategic vision of fostering closer ties with NATO allies outside the U.S. The Gripen is also designed to be a highly cost-effective solution for countries seeking a versatile and efficient platform for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. Its advanced avionics, combined with operational flexibility and the ability to operate from austere environments, make it an ideal candidate for Canada’s diverse defense needs. Another option under consideration is the French Dassault Rafale, a multi-role fighter jet used by several countries around the world. Its ability to perform a wide range of missions, from air superiority to strike and reconnaissance, makes it an attractive alternative. France’s military industry has a history of working closely with Canada, which may facilitate smoother negotiations for potential integration into the Canadian Armed Forces. The Rafale’s proven combat performance in various theaters, including its deployment in the Middle East and Africa, demonstrates its reliability in real-world combat conditions. Its combination of advanced radar, sensor systems, and multirole capabilities positions it as a highly capable platform for a wide range of operations. The Eurofighter Typhoon, a product of a European consortium involving the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain, is another possible alternative. The Typhoon is primarily an air superiority fighter, but it also offers multirole capabilities, making it a versatile platform for Canada’s needs. The Typhoon’s advanced AESA radar, superior maneuverability, and high-speed capabilities make it one of the most formidable air combat platforms in the world. It has proven its worth in NATO operations and is already in service with several European air forces. For Canada, the Typhoon represents a strong European alternative that could enhance interoperability with NATO allies while providing a highly capable air combat solution. The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, already in service with several NATO countries, represents another potential option for Canada. As a highly capable multirole fighter, the Super Hornet offers flexibility in both air superiority and strike missions. While Canada’s current fleet includes the older F/A-18 Hornet, transitioning to the Super Hornet could offer operational efficiencies, including shared parts and training systems. The Super Hornet is also known for its combat performance and versatility, having been deployed in numerous conflict zones. Its ability to operate from aircraft carriers, even though Canada does not currently operate carriers, adds an additional layer of flexibility in joint NATO operations. The Lockheed Martin F-16V Viper, a modernized version of the classic F-16, is another possible option. The F-16V offers advanced avionics, including the AN/APG-83 AESA radar, and provides a more cost-effective alternative to the F-35. The F-16V is highly capable in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions and is already used by numerous NATO allies. Its lower cost compared to the F-35 makes it an attractive option for countries looking to modernize their fleets without the high price tag. Its combat-proven performance and multirole capabilities ensure that it remains a relevant option in today’s modern battlefield. Finally, there is the possibility of Canada developing an indigenous fighter program, though this would be a far more complex and costly endeavor. With technological advancements in defense and aerospace, Canadian defense manufacturers could explore the creation of a homegrown fighter that would not only reduce reliance on foreign technology but also bolster Canada’s defense industry and innovation. An indigenous program could allow Canada to tailor its fighter jet to its specific needs, ensuring that it remains independent from foreign suppliers while strengthening its national defense capabilities. An additional potential option that could become relevant for Canada is the United Kingdom’s Tempest program. This next-generation fighter program, which is still in its developmental stages, is being led by the UK with participation from Italy and Sweden. The Tempest is designed to provide advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence, stealth, and autonomous systems, making it an attractive option for future combat needs. While still several years from its expected entry into service, the Tempest could offer Canada access to cutting-edge technology and the opportunity to partner with European allies in developing a next-gen fighter. However, as the aircraft is not expected to be ready until the 2030s, Canada would likely need an interim solution to replace its aging CF-18 fleet. Beyond the technical and geopolitical aspects, there are significant economic implications of such a decision. Canada’s defense budget has been under scrutiny for years, with advocates for increased spending arguing that the country needs to modernize its military assets to stay competitive on the global stage. The decision to pursue an alternative to the F-35 would not only involve procurement costs but also long-term maintenance, training, and operational expenses. The choice of a more independent system could result in a more manageable cost structure, reducing the financial strain that comes with the highly specialized nature of the F-35 program. Strategically, the decision to explore alternatives reflects Canada’s desire to assert more independence in its defense policy. As global military alliances shift, and with the unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy, Canada’s move to reconsider its reliance on American-made fighter jets signals a growing realization that the country’s security interests must be adaptable to changing political realities. Canada’s reassessment of the F-35 program is a sign of a larger trend toward reevaluating defense dependencies in an increasingly volatile world. With rising concerns over the direction of U.S. foreign policy, Canada seeks to diversify its defense capabilities and pursue options that better align with its national interests. While the F-35 remains one of the most advanced fighter jets in existence, the quest for alternatives—whether European or indigenous—reflects a desire for more control, more flexibility, and a stronger, self-reliant military future. The coming years will likely see Canada navigating a delicate balance between traditional alliances and new, independent defense partnerships.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-what-could-be-the-option-for-canada-to-replace-f-35-fighter-jet-acquisition-after-political-tensions-with-us	2025-03-15T04:52:07-07:00	
Exclusive | Belarus already produced several launcher systems for the Oreshnik ballistic missile to expand Russia’s strike capabilities	On March 13, 2025, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko stated that the Russian Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) has not yet been deployed in Belarus and confirmed ongoing work on related components. Speaking to reporters in the Kremlin, Lukashenko explained that while Belarus does not currently possess the missile, it has initiated manufacturing of several launchers, which are nearing completion. He specified that Belarus requires missiles supplied by Russia to complete the system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lukashenko explained that while Belarus does not currently possess the missile, it has initiated manufacturing of several launchers, which are nearing completion. (Picture source: Russian MoD/Illustrative image) Belarus is producing launchers for the Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile system and expects Russian missile deliveries at a later stage. During an official visit to Moscow, Lukashenko noted that the placement of the Oreshnik system in Belarus is progressing in accordance with bilateral agreements. Alexei Polishchuk, head of the second department of CIS countries at the Russian Foreign Ministry, previously stated that the deployment of these missile systems in Belarus would follow the security agreements ratified by both governments. Belarus has historically been involved in the production of transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) and missile launch platforms. During the Soviet era, the Minsk Automobile Plant (MAZ) developed several TEL systems, including the MAZ-547A, which was used for the RSD-10 Pioneer (SS-20 Saber) intermediate-range ballistic missile system. This launcher provided mobility, improving deployment capabilities. In the 1980s, Belarus contributed to the MAZ-7916, which was used as the TEL for the RT-2PM Topol (SS-25 Sickle) intercontinental ballistic missile. The mobility of these systems played a role in ensuring the survivability of Soviet missile forces. Production of missile launchers continues in Belarus through MAZ and the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant (MZKT). MAZ, founded in 1944, initially focused on heavy-duty vehicles before shifting to military applications, such as the MAZ-543, introduced in 1962 for the TEMP missile launcher. In 1991, the division responsible for military transport was separated from MAZ to form MZKT, which has continued producing specialized military transporters. The MZKT-79221, developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, serves as the chassis for the Topol-M missile system, while the MZKT-7930 'Astrolog,' introduced in the early 1990s, supports systems such as the Iskander ballistic missile and the Pantsir-S1 air defense system. Security cooperation between Belarus and Russia is formalized through several agreements. On February 26, 2025, the lower house of the Belarusian parliament ratified a draft law approving a security treaty with Russia within the framework of the Union State. Signed in Minsk on December 6, 2024, the agreement is awaiting approval from the upper house before being signed into law by Lukashenko. This treaty formalizes security cooperation and includes provisions for military base arrangements, facilitating the deployment of Russian military assets in Belarus. According to Russian sources, the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) has a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers, a speed exceeding Mach 10 (12,400 km/h), and a payload capacity of up to 1.5 tons. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that no existing missile defense systems are capable of intercepting the Oreshnik, and Russian analysts claim that the Oreshnik could only be intercepted by their S-500 air defense system. Reports suggest that the missile is derived from the discontinued RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile program. Some assessments have questioned its precision in conventional strikes, indicating it may be designed for nuclear payloads. Belarus has historically been involved in the production of several transporter-erector-launchers (TELs) and missile launch platforms for Russia, including the MZKT-7930 Astrolog used by the Iskander ballistic missile system. (Picture source: Russian social media) Discussions on Oreshnik deployment intensified after Lukashenko's request during a December 6, 2024, meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State. He cited NATO military activities in Poland and Lithuania as security concerns, stating that the missile system would serve as a deterrent. Putin responded that deployment could occur in the latter half of 2025, depending on production progress. He stated that while the missiles would be part of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Belarusian authorities would have a role in determining targeting parameters. The Oreshnik missile system was first used in combat on November 21, 2024, in a strike against a defense facility in Dnipro, Ukraine. The Russian government stated that the strike was a response to Ukraine’s authorization of long-range attacks inside Russian territory. Western defense officials, including from Estonia and the United Kingdom, assessed the missile launch as a strategic signal rather than solely a tactical operation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested the timing of the strike was politically motivated, potentially aimed at influencing U.S. policy under President Donald Trump’s administration. Belarusian officials state that security cooperation with Russia does not pose a threat to third countries. Speaking at the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on February 26, 2025, Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov stated that the presence of Russian nuclear and conventional missile systems in Belarus was a defensive measure. He referenced Belarus’s decision in the 1990s to relinquish its nuclear arsenal under the Budapest Memorandum and stated that Western security assurances had not been upheld. Ryzhenkov said the deployment of Oreshnik missiles would serve as a deterrent against NATO military activity in the region. Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin has stated that the deployment of the Oreshnik missile system and tactical nuclear weapons increases Belarus’s defense capabilities. While he did not specify a deployment timeline, he confirmed that work is ongoing. Russian officials have described the Oreshnik as a hypersonic system designed to penetrate advanced defenses. According to Russian sources, multiple Oreshnik missiles launched in coordination could generate destructive force comparable to nuclear weapons, without the radiation effects of traditional nuclear warheads. The possible deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus has drawn international attention. Western analysts view it as part of Russia’s broader strategy concerning NATO and Ukraine. U.S. intelligence assessments indicate that while Russia has started producing the missile, its full capabilities remain unverified. Belarusian authorities state that deployment decisions align with national security interests and the Union State agreement with Russia. As the treaty awaits final approval, discussions on Oreshnik deployment are expected to continue throughout 2025.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-belarus-already-produced-several-launcher-systems-for-the-oreshnik-ballistic-missile-to-expand-russias-strike-capabilities	2025-03-14T06:49:30-07:00	
US Announces Support for Japan’s Hypersonic Glider Program Against Growing Indo-Pacific Threats	The U.S. State Department has approved a potential Foreign Military Sale (FMS) to Japan, estimated at $200 million, for equipment and services supporting the development of the Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile (HVGP) program. Announced by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on March 10, 2025, this decision marks a further step in the technological and military cooperation between Tokyo and Washington. The project, overseen by Japan’s Ministry of Defense and the Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics Agency (ATLA), aims to equip Japan with a hypersonic glider designed to enhance the defense of its remote islands. The proposed sale is now awaiting final approval from the U.S. Congress. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On February 7, 2025, Japan Unveils New Flight Tests for Its Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (Picture source: Japan’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency) Japan’s initiative to develop hypersonic weapons dates back to 2018, when a program was launched to enhance the long-range strike capabilities of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). The HVGP, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), consists of a hypersonic glider carrying a high-explosive warhead, launched by a solid-fuel booster before traveling at extreme speeds toward its target. This system is primarily intended for the defense of the Ryūkyū Islands and other strategic territories, reinforcing Japan’s military posture amid regional security concerns. The HVGP program is structured in progressive phases. The initial version, referred to as Block 1, is based on existing technology and is expected to have a range of 500 to 900 kilometers. This first variant is planned for deployment in fiscal year 2026 to provide an operational capability in the shortest possible timeframe. Subsequent developments include Block 2A and Block 2B, which will incorporate more advanced technologies, including wave rider flight technology, enabling greater maneuverability and improved penetration against air defense systems. These versions are projected to have an extended range of 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers, allowing them to engage targets beyond Japan’s territorial waters, including moving naval assets such as aircraft carriers. These enhanced versions are scheduled for completion by 2027, with operational deployment expected in the 2030s. The Japanese Ministry of Defense has already conducted four successful test flights of the HVGP from a site in California: one in August 2024, two in November 2024, and another in January 2025. These tests validate progress in the program and the viability of the technology, although challenges remain, particularly in terminal guidance and heat resistance at hypersonic speeds. U.S. support for Japan’s hypersonic glider program includes the provision of key equipment and services. The proposed package encompasses test preparation, technical assistance, transportation of equipment, and coordination meetings between Japanese and U.S. experts. These services will be delivered directly by the U.S. government, with no offset agreement currently planned. If such an agreement is pursued, it would be defined in subsequent negotiations between Tokyo and Washington. The U.S. State Department justified the sale by stating that it aligns with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. The agreement is intended to strengthen Japan’s defense capabilities, given its status as a key U.S. ally and a major contributor to political and economic stability in the Indo-Pacific. According to the DSCA, the sale will enhance Japan’s ability to respond to evolving threats, particularly by improving the defense of its remote territories. The agency also emphasized that this transaction will not alter the fundamental military balance in the region, a statement likely aimed at addressing concerns from other regional powers, particularly China and North Korea. An important aspect of this transaction is that it will not require the deployment of additional U.S. government personnel or private contractors to Japan. Furthermore, the DSCA assured that this sale will not negatively impact U.S. defense readiness, meaning that the equipment provided will not be drawn from active U.S. military inventories. The HVGP program is advancing at a time of increasing investment in hypersonic technologies by major global powers, including the United States, China, and Russia. Hypersonic weapons are considered a key element in modern warfare due to their ability to strike targets rapidly while evading conventional defense systems. For Japan, acquiring this capability represents a significant strategic shift. Amid China's growing military presence in the East China Sea and continued security challenges posed by North Korea, Tokyo is working to enhance its defense capabilities with autonomous long-range strike options. This effort is also part of a broader initiative to reduce reliance on foreign navigation and intelligence systems, strengthening Japan’s independent surveillance and targeting infrastructure. With the U.S. State Department’s approval, the HVGP program moves forward toward a new phase. If the U.S. Congress approves the transaction, Japan will gain critical technical and logistical support to finalize its hypersonic glider development. This will provide Tokyo with an advanced deterrence capability, a significant factor in maintaining security in a region marked by ongoing strategic rivalries.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-announces-support-for-japans-hypersonic-glider-program-against-growing-indo-pacific-threats	2025-03-14T06:44:33-07:00	
Taiwan to equip new light frigates with XTR-102A2 20mm remote weapon systems for patrol missions in the Taiwan Strait	As reported by The Liberty Times on March 7, 2025, the Taiwanese Navy is set to receive the first vessel from its Light Frigate Program before October 2026. The program, which includes both air defense and anti-submarine variants, is progressing according to the schedule set at Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Company (JSSC). Military sources confirmed that the new light frigates will be equipped with the XTR-102A2 dual-tube 20mm remote weapon systems for side defense instead of previously considered remote-controlled 30mm autocannons.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan’s Light Frigate Program aims to deliver 12 ships to replace the six Jiyang-class frigates, as well as provide a platform optimized for operations in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters. (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) The XTR-102 is a close-range 20mm remote weapon system developed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST). It integrates traditional weapon systems with optoelectronic targeting and remote operation. The system has two primary models: the XTR-101, a single-tube optoelectronic remote-controlled turret, and the XTR-102, a dual-tube variant. The latter has two derivatives: the XTR-102A1 for shore-based installations and the XTR-102A2 for ship-mounted applications. The XTR-102 has been installed across multiple platforms, including those operated by the Republic of China Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. The XTR-102A2 uses a dual-tube T-75 20mm machine gun, with a firing rate of 400 to 1,200 rounds per minute and a maximum effective range of 2,000 meters. The system features an independent optoelectronic targeting suite, allowing it to operate autonomously. It is designed for engaging small, fast-moving targets, including drones and speedboats. The turret is mounted on the light frigate’s port and starboard sides, providing short-range automated defense. The system is also integrated into the Coast Guard Administration’s 600-ton Anping-class offshore patrol vessels. The XTR-102A2 ship-mounted variant has been deployed on platforms including the Kuang Hua VI-class missile boat and Taiwan’s 4,000-ton Chiayi-class offshore patrol vessel. Taiwan’s Light Frigate Program was initiated in 2022 due to delays in the Zhenhai Project, one of the 12 shipbuilding plans of the Republic of China Navy which aimed to create a new class of frigates with a 4,500-ton displacement. The lack of sufficient medium and large ships to counter the People’s Liberation Army Navy led to the reallocation of the Zhenhai Project budget toward light frigate construction. The first ship was scheduled to begin construction in 2023, with two configurations: air defense and anti-submarine. The program aims to deliver 12 ships to replace the six Jiyang-class frigates, as well as fill a critical gap in Taiwan’s naval capabilities, providing a platform optimized for operations in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters. The new class of ships will function as versatile assets, capable of responding to gray zone threats, patrolling key maritime routes, escorting supply ships, and supporting military exercises. The initial design of a light frigate concept was presented at the 2018 Kaohsiung International Maritime and Defense Industry Exhibition. The concept included a 1,400-ton vessel designed by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Taiwan International Shipbuilding. The ship measured 85 meters in length, 13.1 meters in width, and had a draft of 3.2 meters. It featured a displacement of approximately 1,400 tons, two diesel engines, a maximum speed of 30 knots, and a cruising range of 2,200 nautical miles at 12 knots. The vessel was armed with a rotating phased array radar, a 76mm rapid-fire gun, eight anti-ship missiles, and 16 medium- and short-range air defense missiles. It also included anti-submarine torpedoes and the XTR-102A2 twin-tube remote-controlled turret. The types of missiles were unspecified, but animations suggested the presence of Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles and Sea Sword II air defense missiles. The XTR-102A2 uses a dual-tube T-75 20mm machine gun, with a firing rate of 400 to 1,200 rounds per minute and a maximum effective range of 2,000 meters. (Picture source: NCSIST) In August 2022, Taiwan’s National Defense Budget confirmed that the planned 'new generation frigate' with four-sided fixed array radar would be replaced by a smaller 1,500-2,000 ton light frigate utilizing rotating array radar. The budget for the program remained at NT$24.549 billion, with no changes to the implementation schedule. A special report released in October 2022 outlined that the People's Liberation Army Navy's deployment of Type 053H3, Type 054A, and Type 056A missile frigates had necessitated the construction of a 2,500-ton light frigate. The plan called for the air defense prototype to be completed by 2025 and the anti-submarine prototype by 2026. Legislative discussions confirmed that an additional 10 light frigates would follow the two prototype ships. Following the project approval, a bidding process for the combat system and hull platform was launched. The combat system was entrusted to the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, while the hull construction was opened for domestic competition. The total budget for the two prototype ships was set at NT$20 billion, with NT$4.6 billion allocated for the air defense variant and NT$4.45 billion for the anti-submarine variant. Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Company (JSSC) was awarded the construction contract in May 2023, with the contract formally initiated on May 12. The program called for radar stealth design, an aluminum upper structure with a steel lower hull, and integration with the CMS-330 combat management system. By mid-2023, revisions were made to the ship's design following internal discussions regarding space limitations. The original specifications called for a vessel under 110 meters in length with a displacement of 2,500 tons. However, it was determined that this configuration would not allow for sufficient internal space for future capability enhancements. As a result, the design was adjusted to a displacement of nearly 3,000 tons with a total length approaching 120 meters. The exterior and interior design responsibilities were assigned to a foreign contractor, and Gibbs &amp; Cox was selected to design the hull. The final design resembles a scaled-down version of the U.S. Navy’s Constellation-class frigate. In the 1990s, the US agreed to transfer eight Knox-class frigates to the Taiwanese Navy, which were later renamed as the Chi Yang-class. (Picture source: Wikimedia/玄史生) Construction of the air defense variant commenced in November 2023, followed by the anti-submarine variant in January 2024. Additional ceremonies were held in November 2024 for the prototype’s structural assembly at the Xingao Shipyard in Kaohsiung City. The program remains on track for the first two ships to be delivered by the end of October 2026, after which a decision will be made regarding full-scale production of the remaining 10 light frigates. The ships' specifications include a standard displacement of 2,500 tons and a full load displacement of 3,500 tons. The overall length is 115 meters, with a beam of 15 meters. They utilize a Combined diesel-electric or gas (CODLOG) propulsion system, comprising one GE LM2500+G4 gas turbine engine and two electric propulsion motors. The maximum speed is over 30 knots, and the operational endurance exceeds 2,200 nautical miles at a speed of 12 knots. The crew consists of 90 personnel, with a lieutenant colonel as captain. Each light frigate is equipped with a Mk 75 naval gun, a Phalanx close-in weapon system, and two XTR-102A2 remote-controlled machine guns. The air defense variant has an eight-tube Huayang vertical launch system capable of deploying 32 Sea Sword II air defense missiles. It can carry up to 16 Hsiung Feng III anti-ship missiles or eight extended-range Hsiung Feng III missiles. The anti-submarine variant includes two eight-tube Sea Sword II missile launchers, up to 16 anti-ship missiles, and two triple-tube Mk 32 surface ship torpedo launchers. The electronic warfare suite consists of two Mk 36 SRBOC jammer launchers and an AN/SLQ-25 torpedo countermeasure system. The ships feature a Type 997 3D air search radar, a fire control radar, a navigation radar, and a TRAPS towed variable-depth sonar for anti-submarine detection. The combat management system is the CMS-330, integrated with the Xunlian Combat Management System and the Dacheng Tactical Digital Data Link System. The ships have a dedicated flight deck designed to operate an S-70C(M)-1/2 anti-submarine helicopter but do not include a hangar. A shipborne small boat is also part of the standard equipment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/taiwan-to-equip-new-light-frigates-with-xtr-102a2-20mm-remote-weapon-systems-for-patrol-missions-in-the-taiwan-strait	2025-03-14T06:17:30-07:00

Indra developed the LINCE battle management system, which enhances coordination and tactical management on the battlefield, while Spanish license-built thermal imaging optics improve target detection and engagement capabilities in all conditions. The Spanish Army currently operates 239 Leopard 2E tanks, deployed across mechanized brigades, with some units participating in NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence mission in Latvia. Spain also maintains a fleet of 98 Leopard 2A4 tanks, following the delivery of ten units to Ukraine. The Leopard 2E’s primary armament consists of a Rheinmetall L55 120mm gun, capable of firing high-velocity rounds designed to penetrate modern armored threats. The modernization program includes the installation of an improved L55-A1 gun, providing enhanced performance against advanced armor and compatibility with next-generation munitions. A remotely controlled weapon station, potentially armed with a 7.62mm FN MAG58 machine gun, is also planned to strengthen the tank’s close-range defensive capabilities. Protection systems will also be significantly upgraded to improve survivability. Enhancements include the integration of an active protection system (APS), a new frontal armor protection kit, and an early warning system to counter modern anti-tank threats. Additional mine and improvised explosive device (IED) protection measures will be implemented to improve resilience in high-threat environments. Mobility improvements are planned with the installation of new tracks and an optimized transmission system, ensuring better maneuverability across different terrains. A multispectral camouflage system will be added to reduce the tank’s thermal and visual signature, making detection by enemy sensors more challenging. These upgrades aim to bring the Leopard 2E in line with the latest European battle tank standards, such as the Leopard 2A7 and other modernized NATO armored platforms. The Leopard 2E modernization program is structured into multiple phases, each focusing on specific upgrades. The first phase will address obsolescence issues and improve sustainment capabilities, ensuring the tank's continued operational effectiveness. This phase will transition the Leopard 2E to the 2E M1 configuration, with an initial operational capability (IOC) expected by 2029. Subsequent phases will integrate new mission systems and advanced technological solutions. Phase II will involve the pre-installation of mission modules, bringing the Leopard 2E closer to the Leopard 2A7 configuration, and prioritizing active protection systems (APS) and remote weapon stations (RWS). Phase III will involve the acquisition of 60 mission modules, leading to the development of the Leopard 2E M2+ standard, with full operational capability (FOC) expected by 2032. These upgraded tanks will incorporate APS, the L55-A1 gun, improved armor, underbody mine and IED protection, and a new mobility package including upgraded tracks and drive components. From an industrial perspective, Spain intends to leverage its past experience in Leopard 2E assembly, as most of the fleet was domestically produced by ENSB.

Turkish Navy Strengthens its Underwater Power with Atmaca Missile Capable of Discreet Long-Range Strikes	The Turkish Navy has taken a step in developing its underwater strike capabilities with the successful test launch of the encapsulated variant of the Atmaca anti-ship missile. Conducted from the TCG Preveze submarine off the coast of Mersin in the Mediterranean Sea, this test represents a major milestone for Turkey’s defense industry and confirms the country's ability to equip its submarines with domestically developed weapon systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Atmaca missile is designed to replace the Boeing RGM-84 Harpoon currently in service with the Turkish Navy (Picture source: Turkish MoD) The announcement was made by Haluk Görgün, head of the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB), who highlighted the event as an important achievement in Turkey’s efforts to enhance its self-reliance in military technology. The missile, developed and manufactured by Roketsan, was launched from a 533 mm torpedo tube inside a watertight capsule equipped with a propeller. Once expelled from the submarine, the capsule released the missile, which then activated its propulsion system to proceed toward the designated target. Footage shared on social media indicates that the tested missile was not equipped with a live warhead, as no impact was observed. A key objective of this demonstration was to confirm the system’s compatibility with the torpedo tubes of Turkish submarines, particularly those of the Preveze and Gür classes. These submarines will gain this capability following their modernization with the MÜREN combat management system, developed by HAVELSAN. This upgrade enables Turkish submarines to integrate domestically produced weapons, including the AKYA heavyweight torpedo and now the encapsulated Atmaca missile. The Atmaca missile is designed to replace the Boeing RGM-84 Harpoon currently in service with the Turkish Navy. Already deployed on Ada-class corvettes and modernized Barbaros-class frigates, its submarine-launched version expands operational options by allowing Turkish submarines to engage surface targets from long range while maintaining a low detection profile. Developed by Roketsan since 2009, the Atmaca is an all-weather anti-ship cruise missile designed for high-precision strikes. It utilizes a navigation system combining GPS, an inertial navigation system, a barometric altimeter, and a radar altimeter. Its active radar seeker enables precise target acquisition, while its data link allows real-time course adjustments, including target updates, re-engagement, or mission cancellation. The missile's sea-skimming approach makes it more challenging to detect and intercept. With a length of 4.8 to 5.2 meters and a weight of less than 800 kg, the Atmaca is equipped with a high-explosive, penetration-type warhead weighing 250 kg. It has a range exceeding 220 km, while its land-based variant, the KARA ATMACA, can reach targets beyond 280 km. Its capabilities have attracted international interest, particularly in Southeast Asia. In November 2022, Indonesia signed a contract to procure 45 Atmaca missiles, while Malaysia intends to integrate the system into its three Littoral Mission Ships (LMS) Batch 2, based on the Ada-class corvette design. This successful test places Turkey among a limited group of nations with submarine-launched anti-ship missile capabilities, a technology currently deployed by the United States (UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon), France (SM-39 Exocet), and Russia (submarine-launched Kalibr variants). This capability significantly enhances a submarine’s operational reach, allowing it to engage distant targets without exposing its position, adding a new strategic dimension to naval warfare. Alongside the encapsulated Atmaca, Turkey is also developing the Gezgin cruise missile, intended for long-range land strikes from submarine platforms. With greater range and payload capacity, this system is expected to play a key role in Turkey’s naval deterrence strategy. Additionally, discussions have emerged regarding the development of a submarine-launched air defense missile, potentially derived from the Hisar system by ASELSAN, as presented during the 10th Naval Systems Seminar. The first successful underwater launch of the Atmaca missile reflects the progress of Turkey’s defense industry and its objective of achieving strategic autonomy in the naval domain. By focusing on indigenous technology, Turkey continues to enhance its submarine forces and strengthen its position as a key player in the development and production of advanced weapon systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/turkish-navy-strengthens-its-underwater-power-with-atmaca-missile-capable-of-discreet-long-range-strikes	2025-03-14T03:27:54-07:00	
John Cockerill Plans to Produce Light Armored Vehicles in Belgium to Align with Europe's Rearmament Strategy	As Europe moves forward with a large-scale €800 billion rearmament plan, the Belgian group John Cockerill is reaffirming its ambition to restart the production of armored vehicles on Belgian soil. Its CEO, François Michel, has confirmed the company’s interest in large-scale production, drawing on decades of expertise in manufacturing turrets for NATO light tanks. The stated objective is to reestablish domestic production in Belgium, an industrial challenge the country has not undertaken for more than a generation. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This initiative to relocate part of the armored vehicle production to Belgium is part of a broader European effort to strengthen its defense industry in response to an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. (Picture source: John Cockerill Defense) Among the potential sites for setting up an armored vehicle assembly line, the former Audi plant in Forest is being seriously considered. This site, currently seeking a new operator, could be repurposed to accommodate high-volume production, which François Michel sees as essential for Belgium to play a significant role in Europe's defense industry. However, no final decision has been made, and other industrial sites in Belgium are also under review. The CEO of John Cockerill highlights the possibility of repurposing existing facilities with experience in high-volume military vehicle production, a consideration that extends beyond Belgium, as other European countries explore similar initiatives. John Cockerill Defense (JCD) is a key player in land-based weapon systems, specializing in the design and manufacturing of turrets for armored vehicles. The company offers a range of modular solutions suited to light and medium armored vehicles, incorporating weapons of various calibers from 25mm to 105mm. One of its flagship products is the Cockerill 3000 series, a family of modular turrets that can be equipped with different weapon configurations to meet the specific requirements of armed forces. The Cockerill 3105 turret, fitted with a 105mm high-pressure cannon, provides armored vehicles with firepower comparable to that of battle tanks while maintaining greater mobility. Beyond turrets, JCD develops and integrates light armored vehicles designed to operate in various tactical environments. A notable example is the Cockerill i-X, a hybrid combat vehicle combining speed, stealth, and firepower, designed for reconnaissance and rapid intervention missions. This platform reflects JCD’s focus on mobility and combat effectiveness. The company also modernizes existing platforms by integrating advanced targeting, stabilization, and beyond-line-of-sight firing capabilities, enhancing the operational efficiency of equipped forces. The former Caterpillar site in Gosselies, Charleroi, is also being considered. François Michel has been in discussions with Thomas Dermine, the mayor of Charleroi, and has expressed interest in this alternative. The involvement of Belgium’s Minister of Defense has been noted in these considerations. However, the Liège province, where John Cockerill is headquartered, presents challenges in terms of available industrial space. While sites such as the former Chertal steel mill or facilities in Seraing have been mentioned, their condition requires long-term rehabilitation work, which does not align with the urgency of the planned industrial expansion. The limited availability of industrial land in Liège further complicates the situation, with designated industrial zones already at 95% capacity. This initiative to relocate part of the armored vehicle production to Belgium is part of a broader European effort to strengthen its defense industry in response to an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, European countries have recognized their dependence on external arms supplies and are accelerating the development of domestic defense industries to meet the growing demands of their armed forces. Belgium, which has not manufactured armored vehicles for decades, sees this project as an opportunity to regain a role in the defense sector. Additionally, this shift is driven by changes in U.S. defense policy toward Europe. With the prospect of a gradual reduction in American engagement on the continent, the European Union must enhance its strategic autonomy. Several initiatives have been launched to build a more robust defense industrial base, and John Cockerill’s project is aligned with this objective. If the Audi Brussels or Caterpillar site is selected, it would mark an important step in Belgium’s efforts to establish domestic production capacity and contribute to Europe's collective rearmament strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/john-cockerill-plans-to-produce-light-armored-vehicles-in-belgium-to-align-with-europes-rearmament-strategy	2025-03-14T02:50:23-07:00	
China tests new family of amphibious infantry fighting vehicles to replace the Type 05	As reported by OedoSoldier on March 13, 2025, China is developing a new generation of amphibious infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) to replace the existing Type 05 family. Recent imagery reveals a new platform that could feature an unmanned turret and an active protection system (APS). The vehicle, identified by hull number 003, appears to incorporate mobility and survivability improvements for amphibious operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The hull of the new amphibious IFV, identified by hull number 003, exhibits several changes compared to earlier models, including variations in the spacing of road wheels and modifications to the transom flap at the rear. (Picture source: Twitter/OedoSoldier) The new IFV’s turret, which lacks visible crew positions, suggests it is unmanned and automated. Reports indicate that the new amphibious IFV, identified by hull number 003, could integrate multiple sensor systems for target acquisition and active defense, likely forming part of a hard-kill APS. This approach differs from Western designs that use composite or NERA armor as layered passive armor, which increases weight. The Chinese model prioritizes active defenses, which are suited for light vehicles where conventional armor provides limited protection. The vehicle’s main armament appears to be a 30mm autocannon, similar to the ZBD-05. No anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher is visible, though it could be mounted on the opposite side of the turret. The hull exhibits several changes compared to earlier models, including variations in the spacing of road wheels and modifications to the transom flap at the rear. These changes indicate efforts to refine hydrodynamic performance and enhance amphibious maneuverability. China has also tested a potentially larger version of the Type 05, distinguished by changes to its road wheel spacing and hull structure. Observers have noted the redesigned turret of the vehicle, identified by hull number 005, and partially faceted barrel, suggesting changes in armament, as well as the expansion of an amphibious combat vehicle family that could include new assault tank or support variants. China’s current amphibious warfare strategy could involve securing air superiority before deploying these IFVs and amphibious tanks in an armored landing operation. China has also tested a potentially larger version of the Type 05, identified by hull number 005, distinguished by changes to its road wheel spacing, hull structure, and turret design. (Picture source: Twitter/OedoSoldier) The Type 05 amphibious combat vehicle family was developed in the early 2000s to replace older platforms such as the Type 63A amphibious tank. The People's Liberation Army required a high-speed amphibious vehicle capable of over-the-horizon deployment and increased firepower. Developed by Norinco, the Type 05 was designed to improve China’s amphibious assault capabilities. It entered service in 2005, and multiple variants have since been introduced to support different operational requirements. The Type 05, which seems to be inspired by the now-canceled U.S. Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) program, remains in active use within China’s amphibious forces. The Type 05 incorporates a hydrodynamically optimized hull, an extendable bow, and a retractable suspension system, enabling speeds of up to 30 km/h in water. It is propelled by two rear-mounted water jets, while on land, it utilizes a diesel engine generating 1,500 hp in waterborne mode and 550 hp on land. The vehicle’s aluminum alloy construction reduces weight while providing limited protection against small arms fire and shell fragments. Additional composite armor plates enhance protection in specific areas, such as the turret. The fire-control system includes thermal imaging, a laser rangefinder, and independent sights for both the commander and gunner. These features contribute to target acquisition and engagement capabilities. The Type 05 is designed for rapid amphibious landings and operations in coastal environments. The Type 05 series consists of several variants designed for specialized roles that are used by the Chinese Navy's Marine Corps and Army's amphibious mechanized brigades. The ZBD-05 serves as the infantry fighting vehicle variant, equipped with a 30mm autocannon and anti-tank guided missiles to support dismounted infantry. The ZTD-05 functions as an amphibious assault vehicle, fitted with a 105mm rifled gun capable of firing kinetic and guided munitions. Additional versions include command and control vehicles, reconnaissance variants, armored recovery vehicles, and engineering support models. These adaptations enable the Type 05 platform to conduct a range of amphibious operations, including direct assault, logistical support, and battlefield coordination. The ZBD-05, the infantry fighting vehicle variant, is equipped with a ZPT-99 30mm autocannon capable of engaging ground and aerial targets. It is complemented by a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun and can be outfitted with HJ-73C anti-tank guided missiles. The turret is integrated with a fire-control system featuring a digital ballistic computer, thermal imaging, and a laser rangefinder. The vehicle accommodates a crew of three and can transport up to eight infantry personnel in the rear compartment. The retractable suspension system, combined with its engine power, facilitates seamless transitions between land and water operations, ensuring operational flexibility across diverse terrains.

Facing US Uncertainty Portugal Seeks European Alternatives to F-35 Fighter Jet	The evolution of U.S. policy toward NATO has led the Portuguese Ministry of Defense to reassess its combat aircraft acquisition strategy. This resulted in the abandonment of Lockheed Martin's fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter. Defense Minister Nuno Melo confirmed this decision in an interview with the Portuguese daily Público. This Decision reflects growing concerns about the reliability of U.S. commitments to European allies. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Due to U.S. political uncertainties and F-35 restrictions, Portugal is opting for European alternatives like the Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, and Gripen to replace its aging F-16 fleet (Picture source: Dassault/Eurofighter/US DoD/ Saab) Donald Trump's election and controversial statements on NATO, including threats to reduce U.S. funding for the alliance and criticism of European partners’ financial contributions, have raised doubts among member states. Trump has also suggested that the United States may no longer ensure Europe's security with the same level of commitment as in the past. As a result, several European nations, including Portugal, are reassessing their procurement strategies for U.S. military equipment to maintain greater defense autonomy. The F-35 had initially been identified as the ideal replacement for Portugal’s aging F-16 fleet, a transition that seemed logical given its adoption by several NATO members, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Poland, and Germany. In April 2024, the Chief of Staff of the Portuguese Air Force, General João Cartaxo Alves, stated that the transition to the F-35A was already underway. However, increasing geopolitical uncertainty and potential U.S. restrictions on foreign-operated F-35s have made this acquisition less viable. Beyond diplomatic concerns, the F-35’s high cost remains a significant obstacle. Each aircraft costs approximately $82 million, while operational costs reach $33,000 per flight hour. Maintenance expenses are four times higher than those of the F-16 currently in service. Additionally, Washington could impose operational restrictions on exported aircraft, particularly by controlling access to software updates and critical maintenance components. These potential restrictions, referred to by some as a 'kill switch,' raise concerns about Portugal’s autonomy in operating these fighters. Given these uncertainties, Lisbon is now exploring alternative solutions, particularly within Europe. While Defense Minister Nuno Melo declined to comment on a potential acquisition of the Dassault Rafale, it remains one of the leading contenders. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen E/F are also under consideration, offering options that are less dependent on U.S. constraints. Additionally, the Turkish-made KAAN stealth fighter, currently under development by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), could become a viable choice in the long term. The four aircraft being considered—F-35A Lightning II, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen, and Eurofighter Typhoon—each offer distinct capabilities suited to different operational requirements. The F-35A, a fifth-generation aircraft, stands out for its stealth, advanced avionics, and data fusion capabilities, enabling operations in contested environments. However, its high costs and U.S. export restrictions impose significant constraints. The Rafale, developed by Dassault, is recognized for its multirole versatility, electronic warfare capabilities (SPECTRA), AESA radar, and operational autonomy. The Gripen, a lightweight and cost-effective fighter, emphasizes interoperability with NATO systems, simplified maintenance, and the ability to operate from austere airfields. Meanwhile, the Eurofighter Typhoon, developed through a European consortium, is highly capable in air superiority missions, featuring advanced sensors, high agility, and strong survivability, though it has higher operational costs. If Portugal seeks a balance between performance, autonomy, and cost, the Rafale appears to be the most suitable option. It offers a proven and scalable platform with fewer operational constraints than the F-35A. The Eurofighter Typhoon, while highly capable, is expensive and more specialized for air superiority missions. The Gripen, as a lower-cost alternative, could be viable for a smaller air force looking for a flexible and economical solution. Portugal will need to make a decision in the coming years as its F-16 fleet nears the end of its service life. The transition to a new aircraft could span a decade, with an estimated budget of €5.5 billion. This assessment is also part of a broader discussion on European strategic independence, as the EU considers expanding its defense cooperation initiatives.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/facing-us-uncertainty-portugal-seeks-european-alternatives-to-f-35-fighter-jet	2025-03-14T01:31:19-07:00

Exclusive: China Develops Advanced Barge System to Support Ship-to-Shore Operations in Potential Taiwan Invasion	Recent social media footage showcases a new Chinese barge system designed for efficient ship-to-shore transfer of supplies. With its potential military applications now under close scrutiny, this barge could play a pivotal role in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, particularly in establishing logistical support once an initial beachhead has been secured. This system is especially important in modern warfare, where mobility, speed, and the ability to move resources across the sea quickly can determine the success of a land invasion.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Chinese navy demonstrates new advanced barge system for efficient ship-to-shore operations, enhancing logistical support in amphibious assault scenarios. (Picture source: Social Network) The Chinese barge system, which resembles the British-made Mulberry Harbors used by Allied forces after D-Day during World War II, is engineered to provide a versatile solution for amphibious operations. The Mulberry Harbors were temporary portable harbors constructed on Normandy’s beaches, enabling the Allies to unload vast amounts of supplies, vehicles, and troops directly onto the beach, bypassing the need for traditional port infrastructure that was often too damaged or non-existent. This innovation drastically increased the speed and scale of operations following the initial landings and is often credited as a key enabler in the success of the D-Day invasion. Similarly, the Chinese barge system could be seen as a critical tool in a modern amphibious assault, enabling China’s military to quickly establish a logistical link between shipborne forces and land operations. The barges are designed to move a wide range of supplies from vessels offshore to the shore, including heavy equipment, food, medical supplies, ammunition, and potentially even troops. The system's flexibility allows it to be deployed in areas where traditional docking infrastructure is absent or destroyed, which could be a significant advantage in a conflict with Taiwan, given its heavily defended coastal defenses and limited suitable landing sites. Taiwan’s coastline, stretching across approximately 1,600 km, features both urbanized and rugged areas with few beaches large enough or accessible enough for large-scale amphibious landings. While this presents significant challenges for any invading force, the new barge system could provide a flexible solution for transferring supplies, bypassing the limitations of specific landing zones. The barges could be used in tandem with other amphibious assault vessels, ensuring that Chinese forces maintain a steady supply chain once a beachhead is established. In theory, this capability would allow China to rapidly increase its combat power on Taiwanese soil, delivering everything from fuel to tanks without requiring an intact port, which could be out of reach or heavily defended. The vulnerability of the barge system, however, cannot be overlooked. Taiwan’s coastal defenses are robust, featuring advanced missile systems, including long-range anti-ship missiles, coastal artillery, and radar-guided air defense systems. These defenses pose a substantial threat to any unprotected or slow-moving vessels, especially during the critical phases of amphibious assaults. During such operations, barges would need to traverse potentially hostile waters where precision-guided munitions could easily target them. Thus, any effective use of the barges would require Chinese forces to neutralize or suppress Taiwan’s missile and artillery systems, adding complexity and risk to their amphibious plans. Furthermore, Taiwan’s military is highly trained, with its forces equipped with advanced anti-ship and anti-air systems, including US-supplied equipment such as Harpoon missiles and the Patriot missile defense system. The risks posed to barges by such systems could limit their utility if Taiwanese forces are able to disrupt supply lines or target landing forces with precision strikes. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of combining the barge system with other offensive and defensive capabilities, including air superiority, naval escorts, and the suppression of enemy air defenses, to ensure safe and uninterrupted operations. This barge system is part of a larger Chinese effort to modernize and enhance its amphibious assault capabilities. Reports have indicated that China is constructing specialized amphibious assault vessels designed to land heavier vehicles, such as tanks, directly onto Taiwanese roads. This capability would allow China to bypass some of the natural barriers of Taiwan's coastline, using roads as quick transit routes for fast-moving mechanized units once an initial beachhead is established. The integration of this barge system into China’s broader amphibious strategy indicates a move toward more sophisticated and sustained operations. The barges could be used as part of a multi-phase operation, where, after the initial assault forces secure a beachhead, these barges would continue to deliver additional supplies and heavier equipment. Such operations would allow for the rapid buildup of forces on Taiwanese soil, supporting the advance of Chinese units deeper into the island, potentially faster than traditional port-based logistics could support. While these barges could play a crucial role in ensuring continued resupply operations, their effectiveness hinges on how China can protect them throughout the operation. In addition to the aforementioned threats posed by Taiwanese coastal defenses, these barges are also vulnerable to being disrupted by land-based attacks, such as missile strikes or drone assaults, making their safe operation highly dependent on China’s ability to maintain a strong air and naval presence over the operational area. Moreover, Taiwan's geography presents a unique challenge for amphibious forces, not just in terms of its beaches but also its dense urban areas and mountainous terrain. These factors would require China to plan for more than just a beach landing, factoring in rapid urban warfare and potentially significant resistance from Taiwanese forces. The combination of these challenges further complicates the operational role that these barges can play in an invasion scenario, as their ability to operate effectively in the face of a determined defense will be put to the test. The strategic importance of this new Chinese barge system lies in its potential to provide a reliable, flexible, and rapid means of resupply during a critical phase of an amphibious invasion. While Taiwan’s defenses are formidable, and the vulnerability of these barges remains a significant risk, their integration into broader military strategy could tilt the balance if China can mitigate those threats. The deployment of the barge system could allow for a more sustained, effective operation on Taiwan’s shores, giving China the logistical muscle to push further into the island once initial forces have secured key beachheads. While the new Chinese barges represent a significant tactical tool for military planners, their ultimate success will depend on how well they can be integrated into China's broader amphibious assault strategy, the ability to protect them against Taiwan's advanced defenses, and the overall coordination of the invasion effort. Their role in an invasion of Taiwan is still uncertain, but their introduction into China’s amphibious arsenal is a clear indication of the country's focus on improving its capacity for large-scale, rapid military operations on hostile shores. As the geopolitical situation in the Taiwan Strait continues to unfold, these barges, and the broader amphibious assault system they are part of, will remain a key point of interest for defense analysts and military strategists worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/exclusive-china-develops-advanced-barge-system-to-support-ship-to-shore-operations-in-potential-taiwan-invasion	2025-03-13T10:25:54-07:00

Lockheed Martin develops a Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system mock-up on a Peterbilt 320 truck for Sniper Pod testing	As reported by The Dead District on March 7, 2025, Lockheed Martin has developed a replica of the Russian Pantsir-S1 air defense system using a Peterbilt 320 garbage truck as its base platform. This mock-up, informally referred to by some as the 'Peter Pantsir,' was created for testing and evaluation. It is primarily used to assess the effectiveness of the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, a sensor suite deployed on aircraft such as the F-16 and F-18, designed to identify and classify objects resembling real-world threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mock-up target vehicles are used to evaluate targeting and engagement systems on fighter jets by replicating adversary air defense systems, enabling pilots and sensor operators to analyze the accuracy and reliability of aircraft targeting pods, radar, and weapons systems when detecting and classifying potential threats. (Picture source: Twitter/The Dead District) Mock-up target vehicles are used to evaluate targeting and engagement systems on fighter jets by replicating adversary air defense systems. These replicas enable pilots and sensor operators to analyze the accuracy and reliability of aircraft targeting pods, radar, and weapons systems when detecting and classifying potential threats. Testing with mock-ups allows for adjustments in detection algorithms, assessments of electronic warfare countermeasures, and pilot training under controlled conditions without direct engagement with operational enemy systems. This method provides data on the effectiveness of electro-optical targeting pods, radar-guided missiles, and electronic warfare suites in identifying and engaging targets, supporting the development of countermeasures and operational strategies. The purpose of this mock-up remains open to interpretation, with some sources suggesting it is also intended for Opposing Forces (OPFOR) training. OPFOR is well-established within U.S. Army training exercises, where specialized units replicate adversaries to create realistic combat scenarios. These units follow structured methodologies to simulate enemy tactics, doctrine, and equipment, often using modified vehicles and operational techniques to match potential threats. The U.S. military maintains dedicated OPFOR units at major training centers: the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at the National Training Center (NTC) at Fort Irwin, California; the 1st Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Johnson, Louisiana; and the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) at Hohenfels, Germany. These units employ live, virtual, and constructive training environments to test military strategies, validate operational doctrines, and expose personnel to varied threat scenarios. OPFOR training incorporates information warfare, electronic warfare, and cyber elements to replicate modern battlefield conditions. The program operates under the U.S. Army’s Operational Environment &amp; Opposing Force Program (OE-OPFOR), which oversees OPFOR modernization, accreditation, and scenario development. OPFOR training is used in both national and multinational exercises, including joint operations such as Crocodile '03, which involved Australian-led OPFOR alongside U.S. Marine Corps forces. The Peterbilt 320 is a Class 8 low-cab forward (LCF) truck introduced in 1987, primarily designed for waste collection but also used in construction, tanker, and fire service applications. It succeeded the Peterbilt 310 and was available in left-hand, right-hand, and dual-drive configurations, including a right-hand stand-up option. The truck featured multiple engine options, including the Cummins ISX12, PACCAR PX-9, Westport ISX12 G, and compressed natural gas (CNG) variants, paired with Fuller manual or Allison automatic transmissions. The cab structure consisted of a zinc-coated steel sub-frame and an aluminum cab with bulkhead-style doors. The 320’s design included a lowered doghouse for improved visibility, removable panels, side storage compartments, and an optional cooling unit. In 2014, Peterbilt introduced the ProBilt interior with modifications to the dashboard, controls, and seating layout. The model remained in production until 2017, after which it was replaced by the Peterbilt 520, which retained the LCF layout while incorporating additional features for waste management operations. In 2020, a Russian Pantsir-S1 system, supplied by the United Arab Emirates to forces aligned with Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, was reportedly captured and transported by a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. (Picture source: Russian social media) The United States has actively acquired and analyzed foreign air defense systems to refine countermeasures and improve military tactics. A notable example occurred in 2020 when a Pantsir-S1 system, supplied by the United Arab Emirates to forces aligned with Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, was captured and transported by a U.S. Air Force C-17A Globemaster III to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. While the official justification was to prevent the system from falling into militant hands, intelligence exploitation was likely a secondary objective. Examination of foreign systems such as the Pantsir-S1 allows U.S. defense analysts to assess vulnerabilities, enhance targeting accuracy, and develop suppression strategies. The Pantsir-S1 was conceived in the 1990s as a successor to the Soviet-era Tunguska system, incorporating both missile and autocannon capabilities to provide short-to-medium-range air defense. Developed by KBP Instrument Design Bureau, it was first introduced in the mid-2000s and has since been exported to multiple countries. The system is mounted on various wheeled and tracked chassis, depending on the operator. Designed to engage a range of aerial threats—including aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles—the Pantsir-S1 integrates radar and infrared tracking. However, operational experiences in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine have highlighted its limitations, particularly against coordinated drone and missile strikes. The threat posed by the Pantsir-S1 to fighter jets depends on the engagement scenario. The system’s 57E6 surface-to-air missiles have a reported range of approximately 20 km and can target aircraft flying at altitudes up to 15 km. While Pantsir-S1 units have successfully intercepted enemy airstrikes in some cases, they have also struggled against modern electronic warfare tactics and precision-guided munitions. In conflict zones such as Ukraine, Syria, and Libya, Pantsir-S1 units have been targeted by Turkish and Israeli drones, as well as Western-supplied munitions, exposing weaknesses in their detection and engagement systems. As a result, modifications and enhancements have been made to improve its tracking and targeting resilience in modern combat environments.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lockheed-martin-develops-a-russian-pantsir-s1-air-defense-system-mock-up-on-a-peterbilt-320-truck-for-sniper-pod-testing	2025-03-13T07:47:55-07:00	
Breaking News: Panama ends decades of neutrality with first acquisition of combat aircraft following US policy change	On March 12, 2025, Panama approved a $197 million procurement plan to acquire six aircraft for the National Aeronaval Service (Senan). This purchase includes four A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft from Embraer for over $78 million and two C-295 transport aircraft from Airbus Defense and Space for more than $109 million. The government states that the acquisition is intended to strengthen the country’s capabilities in aerial patrol, disaster response, and humanitarian assistance. The new aircraft will replace an aging fleet of 14 aircraft from the 1980s, which have an estimated annual maintenance cost of approximately $10 million. Officials insist that this procurement has no combat objective.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The acquisition of four A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft for over $78 million marks the first time Panama will operate aircraft with combat capabilities. (Picture source: Brazilian Air Force) Panama's decision to acquire the A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, marking its first operation of combat-capable planes, follows recent incidents involving the United States. In December 2024, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to reclaim control of the Panama Canal, alleging that Panama charged excessive tolls and expressed concerns over potential Chinese influence. These assertions were met with protests in Panama and reaffirmations of sovereignty by Panamanian officials. Therefore, the heightened tensions may have prompted Panama to reassess its defense posture, leading to the procurement of combat aircraft to enhance its national security and assert control over strategic assets.​ Panamanian government representatives explain that the main purpose of acquiring these aircraft is to improve national surveillance, search and rescue operations, and responses to illicit activities such as drug trafficking and illegal fishing. The two C-295 aircraft will be used for logistical support, maritime surveillance, search and rescue, and aerial firefighting, while the A-29 Super Tucanos will focus on aerial patrol operations. Officials maintain that the aircraft will be used strictly for these purposes and that their acquisition aligns with national security priorities. The Cabinet authorized these purchases through an exceptional process. The government has stated that most of the financing will come from external sources, although the final financing structure has not yet been confirmed. Officials also highlight that Panama does not have a military force and that Senan is a security agency responsible for national maritime and aerial surveillance, not a combat force. The government claims that the procurement is necessary to replace outdated aircraft and maintain operational capacity. The acquisition of the A-29 Super Tucanos marks the first time Panama will operate aircraft with combat capabilities. Since the disbandment of the Panamanian military in 1989, the country has relied on security agencies such as Senan, the National Police, and the National Border Service. The increase in unauthorized flights and organized crime activity in Panamanian airspace has been cited as a reason for enhancing air patrol capabilities. This purchase is considered a measure to strengthen aerial security operations. The decision has been met with criticism from various social organizations and political commentators, who argue that the funds could have been allocated to other national priorities such as healthcare and education. Concerns have been raised regarding the financial implications of the purchase, given the lack of publicly available details on the final financing structure. Additionally, some critics question whether this move represents a shift in Panama’s traditionally demilitarized security policy. In response to these concerns, government representatives state that the aircraft will not be used for offensive military operations and that Panama remains committed to its demilitarized status. They emphasize that Senan functions as a security and emergency response agency rather than a military organization. The government argues that the aircraft are necessary for maintaining surveillance and operational readiness, particularly in addressing illicit activities within Panamanian territory. The addition of two C-295 transport aircraft is expected to restore Panama’s medium transport capability, which has been absent since the early 1990s, when the country’s only CASA CN-235 was sold. (Picture source: Airbus Defense and Space) Panama’s current air fleet consists of 24 aircraft, including light aircraft and helicopters used for patrol, transport, and training. Senan operates at least seven Beechcraft Cessna 208B Grand Caravans, three Piper PA-34 Seneca light transport aircraft, three Airbus C-212 Aviocar twin-engine transports, and one De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter for transport and reconnaissance. The service also has at least four MD Helicopters MD-500 utility helicopters, four Bell 412 helicopters, and one Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk. For training, Senan operates five Enaer T-35C Pillán aircraft. The addition of two C-295 transport aircraft is expected to restore Panama’s medium transport capability, which has been absent since the early 1990s, when the country’s only CASA CN-235 was sold. The A-29 Super Tucano was developed by the Brazilian company Embraer as an advanced version of the EMB-312 Tucano trainer. It was designed for counterinsurgency, reconnaissance, and pilot training missions. First introduced in 2003, the aircraft has been adopted by multiple countries for security and border surveillance operations. It was developed to operate in environments with minimal logistical support and can use unpaved runways. The aircraft has been used in various operational contexts, including counter-narcotics and air interdiction missions. The A-29 Super Tucano features a reinforced airframe designed to withstand high-stress operations and higher g-loads, with an operational fatigue life of 8,000 to 12,000 hours. Built to operate in harsh environments with minimal ground support, this light attack aircraft is equipped with Kevlar armor plating around the cockpit and engine to protect against small arms fire. It has two internally mounted FN Herstal M3P .50 caliber machine guns, each with 200 rounds, for defense against ground-based threats. The aircraft is also compatible with night vision goggles (NVGs) and features an integrated forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor for enhanced target acquisition and night operations. The landing gear is reinforced for rough-field operations, allowing takeoff and landing on unprepared runways, which increases its operational flexibility for reconnaissance, training, and surveillance missions. With five external hardpoints—two under each wing and one on the centerline—the A-29 Super Tucano can be armed with various weapons, including unguided Mk 81 (113 kg) and Mk 82 (227 kg) general-purpose bombs, as well as precision-guided munitions such as the Paveway II laser-guided bomb series and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM). For close air support missions, it can be fitted with the Giat NC621 20mm cannon pod or MAA-1 Piranha air-to-air missiles. The aircraft is complemented by various targeting systems, including an integrated mission computer, a laser rangefinder, and a weapons management system that enables the use of advanced targeting pods for greater accuracy. It is also capable of deploying electronic countermeasures to disrupt hostile radar and missile guidance systems. In terms of performance, the A-29 Super Tucano has a maximum speed of 590 km/h, a combat range of approximately 550 km, and an endurance of up to eight hours.

US releases first-ever footage of AGM-114R-9X Flying Ninja bladed missile strike	On February 23, 2025, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted a precision airstrike in northwest Syria, killing Muhammed Yusuf Ziya Talay, a senior military leader of Hurras al-Din (HaD), an Al-Qaeda affiliate. The operation was part of CENTCOM’s ongoing efforts to disrupt terrorist activities in the region and marked the first time the U.S. government publicly released video footage of an AGM-114R-9X Flying Ginsu missile in action. General Michael Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, stated that similar operations would continue as necessary.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The absence of an explosion, along with the observed damage pattern, was consistent with previous strikes using the AGM-114R-9X Flying Ginsu, a variant of the Hellfire missile designed to minimize collateral damage. (Picture sources: US CENTCOM and Open Source Munitions Portal) On March 1, 2025, CENTCOM released video footage documenting the airstrike. The footage showed a vehicle traveling on a road before being struck by a munition. The absence of an explosion, along with the observed damage pattern, was consistent with previous strikes using the AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile, a variant designed to minimize collateral damage. This assessment was supported by images from the strike site, which showed missile fragments with markings identifying them as AGM-114R-9X components. The observed damage to the vehicle, characterized by a star-shaped penetration pattern, aligned with the known effects of the R-9X variant. It is assessed that an MQ-9 Reaper drone conducted the strike, as this platform has been used for similar operations in the past. The AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile, dubbed the Flying Ginsu, Flying Ninja, R9X, or Ninja Missile, is a modification of the Hellfire family, developed to engage specific targets while reducing collateral damage. Unlike conventional Hellfire variants that employ explosive warheads, the R-9X relies on kinetic force and six deployable metal blades, which extend from the missile body before impact. The munition entered U.S. military service in 2017, with the first publicly documented use occurring in 2019. In 2022, it was reportedly used in an airstrike targeting the then-leader of Al-Qaeda, bringing further attention to its operational role. Official acknowledgment of the R-9X remains limited. A U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) spokesperson confirmed its presence in the U.S. inventory but provided no additional details regarding its use. No confirmed foreign sales have been reported, though, in theory, the weapon could be deployed by any system capable of launching standard Hellfire missiles. Reports in 2023 suggested that Israel may have used the missile in Gaza, but subsequent analysis indicated the munition in question was an illumination shell rather than an R-9X. The release of video footage showing the AGM-114R-9X in action for the first time suggests a shift in the availability of official information regarding its use. The Pentagon’s decision to share this material appears to be an effort to highlight the role of precision-guided munitions in counterterrorism operations. The footage depicts a targeting sequence with crosshairs fixed on the driver’s side of the vehicle, with damage limited to that area while the passenger seat remained mostly intact. This corresponds with previous accounts of the missile's capabilities. The targeting FLIR footage shows the missile locking onto a moving vehicle before impact, further illustrating its intended function. The AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile weighs approximately 49 kg and is designed as a kinetic impact munition with six long, retractable blades that deploy in the final moments before impact. (Picture source: Twitter/Status-6) The R-9X has been used in multiple operations targeting individuals traveling in unarmored vehicles, primarily in Syria and Lebanon. Its deployment has led to discussions on the strategic and legal implications of its use, particularly regarding intelligence accuracy and the operational limitations of non-explosive kinetic munitions. While it is designed to limit unintended casualties, its effectiveness depends on precise targeting data. The distinct damage pattern it leaves allows forensic analysts to identify its use at strike sites. The AGM-114R-9X Hellfire missile weighs approximately 49 kg and is designed as a kinetic impact munition with six long, retractable blades that deploy in the final moments before impact. It retains the overall dimensions of a standard Hellfire missile, with a length of approximately 1.6 meters and a diameter of 180 mm, allowing it to be launched from platforms already configured for Hellfire missiles, including rotary-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as the MQ-9 Reaper, and ground-based launchers. The missile relies on a combination of inertial navigation and semi-active laser guidance to precisely engage designated targets. Unlike explosive warheads, the R-9X generates lethal effects through high-velocity kinetic energy and the cutting action of its six forward-deploying blades, which are designed to penetrate vehicle roofs and lightly armored structures while reducing collateral damage. The missile's accumulator and actuator mechanisms facilitate the controlled deployment of its blades, ensuring structural integrity until impact. The R-9X’s non-explosive design is intended for targeted eliminations where minimizing risk to nearby structures and bystanders is a priority. This design enables it to engage targets with a controlled impact radius. Other U.S. military low-collateral munitions include concrete-filled inert bombs and the carbon-fiber-body Mark 82 bomb, both of which similarly reduce fragmentation effects. Unlike explosive warheads, the R-9X generates lethal effects through high-velocity kinetic energy and the cutting action of its six forward-deploying blades, which are designed to penetrate vehicle roofs and lightly armored structure.

This versatility allows the B-52H to engage a broad spectrum of targets, ranging from hardened military installations to high-value, time-sensitive targets in complex environments. A key feature of the B-52H is its long endurance, capable of conducting missions lasting up to 12 hours and striking targets at ranges exceeding 8,000 km (about 5,000 miles) without refueling. This makes the B-52H one of the most effective strategic assets for projecting power across Europe and beyond, ensuring that NATO can respond to threats at any location in its area of responsibility. In a European context, the B-52H can reach key targets within Russia or Eastern Europe, adding strategic depth to NATO’s deterrence posture. It is an essential tool for countering modern, advanced threats, including those posed by peer adversaries with sophisticated air defense systems. The B-52H’s combat capabilities are enhanced by its avionics systems, which allow for precise targeting even in contested environments. It can operate alongside NATO partners, providing long-range strike capabilities that augment the conventional and nuclear deterrence forces of allied nations. The participation of two B-52H bombers in the VIKING NEBULA mission highlights the increasing integration of these aircraft into European defense exercises, underscoring NATO’s readiness and flexibility in responding to emerging threats. The GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a 500-pound, GPS-guided bomb designed to convert 'dumb' bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The GBU-38 is part of the JDAM family of munitions, which includes the GBU-31 and GBU-32 variants, and is widely used by NATO forces for its accuracy and versatility. Its GPS/INS guidance system allows it to strike targets with pinpoint precision, even in adverse weather conditions or GPS-jamming environments, making it a valuable tool for NATO’s precision strike capabilities. In terms of its combat performance, the GBU-38 can engage a wide variety of targets, including enemy command centers, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure, while minimizing collateral damage—an increasingly important factor in modern military operations. With a maximum range of up to 15 nautical miles (approximately 28 kilometers) when launched from high altitudes, the GBU-38 provides standoff capabilities that keep the launching aircraft out of harm’s way while still achieving a direct hit on target. The munition's ability to deliver high levels of destruction with minimal collateral damage makes it ideal for operations in urban or densely populated areas, where precision is critical. In the context of the Vidsel Test Range in Sweden, the live weapons drop of the GBU-38 allowed both U.S. and Swedish forces to refine their joint operational techniques, testing the effectiveness of these munitions in the European theater. This operation highlighted the importance of precision strike capabilities, allowing NATO forces to engage targets with enhanced accuracy and reduced risk to civilian infrastructure, which is crucial for maintaining strategic stability in Europe. The presence of U.S. Air Force bombers, such as the B-52H, in NATO exercises like VIKING NEBULA is of tremendous strategic significance. The ability of U.S. bombers to integrate seamlessly with NATO forces provides the alliance with a robust and flexible response capability to both conventional and hybrid threats. The joint exercises, conducted across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, strengthen NATO’s collective lethality, ensuring that the alliance can quickly deploy and coordinate across multiple domains—air, land, and sea. For example, the integration of Swedish JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft in the VIKING NEBULA mission demonstrated the interoperability of NATO’s air forces. The Gripen fighters, capable of operating in contested environments, provided a robust escort to the B-52H Stratofortresses as they conducted their live weapons drop. This coordination is vital in a high-intensity conflict scenario, where rapid response and the ability to execute joint operations across multiple nations can make the difference between success and failure. Additionally, the use of Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) during the exercise further reinforced NATO’s ability to synchronize ground and air assets in real-time. This coordination not only improves the operational effectiveness of precision strikes but also enhances the alliance’s overall capability to conduct integrated combat operations. For example, the U.S. and Swedish JTACs working together during the live drop ensured the munitions were accurately delivered and maximized their operational impact. The mission also included a low-formation flyover of the Swedish Parliament, celebrating the one-year anniversary of Sweden’s accession to NATO. This symbolic act underscored the strengthening bond between Sweden and NATO, highlighting the alliance’s commitment to ensuring the security of its newest member. The successful integration of Sweden into NATO’s air and ground operations, exemplified by this mission, is a critical step in enhancing collective defense capabilities in Northern Europe, particularly in light of increasing security challenges from potential adversaries in the region. Currently deployed with the 69th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron at RAF Fairford, England, the B-52H Stratofortresses continue to execute operations alongside NATO allies, enhancing the alliance's ability to project power globally.

AKM Group CZ confirms uninterrupted US ammunition supply amid European security concerns	On March 13, 2025, the Czech company AKM Group-CZ confirmed to Army Recognition the regular and uninterrupted supply of ammunition from a US manufacturer, stating that deliveries are proceeding according to contractual obligations. This confirmation comes amid increasing concerns over European defense supply stability following recent policy shifts in the United States.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The logistics department of AKM Group CZ noted that multiple contracts with US manufacturers remain in place, with no reported disruptions linked to political decisions. (Picture source: AKM Group CZ) At the beginning of March 2025, US President Donald Trump announced the suspension of military assistance to Ukraine, ceasing supplies of ammunition, vehicles, and other defense equipment. This decision directly affects Ukraine’s defense capabilities and impacts European security, as many EU countries remain reliant on US defense exports. In response, EU nations are working to expand their defense budgets and domestic arms production. However, experts indicate that Europe is unlikely to reach full self-sufficiency in defense production before 2026-2027. Ukraine’s estimated annual ammunition requirement is around three million shells, while the European Union provided only 500,000 shells in 2023. In 2024, the EU increased its production capacity by 30%, allowing the delivery of one million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine. Despite these efforts, European production remains insufficient to fully meet its own defense requirements. The United States saw a 29% increase in arms and military equipment exports in 2024, reaching a record $318.7 billion, according to the U.S. State Department. The primary recipients of these exports were Turkey, Israel, Romania, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. While the European Union has expanded its production capacity, it still faces limitations in fulfilling its overall defense needs without external suppliers. In response to uncertainty regarding US defense support, AKM Group-CZ has reiterated that it continues to meet its obligations to European end recipients under established contractual schedules. Since the beginning of 2025, the company has completed multiple defense product deliveries from a US manufacturer. This was confirmed during the Enforce Tac 2025 international defense exhibition in Nuremberg, where AKM Group-CZ representatives met with American partners to discuss ongoing supply agreements. The head of AKM Group-CZ’s logistics department stated that the company maintains coordination with US regulatory authorities to ensure adherence to export control regulations and the stability of logistics chains. The company highlighted a contract signed in 2024 with a US arms manufacturer for the supply of defense products to Europe, valued at tens of millions of dollars. The logistics department noted that multiple contracts with US manufacturers remain in place, with no reported disruptions linked to political decisions. ‘We have more than one contract with American manufacturers in the works and do not anticipate difficulties with deliveries due to political processes,’ stated the head of AKM Group-CZ’s logistics department. Geopolitical developments suggest that defense-importing nations are increasingly prioritizing diversification in procurement strategies to mitigate dependence on a single supplier. As a result, international suppliers are expected to play a larger role in global defense markets. This shift requires companies to manage complex logistics, establish alternative supply channels, integrate technologies from multiple countries, and adapt products to meet the specific requirements of end users. AKM Group-CZ previously secured exclusive access to the full annual production capacity of US firearms manufacturer ZRODelta for the European market. This agreement, signed on November 14, 2024, is valued at tens of millions of dollars and follows a prior contract for ammunition supplies. ZRODelta, based in Connelly Springs, North Carolina, manufactures a range of firearms and accessories, including the Modulus Modular Handgun, Venator Precision Rifle, and the Ready Series line of Modern Sporting Rifles. AKM Group-CZ, founded in 2001, specializes in supplying military and dual-use goods, including armored vehicles, artillery systems, small arms, and ammunition. The company collaborates with multiple defense manufacturers, including Cadex Defence, AGM Global Vision, and ZRODelta. Under its latest contract, AKM Group-CZ has already delivered multiple consignments of ammunition and firearms, with shipments arriving at their destinations within 24 days—considerably faster than the standard 45-day transit time. The company attributes this to an organized logistics network and experienced personnel. Quality control is a key component of AKM Group-CZ’s operational procedures. The company conducts batch inspections to ensure all delivered products comply with contractual specifications. The process includes sample selection, testing, and verification before dispatch. According to the company, these measures ensure that all supplied products meet required performance and reliability standards.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/akm-group-cz-confirms-uninterrupted-us-ammunition-supply-amid-european-security-concerns	2025-03-13T04:04:19-07:00

Has the mysterious HQ-29 ballistic missile defense system been spotted in service with the Chinese Armed Forces?	According to International Defence Analysis on March 8, 2025, recent images circulating on social media suggest that the Chinese Armed Forces might have deployed the HQ-29 ballistic missile defense (BMD) system. The HQ-29 is one of several interceptors in China's missile defense strategy, alongside the HQ-9B, HQ-19, HQ-26, and kinetic interceptors such as the DN series. These systems are designed to counter threats ranging from short-range ballistic missiles to those in the exoatmospheric phase. While the HQ-9A air defense variant is well-documented, information on the HQ-29 remains limited, with available details primarily based on unofficial sources.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Chinese military assessments classify the HQ-29 as part of the third layer of the country's missile defense network, focusing on intercepting short- and medium-range threats within the atmosphere. (Picture source: Twitter/International Defence Analysis) The HQ-29 anti-ballistic missile defense (ABMD) system is reported to be functionally similar to the American PAC-3 MSE interceptor missile system, utilizing a kinetic kill vehicle equipped with lateral impulse thrusters for trajectory adjustment. Unlike Russia's 9M96 missile from the S-400 system, which positions its thrusters near the missile's center of gravity, the HQ-29 reportedly employs a system of 100 solid-state pulse thrusters arranged around the missile's head for maneuvering. Reports indicate that China initiated the HQ-29’s development in 2003, with thrust-vectoring and control technology undergoing testing between 2005 and 2007. A validation and verification test was conducted in 2011, with unconfirmed reports stating that it was successful. The project’s chief engineer, Yun Lee, affiliated with CASIC, was acknowledged in Chinese aerospace publications following this test. At the time, the HQ-29 was projected for delivery to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) before the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan. Available information suggests that the HQ-29 is designed for terminal-phase interception of ballistic missiles at lower altitudes. Chinese military assessments classify it as part of the third layer of the country's missile defense network, focusing on intercepting short- and medium-range threats within the atmosphere. Other missile defense elements include the HQ-19 and HQ-26, which are intended to counter threats at higher altitudes, while the DN-series interceptors are designed for mid-course engagements beyond the atmosphere. While the Chinese government has not confirmed the HQ-29’s operational status, references to related research and state awards suggest that the system has reached an advanced stage. A significant aspect of the HQ-29's possible guidance system could be the integration of an advanced fire-control algorithm, optimizing its impulse thrusters for precise trajectory corrections. This technology enables in-flight adjustments to improve interception accuracy. Studies from Chinese research institutions describe simulations and energy efficiency analyses conducted to refine the firing sequence of these thrusters. These developments align with China’s broader missile defense efforts, as demonstrated by exoatmospheric interception tests at the Korla Missile Test Site in 2013. The HQ-29 project is reportedly part of the larger '8102 Project,' an initiative under the Sixth Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), which received national recognition. China's missile defense system is structured in three layers: an exoatmospheric layer managed by kinetic interceptors such as the DN-1 and DN-2; a mid-layer covered by the HQ-19 and HQ-26; and a terminal interception layer, which includes the HQ-9B and HQ-29. The PLA has conducted multiple anti-ballistic missile (ABM) tests since 2010, including midcourse interception trials in 2013, 2014, 2018, and 2021. While these tests were largely attributed to the HQ-19 and DN-series interceptors, some reports suggest that elements of the HQ-29 system were involved in evaluating China's lower-altitude missile defense capabilities. Comparisons between the HQ-29 and the American PAC-3 MSE highlight similarities in interception principles. The PAC-3 MSE is an enhanced variant of the PAC-3, featuring extended range and improved propulsion. Both systems employ hit-to-kill technology, with advanced thruster systems for final-phase targeting. Some sources claim the HQ-29 uses a 55 kg-class kinetic warhead and is launched from an underground vertical launch system, facilitating rapid engagement. Information from leaked documents also suggests that the HQ-29 is integrated with a strategic dual-band phased array radar, which may enhance its detection and tracking capabilities. Although official Chinese sources have provided limited details, available evidence indicates that the HQ-29 has progressed through key developmental stages. Reports of its deployment align with China's efforts to enhance its missile defense network. However, without direct confirmation from the Chinese government, key aspects of the HQ-29’s capabilities remain uncertain, requiring further analysis as more information becomes available.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/has-the-mysterious-hq-29-ballistic-missile-defense-system-been-spotted-in-service-with-the-chinese-armed-forces	2025-03-13T03:30:45-07:00

These platforms support a variety of missions, with the AIM-260A test marking a crucial step forward in improving the Navy’s long-range strike capabilities. Although the specifics of which aircraft participated in the live-fire tests were not disclosed, the AIM-260A's development and testing are part of the broader Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM) program, a collaborative effort between the U.S. Navy and Air Force. This missile, which has been under active testing for years, is designed to address the growing threats posed by increasingly advanced adversary aircraft and to replace older systems like the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The testing conducted by VX-31 is a significant milestone in the missile’s evolution, further refining its long-range performance and advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats. The AIM-260A Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM) represents a massive leap forward in missile technology for the U.S. military. Not merely an evolution of the AIM-120 AMRAAM, the AIM-260A is a new capability designed to maintain U.S. air superiority over increasingly sophisticated adversaries. With near-peer competitors like Russia and China rapidly advancing their own missile and aircraft technologies, the AIM-260A was developed to meet these new challenges. The missile’s key innovations are tailored to ensure that U.S. forces can maintain dominance in air combat, even as adversaries deploy next-generation stealth fighters and advanced air defense systems. Developed to improve upon the shortcomings of older systems, the AIM-260A delivers superior performance in long-range engagements, advanced guidance, and tracking systems, as well as enhanced resistance to electronic warfare. The testing of the missile has proven its ability to meet the growing demands for high-performance munitions that can engage the advanced aircraft of near-peer competitors. The AIM-260A’s design incorporates several major upgrades that make it a game-changer in air-to-air combat. One of the most notable improvements is its extended range. While the AIM-120 AMRAAM has a range of approximately 100 miles (160 km), the AIM-260A is expected to reach up to 150-200 miles (240-320 km), allowing aircraft to engage targets well before they can close in on friendly forces. This increased standoff capability significantly shifts the balance of engagement, giving U.S. aircraft a first-strike advantage over adversaries. In addition to its extended range, the advanced guidance systems of the AIM-260A provide a crucial advantage in modern air combat. Likely combining active radar homing with an enhanced seeker technology, the missile is designed to track and engage targets at extended ranges while maintaining a high level of accuracy in contested environments. This capability is critical as adversary aircraft are increasingly equipped with advanced countermeasures, such as radar jamming and anti-jamming systems. The AIM-260A’s resilience against such electronic warfare efforts makes it a highly effective tool in the battle for air superiority. The enhanced maneuverability of the AIM-260A is another standout feature. Its airframe and propulsion system allow it to maintain high agility during its terminal phase, increasing its chances of hitting highly maneuverable targets, such as advanced fighter jets equipped with sophisticated evasion techniques. Furthermore, the missile's design incorporates low-observable features, reducing the likelihood of detection by enemy radar, which gives it an added edge in stealth operations. The AIM-260A is also designed with flexibility in mind. While its primary role is air-to-air combat, its versatility may allow for secondary ground-attack roles, depending on the specifics of its deployment. This multi-role capability ensures that the AIM-260A can adapt to various mission types, whether it be fleet defense, offensive strikes, or countering emerging threats in contested airspace. The AIM-260A brings several tactical advantages to U.S. forces, significantly altering the dynamics of air combat. One of its primary benefits is its extended standoff capability. With the ability to engage enemy aircraft before they can enter their weapons range, the AIM-260A enables U.S. aircraft to hold a safe distance while still maintaining the offensive. This is especially crucial when facing adversaries such as China and Russia, who are deploying increasingly sophisticated air defense systems. The countering of advanced adversary aircraft is another critical tactical advantage. Modern stealth fighters, such as Russia’s Su-57 and China’s J-20, pose a significant challenge to traditional air combat tactics. With its superior range and advanced radar-homing guidance, the AIM-260A allows U.S. aircraft to engage these stealth platforms at longer ranges, reducing the risk of detection and engagement. This ability to defeat next-generation stealth fighters ensures that U.S. forces can maintain air superiority in complex and contested environments. The multi-target engagement capability of the AIM-260A is also worth noting. Thanks to its advanced seeker and radar systems, the missile can track multiple targets simultaneously. This allows a single aircraft to engage multiple hostile aircraft in rapid succession, an essential capability in air combat scenarios where threats are numerous and dynamic. In modern combat, electronic warfare plays an increasingly significant role. The AIM-260A’s ability to resist jamming and spoofing makes it a reliable weapon in environments where electronic countermeasures are employed. This capability is critical in ensuring that the missile can maintain its lock on targets and successfully neutralize adversary aircraft, even in the face of sophisticated electronic warfare efforts. Finally, the AIM-260A’s first-strike advantage gives U.S. forces a critical edge in air combat. By leveraging its extended range and improved tracking capabilities, the missile allows U.S. aircraft to strike first, neutralizing enemy threats before they can launch their own weapons or countermeasures. This makes the AIM-260A a formidable tool for pre-emptively neutralizing enemy aircraft in contested airspace. As testing continues and the AIM-260A is integrated into operational fleets, it is expected to become a critical asset for the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Aircraft such as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-22 Raptors will soon be equipped with the missile, marking a new era in air combat capabilities. The ongoing integration of the AIM-260A into operational fleets will reshape the strategies of both the Navy and Air Force, enhancing their ability to dominate in contested airspace and high-threat environments. The increasing focus on near-peer competitors like China and Russia, both of whom are rapidly advancing their own technologies, underscores the importance of the AIM-260A. With its superior range, advanced guidance systems, and resilience against electronic countermeasures, the missile will allow U.S. forces to remain at the forefront of modern aerial warfare. It provides a vital tool for maintaining air superiority in the face of evolving global threats. Looking toward the future, the AIM-260A is expected to evolve even further, incorporating new technologies and potentially expanding its role in both air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements. Its development is a strategic leap forward, signaling the U.S. military’s preparedness for the future of warfare. As the AIM-260A is integrated into operational platforms and its testing phase progresses, it is clear that this missile will play a pivotal role in maintaining the U.S. military's dominance in the skies for years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/exclusive-us-air-force-tests-new-aim-260-air-to-air-missile-to-secure-air-superiority-over-china-and-russia	2025-03-13T03:12:32-07:00

Flash News: US Marines Deploy NMESIS Anti-Ship Missile Systems in Japan to Counter Indo-Pacific Maritime Threats	On March 3, 2025, the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR) achieved a significant milestone in strengthening the U.S. military's capabilities in the Indo-Pacific with the integration of the NMESIS (Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System) anti-ship missile battery into the 12th Littoral Combat Team (LCT) based at Camp Hansen in Okinawa, Japan. This deployment enhances the U.S. Marine Corps' ability to project power and respond rapidly to emerging maritime threats, particularly in the face of increasing naval challenges from adversaries like China and North Korea. The inclusion of NMESIS in the 12th LCT underscores the importance of mobile, land-based strike capabilities in the region's rapidly evolving security environment.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A landing craft air cushion transports a Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) launcher during Project Convergence 2022 (PC22) at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The deployment of the U.S. Marine Corps 12th LCT (Littoral Combat Team), featuring the advanced NMESIS system, reinforces the strategic position of the U.S. in the Indo-Pacific, an area critical to global trade and security. Okinawa’s geographic location, positioned near vital sea lanes and maritime chokepoints, makes it an ideal hub for enhancing U.S. forces’ responsiveness. The 12th LCT’s ability to rapidly deploy and conduct precision strikes makes it a formidable force in countering potential adversaries, disrupting their naval operations, and maintaining regional stability. The NMESIS is a cutting-edge coastal anti-ship missile system that brings a new dimension to the Marine Corps’ anti-ship warfare capabilities. Developed to address the growing need for mobile, land-based missile strikes against enemy maritime targets, NMESIS integrates the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) with the ROGUE Fires Carrier, an unmanned ground vehicle built on the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) chassis by Oshkosh Defense. The system's innovative design provides the flexibility and responsiveness needed to confront modern maritime threats effectively. The key weapon of the NMESIS system is the NSM, a subsonic, sea-skimming cruise missile specifically designed to strike enemy surface vessels with precision. The NSM has a number of distinctive features that make it highly effective in contested environments. One of its most notable capabilities is its ability to fly at extremely low altitudes, hugging the ocean surface, which makes it resistant to interception by enemy radar systems. The missile’s subsonic speed, around 0.9 Mach, further contributes to its survivability in environments where high-speed missiles may be more easily detected and targeted. The NSM boasts a range of approximately 185 kilometers (100 nautical miles), enabling it to strike enemy vessels at significant distances. This extended range is particularly advantageous in coastal defense operations, where access to naval assets may be limited. With the NMESIS system, U.S. forces can strike maritime targets from land-based positions, providing a strategic advantage in situations where traditional naval forces may be unavailable or restricted by geographic or political limitations. An NMESIS battery consists of two platoons, each comprising three Medium-Range Missile System Launcher (MMSL) sections. Each MMSL section is made up of several key components: a Leader Vehicle, up to three ROGUE-Fires missile launchers, and a Command and Control (C2) vehicle. The Leader Vehicle is tasked with coordinating the system’s overall operations, ensuring that each launcher is operating effectively and that the platoon functions cohesively. The ROGUE-Fires missile launchers, which are mounted on the JLTV chassis, provide the mobile platform for launching the NSMs. These launchers are designed to be flexible and easily re-positioned, allowing the system to quickly adapt to changing operational conditions. The C2 vehicle in the NMESIS system is critical to the overall effectiveness of the battery. Based on the JLTV platform, the C2 vehicle facilitates communication and coordination between multiple units, ensuring that all components of the system work in tandem. It enables real-time updates on target acquisition, missile launch coordination, and battlefield awareness, allowing the system to adapt quickly to evolving threats and operational requirements. The integration of the JLTV platform in both the C2 vehicle and the ROGUE-Fires launchers ensures the system's mobility, protection, and compatibility with other Marine Corps equipment. NMESIS is designed to excel in coastal defense and expeditionary operations, allowing the Marine Corps to maintain a forward-deployed presence capable of launching precision strikes against enemy surface vessels from land-based positions. The ability to quickly move launchers and C2 vehicles provides a strategic advantage in the littoral zones of the Indo-Pacific, where access to traditional naval assets may be restricted. By using mobile, land-based platforms to launch NSMs, the Marine Corps can disrupt adversary naval operations, ensuring the freedom of navigation in vital sea lanes and complicating the enemy’s ability to predict and counter U.S. military actions. In addition to its operational flexibility, NMESIS offers a robust level of protection for its operators. The JLTV chassis, used both in the ROGUE-Fires launchers and C2 vehicles, is designed to provide enhanced protection against small arms fire, shrapnel, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), ensuring that the system remains operational in hostile environments. This mobility and protection make NMESIS a versatile and resilient asset in the U.S. Marine Corps’ arsenal, capable of conducting high-stakes missions in high-risk areas. The system's integration into the 12th LCT is a key component of the U.S. Marine Corps' broader strategy to enhance its warfighting readiness in the Indo-Pacific. The Marine Corps’ focus on speed, precision, and low observability, as embodied in the 12th LCT, ensures that U.S. forces can quickly respond to emerging threats while remaining highly mobile and difficult to target. This approach is designed to disrupt adversaries' decision-making cycles, degrade their targeting capabilities, and create uncertainty and confusion in contested environments. The NMESIS system’s ability to strike from land-based positions further bolsters the Marine Corps’ capabilities by providing a flexible and mobile response option in regions where traditional naval forces may be at a disadvantage. It complements other advanced technologies being integrated into the Marine Corps' modernized force structure, contributing to the overall effectiveness and lethality of U.S. military operations in the Indo-Pacific. As the 12th LCT’s NMESIS anti-ship missile battery begins operations in Okinawa, it marks a significant step forward for the U.S. military’s presence and readiness in the Indo-Pacific. The system enhances the Marine Corps’ ability to engage in long-range, precision strikes against maritime threats while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to the dynamic and complex operational environment of the region. With the integration of NMESIS, the Marine Corps is well-positioned to ensure regional security, maintain freedom of navigation, and counter maritime threats posed by adversaries in the Indo-Pacific.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-marines-deploy-nmesis-anti-ship-missile-systems-in-japan-to-counter-indo-pacific-maritime-threats	2025-03-13T02:12:33-07:00	
Italy Proposes a European Guarantee Fund to Stimulate Private Investment in Defense	Italy has submitted a proposal to its European partners aimed at establishing a common guaranteed mechanism to attract private investment in the defense and aerospace sectors within the European Union. This initiative, which could generate up to €200 billion in investments, is based on a €17 billion guarantee fund designed to limit the impact on public finances. Presented by Italy’s Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti during a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, this approach seeks to strengthen Europe’s defense capabilities without increasing national debt burdens. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French and Italian Marine Regiments Join Forces During Amphex 2024 (Picture source: Italian MoD) The Italian proposal comes as the EU explores various options to increase defense spending in response to potential security threats, particularly from Russia. Ongoing discussions include the possibility of new joint borrowing, the use of existing EU funds, and an expanded role for the European Investment Bank. A decision on these measures is expected by June. According to Giorgetti, Italy is willing to contribute to this collective effort but is committed to doing so without reducing funding for healthcare and public services. With a public debt amounting to approximately 135% of GDP—the second highest in the eurozone after Greece—Italy has limited fiscal flexibility and is seeking mechanisms that do not further increase national debt. The European Union is pursuing an extensive defense investment plan to enhance military capabilities and address emerging threats. Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and growing instability at Europe’s borders, several member states are advocating for increased defense expenditures and greater integration of the defense industry. The European Commission is considering mobilizing funds through various mechanisms, including the European Investment Bank and public guarantees, to modernize military equipment, develop new technologies, and expand production capacity. The aim is to reduce dependency on external partners and strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy. Europe’s rearmament efforts are primarily driven by evolving security challenges and the need for greater independence in crisis management. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exposed critical gaps in ammunition stockpiles and production capacities, underscoring the urgency of revitalizing the defense industry. Additionally, China’s growing military influence, tensions in the South China Sea, and persistent instability in the Middle East and North Africa are prompting the EU to reassess its strategic priorities. The objective is not only to deter potential threats but also to safeguard critical infrastructure and improve resilience against cyberattacks and hybrid warfare. To achieve these goals, the EU is coordinating efforts among member states, combining public investment with private capital to maximize financial impact without significantly increasing national debt. Strengthening the European Defense Fund, establishing a common market for military equipment, and advancing joint programs such as the MGCS main battle tank and the SCAF air combat system exemplify the commitment to collective defense initiatives. This shift is accompanied by discussions on increasing military budgets, with some countries advocating for a minimum defense spending target of 2% of GDP. While this raises concerns over budgetary implications, it reflects a broader recognition of the need for reinforced defense capabilities. The Italian proposal aligns with established financial practices such as InvestEU and the European Fund for Strategic Investments. According to Giorgetti, the proposed guarantee fund would optimize the use of both national and European resources while ensuring more effective private-sector participation. He also emphasized that under EU accounting rules, public guarantees only contribute to national debt if they are utilized by beneficiary companies, thereby mitigating immediate fiscal pressure. Italy currently plans to increase its defense spending to 1.61% of GDP by 2027, a level below the NATO target of 2%. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed raising this threshold to 5%, a suggestion that has generated debate within the alliance. Acknowledging these discussions, Giorgetti stressed the importance of identifying industrial sectors that could be repurposed for defense production. In this context, underutilized automotive factories across the EU have been identified as potential sites for expanding military production while revitalizing struggling industries. As the EU seeks a unified approach to financing its defense initiatives, Italy’s proposal offers a pragmatic alternative focused on mobilizing substantial private investment while maintaining fiscal constraints. This mechanism could play a crucial role in industrial transformation and the expansion of European defense capabilities, aligning financial considerations with strategic security objectives.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/italy-proposes-a-european-guarantee-fund-to-stimulate-private-investment-in-defense	2025-03-13T02:03:08-07:00	
Greece to announce modernization of four Papanikolis-class submarines with new acquisitions under consideration	As reported by OnAlert on March 13, 2025, the modernization of the four Papanikolis-class submarines and the procurement of new submarines are among the programs expected to be announced by the Greek Prime Minister in Parliament on March 27, 2025. Concurrently, the first batch of 44 SeaHake Mod4 heavy torpedoes is set to arrive at the Salamis Naval Base in early summer, following significant delays attributed to supply chain disruptions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hellenic Navy’s plan is to complete the Papanikolis-class modernization program alongside the delivery of new submarines, resulting in a fleet of nine operational submarines. (Picture source: Hellenic Navy) The Hellenic Navy prioritizes enhancing its submarine fleet to maintain operational capabilities established with the acquisition of four Papanikolis-class submarines, based on the German Type 214, and the modernization of Okeanos (S-118), a Poseidon-class submarine based on the German Type 209. During the 2020 maritime crisis between Greece and Türkiye, these submarines reportedly tracked multiple Turkish surface vessels while remaining undetected. The Papanikolis-class is based on the Type 214 submarine, a diesel-electric attack submarine featuring an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system utilizing Siemens polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cells. It has a length of 65 meters, a beam of 6.3 meters, and a submerged displacement of 1,860 tons. The submarine can operate at a maximum submerged speed of 20 knots and dive to depths approaching 400 meters. It is designed for an endurance of 84 days, with the ability to remain submerged for extended periods using its AIP system. The armament consists of eight 533 mm torpedo tubes capable of launching heavyweight torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub-Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Its propulsion system includes two MTU 16V-396 diesel engines, two Piller NTB56.40-10 charging generators, and a Siemens Permasyn electric motor, driving a low-noise skew-back propeller to minimize acoustic signature. Two SeaHake Mod4 heavy torpedoes have already arrived at the Salamis Naval Base for training and certification purposes. These torpedoes lack explosive warheads and are instead equipped with devices that emit light and release a special liquid to facilitate retrieval after launch. They are guided by a fiber-optic cable from the submarine, ensuring precise tracking. Once their battery power is depleted, they surface for retrieval. The first training launches are scheduled for May, with additional exercises planned in the following months. The training torpedoes can be converted into operational weapons by installing 260 kg explosive warheads. By the end of 2025, the Hellenic Navy is expected to receive most of the heavy torpedoes, which will replace the older SUT Mod0 torpedoes acquired in 1980 and the SST4 models that remain in use. The SeaHake Mod4 torpedoes are designed for speeds of up to 50 knots and a range exceeding 50 kilometers. They feature advanced electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) to resist interference and defensive countermeasures. These torpedoes can operate with both active and passive targeting systems and are guided with precision via fiber-optic cables. They can be deployed from various depths under different sea conditions while evading modern decoys and countermeasures. Weighing over 1.5 tons, they carry 260 kg of explosive material, capable of causing significant damage to large naval vessels. The original delivery schedule for these torpedoes was set for 2023, but manufacturer Atlas Elektronik cited material supply issues related to the war in Ukraine as the cause of delays. The Hellenic Navy’s fleet also operates five older Type 209-class submarines. Two '209/1100' units have been in service for over 52 years, while two '209/1200' units have nearly 45 years of operational history. The long-term strategy involves acquiring four new submarines to replace these aging vessels. The Hellenic Navy has expressed interest in several designs, including the German Type 209 1400 Mod, the French Scorpene Evolved and Barracuda, and the Swedish Saab A26. A key requirement is that these submarines be constructed in Greek shipyards to retain a portion of the investment within the national industry. The Minister of National Defense, Nikos Dendias, has proposed an armament package that includes acquiring four new submarines alongside the Papanikolis-class modernization initiative. The Naval Staff has received political approval to conduct market research and request bids for the new submarines, which will be introduced gradually over the next decade. The upgraded Okeanos (S-118) submarine is projected to remain in service for at least 15 more years. The Hellenic Navy’s plan is to complete the Papanikolis-class modernization program alongside the delivery of new submarines, resulting in a fleet of nine operational submarines, including the Okeanos.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/greece-to-announce-modernization-of-four-papanikolis-class-submarines-with-new-acquisitions-under-consideration	2025-03-13T01:36:52-07:00	
Belarus finalizes agreement allowing Russia to deploy Oreshnik ballistic missiles on its territory	According to WWW1.Ru on February 26, 2025, the lower house of the Belarusian parliament ratified a draft law approving the security treaty between Belarus and Russia within the framework of the Union State. The agreement, signed in Minsk on December 6, 2024, now requires approval from the upper house of parliament before being signed by President Alexander Lukashenko. The treaty formalizes security cooperation between the two nations and establishes mutual defense commitments, including military base arrangements for the Russian Federation on Belarusian territory.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Some reports suggest that the Oreshnik is derived from the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile program, which was previously discontinued. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The agreement coincides with discussions regarding the deployment of the Russian Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile system in Belarus. Alexei Polischuk, head of the second department of the CIS countries at the Russian Foreign Ministry, previously stated that deployment would follow the treaty’s ratification. The Oreshnik system, according to official Russian sources, has a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers, a speed of Mach 10 (12,400 km/h), and can carry a warhead weighing up to 1.5 tons. Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that no current missile defense systems are capable of intercepting the Oreshnik. During a December 6, 2024, meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State, Lukashenko requested the deployment of Oreshnik missiles in Belarus, citing security concerns related to NATO military activities in Poland and Lithuania. He stated that the missile system would serve as a deterrent and align with Belarus’s security policies. Putin responded that deployment could occur in the second half of 2025, depending on the pace of serial production. He specified that while the missiles would be integrated into Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Belarusian authorities would determine targeting parameters. The Oreshnik missile system was first used in combat on November 21, 2024, in a strike against a defense-related facility in Dnipro, Ukraine. The Russian government stated that this strike was in response to Ukraine’s authorization of long-range attacks inside Russian territory. Western defense officials, including those from Estonia and the United Kingdom, interpreted the missile launch as a strategic message rather than solely a tactical operation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that the timing of the strike was intended to influence U.S. policy under President Donald Trump’s administration. Belarusian officials maintain that security cooperation with Russia does not pose a threat to third countries. On February 26, 2025, Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov, speaking at the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, stated that the presence of Russian nuclear and conventional missile systems in Belarus was a defensive necessity. He referenced Belarus’s decision in the 1990s to relinquish its nuclear arsenal under the Budapest Memorandum and argued that Western security assurances had proven unreliable. Ryzhenkov emphasized that Russian Oreshnik missiles stationed in Belarus would serve a deterrent role in response to NATO military deployments in the region. Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin has stated that the deployment of Oreshnik and tactical nuclear weapons increases Belarus’s defense capabilities. He noted that the Belarusian Armed Forces are modernizing their equipment and strategy. While he did not specify the exact timeline for the missile system’s deployment, he confirmed that work in this direction was continuing. Russian officials describe the Oreshnik missile as a hypersonic system capable of penetrating defensive installations. The missile has been reported to deliver high-velocity impacts, with kinetic energy effects comparable to a nuclear strike without radiation consequences. According to Russian statements, multiple Oreshnik missiles launched in coordination could achieve destructive force similar to nuclear weapons. The possibility of Oreshnik deployment in Belarus has drawn international attention. Western analysts regard it as part of Russia’s broader strategy to exert pressure on NATO and Ukraine. U.S. intelligence assessments indicate that while Russia has started producing the missile, its full capabilities remain uncertain. Some reports suggest that the Oreshnik is derived from the RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile program, which was previously discontinued. Experts have noted concerns about the missile’s precision in conventional strikes, suggesting that it may be more suited for nuclear payloads. Domestically, Lukashenko has stated that Oreshnik deployment is necessary for national security and that Belarus should retain control over targeting decisions. Russian officials have framed the deployment as fulfilling security obligations under the Union State agreement. The finalization of the treaty and the potential deployment of the Oreshnik missile system in Belarus are expected to remain key issues in regional security discussions throughout 2025.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/belarus-finalizes-agreement-allowing-russia-to-deploy-oreshnik-ballistic-missiles-on-its-territory	2025-03-13T00:59:04-07:00

Volkswagen Ready to Enter Military Production Exploring Defense Equipment Supply	According to information reported by The Telegraph on March 11, 2025, Volkswagen is considering entering the production of military equipment for the German army, marking a potential diversification of its activities amid Europe's rearmament efforts. This statement comes from Oliver Blume, CEO of Europe’s largest car manufacturer, who stated that the company is open to exploring new concepts but has not yet received concrete proposals from potential partners. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg (Picture source: WikiCommons) This development coincides with Germany’s efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities, driven by concerns over a possible disengagement of the United States under President Donald Trump. Uncertainty about U.S. commitments is prompting Europe to bolster its defense industry, with increased investments and industrial restructuring. Several manufacturers, including Rheinmetall and KNDS Group, have already begun converting their automotive component production facilities to manufacture military equipment in response to growing demand. According to economic analysts, German car factories currently have surplus capacity due to a sharp decline in vehicle exports, which have halved from pre-pandemic levels. This drop is partly due to increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers, now the world’s leading car exporters, as well as a European market shifting toward electrification, which is reshaping traditional automotive production. In Germany, annual vehicle exports have fallen from 2.4 million to around 1.2 million units, forcing manufacturers to rethink their economic model. Asked about Volkswagen’s potential involvement in military equipment production, Oliver Blume emphasized the need for increased security investments in Europe. He clarified that no concrete steps had been taken so far but did not rule out the possibility of Volkswagen playing a role in the sector. He noted that the group has extensive expertise in the automotive industry and could provide consulting and technological support if needed, without immediately committing its production facilities. Rising demand for defense equipment has already had a significant impact on financial markets, with strong stock growth among German defense companies expanding their production capacity. Some automotive factories, initially designed for internal combustion engine production or light vehicle components, are now being converted to meet military sector needs. The industrial flexibility of these facilities could enable rapid adaptation to new defense market requirements, particularly for armored vehicles or aerospace components. Oliver Blume’s statements come as Volkswagen reports a 15% drop in profit, totaling €19.1 billion in 2024 compared to €22.5 billion the previous year. The company is facing challenges related to its transition to electric vehicles, which requires significant investment in new technologies, as well as the impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on vehicles manufactured in Canada and Mexico. To remain competitive against Chinese manufacturers, Volkswagen has launched a major restructuring plan that includes cutting 35,000 jobs, reducing costs, and optimizing production lines. This potential diversification into the defense sector could present a strategic opportunity for the company. In addition to strengthening Germany’s and Europe’s defense capabilities, it could help Volkswagen offset losses in the traditional automotive market. However, the company remains cautious and is waiting for initiatives from the defense sector before committing further to this direction. The evolution of the geopolitical situation and the policies of European governments will be key factors in shaping this industrial strategy.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/volkswagen-ready-to-enter-military-production-exploring-defense-equipment-supply	2025-03-12T08:16:09-07:00

The Leopard 2A5, on the other hand, is equipped with the renowned 'Chobham' armor, providing excellent protection, but the K2’s overall protection system is seen as superior in terms of active defense measures. The K2's sophisticated suspension system and powerful engine provide exceptional mobility, even in rough terrain, allowing it to operate effectively across Poland's diverse landscape. It is also equipped with state-of-the-art battlefield management systems, digital fire control, and an advanced crew comfort system, ensuring maximum efficiency in operational environments. The T-72 and PT-91, while functional, are somewhat outdated in terms of electronics and suspension systems. The Leopard 2A5 and 2A4 offer robust mobility but are not as agile as the K2 in specific conditions, particularly in terms of operational ease and advanced sensors. Poland’s ongoing acquisition of the K2 tanks is part of a broader strategy to modernize its armed forces, particularly its armored corps, and to prepare for future defense challenges. Poland has made it clear that it intends to significantly increase its tank strength over the coming years, with the goal of positioning itself as one of the most powerful armored forces in Europe. In addition to the K2, Poland has also been negotiating contracts for the K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers and FA-50 fighter jets from South Korea, further expanding its defense capabilities in line with NATO requirements. This strategy is closely aligned with the modernization of Poland’s defense infrastructure and its desire to build a rapid-response military capable of addressing potential threats along its eastern border. The goal of Poland is not only to replace outdated Soviet-era equipment but to position itself as a key military power in the region, capable of quickly mobilizing and deploying advanced armored units in the event of a crisis. With the K2 Black Panther tanks, Poland is taking a significant step toward achieving this ambitious objective, setting the stage for a more agile, modern, and lethal military in the near future. As Poland continues to receive deliveries of the K2, the country is expected to complete the integration of the full 180-unit order over the next few years, ensuring that its tank fleet remains at the forefront of military technology and readiness. Furthermore, discussions are ongoing to expand this number to 1,000 tanks potentially, securing Poland's place as a dominant armored force in Europe for decades to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-receives-new-batch-of-12-south-korean-k2-tanks-aiming-to-become-europes-leading-tank-power	2025-03-12T07:25:29-07:00

The programme includes the planned acquisition of 80 to 98 self-propelled 155mm howitzers to replace the 33 US-made M777 towed systems currently in service, while the 121 towed 105mm howitzers, including C3 and LG1 Mk II models, will remain in reserve units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Indirect Fires Modernisation (IFM) program includes the planned acquisition of 80 to 98 self-propelled 155mm howitzers to replace the 33 US-made M777 towed systems currently in service. (Picture source: Canadian Armed Forces) A request for information has been issued to define preliminary requirements and assess available options for procurement. The request for information process remains open, with a closing date in April 2025. Companies such as Glooscap Defence, Intermat Group SA, M2K Industrial, Tactiql, and Patriot Forge Co. have already expressed interest in participating in the programme through partnerships. The ongoing trade conflict between Canada and the United States raises concerns about its potential impact on Canada's defense sector, particularly regarding the procurement of U.S.-made defense equipment. The heightened tensions may prompt Canada to reassess its defense procurement strategies, possibly seeking to reduce reliance on U.S. defense equipment, such as the M777, and explore alternative partnerships to safeguard its national security interests, especially given Donald Trump's often-expressed desire to make Canada the 51st U.S. state. In addition to self-propelled howitzers, the Indirect Fires Modernisation (IFM) programme includes plans to procure up to 99 120mm mortars integrated with LAV 6.0 ACSV wheeled armoured vehicles and up to 85 81mm mortars mounted on an unspecified light tactical vehicle. An alternative option under review is the exclusive procurement of 81mm mortars, with the potential acquisition of up to 133 units to replace the 218 older L16 81mm mortars currently in service. The programme also includes a range of support vehicles, such as ammunition carriers, command vehicles, and reconnaissance platforms. These elements may be procured through separate contracts. Additionally, the scope of the programme covers fire control systems, communication systems, simulators, training infrastructure, ammunition certification, and logistics support to ensure operational readiness and sustainment of new artillery systems. The Indirect Fires Modernisation (IFM) programme is identified as a priority within the Canadian Army’s broader modernisation efforts.

These simulations, developed using Python with the SimPy package, assessed the operational effectiveness of indirect fire systems, including 81mm and 120mm mortars, M777 lightweight towed howitzers, and rocket artillery. Data collected from workshops with subject matter experts have been used to refine the model, focusing on weapon system specifications, ammunition consumption, and mission success probabilities under different threat scenarios. While full funding for the IFM programme has not yet been secured, it has been identified as the second-highest procurement priority for the Canadian Army, following the Ground-Based Air Defence (GBAD) programme. The Chief of the Canadian Army has highlighted the indirect fires capability gap as a critical issue, and efforts are ongoing to finalise funding recommendations. A statement of capability deficiency has been drafted to address operational gaps, particularly in relation to Canada’s commitments under Operation Reassurance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/canada-accelerates-its-efforts-to-replace-us-made-m777-howitzers-with-modern-self-propelled-alternatives	2025-03-12T04:45:27-07:00	
Russia confirms ongoing discussions with African nations on Typhoon-PVO air defense vehicle procurement	As reported by TASS on February 20, 2025, the Russian Typhoon-PVO air defense vehicle has drawn interest from African nations, according to Vyacheslav Dzirkaln, Deputy General Director of the Almaz-Antey Air Defense Concern. Speaking at the IDEX-2025 defense exhibition in Abu Dhabi, he stated that African countries are assessing this system for deployment in localized conflicts where large-scale air threats, such as cruise missiles and modern aviation, are not the primary operational concern.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Typhoon-PVO carries nine MANPADS, including the Verba system, which can intercept targets moving at up to 420 m/s within an engagement range of 500 to 6,000 meters and a maximum altitude of 3.2 kilometers. (Picture source: OPKRF) The Typhoon-PVO was developed in response to the requirement for a vehicle capable of improving the mobility and protection of MANPADS (Man-Portable Air Defense Systems) operators. Previously, such teams relied on standard military trucks or armored personnel carriers, which lacked features specifically designed for air defense operations. The project was initiated by the Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant 'Kupol' with support from the Almaz-Antey group. The vehicle is based on the KamAZ-4386 chassis, a variant of the Typhoon-VDV platform designed for airborne forces. The chassis was selected due to its armored protection, mobility, and capability to be adapted for multiple operational roles. The Typhoon-PVO has been presented at multiple defense exhibitions, including Aero India 2025 and the World Defense Show 2024 in Saudi Arabia. It has also undergone practical assessments, including two early prototypes participating in China’s 2019 Clear Sky competition, a 9.5-kilometer obstacle course with 12 obstacles, including slalom sections, a water crossing, and simulated urban and mountainous terrain. Russian crews completed the course in 43 minutes and 30 seconds while engaging airborne and ground targets, finishing in second place. Additionally, four Typhoon-PVO units were included in the 2021 Victory Day Parade in Moscow, indicating its integration into Russia’s armed forces. The Typhoon-PVO is operated by a five-person crew, consisting of a commander, driver, machine gunner, and two anti-aircraft gunners. The vehicle carries nine MANPADS, including the Verba system, which can intercept targets moving at up to 420 m/s within an engagement range of 500 to 6,000 meters and a maximum altitude of 3.2 kilometers. It can receive targeting data from higher-echelon command posts and be integrated into multi-layered air defense networks alongside systems such as the Tor-M2. This integration enables the Typhoon-PVO to utilize radar data from the Tor-M2 while engaging targets with its MANPADS and onboard 12.7mm Kord machine gun. Depending on its configuration, the Typhoon-PVO can also be used as a command vehicle in conjunction with the Tor-M2 system. The machine gun is turret-mounted and can be fired while the vehicle is in motion, with operational fire capability maintained at speeds of up to 20 km/h. Two roof hatches allow the machine gunner and a MANPADS operator to engage targets while remaining inside the armored hull.

South Korea Offers Submarines to Canada as Relations with Washington Deteriorate	As Canada reassesses its strategic partnerships, South Korea is positioning itself as a reliable defense supplier capable of delivering advanced military equipment efficiently. A recent visit by a South Korean delegation to Ottawa highlights this initiative at a time when political instability in the United States is prompting several allies to diversify their sources of military procurement, as reported by the Ottawa Citizen on March 10, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A key element of this proposal is the KSS-III, a next-generation submarine developed by Hanwha Ocean (Picture source: ROK Navy) A group of twelve representatives from South Korea’s defense industry and government met with Canadian officials on March 5 and 6 to promote a range of military systems, including howitzers, training aircraft, rocket launchers, and submarines. The offer includes commitments to support Canadian industry by establishing local maintenance facilities and providing full access to onboard technology, an advantage that U.S. suppliers do not always guarantee their partners. A key element of this proposal is the KSS-III, a next-generation submarine developed by Hanwha Ocean. According to retired South Korean Admiral Steve Jeong, now vice president of the company, the platform aligns with the requirements of the Canadian Armed Forces. He emphasized that three units are already in service, and that South Korea could deliver a submarine within six years of signing a contract. With the capability to remain submerged for over three weeks without surfing and a range exceeding 7,000 nautical miles, the KSS-III is particularly suited for Arctic operations. South Korea is becoming an increasingly prominent player in the global arms market. Its defense exports have grown significantly in recent years, particularly in Europe, where several countries are seeking to reduce their reliance on the United States. Poland has signed a contract worth over $10 billion for South Korean tanks, self-propelled howitzers, light aircraft, and missile systems, while Romania has secured a $1 billion deal for howitzers. These agreements include provisions for local production, supporting job creation and industrial cooperation. The growth of South Korea’s defense industry is partly driven by past challenges with US suppliers. According to Jeong, South Korea previously faced rising costs and technological dependence that limited its autonomy. In response, the country developed its own defense systems, enabling it to provide NATO-compatible equipment while avoiding certain restrictions associated with U.S. exports. This shift comes at a time when Canada is increasingly scrutinizing its dependence on U.S. technology. The F-35 fighter jets ordered for $19 billion remain under American control in terms of software and hardware updates. Similarly, the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) warship program, which could cost up to $80 billion, incorporates key systems controlled by the United States, potentially restricting Canada’s operational sovereignty over its own naval fleet. Despite these concerns, the Canadian government has maintained its procurement strategy with the US, signing nearly $30 billion in military equipment contracts in 2023, including an $8 billion agreement with Boeing for surveillance aircraft and a $2.5 billion deal for drones. This approach aimed to address American criticism over Canada’s defense spending levels but has not prevented the Trump administration from increasing pressure on Ottawa. The issue of military and economic integration with the U.S. remains a divisive topic among Canadian policymakers and defense experts. Some former high-ranking officials, such as General Rick Hillier, advocate for closer ties with Washington, while others, like retired Vice Admiral Mark Norman, warn against excessive reliance and have suggested economic countermeasures in response to U.S. pressures. Against this backdrop, South Korea’s proposal aligns with a broader trend in which U.S. allies are exploring alternative defense suppliers. If Canada seriously considers this offer, it could mark a shift in its procurement policy, favoring partners that provide competitive and technologically accessible solutions without imposing excessive restrictions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/south-korea-offers-submarines-to-canada-as-relations-with-washington-deteriorate	2025-03-11T01:52:48-07:00	
Tenth Russian Project 12700 Alexandrit-class minesweeper Polyarny approaches the final construction phase	On March 9, 2025, the Telegram channel Military Russia shared an image of the tenth hull of the Project 12700 minesweeper, named Polyarny, indicating that the vessel is approaching the final stages of its construction at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard (SNSZ) in Saint Petersburg. This development is part of the ongoing expansion of Russia’s mine countermeasure fleet under the Alexandrit-class program, as initial plans called for the construction of ten ships, but later statements mentioned a total of up to 40 units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The classification of the Project 12700 has changed multiple times, alternating between base and sea minesweepers, though the Polyarny is officially designated as a base minesweeper, as indicated on its keel-laying plaque. (Picture source: Telegram/MilitaryRussia) The Polyarny was laid down on June 12, 2022, following a contract signed by the Russian Ministry of Defense on August 25, 2021, during the Army-2021 International Military-Technical Forum. The ship, designated with factory number 530, is intended for service with the Northern Fleet. Project 12700 ships are designed for mine countermeasure operations in both coastal and deep-sea environments. The classification of these ships has changed multiple times, alternating between base and sea minesweepers, though the Polyarny is officially designated as a base minesweeper, as indicated on its keel-laying plaque. The Project 12700, known as the Alexandrit-class, was developed by the Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau to modernize the Russian Navy’s mine countermeasure capabilities. The lead ship, named Aleksandr Obukhov, was laid down in 2011 and entered service in 2016. The project was initiated to replace aging Soviet-era minesweepers from the Gorya and Sonya classes with vessels utilizing composite materials and updated mine-hunting technology. Initial plans under the State Armament Program for 2018–2027 called for the construction of ten ships, but later statements mentioned a total of up to 40 units. A primary feature of the Alexandrit-class is its monolithic fiberglass hull, produced using vacuum infusion technology. The SNSZ is the only shipyard in Russia with this capability and the only one globally capable of producing monolithic hulls up to 80 meters in length. This construction method reduces the vessel’s magnetic signature, improving survivability against magnetic mines, while also providing higher structural strength compared to steel hulls. The fiberglass composition increases service life beyond that of low-magnetic steel hulls while reducing overall weight. The shipyard implemented advanced equipment and software to develop this technology. This construction method reduces the vessel’s magnetic signature, which improves survivability against magnetic mines. The composite hull also provides resistance to corrosion and extends its operational lifespan compared to traditional steel-hulled designs. The propulsion system consists of two 42-cylinder, star-configured Zvezda M503B-1 diesel engines, each producing 2,500 horsepower, supported by two ADGR-315/1500 OM4 diesel generators (315 kW each) and two DGF2A 200/1500 diesel generators (200 kW each). The ships are also equipped with two bow thrusters (PU-100F) and two stern retractable azimuth thrusters (VPK-90F/70), providing high maneuverability. The maximum speed is 16.5 knots, with an operational range of 1,600 nautical miles at 10 knots. The Alexandrit-class is equipped with a range of mine countermeasure systems, including the Livadia-M mine detection sonar, the Pall-N navigation radar, and the Ruberoid communications suite. The mine countermeasure system integrates high-performance hydroacoustic stations, deployed both onboard and via remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles, for mine detection and neutralization in coastal and deep-sea environments. The ships also feature an integrated bridge system and an automated mine countermeasure control system, allowing centralized management of all detection and neutralization operations. Defensive armament includes a six-barrel 30mm AK-306 close-in weapon system, a 14.5mm MTPU heavy machine gun mount, and eight man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), either the 9K38 Igla or the 9K333 Verba. The Aleksandr Obukhov (n°507), the lead ship of the Alexandrit-class (which became the most numerous type of sea minesweeper in service within the Russian Navy), was commissioned on December 9, 2016, and assigned to the Baltic Fleet. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The ships have a standard displacement of 620 tons, increasing to 890 tons at full load. They measure 61 meters in length, with a beam of 10.2 meters and a draft of 2.68 meters. Their maximum speed is 16.5 knots, with an operational range of 1,600 nautical miles at 10 knots. These vessels are designed for ten-day missions without resupply and have a crew complement of 45. Mine countermeasure capabilities are supported by unmanned mine-hunting systems, including the Skanda unmanned surface vehicle and the Alexandrit-ISPUM mine disposal system. The ships also retain the capability to operate traditional sweeping equipment, as well as using the Orlan-10 UAV. The onboard electronic suite features the Diez automated control system, the Anapa sonar, the Struktura-35 mine detection sonar, and the Altyn-M integrated sonar system for underwater navigation and detection. Production of the Alexandrit-class is centralized at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard, the sole facility currently manufacturing these vessels. Early production faced delays, particularly with diesel engine procurement from Zvezda, but shipbuilding capacity has since increased. While there were considerations to expand production to the Amur Shipyard, all orders remain with SNSZ. In 2021, official statements indicated that an additional ten ships were under consideration following the initial production run. Several ships from this class have been delivered to different Russian fleets, becoming the most numerous type of sea minesweeper in service within the Russian Navy. The Aleksandr Obukhov (n°507), the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on December 9, 2016, and assigned to the Baltic Fleet. For its part, the Black Sea Fleet operates the Ivan Antonov (460), commissioned on January 26, 2019, the Vladimir Yemelyanov (466), commissioned on December 28, 2019, and the Georgiy Kurbatov (464), which entered service on August 20, 2021. The Pacific Fleet has received the Yakov Balyaev (701), commissioned on December 26, 2020, the Pyotr Ilyichev (721), which entered service on November 16, 2022, and the Anatoly Shlemov (757), delivered on December 29, 2022. The most recently delivered unit, the Lev Chernavin (660), was assigned to the Baltic Fleet on December 25, 2023. Additional ships are currently in various stages of construction. The Afanasy Ivannikov (hull n°529), which was laid down on September 9, 2021, was launched on August 9, 2024, and is expected to enter service in 2025. The Polyarny (530), laid down on June 12, 2022, is nearing the final stages of construction and is also planned for commissioning in 2025. The Dmitry Lysov (531), laid down on June 19, 2023, and the Semyon Agafonov (532), laid down on January 18, 2024, are still under construction, with expected service entry in 2026 and 2027, respectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/tenth-russian-project-12700-alexandrit-class-minesweeper-polyarny-approaches-the-final-construction-phase	2025-03-11T01:48:31-07:00

The HQ-17AE is a short-range surface-to-air weapon system designed to operate in all weather conditions and capable of intercepting targets flying at low and medium altitude. Developed by the Second Academy of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), it is an export version of the HQ-17A, itself derived from the Russian Tor system. Like all members of the HQ-17 family, the HQ-17AE is primarily intended to counter SHORAD ('Short-Range Air Defense') threats such as aircraft, helicopters, and drones, as well as precision-guided munitions (guided bombs, cruise missiles, and air-to-surface missiles). Chinese official sources indicate that it can also engage more challenging targets such as stealth aircraft, supersonic cruise missiles, and certain types of rockets. The HQ-17 range includes multiple variants: tracked versions (HQ-17) and 6×6 wheeled versions (HQ-17A), both operated by the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force, as well as an export version called the FM-2000, revealed for the first time at the 2018 Airshow China defense exhibition. It remains unclear whether the HQ-17AE is simply a new designation for the FM-2000 or whether it is a distinct variant featuring a launcher-radar vehicle more closely aligned with the HQ-17A. In any case, the difference between the HQ-17A and the FM-2000 mainly lies in the 6×6 chassis, although both systems use the same firing turret. In addition to Tajikistan, the HQ-17 series has been exported to countries including Serbia and Saudi Arabia, reflecting China’s growing footprint in the global defense market. This acquisition is part of a broader regional trend: neighboring Uzbekistan has also procured Chinese-made air defense systems such as the FM-90 and the KS-1C. By adding the HQ-17AE to its arsenal, Tajikistan signals a shift toward Chinese defense technology to strengthen its national security and enhance its overall deterrence posture.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/tajikistan-debuts-chinese-made-hq-17ae-air-defense-system-during-armed-forces-anniversary-parade	2025-03-11T01:28:50-07:00	
Czech Republic Conducts Tests on Caesar 8x8 Self-Propelled Howitzer in France Ahead of Military Integration	The Czech Republic is advancing its artillery modernization with the first tests of the Caesar 8x8 self-propelled howitzer in France.

Europe Strengthens Air Defense with Massive Aster Missile Order from France Italy and UK	France, the United Kingdom, and Italy are set to announce a new strategic order for nearly 220 Aster 15 and 30 missiles, as reported by La Tribune. This acquisition, to be officially confirmed early next week by the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), aims to enhance the missile defense capabilities of the three nations while reinforcing European industrial sovereignty in this critical sector. The contract, awarded to the industrial consortium Eurosam, reflects European efforts to address evolving aerial threats, including next-generation fighter aircraft, hypersonic missiles, and long-range armed drones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles form the backbone of air and missile defense systems for several European nations, equipping both naval and ground-based platforms (Picture source: OCCAR) The contract has been granted to Eurosam, a Franco-Italian economic interest group (GIE) comprising MBDA France, MBDA Italy, and Thales, key companies in the European defense industry. This longstanding partnership plays a major role in the development of naval and land-based air defense capabilities through widely deployed and proven systems. Beyond this latest order, Paris, London, and Rome have emphasized the need to accelerate production and delivery schedules, not only for these additional missiles but also for previously contracted units. The objective is to ensure the timely availability of Aster missiles for their respective armed forces, addressing operational readiness requirements in a geopolitical context marked by increasing military tensions. The Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles form the backbone of air and missile defense systems for several European nations, equipping both naval and ground-based platforms. Designed to provide effective protection against a broad range of aerial threats, they are integrated into key defense systems, including PAAMS (Principal Anti-Air Missile System), which is deployed on the UK Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers, the French and Italian Horizon frigates, and the SAMP/T system used by the French and Italian armies. The Aster 15, developed for short- to medium-range air defense, reaches speeds of Mach 3 and has an interception range exceeding 30 km, making it well-suited for countering multiple and simultaneous threats. The Aster 30 is designed for long-range engagements, with an operational range exceeding 120 km and a speed of Mach 4.5, enabling it to intercept short-range ballistic missiles and maneuver aerial threats. The missiles employ an advanced guidance system integrating an active radio frequency (RF) seeker and inertial navigation, ensuring high-precision target tracking. Their maneuverability is enhanced by a hybrid control system combining aerodynamic surfaces with thrust vector control, known as PIF-PAF, which enables rapid trajectory corrections. This design ensures a high interception success rate, even against supersonic targets executing complex evasive maneuvers. Due to these capabilities, Aster missiles are effective against a wide range of threats, including stealth aircraft, low-flying cruise missiles, and short-range ballistic missiles. With growing international tensions and the emergence of new threats, Aster missile production capacity has become a strategic concern. In December 2022, France and Italy had already placed an order with Eurosam for nearly 700 Aster missiles, highlighting the program’s significance for European armed forces. The current priority is to shorten production times and expand industrial capacity to meet operational requirements more effectively. MBDA, a key industry player, has set an objective to reduce production time significantly. In 2022, the average production time for an Aster missile was 42 months, but the goal is to bring this down to under 18 months by 2026. To achieve this, MBDA and its partners are implementing an industrial optimization strategy, including facility expansions and automation of certain manufacturing stages. The Selles-Saint-Denis site, which plays a key role in final assembly and missile integration, is undergoing investment initiatives to enhance production capacity and ensure a steady increase in output. The acceleration of deliveries and increased production capacity align with broader European efforts to strengthen strategic autonomy. As asymmetric and conventional threats continue to evolve, ensuring a secure and independent supply of essential defense systems is becoming a priority for European nations. This joint order reflects the commitment of Paris, London, and Rome to maintaining interoperability among their armed forces while reducing reliance on non-European suppliers. By modernizing industrial infrastructure and optimizing manufacturing processes, Europe is positioning itself as a key player in next-generation defense systems. This strategy extends beyond the Aster missile program and is part of a broader effort to enhance collective defense capabilities, including initiatives such as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) and new missile defense programs within NATO and the European Union. The official confirmation of this order for more than 200 Aster missiles marks a new step in strengthening European air defense capabilities. By reinforcing industrial cooperation and accelerating the deployment of these critical systems, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy aim to enhance the protection of their strategic assets and military units. In a constantly evolving security landscape, this initiative underscores the importance of a proactive approach to addressing modern air defense challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/europe-strengthens-air-defense-with-massive-aster-missile-order-from-france-italy-and-uk	2025-03-10T07:39:24-07:00	
North Korea Builds Two New Frigates Simultaneously as It Expands Naval Capabilities with Russian Assistance	North Korea is undergoing an unprecedented modernization of its naval fleet with the simultaneous construction of two distinct frigates at the Nampo shipyard. These new surface vessels mark a strategic shift in Pyongyang’s maritime doctrine, aimed at strengthening its power projection and defense capabilities in response to regional threats. During an inspection visit on March 8, 2025, Kim Jong-Un reviewed the progress of these projects and reaffirmed the importance of naval power in national defense, emphasizing the need for a fleet capable of operating under modern naval warfare conditions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images released by state media show two ships under construction, each in a different section of the shipyard (Picture source: KCNA) Images released by state media show two ships under construction, each in a different section of the shipyard. The first, which appears to be at an advanced stage, features a large superstructure with a design seemingly intended to reduce radar signature. It is expected to integrate modern systems, including a fixed-panel radar, a configuration not previously seen in the North Korean Navy, and a vertical launching system (VLS) capable of deploying both cruise missiles and advanced guided surface-to-air missiles. With an estimated displacement of over 3,000 tons, this frigate would be the largest surface combatant ever built by North Korea. Its design suggests an effort to align with the technological standards of more developed navies while enhancing the country's blue-water capabilities. The second frigate, still under construction in another hall of the same shipyard, appears to be part of a separate program. The installation of a new clad structure in this section, identified by analysts in the previous year, indicates that construction on this vessel has recently accelerated. Its design and configuration are less advanced than those of the first ship, suggesting that it may be a more conventional variant, likely designed for patrol and coastal defense missions. However, it also incorporates modernized elements, reflecting a broader effort to enhance the North Korean surface fleet. This ambitious naval program is part of a wider modernization initiative, which also includes the construction of a 7,000-ton nuclear-powered strategic submarine. Currently being assembled at Sinpo South, this submarine is expected to carry up to ten ballistic missiles, providing Pyongyang with a more difficult-to-detect underwater strike capability. The commissioning of this submarine would significantly strengthen the country's nuclear deterrence strategy and mark a turning point in its submarine capabilities. The simultaneous acceleration of these naval projects is partly attributed to growing cooperation with Russia. Historically, North Korea has received technological transfers from China and the former Soviet Union to develop its naval capabilities. Today, presumed Russian involvement in these projects could explain the rapid integration of advanced technologies, particularly the VLS and modern radar systems. This development suggests an intensification of ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, reinforcing North Korea’s navy amid rising geopolitical tensions. Currently, the Korean People’s Navy relies primarily on an aging fleet dominated by Najin- and Nampo-class frigates. The Najin-class frigates, introduced in the 1970s, have undergone partial modernizations, including the integration of Kh-35 anti-ship missiles on certain units. However, with a displacement of around 1,500 tons, these ships exhibit clear technological limitations against modern threats. The Nampo-class frigates, more recent but produced in limited numbers, remain largely undocumented due to the secrecy surrounding North Korea’s naval programs. In comparison, the new frigates under construction represent a significant technological leap, enhancing the country's ability to conduct more effective naval operations. Alongside these developments, North Korea has also integrated a modernized frigate into its fleet, Patrol Ship No. 661, part of the Amnok-class. This vessel, among the most advanced in the North Korean Navy, features a design inspired by foreign models and a diversified weapons system. It is equipped with eight anti-ship missiles, six short-range surface-to-air missiles, a 76mm naval gun, two rapid-fire anti-aircraft systems, and anti-submarine rocket launchers, providing North Korea with improved maritime and coastal operational capabilities. The commissioning of this frigate coincided with North Korea’s participation in Russia’s 'Ocean-2024' naval exercises, an event that marked the country's first such involvement and highlighted a growing military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang. The simultaneous development of these frigates and the strategic nuclear submarine comes at a time of rising regional tensions, particularly with the United States and South Korea increasing their joint military exercises. Ahead of the Freedom Shield drills, North Korea appears to be signaling its ability to modernize its navy despite international sanctions and diplomatic pressures. This accelerated naval modernization marks a break from Pyongyang’s traditional military doctrine, which has historically focused on land-based and submarine deterrence. The commissioning of these new warships represents a major transformation for the Korean People’s Navy, which has long been limited to asymmetric and coastal operations but now appears to be shifting towards a broader enhancement of its blue-water capabilities. With these frigates and its submarine program, North Korea is moving beyond a purely defensive posture to establish a more diverse and sophisticated naval fleet. This evolution, combined with technical and strategic support from Russia, could alter the regional naval balance and force the United States and South Korea to reassess their maritime defense and presence strategies.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/north-korea-builds-two-new-frigates-simultaneously-as-it-expands-naval-capabilities-with-russian-assistance	2025-03-10T06:45:06-07:00	
Poland Releases Video of First Successful CGR-080 Missile Launch from Homar-K MLRS	Poland has released a video of the first successful launch of the CGR-080 guided missile from the Homar-K system, shared on X by defense analyst Haku Mason. While the announcement of this launch was made on December 7, 2024, this is the first time footage of the event has been made public, providing a concrete illustration of the system’s capabilities and the extended range of this new-generation munition. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from the video of Poland's first successful launch of the CGR-080 guided missile from the Homar-K system. (Picture source: Haku Mason X Channel) The Homar-K system is a Polish adaptation of the South Korean K239 Chunmoo multiple-launch rocket system, integrating advanced South Korean technologies onto a Polish Jelcz 8x8 truck chassis and combined with the Topaz fire control system. This configuration provides Poland with a mobile, modular platform adapted to modern conflict requirements. The partnership between Hanwha Aerospace and Poland’s defense industry has resulted in a hybrid solution combining South Korean expertise in rocket artillery systems with local industrial capabilities. In addition to the CGR-080, Poland already operates the CTM-290 tactical ballistic missile and may eventually integrate long-range missiles such as the CTM-MR (formerly CTM-160) and KTSSM-II, further enhancing its long-range strike capabilities and deterrence potential. The CGR-080 is a guided missile utilizing GPS/INS (Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System) technology, ensuring high accuracy with an operational range of 30 to 80 kilometers and a Circular Error probability (CEP) of just 15 meters. Its explosive warhead is designed to effectively neutralize a variety of targets, including military infrastructure, lightly armored vehicles, and fortified positions. Unlike traditional unguided rockets, the CGR-080 provides precision strike capability, reducing collateral damage and improving the effectiveness of targeted bombardment, particularly in urban or complex environments. Compared to similar systems, the Homar-K equipped with the CGR-080 exceeds the performance of the U.S. HIMARS system armed with the M31 GMLRS missile, which has a maximum range of 70 kilometers. This increased range allows Polish forces to engage targets at greater distances while remaining beyond the reach of enemy counter-battery systems. The extended range, combined with the modularity of the Homar-K, provides greater operational flexibility and an enhanced deterrence capability on the battlefield while maintaining interoperability with allied artillery systems. A key advantage of the Homar-K system is its ability to fire a wide range of munitions, increasing its adaptability for various mission types. In addition to the CGR-080, it is compatible with the CTM-MR guided missile, which has a range of 50 to 160 kilometers and a penetration-fragmentation warhead designed for destroying fortified positions and strategic infrastructure. The CTM-290 missile can strike targets up to 290 kilometers away, further extending the Polish military’s deep-strike capability. The Homar-K can also deploy a guided anti-ship missile equipped with GPS/INS/IIR (Imaging Infrared) guidance, capable of engaging naval targets at ranges between 50 and 160 kilometers, enabling operations across multiple theaters. The success of this first CGR-080 launch demonstrates the increasing operational proficiency of Polish artillery crews in handling advanced systems. The K239 Chunmoo, from which the Homar-K is derived, is currently the second most-produced modern multiple launch rocket system globally after U.S. systems and is in service in significant numbers in South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Poland, and Saudi Arabia. Hanwha Aerospace, Poland’s partner in this project, has demonstrated its ability to provide solutions tailored to local requirements by integrating its systems with national components. The successful integration of the CGR-080 missile could also pave the way for the Homar-K system’s export to other countries, including Norway, the Philippines, and Malaysia, which may be interested in a multiple-launch rocket system offering modularity and compatibility with advanced munitions. This development strengthens the international appeal of the Homar-K program and could mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation between Poland and other strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/poland-releases-video-of-first-successful-cgr-080-missile-launch-from-homar-k-mlrs	2025-03-10T05:48:22-07:00

ASELSAN Develops Advanced Laser Defense with Mobile GÖKBERK System to Counter Growing Drone Threat	On March 10, 2025, ASELSAN confirmed the effectiveness of its GÖKBERK mobile laser weapon system during recent tests. The system demonstrated its ability to detect, automatically track and neutralize FPV drones, which have become an increasing threat in modern conflicts. Across different operational scenarios, GÖKBERK proved its rapid engagement time and high precision, key characteristics for its integration into Türkiye’s national air defense system, Steel Dome. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In this context, ASELSAN has developed GÖKBERK, a mobile laser system designed to eliminate small and medium-sized drones (Picture source: Aselsan) Recent conflicts have highlighted the effectiveness of low-cost drones, particularly kamikaze and FPV models, used by both conventional armies and non-state actors. In Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa, these systems have shown their ability to bypass traditional air defense systems and inflict significant damage on ground forces and critical infrastructure. In response to these emerging threats, several countries are investing in modernizing their air defense systems by incorporating technologies capable of engaging small, low-signature targets quickly. The adoption of laser weapons is driven by several factors: their significantly lower engagement cost compared to traditional missiles, near-instantaneous response time, and the ability to operate continuously without the need for ammunition resupply. These characteristics position directed energy weapons as a strategic solution for protecting military bases, command centers, airports, and other sensitive infrastructure. In this context, ASELSAN has developed GÖKBERK, a mobile laser system designed to eliminate small and medium-sized drones. Its effectiveness was recently demonstrated in tests where it successfully neutralized FPV drones in various operational scenarios. Designed as a key component of Türkiye’s Steel Dome air defense system, GÖKBERK is distinguished by its ability to respond swiftly to threats with optimized targeting precision.

Its guidance system, enhanced by artificial intelligence algorithms, maximizes targeting efficiency based on operational conditions. GÖKBERK operates with a dual-threat neutralization capability. It can conduct physical destruction of targets through its high-power laser, providing an immediate 'hard kill' effect against detected drones. Additionally, it features an electronic disruption capability via ASELSAN’s Kangal jammer, which interferes with enemy drone communications and sensors, rendering them inoperative through a 'soft kill' approach. This combination enables it to address a broad spectrum of threats, ranging from kamikaze drones to mini-UAVs equipped with explosive payloads. The system has been designed for high operational autonomy. With its advanced cooling technology, GÖKBERK can function continuously without performance degradation, making it particularly suited for prolonged use in the defense of fixed sites such as military bases, power plants, ports, and oil refineries. Unlike conventional defense systems that require ammunition replenishment, GÖKBERK offers a near-unlimited firing capacity, making it a cost-effective solution for armed forces. Additionally, its modular architecture allows for future upgrades, including increased laser power and integration into broader networked defense systems. ASELSAN continues to refine the system by analyzing test data collected under various weather conditions to further enhance its capabilities. Investment in directed energy weapons reflects a strategic shift in how airborne threats are addressed by defense industries. Traditional systems, relying on missiles and anti-aircraft guns, while still relevant, face limitations in countering swarms of low-cost drones and mass drone attacks. As a result, states are seeking more flexible solutions capable of engaging multiple targets quickly and at lower costs. Similar projects to GÖKBERK are also being developed in the United States, Europe, and Asia, where multiple laser weapon programs are underway for integration into land, naval, and aerial platforms. Türkiye, through ASELSAN, aims to strengthen its strategic autonomy and develop advanced solutions in the field of counter-drone defense. GÖKBERK aligns with a global trend of leveraging laser technologies to counter the rapid evolution of asymmetric threats. By combining electronic disruption and physical destruction capabilities, ASELSAN provides a comprehensive solution for securing strategic sites and enhancing force protection. As testing continues and further improvements are planned, the GÖKBERK system represents a significant step toward a new generation of directed energy-based counter-drone systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/aselsan-develops-advanced-laser-defense-with-mobile-goekberk-system-to-counter-growing-drone-threat	2025-03-10T01:27:03-07:00

Exclusive: US Army Integrates Israeli Spike Missile on AH-64 Apache Helicopter for Enhanced Precision Strikes	On March 5, 2025, a significant milestone in U.S. Army aviation took place as the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) successfully piloted an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter integrated with Spike Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) missiles. This event marks the first-ever flight of training Spike NLOS missiles by a conventional Army unit in the U.S. Central Command area of operations, setting the stage for future operational combat use of the system. The successful flight represents a critical step in the Army's ongoing efforts to enhance its precision strike capabilities, bringing the Spike NLOS closer to becoming a fully integrated weapon system for the Apache fleet.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), successfully conducts a flight of an AH-64 Apache helicopter equipped with training Spike Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) missiles at Erbil Airbase, Iraq, on March 5, 2025. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The U.S. Army's decision to adopt the Israeli-made Spike NLOS missile system for its Interim-Long Range Precision Munition (I-LRPM) program in 2020 significantly bolstered the firepower and operational flexibility of its AH-64 Apache helicopters. Developed by Lockheed Martin, Spike NLOS enables the Apache to engage targets beyond visual range (BVR), extending the attack helicopter’s operational range to up to 32 kilometers. This long-range capability allows Apache pilots to neutralize high-value targets at distances far greater than traditional missiles, providing more effective standoff and reducing the risk of exposure to enemy air defenses. Spike NLOS is part of the broader Spike family of missiles, which was originally developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The Spike family, known for its precision and versatility, includes a variety of missile variants designed for different platforms and target engagement scenarios. The NLOS (Non-Line of Sight) version stands out by allowing the missile to be fired at targets that are not directly visible to the operator or the launch platform, thanks to its sophisticated guidance systems and the use of real-time sensor data from the Apache. This technology is a key feature that sets Spike NLOS apart from traditional missiles, making it ideal for modern combat environments where traditional line-of-sight targeting may not always be possible or effective. Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) technology enables the Spike missile to strike targets hidden behind obstacles such as buildings, terrain, or dense foliage. This capability is made possible by integrating the missile with advanced targeting and guidance systems, which allow the operator to launch the missile based on precise coordinates or sensor inputs, even if the target cannot be directly seen. In combat, where visibility may be limited due to weather conditions, smoke, or geographic features, this technology offers a significant advantage in striking high-value targets without exposing the platform to unnecessary risk. Spike NLOS is equipped with an advanced motor system that enhances its range and accuracy, two crucial elements for precision strikes in modern warfare. The missile’s long range allows Apache crews to engage distant targets from a safe standoff distance, minimizing exposure to hostile air defenses and ground fire. In addition to its extended range, the missile also incorporates a 'man-in-the-loop' control system. This feature provides Apache pilots with the ability to adjust the missile's trajectory during flight, giving them greater control over the missile’s path as it engages its target. The ability to make real-time adjustments is especially valuable in dynamic combat environments, where targets may move or change positions rapidly. The integration of Spike NLOS enhances the Apache’s precision strike capabilities. The man-in-the-loop feature enables the pilot to guide the missile to its target with greater accuracy, even if the target is moving or positioned in challenging terrain. This flexibility allows Apache crews to engage targets more effectively, particularly in complex combat situations where the environment is constantly changing, and precision is key to mission success. In addition, the ability to control the missile mid-flight ensures a high probability of hitting the target, even if it is not in direct line of sight from the helicopter. Moreover, the compatibility of Spike NLOS with the Apache’s existing suite of sensors and avionics systems ensures that the Apache will maintain situational awareness while executing precision strikes. The Apache’s onboard sensors can track and identify targets at long distances, and the integration with Spike NLOS allows the helicopter to launch a missile and strike with pinpoint accuracy, even when those targets are obscured by terrain or obstacles. This added capability is vital in modern warfare, where minimizing collateral damage and ensuring mission success are of paramount importance. The introduction of Spike NLOS onto the AH-64 Apache represents a significant enhancement of the U.S. Army’s precision strike capabilities, providing a new tool for a wide range of combat operations, including counter-terrorism, force protection, and conventional warfare. Previously, the AH-64 Apache’s primary missile system was the AGM-114 Hellfire, a laser-guided missile that has been in use for decades. While the Hellfire remains an effective weapon, its range and line-of-sight limitations have made it less suitable for certain modern combat scenarios. The Spike NLOS missile, with its extended range, non-line-of-sight capability, and advanced guidance systems, gives the Apache a significant tactical advantage. By integrating Spike NLOS into its weaponry, the Apache can now strike targets up to 32 km away, extending its operational reach and providing greater flexibility in combat. The ability to engage targets beyond visual range also enhances the safety of Apache crews, allowing them to remain at a standoff distance and reducing the risk of retaliation from enemy air defenses or ground forces. The precision targeting capabilities of the Spike NLOS, combined with its extended range, make the Apache a more formidable platform in modern, high-intensity conflicts. Looking ahead, the U.S. Army plans to continue testing and refining the Spike NLOS missile system, with the goal of fully integrating it into Apache units around the world. As the Army refines its use of Spike NLOS in real-world combat scenarios, it will be able to build on the Apache's already impressive capabilities, ensuring that it remains a key asset in the U.S. military’s arsenal for years to come. With its enhanced range, precision, and flexibility, the Spike NLOS missile system is set to play a critical role in the Army’s ability to conduct effective and efficient operations in a wide range of conflict zones. As the U.S. military continues to adapt to evolving threats, the integration of Spike NLOS on the Apache attack helicopter represents a key step in maintaining air superiority and providing critical support to ground forces. The system will provide Apache crews with the tools needed to tackle a wide range of targets, from enemy combatants to high-value assets, while minimizing risks and maximizing the effectiveness of each strike.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-army-integrates-israeli-spike-missile-on-ah-64-apache-helicopter-for-enhanced-precision-strikes	2025-03-08T11:26:02-08:00

The F-35B's capability to operate in austere conditions, integrate with joint networks, and provide enhanced battlespace awareness makes it a critical asset for any coalition force operating in the region. Furthermore, the deployment of the F-35B is a clear sign of the U.S. military’s ongoing transition from fourth-generation aircraft, like the F/A-18 Hornets and AV-8B Harriers, to fifth-generation platforms. The February 2025 Marine Aviation Plan laid out this transition as essential to maintaining superiority in modern combat environments. The F-35B's stealth capabilities, advanced sensors, and interoperability with allied forces ensure that the U.S. remains ahead of potential adversaries technologically, with a platform that can operate effectively across a range of missions in increasingly complex and contested environments. The Unit Deployment Program, under which VMFA-214 is operating, has long been a crucial element in maintaining a rotational presence in the Indo-Pacific. The program ensures that U.S. forces gain invaluable experience in the region while maintaining a visible and continuous presence. This ongoing rotation of forces is particularly important given the geopolitical instability in the region and the need for the U.S. to remain agile in its response to evolving threats. The F-35B’s capabilities in areas such as networked warfare, sensor fusion, and rapid mobility further solidify the strategic value of the UDP, offering the U.S. the flexibility to respond quickly to contingencies, wherever they may arise. The F-35B's deployment also carries broader geopolitical and diplomatic significance. By reinforcing its military presence in Japan, the U.S. signals its unwavering commitment to the security of its allies in the Indo-Pacific. Japan, a critical partner in the region, plays a key role in the U.S.'s strategy for containing Chinese expansionism and ensuring regional stability. The presence of advanced American airpower strengthens Japan’s defense capabilities while reinforcing the bilateral defense relationship between the two nations. As China continues to expand its military presence and assert its influence in the South China Sea, the U.S. must ensure that its forces remain capable of meeting emerging threats head-on. The F-35B’s deployment to Japan provides the U.S. with an additional layer of defense and a powerful tool for maintaining peace and stability in the region. The deployment of VMFA-214’s F-35B squadron to Japan is more than just a tactical maneuver—it represents a major shift in U.S. military operations in the Indo-Pacific. The integration of fifth-generation aircraft like the F-35B enhances the U.S. Marine Corps' ability to project power across the region, collaborate with allied forces, and maintain air superiority in an increasingly contested environment. The flexibility and advanced capabilities of the F-35B ensure that U.S. forces remain at the cutting edge of modern warfare, ready to meet any challenge that arises in the region.

(Picture source: North Korea press agency) Accompanied by senior officials, including Jo Chun Ryong, secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) Central Committee, and Admiral Kim Myong Sik, commander of the North Korean Navy, Kim emphasized the strategic importance of the new submarine. This submarine is expected to enhance North Korea’s nuclear deterrence, providing it with a powerful second-strike capability.Military experts from South Korea suggest that the new nuclear-powered SLBM submarine is likely to be a 6,000-ton or 7,000-ton class vessel, capable of carrying around 10 ballistic missiles. According to Moon Keun-sik, a South Korean submarine expert from Seoul’s Hanyang University, the term 'strategic guided missiles' used by North Korean officials indicates that these missiles would be nuclear-capable. This makes the submarine a crucial element of North Korea's growing nuclear arsenal, capable of delivering long-range, devastating retaliatory strikes even after a preemptive attack on land-based assets. North Korea’s new nuclear-powered SLBM submarine marks a significant evolution in its naval forces, which have long relied on smaller, diesel-powered submarines. As of Military Balance 2024, the North Korean Navy boasts a fleet of 71 submarines, which include various models designed for different strategic and tactical roles. Notable among these are the SSB 1 8.24 Yongung (Gorae), a submarine involved in SLBM trials, and several others with specialized capabilities, such as cruise missile submarines (SSC) and attack submarines (SSK). The North Korean fleet includes several key types of submarines designed for distinct operational needs. The SSB (Strategic Submersible Ballistic) class submarines, such as the Gorae-class, are specifically designed to carry and launch submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Gorae-class, for instance, has been used in trials for North Korea's Pukguksong-1 SLBM. North Korea also operates SSK (attack submarines), like the Type-033 (Romeo-class), which are equipped with torpedo tubes for anti-ship and anti-submarine warfare. In addition, the country fields SSC (cruise missile submarines), which are equipped to launch cruise missiles, with some variations carrying 533mm torpedo tubes or 53-65E heavy-weight torpedoes. Lastly, North Korea also operates SSW (specialized or small submarines), such as the Yugo and Yeono-class, which are often used for specialized missions and can carry various types of torpedoes. The addition of the nuclear-powered SLBM submarine will significantly enhance North Korea's ability to conduct strategic deterrence operations. Unlike diesel-electric submarines, nuclear-powered submarines can remain submerged for much longer periods, making them harder to detect and therefore improving their survivability in a potential conflict. The SLBM capability also gives North Korea a second-strike nuclear deterrent, ensuring the ability to launch a devastating retaliatory attack even if its land-based nuclear assets are destroyed in an initial strike. The term SLBM (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile) refers to a missile launched from a submerged submarine. These missiles are essential for any nation aiming to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent, as they provide the ability to retaliate against adversaries from beneath the ocean’s surface. This ensures a secure second-strike capability, even if other nuclear assets are neutralized. North Korea’s Pukguksong-1 SLBM, tested from its Gorae-class submarine, is an example of the technology Pyongyang has developed. These SLBMs, capable of striking distant targets, give North Korea a powerful and mobile nuclear deterrent. The new nuclear-powered SLBM submarine will further enhance the effectiveness of North Korea’s deterrent force, increasing its operational range and survivability in a potential conflict. Experts suggest that Russia may have played a significant role in helping North Korea advance towards developing nuclear-powered submarines. Moscow has long been a key supplier of military technology to North Korea, including missile systems and nuclear technology. The assistance of Russian-designed nuclear reactors and submarine systems is believed to have been instrumental in overcoming the technical challenges associated with creating a nuclear-powered submarine capable of launching SLBMs. The introduction of a nuclear-powered SLBM submarine represents a pivotal development in North Korea's military strategy. It allows the country to expand its reach and resilience, providing a reliable and mobile platform for nuclear retaliation. This capability ensures North Korea can survive and strike back even in the highly contested waters of the Pacific. With SLBMs, the new submarine strengthens North Korea’s strategic deterrence, presenting new challenges for regional powers, especially the U.S. and South Korea, who must now account for this enhanced capability in their defense planning. This move also signals North Korea's growing ambitions in undersea warfare, as the nation continues to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal. The integration of SLBMs into a nuclear-powered submarine brings North Korea closer to parity with other nuclear powers possessing similar capabilities, further solidifying its position as a formidable military presence in the Pacific and beyond. North Korea's unveiling of its nuclear-powered SLBM submarine is a significant step in its ongoing efforts to bolster its nuclear deterrence and strengthen its naval capabilities. With technological assistance from Russia and an expanding fleet of advanced submarines, this new vessel will play a crucial role in North Korea's ability to project power and maintain strategic stability in the region. As these developments continue, the potential for increased tensions in the Pacific region grows, with North Korea’s enhanced ability to deter and retaliate against adversaries through its nuclear-powered submarine and SLBM capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-north-korea-unveils-first-locally-made-nuclear-powered-submarine-posing-threats-to-us-asia	2025-03-08T10:08:25-08:00

Focus | British Type 83 destroyer moves towards the development phase to strengthen naval air defense	As reported by the UK Defence Journal on March 4, 2025, the United Kingdom has officially initiated the concept phase for the next-generation Type 83 destroyer, a key component of the Future Air Dominance System (FADS) program. This class of guided-missile destroyers is being developed to replace the Royal Navy’s existing Type 45 destroyers, ensuring maritime air defense capabilities remain operational into the late 2030s and beyond. In response to a parliamentary question from MP Mark Francois, Minister of State for Defence Maria Eagle confirmed the Type 83’s role in FADS and its purpose of replacing the Type 45’s air defense function.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This new class of guided-missile destroyers is being developed to replace the Royal Navy’s existing Type 45 destroyers, ensuring maritime air defense capabilities remain operational into the late 2030s and beyond. (Picture source: British MoD) The Type 83 is expected to be larger and more advanced than its predecessor, and serve both as a conventional guided-missile destroyer and an air defense destroyer. Its primary mission will be to provide integrated air and missile defense against various threats, including hypersonic missiles. Government updates have described FADS as a multi-domain initiative designed to enhance UK defense capabilities across air, land, and maritime operations. In December 2024, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) conducted a Market Engagement Event (MEE) to collect industry input on the project’s direction, evaluating marketplace capabilities and challenges. Further industry engagement is scheduled for 2025 as the Royal Navy refines its requirements. Concept images released in 2023 suggest the Type 83 may be larger than the Type 45, with a size comparable to the US Navy’s Zumwalt-class or China’s Type 055 destroyers. Although exact specifications remain undisclosed, the Type 83 is anticipated to incorporate next-generation radar and sensor systems, possibly including an advanced phased array radar suite. The ship is also expected to be equipped with Mk 41 vertical launch systems (VLS) for air defense, land attack, and anti-ship missiles. Additionally, it may feature a power generation system capable of supporting directed energy weapons such as high-energy lasers or railguns. The projected timeline for the Type 83 indicates an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in the late 2030s or early 2040s. The exact number of ships to be built remains uncertain, as past UK defense procurement programs have often resulted in fewer vessels than initially planned. Future decisions regarding fleet composition are expected to be determined through a Strategic Defence Review later in the decade. The location of the Type 83’s construction is another unresolved factor. While the government has expressed support for domestic shipbuilding, no official confirmation has been made regarding the shipyard responsible for the program. Minister Maria Eagle stated that the decision remains subject to commercial considerations, but she noted that the project will sustain employment in the UK defense sector until at least the mid-2040s, depending on the number of ships constructed. The MoD has committed to analyzing supply chain involvement and social value aspects during the concept phase to ensure the support of UK-based defense manufacturing. Several design concepts have been proposed, including a large cruiser-like vessel with an expanded missile payload, an arsenal ship with a reduced crew requirement, and an air-warfare variant derived from the Type 26 frigate. Each approach presents trade-offs in terms of cost, capability, and operational flexibility. Parallel developments in sensor technology, such as the potential integration of the Aegis combat system or UK-developed radar systems, could influence final design decisions. The Type 83's primary mission will be to provide integrated air and missile defense against various threats, including hypersonic missiles, likely for the UK Carrier Strike Group, also known as UKCSG. (Picture source: British MoD) The Type 45 destroyers currently serve as the Royal Navy’s primary air defense platform, with plans for their retirement by 2038. To maintain operational effectiveness until the Type 83 enters service, the Type 45s are undergoing upgrades, including the integration of the Sea Ceptor missile system. However, concerns remain over whether the replacement schedule will maintain the required number of air defense platforms. Historically, UK naval procurement programs have seen reductions in planned fleet numbers, and similar risks could impact the Type 83 program. The Future Air Dominance System (FADS) is designed as a system-of-systems, with Type 83 destroyers expected to operate alongside NATO allies, the Queen Elizabeth-class carrier air wing, and other maritime and land-based assets. Preliminary discussions have indicated that the ships may act as motherships for new sensors and autonomous vessels, potentially expanding their role beyond traditional air defense. The MoD has also confirmed that the Type 83 will be equipped to counter hypersonic missile threats. Former Chief of the Defence Staff General Nick Carter has previously highlighted the necessity of these destroyers, emphasizing that the Type 45s currently provide the UK’s only long-range air defense capability against cruise and ballistic missile threats. The final number of Type 83s to be constructed is yet to be determined and will be influenced by the upcoming Strategic Defence Review. Uncertainty also surrounds the industrial strategy for the Type 83 program. Multiple UK shipyards are competing for the contract, and the MoD has yet to decide whether the vessels will be constructed at a single facility or distributed across multiple sites. The government has reaffirmed its commitment to sustaining domestic shipbuilding jobs, with officials indicating that the program will generate employment opportunities through at least the mid-2040s. Challenges related to recruitment and resource management within the Royal Navy have raised concerns about whether the number of Type 83s procured will be sufficient to maintain current operational capabilities. Previous trends suggest that projected fleet sizes often decrease over time, which could lead to capability gaps in the UK’s air defense structure if the Type 83 program does not meet planned targets.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/focus-british-type-83-destroyer-moves-towards-the-development-phase-to-strengthen-naval-air-defense	2025-03-06T05:10:34-08:00

(Picture source: Dutch MoD) Estonia provided the target drones, enabling Dutch pilots to simulate realistic scenarios involving the simultaneous engagement of multiple aerial threats. The ability to intercept drones effectively has become a critical component of the Netherlands’ F-35 missions within NATO, particularly in air policing operations to secure allied airspace from potential intrusions. These live-training scenarios help pilots develop essential skills for real-world engagements, ensuring greater adaptability to evolving security challenges. The Netherlands integrated the F-35A Lightning II into its air force as part of a broad modernization program, replacing aging F-16s. The RNLAF plans to acquire 52 F-35A aircraft, with several already in operational service. Designed for air superiority, precision strikes, and reconnaissance, these aircraft play a key role in surveillance, deterrence, and power projection, particularly within NATO operations. The F-35A Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole stealth fighter developed by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. Air Force and international partners. These variant features advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and network-centric capabilities, making it a key asset in modern warfare. Powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney F135-PW-100 engine, it reaches speeds of Mach 1.6. Equipped with AN/APG-81 AESA radar, Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), it provides enhanced situational awareness, enabling engagements beyond visual range and effective operations in contested environments.

This event highlighted the growing role of counter-drone defense in regional security and the need for allied forces to enhance their ability to counter asymmetric aerial threats. Since late 2023, the RNLAF has deployed four F-35A jets in Estonia as part of NATO’s air policing mission. So far, these aircraft have conducted ten interception missions, identifying eighteen Russian aircraft near NATO airspace. These operations demonstrate the Netherlands’ commitment to monitoring and protecting NATO’s eastern flank, particularly in the context of heightened tensions with Russia. The Baltic Sea is a strategically significant region for Nordic countries and Europe, especially amid ongoing tensions with Russia. A key hub for trade and energy transit, it hosts critical infrastructure, including the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, which connect Russia directly to Europe. However, this energy dependency has exposed the continent to security vulnerabilities, exacerbated by political tensions and sabotage incidents, such as those targeting these pipelines. Additionally, the security of underwater infrastructure has become a growing concern, as seen in the damage to the EstLink 2 cable, which connects Finland and Estonia, raising alarm over the protection of subsea communication and energy networks. In response to these challenges, Nordic and Baltic countries have been strengthening their defensive posture. The recent accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO has significantly altered the strategic balance in the Baltic Sea, effectively turning the region into a 'NATO-controlled zone', increasing pressure on Russia. Additionally, proposals such as the one from Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, advocating for a joint naval force in the Baltic Sea, reflect Europe’s effort to bolster security cooperation. In this context, the Netherlands’ deployment of F-35A jets in Estonia contributes to NATO’s deterrence and defensive strategy, reinforcing the collective effort to counter potential destabilizing actions by Russia in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/dutch-f-35s-train-to-intercept-drones-with-aim-9-sidewinder-missiles-over-baltic-sea	2025-03-06T02:00:47-08:00

OCCAR has also shared the requirements for the EGC program, defining the vehicle’s engineering, mobility, and protection capabilities. The EGC must feature a 4-in-1 bucket and an excavator arm capable of digging a tank firing position within 50 minutes, creating anti-tank ditches at a rate of 30 meters per hour with two vehicles, and lifting loads of up to three tons. Additionally, the system must be able to excavate trenches 90 cm wide and up to 2.5 meters deep, relocate soil, and construct protective berms using displaced earth. These capabilities must be functional both during the day and at night, with integrated equipment ensuring operability in low-visibility conditions. The EGC is also required to be certified for use on civilian roads in customer countries. Beyond its engineering role, the EGC must feature multi-functional capabilities aligned with the SCORPION combat system. It will integrate communication systems such as CONTACT/SYNAPS radios, the SICS battlefield management system, and the BARAGE jammer. The vehicle must match the speed, protection, autonomy, and off-road mobility of the Griffon and Jaguar armored vehicles, ensuring operational continuity. Designed to function in muddy and sandy environments, the EGC will feature an adaptive tire pressure system for improved traction and a winch for self-recovery. It will operate with a three-person crew consisting of a commander, a driver, and a radio-gunner and must be capable of towing a trailer and functioning in CBRN-contaminated environments. To date, one candidate is known: CNIM. This French company has proposed both an initial project and an evolution. When first introduced as a concept by CNIM in collaboration with Texelis in 2022, the Engin du Génie de Combat (EGC) was envisioned as a high-mobility, 8x8 wheeled engineering vehicle designed to operate in complex battlefield environments. It was intended to perform combat engineering tasks such as obstacle clearance and fortification construction while ensuring crew protection. Additionally, the EGC was already designed for integration into the SCORPION combat system, ensuring interoperability with other armored platforms in the French and Belgian armed forces. With the Auroch concept, the French consortium of CNIM Systèmes Industriels, KNDS France, and Texelis has introduced refinements to align more closely with the anticipated requirements of the EGC program.

North Korea to soon deploy its first airborne early warning aircraft based on a Russian IL-76	As reported by 38 North on March 4, 2025, North Korea appears to be nearing completion of its first airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft, representing an expansion of its air force capabilities. Satellite imagery analysis indicates that a modified Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft has been stationed at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport, with a large radome mounted on its fuselage.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Converting an IL-76 into an AEW platform requires expertise in radar integration, airborne networking, and electronic warfare, areas in which North Korea has limited experience. (Picture source: Airbus Defence &amp; Space and 38 North via Decker Eveleth/Twitter) The radome features a triangular shape, a design seen on Chinese KJ-2000 and KJ-500 AEW aircraft, which typically house three fixed phased array radars covering 120-degree sectors each. While this configuration suggests a possible Chinese influence, there is no definitive evidence confirming direct external support. The IL-76 was previously part of Air Koryo’s cargo fleet before being transferred to a maintenance facility in October 2023, where security fences were installed around it. Structural modifications began in November 2023, prompting speculation regarding its conversion into an AEW platform. By late 2024, visible progress had been made, and the aircraft was moved into an adjacent hangar. In February 2025, it reappeared with a mounted radome, providing the clearest indication yet of North Korea’s efforts to develop an AEW system. However, state media has not acknowledged the project. According to Decker Eveleth, the development of an AEW aircraft would allow North Korea to detect low-flying threats such as cruise missiles, which its existing Soviet-era ground-based radar systems struggle to track due to the country’s mountainous terrain and the curvature of the Earth. Airborne radar coverage would improve North Korea’s situational awareness and potentially enhance its air defense network. However, the effectiveness of such a system depends on its integration with existing command and control infrastructure. AEW platforms require advanced networking capabilities and real-time data-sharing systems, the availability of which in North Korea remains uncertain. Analysts have raised questions regarding possible foreign involvement in the modification process. Satellite imagery from late 2023 revealed structural changes that resemble AEW modifications observed in Russian and Chinese aircraft. No conclusive evidence exists to confirm Russian assistance, but reports indicate increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. Since North Korea began supplying artillery shells and other military aid to Russia during the Ukraine conflict, speculation has grown that Pyongyang could be receiving technical support or surplus military equipment in return, including components relevant to AEW capabilities. North Korea’s use of the Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft began in 1993 when Air Koryo acquired three IL-76TDs for freight transport to and from China and Russia. These aircraft remain in service and are registered as P-912, P-913, and P-914. Air Koryo’s Il-76s have been cited in reports alleging their involvement in transporting cargo associated with North Korea’s military programs, including missile components, in violation of United Nations sanctions. In 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated 16 Air Koryo aircraft, including its Il-76s, for their association with North Korea’s transportation sector and potential links to weapons proliferation. North Korea’s use of the Ilyushin Il-76 cargo aircraft began in 1993 when Air Koryo acquired three IL-76TDs for freight transport to and from China and Russia. (Picture source: LiuXiaHui/RussianPlanes.net) While primarily operated for cargo transport, at least one Il-76 has been photographed in a military camouflage scheme, leading to speculation about its use beyond commercial freight operations. Despite international restrictions, these aircraft remain an integral part of North Korea’s air logistics capabilities, particularly given the country’s reliance on Soviet-era aircraft and its limited access to newer models due to sanctions. Recent reports suggest that Russia has agreed to supply North Korea with MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets in exchange for the deployment of North Korean personnel to Russia. According to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Samuel Paparo, approximately 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia, though they have not yet participated in combat operations. This agreement aligns with broader patterns of increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, with indications that Pyongyang may also seek additional technological transfers, including missile re-entry vehicles, submarine technologies, and upgraded air defense systems. North Korea’s air force operates a fleet of aging Soviet-era aircraft with limited modernization due to sanctions and resource constraints. The inventory primarily consists of MiG-21s, MiG-23s, Su-25s, and a small number of MiG-29s. The acquisition of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters would expand its air force’s capabilities, though it would still remain behind South Korea’s technologically advanced air fleet, which includes F-35 and F-15K fighters. North Korea’s AEW initiative aligns with its broader intelligence-gathering objectives, which include increased investments in space-based reconnaissance through satellite deployments. A functional AEW platform would complement these efforts by providing airborne surveillance, potentially improving Pyongyang’s ability to monitor foreign military activities and coordinate its own operations. Significant challenges remain in fully operationalizing an AEW aircraft. Converting an IL-76 into an AEW platform requires expertise in radar integration, airborne networking, and electronic warfare, areas in which North Korea has limited experience. Additionally, AEW platforms require continuous operation to maintain surveillance coverage, and a single modified IL-76 would provide only intermittent capability. Expanding the AEW fleet would require additional modifications or foreign assistance to sustain operational readiness. The introduction of an AEW system in North Korea has implications for regional security. While it may enhance Pyongyang’s ability to track military activities, it also raises concerns about potential misinterpretation of intelligence and an increased risk of escalation. Analysts caution that while an AEW system could improve situational awareness, it might also lead to miscalculations if North Korea interprets routine military exercises as a threat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/north-korea-to-soon-deploy-its-first-airborne-early-warning-aircraft-based-on-a-russian-il-76	2025-03-05T03:48:40-08:00

One of the central themes of AMPHIBEX is the enhancement of interoperability between different military forces. Each participating nation brings its unique capabilities and equipment, making coordination vital. For example, the Republic of Korea Army’s K-55 howitzer, which was showcased in the amphibious exercise, is a key asset for providing indirect fire support during amphibious landings. Its integration into the exercise exemplifies how modern military platforms, despite coming from different countries, can work together seamlessly. Moreover, Thailand's naval and air forces, combined with the U.S. Marines' amphibious assault vehicles and the Singaporean artillery support, demonstrate the importance of multinational coordination in operations that could involve large-scale humanitarian aid or military intervention in conflict zones. This is particularly important in a region that remains vulnerable to flashpoints, ranging from territorial disputes to larger power struggles. The interoperability forged in exercises like Cobra Gold is not limited to military engagements. These drills also foster a deeper understanding between armed forces, enabling more effective disaster relief operations in the event of natural disasters, which are frequent in the region. This multifaceted collaboration enhances not only military capability but also collective resilience to non-combat challenges. The Asia-Pacific region is facing increasing geopolitical and security challenges, particularly with respect to territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the broader competition for influence between global powers. Exercises such as AMPHIBEX and Cobra Gold are key to strengthening military alliances and enhancing the ability of U.S. and regional forces to respond to aggressive actions and humanitarian crises alike. The region's reliance on maritime trade makes it a strategic crossroads for the global economy and security. For this reason, ensuring that regional partners can perform joint amphibious operations effectively is paramount. The U.S. military's presence in the region, underscored by exercises like AMPHIBEX, reinforces its commitment to deterrence and stability while fostering positive relations with Southeast Asian nations. AMPHIBEX, part of Cobra Gold 2025, is a vital training ground for improving military capabilities and multinational cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. Through realistic drills involving complex amphibious assaults and humanitarian operations, participating forces are better prepared for the challenges of modern warfare and regional crises.

Russia restarts TVD-10 engine production to modernize the An-2 biplane aircraft in service since 1947	As reported by TASS on February 27, 2025, Russia has announced plans to restart production of the TVD-10 turboprop engine, originally developed in the Soviet Union, to support the modernization of the Antonov An-2 Kukuruznik biplane aircraft, which was introduced in 1947. Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Anton Alikhanov confirmed the decision, stating that these engines will be used to re-engine An-2 aircraft, with potential future applications for additional modernization.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The An-2, a single-engine biplane, was developed in response to a Soviet Ministry of Forestry requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Polikarpov Po-2 and made its first flight on August 31, 1947. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Siberian Scientific Research Institute of Aviation (SibNIA) plans to have a prototype An-2 equipped with the TVD-10B engine by the summer of this year, while the production of the engine is set to be re-established in Omsk. The decision follows delays in the availability of the VK-800 engine developed at UZGA, which led to the continuation of the older TVD-10 model to ensure aircraft operability at least until 2030, when the LMS-901 Baikal light multipurpose aircraft is expected to enter full-scale production. Originally, the VK-800 project began in 2008 to power various Russian aircraft, including the Ansat and Ka-226 helicopters, but faced numerous challenges, leading to a near halt in progress for about a decade. A renewed effort commenced around 2018-2019 to adapt the engine for the Baikal aircraft. Despite these efforts, the engine's certification is now anticipated by the end of 2025, with serial production expected to begin in 2026. These delays have impacted the timeline for the Baikal aircraft's mass production, which was initially planned for early 2024 but has been postponed. The postponement is further complicated by a substantial increase in the aircraft's projected cost, rising from an initial estimate of 120 million rubles to approximately 445 million rubles per unit. The TVD-10 turboprop engine was developed in 1965 by the Omsk Engine Design Bureau (OMKB) based on the GTD-3F engine used in the Ka-25 helicopter. The engine was designed for regional passenger aircraft and features a free turbine and a remote gearbox. Its takeoff power is 1,025 horsepower, with a propeller power output of 960 horsepower. The engine's fuel consumption rate at takeoff is 0.255 kg/hp per hour. Serial production of the TVD-10 began in 1969, with the engine primarily installed on aircraft such as the Beriev Be-30. In the 1980s and 1990s, the TVD-10 was produced in Poland at the VSK-Rzeszow and VSK-Kalisz plants, with approximately 500 units manufactured. Since 1992, OMKB has conducted maintenance and overhaul operations, repairing 190 engines by 2004 under AP-145 and FAP-145 certification standards. The TVD-10B is a modification of the TVD-10, designed for re-engining the An-2. It retains the same structural features as its predecessor, with a takeoff power of 1,025 horsepower and a dry weight of 230 kilograms. The engine is designed to operate for up to 10,000 hours, with an inter-repair resource of 2,000 hours and a time between overhauls of 1,500 hours. In Poland, the TVD-10B was produced in serial quantities, and with its reintroduction in Russia, it will continue to be used for maintaining and modernizing An-2 aircraft. The Siberian Scientific Research Institute of Aviation (SibNIA) plans to have a prototype An-2 equipped with the TVD-10B engine by the summer of this year, while the production of the engine is set to be re-established in Omsk. (Picture source: Russian social media) The An-2 has been used by Russian military forces since its introduction, fulfilling roles in transport, airborne training, and other logistical operations.

The aircraft remained in military service following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, continuing its role in airborne training. In 2024, Russian conscripts of the Airborne Troops conducted jumps from an An-2 at the Klokovo airfield in the Tula region. The personnel used D-10 main parachutes and Z-5 reserve parachutes, jumping from a height of 1,000 meters at a speed of approximately 160 km/h with a three-second separation interval. The exercise, which included parachute training and tactical drills, resulted in over 500 jumps by the Tula Guards Airborne Unit. The An-2, known as 'Annushka' and 'Kukuruznik' in Russia and designated 'Colt' by NATO, was developed in response to a Soviet Ministry of Forestry requirement for a new aircraft to replace the Polikarpov Po-2. The Antonov Design Bureau, under the direction of Oleg Antonov, designed the aircraft, with the prototype, initially designated SKhA-1, making its first flight on August 31, 1947. Testing continued through 1947 and 1948, and the aircraft was formally accepted into service as the An-2. It was produced for applications in agriculture, transport, aerial firefighting, and airborne operations. Some aircraft have accumulated flight hours exceeding 20,000. Production of the An-2 occurred in multiple locations, with more than 18,000 units built between 1947 and 2002. Initial manufacturing took place at Plant No. 473 in Kyiv, followed by large-scale production at WSK PZL-Mielec in Poland, where approximately 11,915 units were produced between 1960 and 2002. Additional production was conducted in China under the designation Yunshuji Y-5, with some sources indicating continued manufacturing. The aircraft was exported to 26 countries and remains in service in Russia, China, and other states. As of 2012, 1,580 An-2 aircraft were listed as operational in Russia, with 322 considered airworthy. Other fleets included 290 aircraft in Kazakhstan, 135 in Ukraine, 143 in Uzbekistan, 89 in Turkmenistan, 82 in Belarus, 63 in Azerbaijan, 30 in Kyrgyzstan, 13 in Moldova, and 6 in Armenia. The An-2 is a single-engine biplane with a braced-wing configuration powered by a Shvetsov ASh-62IR radial engine with a takeoff power of 1,000 horsepower. Its maximum speed is 258 km/h, with a cruising speed of 180 km/h and a service ceiling of 4,500 meters. The takeoff run is 235 meters, while the landing roll is 225 meters. The upper wing has a span of 18.17 meters, while the lower wing spans 14.23 meters, giving the aircraft a total wing area of 71.52 m². The An-2's empty weight ranges from 3,400 to 3,690 kg, and its maximum takeoff weight is 5,500 kg. It features slatted wings that deploy automatically at low speeds, allowing it to maintain controlled flight at speeds as low as 50 km/h. The aircraft has been used in both civilian and military roles and continues to operate in regions requiring short takeoff and landing capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/russia-restarts-tvd-10-engine-production-to-modernize-the-an-2-biplane-aircraft-in-service-since-1947	2025-03-05T02:48:23-08:00

US Pennsylvania National Guard to receive 324 new Stryker Double V-hull vehicles to increase crew protection	On March 3, 2025, the Pennsylvania National Guard began receiving upgraded Strykers double-V hull (DVH) and Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs) as part of a modernization effort for the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT). The 56th SBCT is scheduled to receive 324 upgraded Stryker vehicles and 300 JLTVs to replace its flat-bottom-hull Strykers and M1097 HMMWVs with models that provide improved protection and operational capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The double-V hull (DVH) upgrade was developed to address vulnerabilities observed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where underbody improvised explosive device (IED) attacks posed a significant threat. (Picture source: Pennsylvania National Guard) The first batch of 25 Strykers has arrived at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, where they will be used for training before being assigned to units. All JLTVs will be received at Fort Indiantown Gap before distribution. The final allocation of the remaining Strykers is still being determined. A 'train-the-trainer' program is planned for March to familiarize personnel with the new vehicles, alongside a field-level maintenance course focused on sustainment and servicing requirements. The double-V hull (DVH) upgrade was developed to address vulnerabilities observed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where underbody improvised explosive device (IED) attacks posed a significant threat. The design incorporates a modified lower hull that redirects blast energy away from the vehicle to reduce structural damage and the likelihood of casualties. Combat data from Afghanistan indicated that DVH-equipped Strykers were more resistant to these threats compared to flat-bottom models. Col. Christopher Costello, commander of the 56th SBCT, noted that the DVH configuration resulted in a measurable decrease in injuries among vehicle occupants following IED incidents. The DVH configuration includes structural reinforcements, blast-attenuating seats, an armored driver’s station, and upgraded armor protection. Additional modifications involve an improved suspension and driveline to compensate for the increased vehicle weight. Testing and analysis have confirmed that the DVH offers enhanced protection against IEDs and blast threats while maintaining mobility and operational effectiveness. The design improvements stem from lessons learned in previous deployments, where flat-bottom Strykers exhibited higher casualty rates. The revised hull shape is engineered to dissipate explosive forces more effectively to mitigate damage. The double-V hull serves as the basis for multiple Stryker variants, including the Infantry Carrier Vehicle-Scout (ICVV-S), Mortar Carrier Vehicle (MCVV), Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEVV), and Anti-Tank Guided Missile Vehicle (ATVV). The Army has not procured DVH versions of the Mobile Gun System or Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle but continues to field a range of configurations to enhance Stryker Brigade Combat Team capabilities. Classified evaluations have validated that the DVH provides increased protection against underbody threats while preserving mission effectiveness. Additional improvements under the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) program include a 450-horsepower engine, a 910-amp alternator for increased electrical output, and a reinforced suspension to support heavier vehicle loads. Enhanced situational awareness systems and networking capabilities have been integrated to meet evolving operational requirements. The Army aims to implement the DVH-A1 standard across all Stryker Brigades, incorporating new weapon systems such as the M153A4 CROWS-J and the 30mm XM813 Chain Gun-equipped turrets. The modernization effort is planned to continue into the 2030s to sustain the Stryker’s role in the Army’s combat vehicle fleet.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-pennsylvania-national-guard-to-receive-324-new-stryker-double-v-hull-vehicles-to-increase-crew-protection	2025-03-05T01:39:41-08:00

Japan to Establish Second F-35B Fighters Squadron by 2030 Strengthening Amphibious Cooperation with US Marines	According to a Japanese Ministry of Defense document reported by USNI News on March 4, 2025, Japan will establish a second F-35 B squadron by the end of the decade. This initiative includes adjustments to the training schedule due to a three-year delay in the completion of the planned airbase on Mageshima Island, which is intended to serve as the fleet's primary training facility. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-35B Lightning II executes a vertical landing aboard Japan Maritime Self-Defense Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga during a developmental test on November 2, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Last week, the Kyushu Defense Bureau of the Ministry of Defense released an explanatory document outlining revisions to the training plan. The ministry’s regional offices regularly provide such updates when military activities may impact local populations. A detailed table outlining the expected number of monthly vertical landing training sessions at Nyutabaru Air Base, located on Kyushu's main island, confirms the formation of a second F-35B squadron by fiscal year 2029, bringing the total number of stationed aircraft at the base to approximately 30. Japan currently plans to establish a temporary F-35B squadron at Nyutabaru by the end of March while awaiting the delivery of the first batch of six aircraft from the planned total of 42. The F-35B Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole fighter equipped with short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability, enabling operations from small ships, roads, and remote bases. Developed for the US Marine Corps as well as the British and Italian forces, it combines stealth, supersonic speed, and operational versatility. Its propulsion system features a Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine and a shaft-driven LiftFan, allowing vertical landing maneuvers while maintaining high flight performance. With a maximum speed of 1,600 km/h and a range of 1,667 km, the F-35B is designed for rapid deployment in conflict zones, reducing reliance on traditional airbases and increasing operational tempo. In terms of armament, the F-35B carries more than 15,000 pounds of ordnance, with an internal weapons bay optimized for stealth or external pylons for maximum payload. It is equipped with the GAU-22/A 25mm cannon and a range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Its advanced avionics include the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, the AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system, and the MADL secure communication system, ensuring effective battlefield connectivity. Protection is enhanced by the AN/AAQ-37 DAS, providing 360-degree threat awareness. These features make the F-35B a key asset for naval and amphibious operations. While the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force operates fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) will be responsible for the F-35Bs, complementing the F-35A fleet already in service. Japan’s acquisition plan includes 105 F-35A and 42 F-35B aircraft. According to projections, eight F-35Bs will be operational by 2025, increasing to 30 with the establishment of the second squadron in 2029. By 2031, the fleet is expected to comprise 40 F-35Bs. Initially, the plan was to station the F-35Bs at Nyutabaru Air Base without conducting vertical landings except in emergencies. However, a review determined that the Mageshima airbase would not be completed until the end of fiscal year 2029. Due to the inability to conduct training there as planned, the Ministry of Defense revised its decision to allow vertical landing training at Nyutabaru. Mageshima, uninhabited since 1980, is located approximately 40 kilometers south of Kyushu’s main island. The Japanese government purchased it in 2019 to develop an airbase for the JASDF, which will also serve as a facility for US Navy and Marine Corps aircraft to conduct simulated carrier landing practice, replacing the current site at Iwo Jima. Additionally, it will function as an operational base for the defense of Japan’s southwestern islands. Construction began in January 2023 and was initially expected to be completed in 2027. However, in September 2024, the Ministry of Defense announced that completion had been pushed back to March 2030 due to material shortages and labor constraints. At a press conference last Friday, Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that the ministry had informed local authorities through the Kyushu Defense Bureau and planned to hold explanatory meetings with residents. Military installations and activities in Japan are frequently located near populated areas, often leading to concerns among residents. Regarding the F-35B training at Nyutabaru, local concerns primarily relate to noise pollution. The explanatory document noted that noise from vertical landings would last for three minutes, citing a 2013 US study that measured a peak noise level of 130 decibels at 75 meters from the landing point and 110 decibels at 300 meters. Japan’s F-35B vertical landing training program includes four types: emergency landings, aircraft type conversion, and proficiency maintenance, landings on non-ship surfaces, and simulated carrier landings. The first three will be conducted at Nyutabaru, while the fourth will only take place at Mageshima once the necessary shipboard landing simulation infrastructure is in place. As Japan integrates the F-35B, other branches of its military are familiarizing themselves with its operations, particularly amphibious units. From February 3 to 6, the commanding officers of the three Amphibious Rapid Deployment Regiments (ARDB) of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force observed flight operations aboard the USS America (LHA-6). This visit was part of a broader engagement with the America Amphibious Ready Group and the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. The objective of this cooperation is to enhance interoperability between US and Japanese forces. Several briefings and planning sessions were held between the commanders of the respective units to strengthen coordination for joint operations. This initiative is part of a larger effort to bolster military ties between the US Marine Corps, the US Navy, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Colonel Chris Niedziocha, commander of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, highlighted the significance of the visit, noting that the simultaneous presence of all three ARDB regiment commanders underscored Japan’s commitment to cooperation with US Marines. He also emphasized the strategic importance of such coordination in the Indo-Pacific, stating that joint actions send a clear signal against coercive or destabilizing activities in the region. As Japan continues to expand its fifth-generation air combat capabilities, the integration of the F-35B into its air force and its coordination with amphibious units represent a strategic shift. The delay in the completion of Mageshima presents logistical challenges, but the Ministry of Defense has adjusted training plans accordingly. Intending to deploy 40 F-35Bs by 2031 and enhance interoperability with US forces, Japan is positioning itself to strengthen its defense posture in response to regional security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-to-establish-second-f-35b-fighters-squadron-by-2030-strengthening-amphibious-cooperation-with-us-marines	2025-03-05T01:20:43-08:00	
US Air Force to deploy the OA-1K Skyraider II as the new primary light attack aircraft for special operations	On February 27, 2025, the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) designated its newest light attack aircraft, the AT-802U Sky Warden, as the OA-1K Skyraider II. Developed under the U.S. Special Operations Command’s (SOCOM) Armed Overwatch program, the aircraft is based on the Air Tractor AT-802 and modified by L3Harris for close air support, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The designation references the Cold War-era A-1 Skyraider, widely used during the Vietnam War.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The OA-1K Skyraider II is derived from the Air Tractor AT-802U Sky Warden, a militarized version of the AT-802 agricultural and firefighting aircraft. (Picture source: AFSOC) Lt. Gen. Michael Conley, AFSOC commander, announced the designation at the Global SOF Foundation’s Special Air Warfare Symposium in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Conley stated that the OA-1K Skyraider II is designed for multiple mission sets, including ISR, close air support, and precision strikes. He emphasized the aircraft’s modularity, allowing it to be reconfigured for different missions. He also noted its capability for rapid deployment, as it can be disassembled for transport inside a C-17 cargo aircraft and reassembled within a day. Conley highlighted that as operators gain experience with the aircraft, its role may evolve beyond initial mission requirements. Brig. Gen. Craig Prather, AFSOC’s director of Strategic Plans, Programs, and Requirements, explained that while the Skyraider II is not intended to engage advanced fighter aircraft, it provides support to special operations forces in low-threat environments. Addressing criticism of its propeller-driven design, he stated that the aircraft’s long loiter time, maneuverability, and adaptability make it effective for its intended role. The OA-1K is equipped with precision-guided munitions, air-to-ground missiles, and electro-optical/infrared sensors. Prather also pointed out that its lower operating cost and ability to provide immediate fire support make it a practical asset for missions requiring persistent overwatch. SOCOM originally planned to procure 75 OA-1K aircraft under a $3 billion contract awarded to L3Harris in August 2022. However, following a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review, the procurement target was reduced to 62 aircraft. The GAO questioned the necessity of such a large fleet after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, where persistent air support was a key requirement. SOCOM officials maintain that the aircraft remains essential for operations in environments where modern jet fighters are unnecessary. The Armed Overwatch program aims to provide sustained ISR and close air support capabilities in regions where higher-cost platforms may be less efficient. AFSOC expects to receive its first operational OA-1K at Hurlburt Field, Florida, in the coming weeks. Two unmodified AT-802 aircraft were delivered in 2024 for pilot familiarization. The 17th Special Operations Squadron is conducting training at Will Rogers Air National Guard Base in Oklahoma. The OA-1K is expected to replace the U-28A Draco, enhancing endurance and operational flexibility for special operations missions. It is scheduled to achieve initial operational capability in 2026, with full fleet delivery expected by 2029. The introduction of the Skyraider II aligns with the Air Force’s plan to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt II, a long-serving close air support aircraft. While the A-10 is known for its survivability and firepower, its phase-out has been contested by those who argue that modern jets cannot fully replace its role. AFSOC officials indicate that the OA-1K can fill a niche in providing close air support in low-threat environments at a lower operational cost. The aircraft is expected to complement other platforms in missions that require rapid deployment to austere locations. The original A-1 Skyraider was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company, introduced in 1946, and was extensively used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. (Picture source: US DoD) L3Harris is exploring additional capabilities for the Skyraider II beyond its light attack and reconnaissance role, including electronic warfare and signals intelligence. The aircraft’s ability to operate from short and unimproved airstrips allows for rapid deployment and crisis response missions. L3Harris has demonstrated that the OA-1K can be disassembled within six hours for transport inside a C-17, enabling global deployment with minimal logistical requirements. Interest in the Skyraider II has extended beyond the U.S., with L3Harris confirming export approval for 22 potential foreign buyers and an additional 15 countries under review. This indicates demand for a cost-effective armed overwatch capability. The OA-1K Skyraider II is derived from the Air Tractor AT-802U Sky Warden, a militarized version of the AT-802 agricultural and firefighting aircraft. The AT-802U was designed for ISR and strike missions in permissive airspace, particularly for counter-insurgency operations. Its rugged construction allows it to operate from austere airstrips with minimal logistical support, a key requirement for special operations forces. The aircraft was selected under the Armed Overwatch program to provide persistent, armed ISR capability while reducing reliance on higher-maintenance platforms. The Skyraider II is equipped with ten external hardpoints capable of carrying a range of precision-guided munitions, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and APKWS laser-guided rockets. It has a maximum speed of 245 miles per hour at 10,000 feet and a range of 1,500 miles at 8,000 feet. The aircraft features a reinforced steel cockpit, self-sealing fuel tanks, and a five-point harness system with airbags. It does not include ejection seats. Its armor protection consists of lightweight composite ballistic shielding around the engine and cockpit, and the airframe is built for an extended operational lifespan with low maintenance requirements. The original A-1 Skyraider was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company and introduced in 1946. It was extensively used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. As a carrier-based attack aircraft, it was designed to carry heavy ordnance loads and provide close air support. The A-1 was particularly noted for its ability to escort search and rescue missions and remain over a battlefield for extended periods. It was eventually replaced by jet-powered platforms. The OA-1K Skyraider II continues this operational concept by adapting similar capabilities for modern special operations requirements, ensuring sustained ISR and close air support in permissive environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-air-force-to-deploy-the-oa-1k-skyraider-ii-as-the-new-primary-light-attack-aircraft-for-special-operations	2025-03-05T01:06:13-08:00

The drone is equipped with a jet engine, enabling it to achieve high speeds and conduct precision strikes. The IRGC considers it a significant addition to its aerial capabilities, complementing its existing fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles. The JAS 313 underwent its first test flight on February 6 aboard the Martyr Baqeri, a drone carrier that joined the IRGC Navy fleet last month. This warship was designed as a mobile maritime platform for deploying drones and helicopters across various operational areas. Iranian authorities have stated that the vessel is equipped with two models of the pilotless version of the Qaher (Conqueror) stealth fighter jet, an aircraft originally unveiled in 2013 and described as being capable of taking off and landing on short runways. The two JAS 313 versions that launched from the Martyr Baqeri on February 6 differ in size. The larger model features a jet engine that enables high-speed operations. According to Rear Admiral Tangsiri, the JAS 313 has a flight endurance of one hour and is designed for both reconnaissance and bombing missions within the IRGC Navy. However, some Iranian social media users mocked the drone’s small size, with one commenting that a more effective model could be found on an online shopping platform. Despite such remarks, Iranian officials continue advancing drone development, considering it a key component of national defense strategy. The unveiling of the JAS 313 comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and Western nations, particularly due to U.S. sanctions imposed on entities based in Hong Kong and mainland China. These entities are accused of supplying critical components for Iran’s drone program. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Iran consistently seeks new ways to acquire Western technology for its UAV programs, relying on front companies and third-party suppliers. Iran has significantly expanded its drone capabilities in recent years. In January, the Iranian military received 1,000 new UAVs, further enhancing its operational capacity. Iranian drones have been used in conflicts across the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen, where they have been linked to several attacks. Additionally, Russia has made extensive use of Iranian-made Shahed drones to strike Ukrainian infrastructure, often integrating them with missile strikes. Iran’s role in supplying drones to Moscow has been highlighted by multiple incidents. Last month, a Russian-launched drone struck the protective shell of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Ukrainian media published images of the drone’s engine, which appeared like that of a Shahed model. Amid ongoing regional tensions, Iran continues to expand its drone arsenal in anticipation of potential confrontations with Israel and the United States. Since the implementation of Washington’s 'maximum pressure' campaign under Donald Trump’s administration, Tehran has intensified efforts to strengthen its defense industry, seeing drones as a strategic tool to project power and enhance military capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/iran-strengthens-navy-with-jas-313-stealth-drone-for-reconnaissance-and-bombing-missions	2025-03-05T00:49:53-08:00

The military engagement of Western powers in the region, notably France and the United States, is partly aimed at ensuring stability and deterring any actions that could disrupt maritime circulation. However, Russia, which until recently maintained a military base in Syria and a Black Sea fleet capable of operating in the Mediterranean, had been intensifying its presence and multiplying shows of force, including naval exercises and aerial interceptions. These operations were part of Moscow’s broader effort to challenge Western influence in this strategic region while protecting its interests in Syria and consolidating its regional alliances. Aerial and maritime incidents, such as the interception of a French drone by a Russian Su-35, illustrated the growing climate of tensions and the risk of escalation between rival forces operating in close proximity. However, the situation in Syria has recently undergone major upheavals. In December 2024, a swift offensive by rebels led to the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, forcing him to flee to Russia. This development has significantly affected Russia’s military presence in Syria. The new Syrian authorities have not severed ties with Moscow nor demanded a complete withdrawal of Russian forces, but they have canceled certain contracts, including the one granting a Russian company control over the port of Tartus. Russian troops have retreated to their main stronghold, the Hmeimim airbase near Latakia, though a total evacuation is not currently planned These dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean echo the escalating tensions in the Baltic Sea, where Russia regularly defies restrictions imposed by NATO and the European Union. Between aggressive overflights, ship interceptions, and suspected sabotage of underwater infrastructure, the confrontation between Moscow and Western nations is becoming increasingly global. In both regions, the main issues revolve around control of strategic routes, energy resources, and military influence, further intensifying the rivalry between Russia and its Western adversaries on multiple simultaneous fronts. Encounters between MQ-9 Reaper drones and Russian Su-35 fighters have become increasingly frequent in recent years, particularly in Syrian airspace and over the Black Sea. One of the most notable incidents occurred on March 14, 2023, when a Russian Su-27 collided with the propeller of a U.S. Reaper, forcing the drone to crash into the Black Sea. Similarly, in July 2023, a Reaper operating in Syria sustained significant damage after being intercepted by a Su-35, which deployed flares nearby, striking the drone’s propeller and compromising its functionality. Such incidents have continued, notably on June 21 and June 27, 2024, when Su-35s engaged in aggressive maneuvers near U.S. Reaper drones over Homs province, compelling the drones to take evasive action to avoid a collision. These dynamics in the Eastern Mediterranean echo the escalating tensions in the Baltic Sea, where Russia regularly defies restrictions imposed by NATO and the European Union. Between aggressive overflights, ship interceptions, and suspected sabotage of underwater infrastructure, the confrontation between Moscow and Western nations is becoming increasingly global. In both regions, the main issues revolve around control of strategic routes, energy resources, and military influence, further intensifying the rivalry between Russia and its Western adversaries on multiple simultaneous fronts. These tense interactions reflect a broader dynamic in which Russia and Western forces engage in a contest for influence in disputed airspaces. In Syria, the near-constant presence of U.S. drones, operating without authorization from Damascus, is viewed by Moscow as an infringement on Syrian sovereignty and a potential threat to Russian military assets.

(Picture source: China MoD) The training exercise, which took place in the strategically sensitive waters of the South China Sea, focused on the integration of multiple naval assets for large-scale amphibious operations. The event is particularly significant given the growing tensions between China and Taiwan, with China increasingly preparing for potential contingencies in the Taiwan Strait and beyond. The Jinggangshan, a Type 071 amphibious dock landing ship, played a pivotal role in the exercise. With a displacement of approximately 20,000 tons and a length of 210 meters, the Jinggangshan is designed to support amphibious landings by carrying up to 800 soldiers, as well as heavy equipment such as tanks and armored vehicles. Its well deck is capable of launching a variety of amphibious landing craft, including air-cushioned landing craft (LCACs), which are essential for delivering troops and vehicles directly onto hostile shorelines. The ship’s flight deck further enhances its versatility, allowing for the deployment of helicopters like the Z-8 or Z-20, providing aerial support and logistical resupply in areas that may be difficult to access by conventional means. These capabilities are critical for rapid power projection, especially in the contested waters around Taiwan. The Hainan, a Type 075 amphibious assault ship, offers even greater operational flexibility. At 250 meters long and displacing 40,000 tons, the Hainan is one of the largest amphibious assault ships in the world. It can carry up to 1,000 troops, 30 amphibious landing craft, and 6 to 8 helicopters, allowing it to launch coordinated assaults using both air and sea assets. The ship's ability to carry heavy artillery and mechanized forces makes it an ideal platform for sustained amphibious operations. Additionally, its large flight deck supports heavy-lift helicopters like the Z-8, enabling rapid troop deployment and providing crucial air support for ground forces. These capabilities make the Hainan an indispensable asset in any large-scale amphibious assault, particularly one involving difficult-to-reach or heavily defended coastal areas, such as Taiwan. The Chaganhu, a comprehensive supply ship, also played a crucial role in the exercise by conducting replenishment-at-sea operations. This logistical support is vital for extending the operational reach of both the Jinggangshan and the Hainan, ensuring that they can remain on station for extended periods without the need to return to port for resupply. The Chaganhu is designed to carry fuel, ammunition, food, and other supplies, allowing the flotilla to operate continuously in maritime environments, even in areas where access to shore-based logistics would be limited or contested. This capability is particularly important for maintaining a sustained military presence in regions like the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. This joint operation underscores the PLA Navy’s increasing focus on integrating its amphibious assets for a wide range of operations, from initial landings to sustained occupation. By combining the capabilities of the Jinggangshan, Hainan, and Chaganhu, the PLA demonstrates its growing ability to conduct complex amphibious assaults, with a focus on rapid deployment, heavy equipment insertion, and logistical sustainment. The timing of the exercise, conducted just months before the release of these images, is highly significant. Tensions over Taiwan remain at the forefront of China’s military planning. The South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait are areas of intense geopolitical competition, with Beijing asserting its territorial claims in the region. As such, the PLA’s emphasis on amphibious warfare is seen as part of its broader strategy to prepare for a potential conflict over Taiwan. The ability to launch a swift, large-scale amphibious assault could be critical in any scenario involving the island, where the PLA would need to quickly establish control over coastal areas, while preventing intervention from foreign powers like the United States. The PLA Southern Theater Command, responsible for operations in the South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and surrounding areas, has been at the forefront of these preparations. With an increasing focus on amphibious training and operational readiness, the command aims to enhance China’s ability to rapidly respond to any escalation in the Taiwan Strait. The release of these images further highlights Beijing's commitment to ensuring its military forces are prepared for a range of contingencies, including amphibious landings in contested areas. China's ongoing investment in amphibious warfare capabilities is reshaping the regional security landscape. The presence of ships like the Jinggangshan and Hainan enables the PLA to project power in critical maritime regions, particularly in scenarios involving Taiwan. These exercises also send a clear signal to Taiwan and its allies about China’s growing military capabilities and its readiness to enforce its territorial claims. While Beijing maintains that military action would only occur in response to Taiwanese moves toward independence or foreign intervention, the frequency and scale of these exercises raise concerns about the potential for conflict in the Taiwan Strait. As tensions in the region continue to rise, the PLA's focus on amphibious warfare and its ability to conduct large-scale operations is likely to be a key factor in future security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific. The growing capabilities of China’s amphibious forces highlight the importance of maintaining a military edge in these contested waters, particularly as the geopolitical balance continues to shift. The PLA Navy’s enhanced readiness for amphibious operations could significantly influence the future trajectory of China-Taiwan relations, with far-reaching implications for regional and global security.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/china-demonstrated-its-capabilities-to-conduct-large-scale-amphibious-operations-during-february-2025-exercise	2025-03-04T05:02:18-08:00

The Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT) is a subsonic, long-range cruise missile with an expected range exceeding 800 km (500 miles). It is priced at approximately $150,000 per unit. According to Scott Callaway, Director of Affordable Mass at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, CMMT is positioned between low-cost standoff glide weapons and more expensive cruise missiles such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), which costs over $1.5 million per unit. If procured by the U.S. Department of Defense, the production capacity could reach 2,500 units per year to support the U.S. military’s effort to sustain a stockpile of cost-effective weapons for potential conflicts, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, while managing budget constraints. The CMMT has two primary configurations. The first is an air-launched variant designed for deployment from U.S. Air Force airlifters, fighters, and bombers, extending strike range. The second is a shorter-range version for rotary-wing aircraft. The system's modularity allows for customization across multiple environments, including maritime strike applications. Lockheed Martin has indicated that CMMT can be deployed in swarms and can integrate varied seeker technologies to optimize targeting efficiency. It is also worth noting that the CMMT is the third missile unveiled by Lockheed Martin in just a few months, following the JASSM-XR and the Mako, highlighting the company's strategic effort to diversify the U.S. armed forces' stockpile. CMMT is part of Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division under Project Carrera, which seeks to develop a flexible autonomy framework for integrating crewed and uncrewed aircraft in collaborative operations. The initiative includes the creation of AI-driven control systems for autonomous drones to operate collaboratively with piloted aircraft such as the F-35, rather than serving as supplementary assets. Early testing has included integrating the Speed Racer drone, a modular payload testbed using digital engineering that has influenced the CMMT design approach, with F-35 fighters to refine operational capabilities. Digital engineering has also allowed Lockheed Martin to reduce the time required to reach the preliminary design review milestone by 50%. Furthermore, Project Carrera builds on previous initiatives, including Skyborg and the X-44A program, which explored AI-driven control systems for uncrewed combat aircraft. In these initiatives, the Skunk Works division tested autonomous drones in combat scenarios, supporting piloted fighters in strike and reconnaissance missions. Early trials have included AI-assisted route planning, sensor integration, and automated threat response. Project Carrera also incorporates Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO) battlespace multipliers, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for beyond-line-of-sight sensing in contested environments and forward-survivable platforms with enhanced sensor capabilities. Integration with Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (JADC2) is a core component, ensuring bi-directional data exchange with command nodes to enhance operational effectiveness. With structured investments of $20 million in crewed and uncrewed assets, $42 million in teaming enablers, and $38 million in battlespace multipliers, Project Carrera is designed to enhance distributed warfare capabilities through networked, AI-enabled systems.

Russian destroyer Severomorsk could become the new flagship of the Baltic Fleet to strengthen its anti-submarine capabilities	According to MilitaryRussia on March 2, 2025, the Baltic Fleet appears to have a new flagship, as the Russian Navy has left the Severomorsk, a Udaloy-class destroyer, in the Baltic Sea following its 14-month technical restoration and combat training, rather than returning it to its home fleet. This decision appears to be related to the status of the Baltic Fleet’s former flagship, the Nastoichivy, which has likely been decommissioned and is awaiting disposal, as suggested by the cessation of its sea deployments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The decision to keep the Severomorsk in the Baltic is driven by the need to enhance the fleet’s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities and support sea trials for new diesel-electric submarines under construction in St. Petersburg. (Picture source: Russian social media) The Baltic Fleet has historically maintained limited anti-submarine warfare (ASW) assets compared to the Northern and Pacific Fleets, with a greater emphasis on surface combatants and smaller multi-role vessels. The removal of the Nastoichivy from operational duty necessitated a replacement, and the ASW-focused Severomorsk could improve the fleet’s ability to detect and engage submarines, as its gas turbine propulsion offers increased reliability and sustained deployment capability compared to the steam-powered Nastoichivy. The Severomorsk is a Project 1155 Udaloy-class destroyer commissioned on January 24, 1988, after being built at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad. Originally laid down as Simferopol, it was renamed Severomorsk in 1996. The ship has served extensively in the Northern Fleet, taking part in various naval exercises, including joint drills with the United States and Norway. It has conducted long-range deployments in multiple theaters, including the Arctic, Mediterranean, and the Gulf of Aden, where it carried out convoy escort missions and counter-piracy operations. It has also been involved in Arctic naval operations, including a mission to the New Siberian Islands and participation in the Northern Sea Route transit. The ship’s armament includes two quadruple launchers for URK-5 Rastrub-B anti-submarine/anti-ship missiles, two Kinzhal surface-to-air missile systems with a total of 64 missiles, and 24 RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers. It is also equipped with two AK-100 naval guns, four AK-630 close-in weapon systems (CIWS), and eight 53-65K 533mm torpedoes. It also carries two Ka-27PL helicopters, which enhance the ship's ability to detect, track, and engage submarines beyond the range of its onboard sonar systems. Its sensor suite includes the Polynom sonar system, which provides long-range submarine detection, and the Frigate radar system, which offers air and surface surveillance. The Severomorsk has a standard displacement of 6,840 tons and a full-load displacement of 7,480 tons. It is 163 meters long, 19 meters wide, and has a draft of 7.8 meters. The ship is powered by four gas turbine engines, each generating 20,000 horsepower, for a total of 80,000 horsepower. This propulsion system allows the ship to reach a maximum speed of 29.5 knots and an operational range of 6,882 nautical miles at economical speed. The ship can remain at sea for up to 30 days without resupply. Compared to earlier Soviet destroyers, its gas turbine propulsion system is more reliable than the steam turbines of the Sovremenny-class, reducing maintenance demands and improving operational availability. The hull design incorporates an extended forecastle for improved seaworthiness, and its dual helicopter hangar provides additional ASW capabilities. The Udaloy-class destroyers, developed under Project 1155 in the 1970s, were designed as specialized ASW ships to operate alongside the missile-armed Sovremenny-class destroyers. Soviet naval doctrine at the time emphasized role specialization, with the Udaloy-class optimized for ASW operations and equipped with long-range sonar, missile-torpedoes, and rocket launchers for engaging submarines. The class was introduced to counter NATO submarine threats, particularly those from the United States and the United Kingdom. While early Udaloy-class ships had limited anti-ship and air defense capabilities, later modifications incorporated improved missile systems and gun armament, making them more versatile. The Nastoichivy, a Project 956 Sovremenny-class destroyer, was among the last of its class to be built in the late 1980s and served as the flagship of the Baltic Fleet. Unlike the Udaloy-class, which was designed primarily for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations, Nastoichivy was optimized for surface warfare, armed with Moskit anti-ship missiles and AK-130 dual naval guns. Its air defense capabilities were based on the Uragan missile system, but its ASW capability was limited, relying only on torpedoes and depth charges. The ship was powered by a steam turbine propulsion system, which required extensive maintenance and had operational limitations compared to gas turbines. The Sovremenny-class, developed under Project 956, was designed in response to NATO’s emphasis on surface warfare in the late 1970s. The class prioritized speed and firepower, equipping each ship with long-range anti-ship missiles and rapid-firing artillery. Built between the late 1970s and early 1990s, these destroyers were initially a key part of the Soviet Navy’s surface strike force. However, their lack of strong ASW capabilities and reliance on steam turbine propulsion reduced their long-term viability. Many units have since been retired or transferred to China, with only a few remaining in service with the Russian Navy. The Nastoichivy, a Project 956 Sovremenny-class destroyer, was among the last of its class to be built in the late 1980s and served as the flagship of the Baltic Fleet.

Taurus KEPD-350 Missile Soon to Be Operational on Swedish Gripen Fighter Jets Enabling Long-Range Precision Strikes	Sweden has initiated negotiations with Germany to integrate the Taurus KEPD-350 air-launched cruise missile into its fleet of Saab JAS39 Gripen C/D fighters, according to a recent document from the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), highlighted by The Aviationist. This initiative is part of a broader plan to modernize Sweden’s air force, which includes the gradual phase-out of 45 Gripen C/D aircraft from the current fleet of 105. These will be replaced with newly built Gripen E/F variants and 60 upgraded Gripen C/Ds. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 on the Gripen C is expected to reach initial operational capability by 2028, with its integration on the Gripen E to follow at a later stage (Picture source: Saab) The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 on the Gripen C is expected to reach initial operational capability by 2028, with its integration on the Gripen E to follow at a later stage. Saab, one of the development partners of the missile alongside MBDA Germany, has previously showcased the KEPD-350 as part of the Gripen’s weapon package, though it remains unclear whether it has been live-fired from the aircraft. As a NATO member, Sweden might also consider alternatives such as the AGM-158 JASSM, already acquired by other alliance members, including Poland. The Taurus KEPD-350 is a long-range cruise missile designed for precision strikes against fortified targets. It has a range of 500 km and flies at an altitude of only 35 meters above the ground, reaching a speed of Mach 0.95 (approximately 1,170 km/h). Its 481 kg MEPHISTO warhead features a dual-charge configuration, allowing it to penetrate heavily protected structures. Comparable to the British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG, it provides deep-strike capability for strategic targets. Interest in this missile in Europe has grown, particularly due to its potential deployment in Sweden. In operational scenarios, Gripen aircraft could use Agile Combat Employment (ACE) tactics, utilizing roads and highways as temporary runways to quickly reposition in the Scandinavian terrain. This approach would enhance Sweden’s air force resilience in case of an attack while taking advantage of gaps in Russian defenses to conduct long-range strikes against key targets. South Korea has also demonstrated the effectiveness of the Taurus KEPD-350, integrating it into its fleet of F-15K Slam Eagles in 2016. The missile was used in live-fire exercises in 2017 and, more recently, in October 2024. Its adoption by other air forces further establishes it as a reliable cruise missile capable of operating in modern threat environments. Alongside the Taurus KEPD-350 integration, Sweden is upgrading 60 Gripen C/D aircraft as part of an obsolescence management program. These aircraft will be upgraded to the MS20 Block 3 standard starting in 2026, followed by the MS20 Block 4 upgrade in 2028. The modification process, which began in 2024, will continue until 2027, ensuring sufficient operational capability for training missions and the transition to Gripen E. The planned phase-out of 45 Gripen C/Ds will be adjusted depending on the operational availability of the new Gripen E variants. Sweden’s Gripen program is also directly linked to military assistance for Ukraine. On September 9, 2024, Stockholm announced a $443 million aid package to acquire Gripen spare parts, potentially preparing for a future transfer of aircraft to Kyiv. This support aligns with Sweden’s broader strategy of strengthening Ukraine’s defense capabilities. However, Stockholm remains cautious about the timeline for deliveries, considering ongoing international negotiations and the requirements of its own air force. The development of the Gripen E program has undergone multiple adjustments since its launch in 2013, particularly to align Swedish requirements with those of international customers. Deliveries to the Swedish and Brazilian air forces began in 2020, and Saab has since received orders for conversion kits to upgrade 20 Gripen C/D aircraft to Gripen E. The aim is to achieve a higher level of technical maturity while slightly slowing production to optimize performance. The Swedish Air Force plans to introduce the Gripen E at Såtenäs Air Base by late 2025, though its initial deployment will be limited. Additionally, Saab has received a SEK 1.7 billion order to maintain and modernize Taurus KEPD-350 missiles currently in service with the German Air Force. The contract, signed with TAURUS Systems—a joint venture between MBDA Germany and Saab—includes a major system upgrade and ten years of maintenance from 2025 to 2035. These enhancements will improve the missile’s capabilities to meet evolving operational requirements. The integration of the Taurus KEPD-350 into Sweden’s Gripen fleet represents a significant development in the country’s long-range strike capabilities, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions in Europe. By combining an agile platform like the Gripen with a cruise missile capable of neutralizing strategic targets at extended ranges, Sweden strengthens its deterrence posture and enhances its operational flexibility. Future developments in the Gripen program, as well as decisions regarding Ukraine and Sweden’s air force modernization, will have a lasting impact on the country’s defense strategy in the coming years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/taurus-kepd-350-missile-soon-to-be-operational-on-swedish-gripen-fighter-jets-enabling-long-range-precision-strikes	2025-03-03T00:46:53-08:00

Focus: What Are the Nuclear Capabilities of France After President Macron's Offer to Protect Europe Against Russia?	On March 1, 2025, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that he was ready to initiate discussions on nuclear deterrence for Europe, signaling that France could extend its nuclear protection to other European Union (EU) member states in light of the increasing security threats posed by Russia. This statement marks a pivotal moment in European defense, suggesting that France, with its advanced nuclear capabilities, may play a more prominent role in safeguarding the continent’s security amid growing geopolitical tensions, particularly as Russia’s actions in Ukraine and military assertiveness in Eastern Europe continue to unsettle the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Rafale fighter aircraft equipped with the ASMP-A supersonic nuclear missile. (Picture source: MBDA) France has long maintained a robust nuclear deterrent, positioning itself as one of the leading nuclear powers globally. The French nuclear arsenal is primarily designed to defend national sovereignty, but in the context of the evolving security environment in Europe, Macron’s comments suggest a shift towards a more collaborative European nuclear posture. President Macron’s willingness to explore the idea of extending France's nuclear umbrella to other EU countries could signify an evolution in the continent's defense strategies, underscoring France's leadership role within both NATO and the EU. France’s nuclear deterrence is built around three primary elements: land-based missiles, air-launched systems, and sea-based platforms, each playing a critical role in ensuring the country's second-strike capability. These three pillars work together to provide France with a comprehensive and survivable nuclear force, capable of responding to any existential threat. While these forces are primarily intended to safeguard France’s own security, they also form the foundation for any potential broader European nuclear deterrence discussions that Macron alluded to. At the heart of France’s land-based nuclear deterrent are the M51 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which are primarily deployed on the Triomphant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). These missiles have a range of approximately 8,000 km and can carry multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), each with a nuclear warhead. This ensures that France can strike adversaries from a considerable distance, even in the event of a first-strike attack. The M51 system represents one of the most reliable and survivable elements of France’s nuclear strategy. While France does not currently have land-based ICBMs in the traditional sense, the strategic role of submarine-launched M51 missiles ensures that French nuclear forces are second-to-none when it comes to survivability. In terms of air-launched nuclear capabilities, France’s focus is on the ASMP-A (Air-Sol Moyenne Portée-Amélioré) cruise missile, which is deployed on both Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft and Mirage 2000N bombers. The ASMP-A missile is a supersonic, air-to-ground missile designed to deliver nuclear warheads to strategic targets at distances of up to 300 km. The French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) provides the air component of France’s nuclear triad, ensuring that the country can launch nuclear strikes from airbases or aircraft carriers, depending on the operational requirements. The Rafale fighter, with its high agility, versatility, and proven combat record, serves as the primary platform for the delivery of nuclear payloads. France is also planning to integrate future generations of missiles and aircraft, ensuring that its nuclear deterrent remains cutting-edge and capable of evolving alongside emerging technological threats. By far, the most prominent component of France's nuclear deterrent is its sea-based leg, which is centered around the Triomphant-class SSBNs. These submarines carry M51 ICBMs, which have the ability to strike enemy targets thousands of kilometers away while maintaining an untraceable presence beneath the ocean's surface. There are four Triomphant-class SSBNs in service, and they are equipped with the M51 missiles, each capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads. The SSBNs operate under strict nuclear deterrence protocols, and their survivability at sea ensures that France’s nuclear deterrent is never fully neutralized in the event of an attack. These submarines can remain submerged for extended periods, making them a virtually impregnable component of France’s deterrent. This highly survivable second-strike capability means that even in a scenario where French land-based or air-launched nuclear assets are neutralized, the nation can still retaliate with devastating effect from its nuclear-powered submarines. President Macron’s recent comments about European nuclear deterrence come as Europe faces growing geopolitical instability, particularly with Russia's actions in Ukraine and its renewed military assertiveness in Eastern Europe. In this context, Macron has indicated that France is willing to discuss the possibility of extending its nuclear umbrella over other EU member states, potentially enhancing security cooperation within NATO and the EU. Macron’s remarks are timely, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has raised concerns about the security of NATO’s eastern flank. While the alliance has worked to bolster its defenses, the reality is that nuclear deterrence remains a cornerstone of military strategy, especially for nations like France that possess advanced nuclear arsenals. The President’s comments suggest a willingness to deepen defense ties within the EU, including sharing strategic nuclear deterrence to better secure the continent. If Macron's proposal gains traction, France could theoretically offer extended nuclear protection to other EU member states. However, several technical and political factors would need to be addressed, including political consensus within the EU and the logistics of nuclear sharing arrangements. NATO has long used a nuclear-sharing arrangement with several countries, such as Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, allowing these nations to host nuclear weapons as part of the broader alliance. France’s willingness to allow other EU states access to its nuclear deterrent would mark an evolution of this concept and could change the dynamics of European defense. Additionally, extending nuclear deterrence would require detailed agreements on command and control protocols, ensuring that France retains control over its nuclear arsenal while simultaneously offering security guarantees to its European partners. Several NATO member countries also possess or host nuclear capabilities that contribute to the alliance's overall deterrence strategy. The United Kingdom maintains a nuclear deterrent based on the Trident II D5 SLBMs deployed aboard Vanguard-class SSBNs, while the United States provides a significant share of NATO’s nuclear forces through its arsenal of ICBMs, SLBMs, and B61 nuclear bombs stationed in various European countries. Germany, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands all participate in NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangements, hosting U.S. nuclear weapons and ensuring that their aircraft are capable of delivering these weapons in a crisis. Although these countries do not have independent nuclear arsenals, they play a vital role in NATO’s nuclear posture. France’s nuclear deterrent, consisting of land-based, air-launched, and sea-based capabilities, is one of the most sophisticated in the world. President Macron's recent statements on discussing nuclear deterrence for Europe are part of a broader strategy to bolster European security, particularly in light of growing tensions with Russia. While much remains to be discussed, France's nuclear capabilities could play a crucial role in shaping the future of defense policy in Europe, ensuring stability, and providing a powerful deterrent against any potential aggressors. Should Macron’s proposal come to fruition, it could lead to a more integrated European defense strategy, enhancing security across the continent while reinforcing the collective security framework within NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-what-are-the-nuclear-capabilities-of-france-after-president-macrons-offer-to-protect-europe-against-russia	2025-03-02T05:08:19-08:00

Exclusive: Iran Strengthens Armored Forces with Delivery of Modernized US M60 Tank Suleiman-402	According to information published by several Iranian media outlets on February 27, 2025, Iran has received new military equipment, including the Suleiman-402, an upgraded version of the American-made M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (MBT). This new delivery is part of the country's ongoing efforts to enhance its military capabilities, particularly its armored forces, as Iran seeks to modernize and strengthen its defense industry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The official delivery ceremony of the Suleiman-402 tank to the Iranian Army marked a significant upgrade to the country's armored forces with the modernized US-made M60 platform. (Picture source: Iranian press agency) The M60 MBT (Main Battle Tank), originally developed by the United States in the 1950s and introduced into service in 1960, has been a significant component of Iran’s ground forces for decades. Iran first acquired a substantial number of M60 tanks during the 1970s, as part of a broader military modernization program under the regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. These tanks were part of Iran's military partnership with the United States before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Following the revolution, Iran found itself cut off from American military supplies, but the M60s remained an important part of the Iranian Army's armored forces. Over the years, Iran has made extensive efforts to maintain and upgrade these tanks, ensuring they remained operational and effective for several decades. The Suleiman-402, which is the latest variant of the M60 in the Iranian Army, represents a significant leap forward in the country's tank modernization efforts. The Iranian Army’s continued reliance on the M60 platform has driven the need for upgrades to improve its firepower, mobility, and survivability in modern combat situations. Although specific details of the Suleiman-402 remain largely unconfirmed due to the classified nature of such military projects, several enhancements have been suggested based on Iranian media reports and expert analysis. One of the primary upgrades is likely to be in the tank's armor protection. The Suleiman-402 is expected to feature enhanced composite and reactive armor, offering better defense against contemporary anti-tank weapons such as guided missiles, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and other modern threats. This upgraded armor would significantly improve the tank's survivability on the battlefield, especially in the face of more sophisticated and potent anti-tank systems used by adversaries. Another major improvement is in the tank's firepower. The Suleiman-402 is expected to be equipped with a 120mm smoothbore cannon, replacing the original M60’s rifled gun. The smoothbore cannon allows the tank to fire more advanced, high-velocity rounds, including armor-piercing munitions, which would significantly improve its ability to engage and destroy modern enemy armored vehicles at longer ranges. This upgrade enhances the tank's role in armored warfare, particularly in countering heavily armored threats on the battlefield. In terms of mobility, the Suleiman-402 is believed to have a more powerful engine, which would improve its speed, agility, and overall operational range. This engine upgrade is essential in ensuring the tank can effectively maneuver across various terrains and remain competitive in high-speed engagements with other modern armored vehicles. The fire control system of the Suleiman-402 is another area where significant improvements have been made. The tank is expected to feature an upgraded fire control system, including more advanced targeting sensors, ballistic computers, and enhanced night-vision capabilities. These upgrades will improve the tank’s effectiveness in low-visibility conditions, allowing it to engage targets with higher precision during both daytime and nighttime operations. The integration of more modern electronics would also allow the Suleiman-402 to better coordinate with other units on the battlefield, a crucial advantage in today’s networked warfare environments. While still speculative, there is also some possibility that the Suleiman-402 could include autonomous features to enhance its operational efficiency. This could include improvements in automated targeting or loading systems, although the specifics of such technologies have yet to be confirmed. The delivery of the Suleiman-402 is part of Iran's broader drive to bolster its indigenous defense industry, which has become an increasingly critical aspect of its military strategy. Over the years, Iran has faced significant international sanctions that have restricted its ability to acquire advanced foreign military technology. As a result, Iran has focused on developing and producing its own weapons systems, from tanks and armored vehicles to missiles and aircraft. This emphasis on self-sufficiency allows Iran to mitigate the effects of sanctions and reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers, particularly those in the West. The development of indigenous defense technologies, such as the Suleiman-402, reflects Iran’s desire for greater autonomy in its defense capabilities. The country’s ability to produce advanced military equipment locally not only ensures that it can continue to modernize its forces but also positions Iran as a self-reliant military power capable of maintaining its defense posture without external assistance. In the face of regional instability and ongoing geopolitical tensions, this strategic independence in defense production has become a top priority for the Iranian government. The Suleiman-402 tank, along with other domestic military projects, forms part of Iran’s vision for a more advanced and resilient military force. By upgrading its fleet of M60 tanks, Iran is able to extend the service life of these armored vehicles while enhancing their effectiveness on modern battlefields. This strategy of upgrading older platforms is an essential part of Iran’s military modernization efforts, which also include other indigenous systems, such as the Karrar main battle tank and various missile defense systems. The delivery of the Suleiman-402 highlights the growing importance of self-reliance in Iran's military strategy. This new tank will play a significant role in the Iranian Army's armored forces, complementing other modernized platforms and contributing to the country’s overall defense capabilities. In an era of increasing regional volatility and rising military tensions, the Suleiman-402 is a testament to Iran’s determination to enhance its military strength through domestic innovation and production. In conclusion, the Suleiman-402 is more than just an upgraded version of the M60 tank; it is a symbol of Iran’s broader strategic goal of achieving self-sufficiency in defense technology. As Iran continues to modernize its military, this tank will play an important role in enhancing its armored forces’ capabilities and bolstering its defense posture in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment. The Suleiman-402 not only improves Iran’s military capabilities but also underscores the country's commitment to technological independence in its defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-iran-strengthens-armored-forces-with-delivery-of-modernized-us-m60-tank-suleiman-402	2025-03-01T09:24:15-08:00	
Flash News: US Army to Field First Land-Based Variant of New LRHW Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon in 2025	The U.S. Army is set to deploy its land mobile version of its Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) to an operational unit by the end of 2025, as revealed in a recent U.S. Congress report released on February 27, 2025. This marks a significant leap forward in the U.S. Army's modernization efforts and highlights the growing importance of hypersonic technology in the evolving landscape of modern warfare. The LRHW is part of a broader strategy to ensure the U.S. military maintains its technological edge over adversaries who are rapidly developing advanced missile technologies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Army Soldiers assigned to Bravo Battery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery, Long Range Fires Battalion, 1st Multi-Domain Task Force, demonstrate the capabilities of one of the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon LRHW Transporter Erector Launchers participating in exercise Bamboo Eagle 24-3 on Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., August 2, 2024. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Hypersonic weapons, such as the LRHW (Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon), are a category of missiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5—five times the speed of sound—and can even reach speeds up to Mach 20, or roughly 24,000 kilometers per hour. What sets these weapons apart from traditional missiles is their ability to travel at hypersonic speeds while maintaining maneuverability mid-flight. Unlike conventional ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable arc, hypersonic weapons can adjust their flight path during the missile's trajectory, making them much harder to intercept with existing missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability gives hypersonic weapons a clear advantage in both offensive and defensive operations, allowing them to evade interception and strike with extreme precision, making them a game-changer in modern military strategy. The LRHW, designed to deliver these hypersonic capabilities, is a long-range, ground-launched missile system that combines an advanced hypersonic glide body with a conventional warhead. This combination enables the U.S. Army to strike targets at ranges far beyond those achievable by traditional artillery or missile systems. The LRHW has a reported range of approximately 2,776 kilometers (1,725 miles) and can travel at speeds exceeding 6,100 kilometers per hour (3,800 miles per hour). The weapon is capable of reaching the top of the Earth's atmosphere and remaining just beyond the reach of current air and missile defense systems until it is ready to strike, at which point it becomes nearly impossible to intercept or defend against. The LRHW can engage a variety of high-value targets, such as enemy command centers, naval fleets, missile defense sites, and strategic infrastructure, all with minimal warning. Its ability to reach these targets at extremely high speeds, coupled with its precision, makes it a formidable tool in both conventional and strategic warfare scenarios. The LRHW system provides the U.S. Army with a strategic attack weapon designed to defeat Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities, suppress adversary long-range fires, and engage other high-priority or time-critical targets. As part of the U.S. Army’s modernization efforts, it is seen as a critical asset for deterring potential adversaries, particularly in regions where military access is restricted or contested. In addition, the U.S. Army’s LRHW development program is closely aligned with the U.S. Navy's efforts, enhancing the overall interoperability of the military’s hypersonic missile capabilities. The LRHW is made up of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (C-HGB) and a 34.5-inch booster developed by the Navy, with the missile component being developed by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. The missile is designed to be launched from a land-based, truck-launched system, giving it the flexibility and mobility to be deployed in a wide variety of operational environments. When the hypersonic glide body is attached, it is referred to as the Navy-Army All Up Round plus Canister (AUR+C). This missile component serves as the common two-stage booster for both the U.S. Army’s LRHW and the U.S. Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) system, which can be fired from both surface vessels and submarines. The U.S. Army’s integration of the LRHW into its arsenal represents a significant leap in strike capability, offering the ability to engage targets at long ranges, outpacing traditional missile defense systems. The weapon’s speed, maneuverability, and precision make it a formidable tool in the U.S. military’s arsenal, with the ability to deter adversaries and respond rapidly to evolving threats. The deployment of hypersonic weapons like the LRHW is especially critical in the current geopolitical environment, where rival powers such as China and Russia are also developing similar technologies. The LRHW offers the U.S. Army a critical strategic advantage by ensuring that it can strike at high-priority targets in enemy territory at speeds that are difficult to defend against. The weapon's ability to rapidly change its trajectory mid-flight further complicates the task of intercepting or neutralizing the threat, making it an essential element in the U.S. military's deterrence strategy. In August 2024, a significant milestone in the LRHW program occurred when the U.S. Army’s only LRHW battery, part of the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF), participated in Bamboo Eagle, an eight-day joint exercise led by the U.S. Air Force. The exercise, which took place across various locations in the U.S., was the first time that U.S. Army land-based fires were integrated into an Air Force-led exercise. Over 3,000 service members from the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and even allied forces like the Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force participated. The integration of the LRHW into Bamboo Eagle 24-3 showcased the U.S. military's ability to operate across multiple domains, including land, air, sea, and cyber, in a coordinated and effective manner. This participation demonstrated the LRHW's potential for joint operations, proving that it could serve as a key element in integrated, multi-service military operations, providing a versatile and powerful strike capability. The U.S. Army originally planned to deploy the LRHW to the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, specifically to the 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, 17th Field Artillery Brigade. However, the latest reports indicate that it is still unclear whether this specific unit will be the first to receive the LRHW, or if other units will be chosen for its initial deployment. Despite the uncertainty around the exact deployment location, the U.S. Army is on track to begin fielding the LRHW by the end of 2025, with the goal of having the system fully operational shortly thereafter. Looking to the future, the LRHW is expected to be just the beginning of the U.S. Army's hypersonic missile program. The U.S. Army is continuing to refine the LRHW's capabilities and is also working on developing additional hypersonic systems, including air-launched and sea-launched variants. These systems will complement the LRHW, enabling the U.S. military to maintain a strategic edge in high-speed, precision strikes across various domains. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare cannot be overstated. With their ability to strike rapidly and with precision, hypersonic missiles are seen as a key deterrent against adversaries who may otherwise feel emboldened to challenge U.S. military forces. These weapons represent a significant shift in how the U.S. military will engage in future conflicts, offering capabilities that are not only faster but also harder to predict and defend against. The LRHW, as part of the U.S. Army’s overall strategy, will provide a vital asset in future conflicts, allowing the U.S. to project power more effectively and rapidly than ever before, ensuring that it remains a dominant force in global military affairs.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-army-to-field-first-land-based-variant-of-new-lrhw-long-range-hypersonic-weapon-in-2025	2025-03-01T07:23:57-08:00
