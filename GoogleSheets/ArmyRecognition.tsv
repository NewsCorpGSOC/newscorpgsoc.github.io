Breaking News: Trump Elected President Signals Shift in US Military Strategy and Ukraine Aid	Donald Trump's return to the White House is set to bring significant changes to U.S. military and foreign policy, with major implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly questioned the scale and focus of American support for Ukraine, suggesting he would reduce or reevaluate aid to Kyiv. His previous administration had a complex relationship with Russia and NATO, leading to uncertainty among allies about America’s long-term commitments. Now, his re-election suggests a shift towards a more isolationist approach that prioritizes U.S. interests over international military engagements.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Ukraine Defense Contact Group attendees are welcomed at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, on March 19, 2024, with Ukrainian and U.S. flags symbolizing the strong international support for Ukraine's defense efforts. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has become Kyiv's leading military supporter, committing over $54 billion in security assistance to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russian forces. This support includes sophisticated systems such as Patriot missile batteries, HIMARS rocket artillery, Abrams tanks, and a range of air defense and anti-tank weapons essential for countering Russian advancements. The aid has been crucial in strengthening Ukraine's defensive capabilities on multiple fronts, allowing it to push back against Russian troops and protect vital urban areas. Despite bipartisan support in Congress for Ukraine funding, Trump’s return to office signals a potential reevaluation of this strategy, with the former president indicating that he would convert some aid to loans and possibly reduce overall funding, a move that has drawn both support and criticism from NATO allies and within U.S. political circles concerned about maintaining Ukraine’s resilience. Trump has pledged to bring a quick end to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, asserting he could negotiate a peace settlement 'within 24 hours' of taking office. However, the details of this strategy still need to be clarified. His stated approach involves high-stakes negotiations with both Moscow and Kyiv, potentially including cuts to U.S. military assistance as a means to pressure both sides toward an agreement. While this aligns with the preferences of some of Trump’s voter base—many of whom support reducing aid to Ukraine—critics warn that such a move could embolden Russian ambitions and potentially destabilize the region further if it compromises Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty. Trump’s stance on foreign aid comes amid a broader reorientation of U.S. defense priorities, with the fiscal year 2024 defense budget projected to be a record $842 billion. This budget reflects a shift toward modernization and high-priority technologies to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. For example, significant funding has been allocated to nuclear arsenal upgrades, advanced cyber capabilities, and expanding U.S. military presence in Asia. Under Trump, this trend may accelerate, potentially reducing the American military footprint in Europe while focusing on domestic and Indo-Pacific security interests. NATO allies, already preparing for a potential reduction in U.S. support for Ukraine, are exploring mechanisms to ensure continuity in assistance independent of American aid to maintain Ukraine’s defenses in the face of these potential shifts. Trump’s re-election has spurred NATO and European allies to prepare for potential shifts in the U.S.-led support structure. During his previous term, Trump urged NATO members to increase their defense contributions, and he is expected to renew those demands. Recently, NATO has been working to assume a more direct role in coordinating military aid for Ukraine, a step seen as a means of maintaining consistent support even if U.S. contributions are curtailed. European allies, including Germany and France, have expressed a commitment to uphold assistance for Ukraine’s defense, regardless of the U.S.’s level of engagement. However, Trump’s approach may strain transatlantic relations, as allies brace for possible adjustments in U.S. defense strategy. As Trump’s administration prepares to reenter the global stage with new policies, Ukraine’s allies are weighing how these changes might impact Kyiv’s ongoing fight against Russian aggression. European governments are poised to fill potential gaps in military aid, and NATO is adjusting its strategy to ensure continuity in Ukraine’s defense. Meanwhile, Ukrainian leaders brace for potentially significant shifts in the diplomatic relationship with Washington, anticipating that the coming months may bring both challenges and new avenues in their efforts to secure peace.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-trump-elected-president-signals-shift-in-us-military-strategy-and-ukraine-aid	2024-11-06T02:31:01-08:00

France Positions to Equip Cyprus with Leclerc Tanks and Mistral Missiles in Response to Turkish Ambitions	In the context of strengthening the military arsenal of the Republic of Cyprus in response to Turkish ambitions, France is working to maintain a significant influence within the Cypriot National Guard, as reported by the Cypriot daily Kathimerini on October 13, 2024. Competing directly with Germany, Paris is promoting several advanced weapon systems for Cyprus, including Leclerc tanks and Mistral missiles. Now reaching the end of its operational cycle within the Cypriot forces, the latter system could be removed from the island's arsenal and redirected to Ukraine, thereby allowing partial renewal with more modern French equipment. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France is also urging Cyprus to consider acquiring Leclerc tanks, competing directly with Germany’s military industry for a potential €250 million contract (Picture source: French MoD) Among the French equipment already supplied to Cyprus are attack helicopters, marking an initial step in military cooperation between the two nations. France now also targets the market for Cypriot battle tanks, aiming to replace the T-80U of Russian origin. This market is particularly competitive, with Germany offering its Leopard tanks. To reinforce its position, France has extended a broader offer that includes additional military systems. A key element of the negotiation revolves around Mistral missiles, acquired forty years ago and primarily used for training. Paris has proposed reclaiming these now-obsolete missiles to reallocate them to Ukraine, where they could see a second operational life. Currently, the National Guard possesses between 150 and 170 of these short-range anti-aircraft systems, which have reached the end of their operational life. In exchange, France would offer Cyprus financial benefits, such as discounts on new Mistral missiles or other French-made equipment. Although this offer appears attractive, Cypriot officials have expressed their intention to negotiate better terms, particularly in terms of compensation, before making a final decision. Beyond the Mistral systems, France is also urging Cyprus to consider acquiring Leclerc tanks, competing directly with Germany’s military industry for a potential €250 million contract. The exact nature of the proposed Leclerc tanks, whether new or used, remains unclear, but France may consider providing second-hand units from a lot previously sold to the United Arab Emirates. Drawing on its past support during the U.S. arms embargo on Cyprus, when France was one of the few countries supplying modern weapons, Paris hopes to leverage this privileged relationship to secure a position in this market. France and Cyprus have a longstanding military cooperation, with several French systems holding an important place within the National Guard's arsenal. Over the past decade, Cyprus has invested approximately €310 million in French military equipment. Recent acquisitions include upgraded Mistral and Exocet systems, along with anti-tank missiles and French armored vehicles. The range of French systems, including attack helicopters, rocket systems, tanks, and self-propelled guns, underscores France's commitment to securing long-term defense contracts with Nicosia. The competition to renew Cypriot military equipment is intensifying as Germany, with its Leopard tanks, competes with Paris for strategic contracts. However, France relies on its historic support during the U.S. embargo, hoping to persuade Nicosia to choose French equipment for its next acquisitions. These proposals, submitted before last summer, have not yet received a formal response. However, they could enable Cyprus to continue modernizing its forces in response to Turkey's growing ambitions in the region, marked by frequent military exercises and regular reinforcement of Turkish forces on the island. Beyond simply providing armaments, France views this military cooperation as an opportunity to affirm its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean, where strategic interests are increasingly contested.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-positions-to-equip-cyprus-with-leclerc-tanks-and-mistral-missiles-in-response-to-turkish-ambitions	2024-11-06T01:36:29-08:00

Initially targeted for export, the model eventually attracted attention from the PLA, particularly the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which evaluated a carrier-capable version under the designation J-35. The naval variant completed its maiden flight on October 29, 2021, featuring modifications like a launch bar and folding wings for carrier operations. Significant changes between the earlier FC-31 demonstrator and the J-35A, a land-based variant of the J-35 naval fighter, include a new radome without a pitot tube, an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), updated nose and main landing gear bay doors, a modified Diverterless Supersonic Inlet (DSI), and a redesigned canopy. The airframe now includes a gun pod, a wide-area heads-up display, and a Luneburg lens to assist with radar signature management. Observations indicate that the fighter’s twin vertical stabilizers and twin-engine configuration include a serrated nozzle, which could be powered by either the WS-13 or the RD-33-derived WS-21 engines, both of which offer similar performance levels. Alongside the domestic J-35A variant, an export version, the J-35E, has been developed. However, the carrier-based J-35 variant currently lacks an international market, as few nations possess the extensive resources required for naval operations. The naval J-35 version could provide carrier-based capabilities, though this would be feasible mainly for nations with catapult launch systems, thus narrowing its potential market. Military analyst Li Li, quoted by China Central Television News, states that the J-35A’s induction marks an expansion in the PLAAF’s stealth capabilities, positioning it alongside the J-20. This step could align PLAAF’s capabilities with the U.S. Air Force, which operates the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. Within the PLAAF, the J-35A joins an informal fleet lineup known as the 'Four Musketeers,' comprising the J-10C, J-16, J-20, and the new J-35A. Notably, this reveal coincides with the 75th-anniversary celebrations of the PLAAF, during which the air force will feature 36 different types of equipment through flight demonstrations and static displays. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. Images depict the J-35A positioned in a shelter typically used by the PLAAF, emphasizing its role as a land-based model. However, the new J-35A could potentially serve as a main carrier aircraft in a naval variant, which would align with China’s expanding capabilities in both aerial and maritime domains. The J-35A’s release on U.S. election day has led to comparisons with the American F-35A, particularly due to similarities in stealth characteristics and specific design elements. (Picture source: US DoD and CCTV News) Reports over the years have noted speculation that the J-31’s development, which led to the J-35A, may have drawn on data from the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program, which led to the F-35, though these claims remain unverified. Some Russian aviation experts have asserted that the J-31 is a domestic design, independent of existing Western aircraft. The design's evolution, including stealth capabilities and multi-role features, indicates a continued focus by China on producing advanced fifth-generation fighters. The F-35 and J-35A display clear visual distinctions that suggest differences in design priorities and potential roles. The F-35 has a rounded, gently sloped nose, while the J-35A's nose is sharper with a more defined chine line. This difference is also evident in the canopy shape: the F-35 features a single-piece, bubble-style canopy with a smooth curve, whereas the J-35A’s canopy is slightly more angular and has a flatter profile. In terms of engine exhaust nozzles, the F-35 uses a polygonal design intended to enhance certain performance characteristics, while the J-35A, typically seen with a rounder exhaust, reflects a different approach in nozzle configuration. The intake designs also vary, with the F-35 featuring larger, straight-sided intakes positioned close to the fuselage, and the J-35A’s narrower intakes angled slightly outward, giving it a distinctive shape. The wing shapes and positions add further contrast between the two aircraft. The F-35’s trapezoidal wings integrate with the fuselage in one configuration, while the J-35A’s trapezoidal wings are larger and have a different placement, possibly reflecting considerations for carrier-based operations. The tail fin design diverges as well: the F-35’s vertical stabilizers are shorter and blend closely into the fuselage, while the J-35A’s stabilizers are taller and angled outward, resembling other designs in China's stealth aircraft lineup, such as the J-20. Finally, the landing gear differs in structure and placement. The F-35 has thicker landing gear, positioned in alignment with its structural design, while the J-35A’s landing gear may be adapted for carrier operations, following certain design conventions observed in other Chinese aircraft. These distinctions suggest each aircraft's design reflects specific operational requirements and design philosophies, with the F-35 and J-35A each incorporating elements that align with their respective priorities and roles.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-to-know-about-chinas-new-j-35a-stealth-fighter-as-a-potential-us-f-35-competitor	2024-11-05T02:45:23-08:00

This deployment is part of a broader strategy recently outlined by the Pentagon, which includes the addition of fighter aircraft, tankers, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers equipped with Aegis ballistic missile defense systems. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder stated that this increased military presence aims to deter Iran and its allies from any hostile actions against U.S. personnel or interests, with the assurance that any attacks would prompt a decisive response. The Middle East has seen several notable incidents this year, including repeated strikes between Iran and Israel. In April, an Iranian attack followed an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus, and in October, further actions purportedly in retaliation for targeted eliminations of Iranian-aligned leaders raised concerns over potential escalation. In response, the U.S. aims to strengthen its deterrent posture in the region, with the B-52s playing a central role due to their long-range strike capacity. The presence of B-52 bombers underscores the strategic flexibility of the U.S., as these aircraft can deliver both conventional and nuclear payloads and perform a variety of missions such as strategic attack, close air support, air interdiction, and maritime operations. This heightened military presence comes at a time of increased regional tensions, with Israel recently deploying approximately 100 fighter jets, including F-35s, in strikes targeting Iranian bases, and Iran responding in October with a substantial missile strike against Israel, claiming it as retaliation for attacks on Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. The deployments are expected to continue over the coming months, even as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, stationed in the region since August, is set to depart. Meanwhile, the U.S. has bolstered Israel's missile defense capabilities with the deployment of a THAAD system, designed to intercept ballistic missiles in their terminal phase, and accompanied by 100 U.S. service members for operation support. The B-52 is not the only strategic bomber currently mobilized. In parallel, the U.S. deployed the B-1B Lancer to the Korean Peninsula, conducting trilateral exercises with South Korean and Japanese fighters in response to North Korea's recent intercontinental ballistic missile test. This deployment alongside Asian allies also emphasizes a shared commitment to counter North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. The increased presence of strategic bombers in both regions demonstrates the U.S.'s rapid deployment capability to deter adversaries in sensitive global areas, including Iran, North Korea, and China. In June 2024, B-52s were deployed to Guam for a live-fire test involving the AGM-183 hypersonic weapon, highlighting their strategic role in the Pacific. In summary, the deployment of B-52 bombers to the Middle East reflects the U.S.'s commitment to maintaining regional stability amid persistent threats from Iran and its allies. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s message remains clear: any attack on U.S. interests will be met with prompt and proportionate defensive measures. These actions underscore the U.S.'s resolve to protect its interests and support its partners during a period of heightened regional tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-air-force-strengthens-its-presence-in-middle-east-with-deployment-of-new-b-52h-bombers-amid-tensions-with-iran	2024-11-05T01:52:06-08:00

Exclusive: Israeli Army Explores Formation of Anti-Tank Units with Seized Hezbollah Kornet and Almas Missiles	In a report published on November 4, 2024, by Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, the Israeli army is reportedly examining the potential to create specialized anti-tank units equipped with seized Hezbollah anti-tank weaponry, including thousands of Russian-made Kornet and Iranian-made Almas anti-tank missiles. This move would be part of a broader Israeli defense strategy aimed at leveraging captured enemy equipment to enhance tactical flexibility and reduce acquisition costs for advanced armament.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During a Golani Brigade operation in the Western Sector of Lebanon, Israeli forces uncovered weaponry, a tunnel system, and underground bunkers that were used by the terror organization Hezbollah. (Picture source: Israeli MoD) The use of captured enemy equipment by the Israeli armed forces is not a new tactic. Since the country’s founding, Israel has seized and integrated various types of enemy material, dating back to conflicts such as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1967 Six-Day War. Captured Arab armor and artillery were commonly refurbished and used to supplement Israel’s limited military resources. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, for example, Israel captured Soviet-origin T-54 and T-55 tanks from Syrian and Egyptian forces. These tanks were later refurbished and repurposed, providing Israel with additional armor strength during critical periods of regional conflict. Similarly, in the 1980s, Israel repurposed Soviet-made weaponry captured from various adversaries, particularly during the Lebanon conflict. Captured equipment is often studied intensively to understand its capabilities and limitations, enabling the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to develop effective countermeasures and, if feasible, repurpose this hardware for their own operational needs. The Kornet and Almas anti-tank missiles, seized in recent operations against Hezbollah, represent potent assets in Israel’s anti-tank arsenal. Initially developed by Russia, the Kornet (ATGM 9M133) is a laser-guided anti-tank missile system known for its range, armor-penetrating capability, and precision. With a maximum effective range of up to 5,500 meters, the Kornet can penetrate up to 1,200 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) with its tandem-warhead design, making it a serious threat to modern armored vehicles and even fortified positions. Hezbollah’s use of the Kornet missile in previous conflicts with Israel demonstrated its ability to penetrate even Israel’s Merkava main battle tanks, a lesson the IDF has not forgotten. The Iranian-made Almas missile, another advanced anti-tank weapon, has similar capabilities to the Kornet, boasting high penetration power and a range that allows for significant standoff engagement. Reports indicate that the Almas missile was designed as an indigenous Iranian effort to replicate and even surpass some of the Kornet's capabilities, with a range of up to 8 kilometers in its most recent configurations. The acquisition of these missiles allows the IDF to significantly enhance its ground unit capabilities without procuring similar systems externally. If the IDF formalizes the creation of anti-tank units armed with Kornet and Almas missiles, it could represent a strategic shift in how Israel conducts anti-armor operations. These missiles would allow Israeli forces to engage armored threats at greater distances and in diverse terrains, an asset particularly useful in the hilly and urbanized areas where conflicts with Hezbollah frequently take place. Establishing these units would enable Israel to maximize the efficiency of seized weapons, making them a cost-effective means of bolstering national defense. Moreover, deploying such units could potentially reduce Israel's dependence on more expensive, domestically produced anti-tank systems, such as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems' Spike family of missiles. Integrating Kornet and Almas missiles would also provide a tactical advantage in scenarios where these systems are already familiar to enemy forces but are now used against them by IDF personnel. The IDF’s consideration of using captured Kornet and Almas missiles aligns with a long-standing practice of repurposing enemy weapons, which allows Israel to turn adversarial capabilities against their original owners effectively. With tensions high in the region, particularly with Hezbollah in Lebanon, this development underscores the IDF’s commitment to adapting its resources and strategies to emerging threats. By potentially fielding anti-tank units using seized equipment, Israel not only strengthens its own defenses but also leverages an innovative approach that could serve as a model for other nations facing similar strategic challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-israeli-army-explores-formation-of-anti-tank-units-with-seized-hezbollah-kornet-and-almas-missiles	2024-11-04T06:50:46-08:00

French German Railgun Reaches Hypersonic Speeds A New Era of Defense	According to information published by Opex360 on November 3, 2024, the French Navy is set to unveil its new electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at speeds reaching Mach 8.7. This innovation, led by the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (ISL) under the Defense Innovation Agency (AID) represents a groundbreaking shift in naval weaponry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unveiling the Future of Naval Artillery: The electromagnetic railgun, capable of launching projectiles at Mach 8.7, promises unprecedented speed, range, and precision in maritime defense. (Picture source: ISL) Other nations, however, have continued exploring the EMRG’s potential. China, for instance, reportedly tested a railgun from its amphibious assault ship Haiyang Shan, though these claims remain unverified. Japan has also joined the race, with its Ministry of Defense’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA) achieving a first successful test in October 2023, firing a 40 mm projectile at Mach 6.5 with a 5-megajoule railgun. Europe, recognizing the strategic advantages of EMRG technology, has pursued joint projects to bolster its defense capabilities. The European Union tasked the ISL with coordinating the PILUM project (Projectiles for Increased Long-range Effects Using Electromagnetic Railgun), which successfully demonstrated the potential for long-range, high-precision projectile launches over several hundred kilometers. The project’s success led to the establishment of the THEMA (Technology for Electro-Magnetic Artillery) program in June 2023, funded by a €15 million grant from the European Defense Fund (EDF). In a recent move to accelerate development, Japan entered a partnership with France and Germany, signing a Terms of Reference (TOR) agreement. This partnership paves the way for collaboration between Japan’s ATLA and the ISL, aiming to advance electromagnetic weapons technology across borders. The French General Directorate for Armament (DGA) has initiated an ambitious program to develop an electromagnetic railgun for the French Navy, known as the RAILGUN project. This project aims to strengthen the Navy's capabilities against evolving maritime threats, particularly hypersonic and saturation attacks. Leveraging electromagnetic energy to propel projectiles at extreme velocities, the railgun is designed for high precision over extended distances, with a reported range exceeding 200 kilometers. This impressive range, coupled with the railgun’s reduced projectile flight times, provides distinct advantages in defensive operations, especially in intercepting fast-moving aerial threats. As detailed by AID (Agence de l'Innovation de Défense), the RAILGUN system is set to bring notable advancements to French naval warfare. Positioned on a vessel's bow, the system would maximize anti-air efficacy by decreasing engagement times and allowing for rapid, high-velocity impacts that increase the likelihood of neutralizing incoming threats. Additionally, since railgun technology eliminates the need for conventional explosive propellants, it can reduce space requirements for ammunition storage on board, enabling vessels to carry more rounds and potentially reduce resupply needs. ISL, for its part, confirmed that the railgun presented at Euronaval can accelerate projectiles to 3,000 meters per second – equivalent to 10,800 km/h or Mach 8.7. Given that speeds above Mach 5 qualify as hypersonic, this weapon stands as a formidable advancement in naval defense technology. The mechanics of an electromagnetic railgun involve creating a magnetic field between two conductive rails through a high-intensity electric current. This field accelerates the projectile, itself a conductor, via the Lorentz force. However, achieving such extreme velocities presents significant challenges. The materials used must withstand intense mechanical stress, and the system requires an immense energy source capable of instantaneous release. As the French Navy moves forward with the RAILGUN project, the electromagnetic railgun could revolutionize naval artillery, setting a new standard in range, speed, and firepower.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-german-railgun-reaches-hypersonic-speeds-a-new-era-of-defense	2024-11-04T05:49:42-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) Following a comprehensive, ship-by-ship assessment, the Department of the Navy concluded that these destroyers possess sufficient hull integrity, combat capabilities, and technical resilience to operate past their anticipated service termination. This service extension will collectively add 48 years of service to the Navy's surface fleet, spanning from 2028 through 2035. Funding for the program has been proposed within the fiscal year 2026 budget, reflecting a forward-looking shift in the Navy’s shipbuilding strategy. Secretary Del Toro highlighted that the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers play a 'vital role' in global power projection and are essential to the Navy’s strategic deterrence in contested regions. Adm. Franchetti expressed that the decision reflects the Navy’s focus on prioritizing investments to maintain a strong Battle Force Inventory and meet the strategic imperatives of both peacetime and conflict scenarios. In her view, this decision ensures the United States can continue to project power and protect its interests globally, especially amid fiscal challenges. Comments The U.S. Navy’s decision to extend the service life of 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers is indicative of broader financial challenges affecting its fleet readiness and modernization. This strategy of prolonging existing ships' lifespans over investing in new vessels reveals a budgetary restraint that has raised concerns, especially amid heightened global security tensions. While extending these vessels offers a short-term fix to maintain a robust fleet presence, it underscores a potential compromise in the Navy’s ability to keep pace with technological advancements and fleet expansion needs. The current fiscal approach limits the Navy's shipbuilding budget, impacting programs critical for fleet growth. For example, shipbuilding projects are already experiencing underfunding, with cuts affecting the production of key vessels, such as the Virginia-class submarines and Constellation-class frigates. This budgetary constraint not only slows the introduction of advanced vessels but could also erode long-term fleet capacity and readiness. By focusing on immediate, cost-saving measures like service extensions, the Navy may fall behind on investments in next-generation capabilities that are essential for countering threats in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Additionally, the push to maintain older ships might hinder innovation, particularly in the context of U.S.-China competition. The Navy's modernization budget prioritizes essential research and technology development, but reduced funding in areas like Science and Technology Research (cut by 30% this year) risks stifling growth in critical domains such as cybersecurity, information warfare, and next-gen shipbuilding. In an era where technological dominance plays a pivotal role in strategic deterrence, these reductions raise questions about the sustainability of the Navy's long-term defense posture. Experts caution that it could weaken the Navy’s future operational effectiveness and innovation pipeline, leaving it potentially underprepared against rapidly advancing global powers like China and Russia.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/in-response-to-china-us-navy-extends-arleigh-burke-class-destroyers-lifespan	2024-10-31T08:09:32-07:00

China Draws Inspiration from Russian War Tactics in Ukraine via Belarus	The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has shown growing interest in the military strategies implemented by Russian forces in Ukraine, observing these developments through a unique intermediary: the Belarusian armed forces. In October, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) highlighted the ongoing military cooperation between China and Belarus, suggesting that Beijing may be examining operational lessons learned by the Belarusian army in connection with the conflict in Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This growing partnership shows China, like other Central Asian nations, seeking to leverage Belarusian expertise in essential hybrid warfare tactics, such as drone use, trench clearing, and urban assaults (Picture source: China Military) According to Major General Vadim Denisenko, Commander of Belarusian Special Operations Forces, China has recently increased its military exchanges with Belarus. Denisenko stated that Chinese military representatives, along with delegations from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, have participated in military exercises in Belarus over the past three to four months. This growing military partnership indicates that China, like other Central Asian nations, aims to benefit from Belarusian experiences in hybrid warfare, including the use of drones, trench clearing, and urban assault techniques, all of which have become essential in contemporary conflict. China’s interest in these competencies points to a strategy of observing and assimilating Russian methods of warfare. It is likely that Beijing, despite not being directly involved in the Ukrainian conflict, views this approach as an opportunity to refine its understanding of hybrid warfare and military response capabilities. Russian influence in Belarus, historically strong, has intensified with the war in Ukraine, making Belarus a pivotal actor in disseminating Russian military techniques, especially to non-Western allies like China. Meanwhile, on October 28, related developments indicated that NATO continues to monitor the region closely. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte disclosed that South Korean intelligence had revealed the presence of North Korean units in Russia’s Kursk region, potentially signaling additional military support for the Kremlin. This Sino-Belarusian military cooperation could be seen as part of a broader network of shared military knowledge that extends beyond the Russia-Belarus alliance, incorporating a group of Asian allies and strategic observers aiming to capitalize on Russian military expertise. Recent events have also underscored an escalation in operations within Ukraine. On the night of October 27-28, Ukrainian forces launched a series of drone attacks targeting Russian infrastructure, including distilleries, to weaken Russian air capabilities. Furthermore, Russian leader Vladimir Putin briefly acknowledged his country’s labor challenges, though he sought to reassure the public by emphasizing Russia’s low unemployment rate and asserted that the national economy could sustain a prolonged war effort. On the international front, support for Ukraine remains steady, marked by close cooperation among Western allies and ongoing diplomatic initiatives. In another development, Moldova’s Constitutional Court is set to review the results of the October 20 referendum on October 31, highlighting the conflict's role in expanding democratic interests within neighboring states. Meanwhile, Georgia is experiencing civil and political challenges to the results of its 2024 parliamentary elections, reflecting the growing tensions in Russia’s periphery.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-draws-inspiration-from-russian-war-tactics-in-ukraine-via-belarus	2024-10-30T06:21:59-07:00

Effective cybersecurity, he noted, is critical to maintaining operational integrity and protecting the continuous flow of information across military networks. With diverse systems converging in modern defense, interoperability has become essential. Ensuring different devices and platforms function cohesively allows personnel to access accurate, timely data without disruption. Edge computing, as discussed by Finlay, emerges as a revolutionary approach that minimizes reliance on cloud computing by processing data locally on devices at the 'coalface' of action. This method ensures quick analysis for rapid decision-making, even in bandwidth-constrained environments. However, a balance is required between edge and cloud computing, as certain situations benefit from centralized data processing. Finlay illuminated one of the most profound challenges in modern military technology: cognitive overload. As soldiers receive vast amounts of information from multiple systems, their decision-making can be impaired, and even highly trained personnel can become overwhelmed. To address this, innovative AI protocols are being developed to monitor stress responses in real-time. By detecting elevated cortisol levels, AI can temporarily take over lower-level tasks, allowing personnel to focus on critical decisions until stress levels normalize. Finlay stressed that integrating these stress management protocols is pivotal in enhancing resilience under high-pressure scenarios. Finlay concluded his presentation by emphasizing the need for a fully integrated approach, where advanced systems work in harmony, supporting military personnel to make decisions swiftly and accurately, even amid cognitive strain. 'The totality of these systems has to be integrated so that personnel can make decisions right for the moment, with all the inputs at hand, while also accounting for cognitive overload and stress responses,' he said, encapsulating the importance of cohesive technology deployment in defense.

Additionally, the Scorpion helmet-mounted display provides augmented situational awareness to pilots, while the SPECTRA self-protection system ensures greater operational freedom and defense against threats. In March 2017, Bangladesh initiated a tender for eight new multi-role combat aircraft, with an option for four additional units, to strengthen national air defense. The Rafale has been competing against the Eurofighter Typhoon for this contract, valued at nearly €2.5 billion. Prime Minister Yunus's administration appears more receptive to the French offer, potentially influenced by French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Dhaka in September 2023, the first by a French head of state in 33 years. Although no official response was given during this visit, France’s interest in this strategic market remains strong. In this competitive context, defense suppliers are highlighting their products' strengths while addressing perceived weaknesses in competitors' offerings. One argument raised against the Rafale is its presence within the Indian military, raising concerns in Bangladesh about reliance on the same suppliers as its neighboring country. Some contend that using the same fighter as India could put Bangladesh at a tactical disadvantage in potential conflicts, as India has a detailed understanding of Rafale's capabilities and limitations. BAF’s specifications for new combat aircraft are particularly stringent. Requirements include twin engines with a minimum dry thrust of 5,500 kg and over 8,000 kg with afterburner, at least eight hardpoints, and a payload capacity of at least 5,000 kg. Avionics must feature electronically scanned array radar with a range of 150 km for air-to-air missions and 50 km for air-to-ground. An integrated electronic warfare suite, infrared search and track system with a 50 km range, helmet-mounted display, and modern glass cockpit are also mandatory. The envisioned contract would encompass maintenance, training, and a set of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, with deliveries in two phases: an initial batch of four jets, followed by another within 18-24 months. Despite no official confirmation, Bangladesh's interest in 'Western' defense equipment is longstanding. The country previously considered acquiring helicopters from Bell Helicopter but later withdrew. Under its 'Force Goal 2030' program, BAF was also approached by Airbus Defence for the Eurofighter Typhoon, although Rafale remained a favored candidate. In 2021, Russia offered a batch of Mikoyan MiG-35 fighters, which Bangladesh quickly declined, signaling a gradual move away from Russian aerospace offerings.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/france-in-pursuit-of-a-strategic-agreement-to-sell-rafale-fighters-to-bangladesh	2024-10-30T04:13:18-07:00

South Korea Warns of Looming North Korean Nuclear Test Before US Election	On October 30, 2024, South Korea’s Ministry of Defense informed lawmakers that North Korea appears ready for a seventh nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, potentially timed with the U.S. presidential election on November 5. Intelligence obtained during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggye-ri site, with specific equipment and launch units in place, likely for an ICBM launch designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target (Picture source: KCNA) The session, conducted by representatives of South Korean military intelligence, also revealed signs of North Korean troops mobilized in Russia. Some units are reported to have joined the frontlines in the Kursk region, where Russian forces face Ukrainian counteroffensives. This deployment, observers note, underscores the strengthened strategic alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict, a factor North Korea appears to be leveraging to intensify its military activities. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been ramping up displays of power in recent months, accelerating missile tests and revealing a secret military-grade uranium production facility in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely a 12-axle model recently shown in state media, for an ICBM launch potentially reaching U.S. territory. This move aligns with warnings from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that Pyongyang may orchestrate significant military provocations around U.S. elections to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target. While previous North Korean ICBM tests were conducted at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid neighboring territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advancement in North Korea’s missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea’s capability to target distant locations, including the U.S. mainland. The escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programs under reduced international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from South Korean authorities leave little doubt regarding Kim Jong Un’s intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with powers outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has pursued nuclear capabilities to bolster its deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric armament strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in nuclear warhead miniaturization and ICBM development, such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of targeting the U.S., thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea strategically positions itself, the U.S. and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. The possibility of a nuclear test and an ICBM launch around the U.S. election period introduces an air of uncertainty, underscoring the importance of maintaining international vigilance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-warns-of-looming-north-korean-nuclear-test-before-us-election	2024-10-30T03:23:55-07:00

The Trophy Active Protection System (APS), developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is a vehicle-mounted defense system designed to protect against various anti-tank threats, including rockets and guided missiles. Operational in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since 2011, it uses multiple radar panels to detect incoming projectiles and neutralizes them by firing countermeasures, intercepting the threat before it reaches the vehicle. This system has been integrated into key Israeli platforms, such as the Merkava tank and Namer APC, and has attracted significant interest from other countries, including the U.S., which has equipped the M1 Abrams with Trophy, and Germany, which has fitted it to the Leopard 2. Despite successful interception, passive armor remains necessary, as fragments of neutralized projectiles may still impact the tank. Each launcher provides more than 180 degrees of coverage, ensuring 360-degree protection. The system operates autonomously, with the tank commander controlling only whether it is active or not. The Trophy's combat-proven capabilities have demonstrated a high interception rate, especially during operations involving the Israeli Defense Forces. It has also been successfully tested by European armies. In addition to protection, the system provides situational awareness through its Fire Source Location (FSL) capability, allowing vehicles to locate and respond to enemy fire effectively. As of 2023, the system has been fielded on more than 1,000 vehicles worldwide, underscoring its role as a critical component in modern armored warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-equips-leopard-2a7a1-tank-with-trophy-aps-to-enhance-protection-against-missiles	2024-10-30T03:09:57-07:00

Military doctors conducted emergency procedures and life-support drills. Piracy Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters has seen fluctuating trends in 2024, marked by a resurgence of high-severity incidents. Despite a global decrease in piracy rates, piracy remains persistent in this region, largely due to geopolitical instability and economic incentives for Somali pirate groups. Notably, Somali pirates have recently resumed hijackings, employing fishing vessels as 'mother ships' to launch skiff-based attacks on passing merchant ships, especially those less protected by armed security or defensive measures. Pirate tactics in the Gulf of Aden often include kidnapping crews for ransom, with recent months witnessing heightened violence against captured individuals. While many attacks are thwarted by security teams and vessel hardening measures, pirates continue to exploit vessels lacking rigorous defenses. Reports highlight cases where pirates intercept vessels using false distress calls or approach vessels under the guise of local fishermen, increasing the risk of misunderstandings and violence. The ongoing regional conflict, particularly involving Houthi attacks and Iranian-backed groups, has also destabilized the Gulf of Aden, further threatening commercial shipping. The recent uptick in anti-ship missile and drone attacks, some targeting vessels linked to Western interests, underscores the rising regional complexity. Consequently, international naval task forces such as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s Operation Aspides have expanded their protective scope to secure critical shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinese-navy-conducts-advanced-anti-piracy-drills-in-gulf-of-aden	2024-10-30T02:54:08-07:00

Pentagon Faces Shortage of Air-Defense Missiles Amid Rising Demand	The United States is experiencing a reduction in its stockpile of air-defense missiles, raising concerns about the Pentagon's readiness to respond to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, as well as potential conflicts in the Pacific. These concerns, highlighted in a recent The Wall Street Journal article on October 29, 2024, focus on interceptors that are essential for countering missile and drone threats in the region. Demand for these munitions has surged as U.S. allies, notably Israel, confront escalating attacks orchestrated by Iran and affiliated militias. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An SM-3 Block 1B interceptor is launched from the USS Lake Erie during an MDA test (Picture source: US DoD) Since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, the United States has deployed over 100 Standard Missiles—interceptors typically launched from ships, crucial for countering Iranian threats and Houthi attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea. This rapid consumption, further accelerated by recent Israeli strikes against Iran, has heightened concerns about the U.S.'s ability to meet growing demands for these munitions, particularly should a conflict arise in the Pacific. The term Standard Missile in this context refers to a series of air-defense missiles developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies) for the U.S. Navy, including models such as the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), and Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). These ship-launched missiles are critical for countering a variety of threats, from ballistic missiles to cruise missiles and aircraft, and are integrated into naval defense systems to protect U.S. forces and allies like Israel. The SM-2 primarily serves medium-range anti-aircraft defense, while the SM-3 and SM-6 add extended capabilities for intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles. The SM-2 is designed for medium-range air defense, capable of intercepting aircraft and cruise missiles within a range of approximately 170 kilometers at speeds of up to Mach 3. The SM-3, with greater range, is intended to neutralize ballistic missiles during their exo-atmospheric phase with a kinetic warhead, reaching targets up to 500 kilometers away. The SM-6 combines both anti-aircraft and anti-missile functions with a range of around 240 kilometers, excelling at intercepting low-altitude cruise missiles and high-speed aerial threats with multi-mode guidance. Pentagon officials, while keeping stockpile data classified to prevent strategic leverage by Iran and its allies, have acknowledged heightened pressure on resources. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh indicated that the Department of Defense is adjusting its posture to protect U.S. forces and support Israel, while maintaining focus on readiness and stockpiles. The high rate of interceptor use by the Pentagon raises challenges for responding to unexpected demands in both the Middle East and Europe. Additional concerns involve the responsiveness of the defense industry, which is often constrained by the need to expand production lines, facilities, and qualified personnel. Elias Yousif, Deputy Director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, noted that the U.S. has not developed a defense industrial base suited to prolonged attritional conflict, which complicates the current situation. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has advocated for increased production of Standard Missiles, though he acknowledged the challenges associated with producing such sophisticated munitions. The Pentagon is exploring alternative solutions, including soliciting new companies to help boost production of air-defense missiles. Despite recent stockpile increases, the launch rate observed in recent months has exceeded production capacity, according to defense analysts and officials. RTX, the manufacturer of Standard Missiles, produces a few hundred annually, though these munitions are also supplied to over 14 U.S. allies, limiting availability for the Pentagon. RTX spokesperson Chris Johnson stated that the company closely collaborates with the Department of Defense to meet production needs. Since the onset of the Hamas-Israel conflict last year, U.S. ships have launched over $1.8 billion in interceptors to protect Israel and ships passing through the Red Sea from Iranian threats. On average, two interceptors are launched per incoming missile to ensure accuracy, resulting in high costs to counter less sophisticated targets, such as Houthi drones. A congressional official noted that while costly, these munitions take months to replace. Last month, the U.S. deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to Israel, allowing the use of other types of interceptors in addition to Standard Missiles. The Pentagon also repositioned Patriot missile defense systems in the region, though their availability remains limited due to commitments in Ukraine. While the Pentagon aims to maintain current Standard Missile production levels, it may reduce production of older variants to fund newer models. The pace of interceptor use in the Middle East, however, could jeopardize U.S. readiness for a Pacific conflict. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery emphasized that the current use of Standard Missiles risks compromising the Navy’s preparedness for Pacific operations, underscoring the strategic impact of prolonged Middle Eastern engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/pentagon-faces-shortage-of-air-defense-missiles-amid-rising-demand	2024-10-29T07:07:52-07:00	
France's Navy enters Taiwan Strait Following US and Canadian Warships	According to information published by Yahoo on October 29, 2024, following the United States and Canada, France has now sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait amid heightened cross-strait tensions. This move by France comes shortly after China’s recent military exercises in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Navy's Floreal class frigate during exercise with Japanese Mogami-class frigate JS Noshiro. (Picture source: JMSDF) On October 20, the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins and the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver passed through the strait. According to The Mirror Media, the French Navy’s Floréal-class frigate Prairial (F731) sailed through the strait, moving from south to north. This transit aligns with the vessel’s recent regional activity, following its goodwill visit to Cebu from October 22 to 25. French military presence within the first island chain is quite frequent. Earlier this year, between April and May, the French Navy’s frigate Vendémiaire (F734) and Bretagne (D655) also conducted visits to the Philippines. Recent typhoon activity, including Typhoon Typhoon Saola and Typhoon Kanun, likely influenced Prairial’s timing to ensure safe and controlled navigation. France’s approach differs from the United States, as the French Navy typically refrains from issuing overt political statements during such transits. While the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) often dispatches ships to shadow foreign vessels in the region, it generally refrains from public commentary unless prompted by any perceived provocations. French Navy France’s stance on Taiwan and China is centered on maintaining freedom of navigation and supporting a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing non-confrontational yet assertive actions. As the only EU country with territories in the Indo-Pacific, France considers itself an Indo-Pacific power with obligations to uphold international laws in areas like the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. This commitment is driven by concerns over China's aggressive actions, such as military drills and territorial claims that disregard international rulings. In practice, the French Navy has regularly conducted freedom of navigation operations, sending vessels like the destroyer Lorraine to the South China Sea and the frigate Prairial through the Taiwan Strait. These moves are positioned as stabilizing efforts rather than provocations. French lawmakers have openly criticized China's actions, noting that Beijing's moves threaten not only regional stability but also global trade security, reinforcing France's resolve to maintain peace and security in the strait through strategic partnerships and multilateral dialogues​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/frances-navy-enters-taiwan-strait-following-us-and-canadian-warships	2024-10-29T06:51:08-07:00

The decision to launch the Taurus Neo project comes in a context where the war in Ukraine has heightened security concerns in Europe. Since the beginning of the conflict, Russia has intensified its use of cruise missiles to target strategic and civilian infrastructure, underscoring Ukraine's need for similar retaliatory capabilities. In response, the United Kingdom and France have already provided Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, which Ukrainian forces have adapted for use on Soviet-made aircraft. These missiles, equipped with sophisticated guidance systems combining GPS, inertial navigation, and infrared imaging (IIR), are mainly used to strike heavily defended targets like ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical hubs behind Russian lines. The Taurus KEPD 350, with its 500 km range and enhanced penetration capabilities, would offer Ukraine additional capabilities to target critical infrastructure and strategic points in Russia, particularly in Crimea. Unlike the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG missiles, the Taurus is equipped with a dual-stage warhead specifically designed to destroy heavily fortified and deeply buried targets. Currently, the German armed forces have about 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, primarily used from Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, it is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming retirement of the Tornado raises questions about the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. The Eurofighter appears to be the most likely option, while integration on the F-35A, recently ordered by Germany, seems unlikely without a complete redesign of the missile to fit the internal bay of the American stealth fighter. In the longer term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo within the framework of the SCAF (Future Combat Air System) program, a next-generation fighter project developed in collaboration with France, Spain, and Belgium. The SCAF is expected to play a central role in modernizing European air capabilities in the coming decades. The development of the Taurus Neo could have considerable implications for European defense. As a long-range precision weapon, this missile could strengthen Germany's deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic options for the continent's collective defense. The modernization of the German armed forces is part of a broader effort to respond to new security threats exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and rising tensions with Russia. However, funding for the Taurus Neo project remains a major challenge for the German government. The 2025 budget will need to include the €350 million necessary to launch the development, and expenses in subsequent years could be affected by current budget constraints. Nonetheless, the support expressed by the government coalition suggests a favorable outcome for the project, despite potential debates in Parliament on the appropriateness of prioritizing such expenditures in a challenging economic context. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project comes just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at rapidly developing new, more advanced long-range strike weapons than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK's membership in the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), an initiative led by France and involving Germany, Poland, and Italy. ELSA aims to develop a missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 km by the 2030s. Although the integration of the Taurus Neo into these programs remains uncertain, the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe reflects an increasing awareness of the need to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities in the face of emerging threats. The Taurus Neo project could therefore fit into a broader dynamic aimed at bolstering collective security on the European continent while positioning Germany as a key player in the development of new defense technologies. The development of advanced cruise missiles, such as the Taurus KEPD 350, represents a critical strategic asset for Western armed forces, particularly in the context of modern conflicts where precision and long-range strike capabilities are crucial. For Ukraine, the use of missiles provided by its allies, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, has demonstrated the effectiveness of these weapons in striking deep behind enemy lines at strategic targets. These missiles allow for the neutralization of critical military infrastructure, such as ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical nodes, thereby disrupting adversary operations and weakening their support capabilities for frontline forces. The Taurus, with its extended 500 km range and reinforced penetration capability, would offer Ukraine increased ability to target strategic sites in Crimea or Russia, expanding the range and impact of Ukrainian operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-to-develop-next-gen-taurus-neo-cruise-missile-after-ukraine-war-lessons	2024-10-29T04:15:55-07:00

Russia Equips T-72B3M Tanks with Advanced Arena-M Active Protection System	According to information published by Uralvagonzavod on October 25, 2024, Russia has upgraded its T-72B3M main battle tanks with the Arena-M Active Protection System (APS). This move reflects a commitment to enhancing the tank's defensive capabilities amid an era of increasingly potent anti-tank weaponry.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russia enhances the T-72B3M tank's battlefield resilience with the Arena-M Active Protection System, designed to intercept and neutralize incoming anti-tank missiles and RPGs, ensuring advanced defense in modern combat scenarios. (Picture source: Telegram account of Уралвагонзавод) The T-72B3M represents the latest iteration of the T-72 series, featuring substantial upgrades over its predecessors in terms of firepower, mobility, and protection. Key improvements to the T-72B3M include an upgraded fire control system, a 1,130 hp V-92S2F engine, and advanced sighting equipment. However, the inclusion of the Arena-M APS marks a particularly notable enhancement, aimed at safeguarding the tank and its crew against an array of anti-tank threats. The Arena-M is a Russian-designed active protection system created to intercept and destroy incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles and rockets, before they reach the tank. The system uses a radar array to detect and track incoming threats within a certain radius around the vehicle. Once a threat is detected, Arena-M calculates its trajectory, allowing the system to deploy countermeasures that neutralize the projectile at a safe distance. The APS is specifically designed to handle threats from multiple directions, enhancing protection against high-speed projectiles fired from modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) or rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). This added layer of defense significantly reduces the likelihood of armor penetration, thus improving the survivability of the T-72B3M on the battlefield. Russia’s choice to integrate the Arena-M system into the T-72B3M rather than reserving it exclusively for newer tanks like the T-90M and T-14 Armata underscores the continued relevance of the T-72 in modern warfare. With over 25,000 units produced since its inception in the 1970s, the T-72 has seen widespread deployment across various theaters and remains in service with numerous militaries worldwide. Upgrading these tanks with APS technology extends their operational lifespan, making them capable of countering threats posed by the latest anti-tank systems. The T-72B3M’s combination of affordability, ease of maintenance, and robust firepower makes it a versatile asset for large-scale military operations. The addition of the Arena-M APS, with its ability to repel contemporary anti-tank weaponry, ensures that the T-72B3M remains relevant in scenarios that demand both maneuverability and resilience. Russia’s decision to install the Arena-M system on its main battle tanks reflects a growing trend within the global military community toward equipping armored vehicles with active protection systems. As anti-tank weapon technology advances, the need for countermeasures has become increasingly critical. Arena-M’s effectiveness and the expanded protection it provides offer a glimpse into future armored warfare, where active defenses could be as crucial as the armor itself. While the current configuration of the T-72B3M with the Arena-M APS offers substantial protection, experts speculate that future variants could incorporate additional features, including modular reactive armor and more advanced electronic warfare countermeasures. Such enhancements would further augment the tank’s ability to operate in contested environments where electronic and cyber warfare elements are increasingly prevalent.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-equips-t-72b3m-tanks-with-advanced-arena-m-active-protection-system	2024-10-29T02:49:48-07:00	
Algeria reveals acquisition of Russian Iskander-E ballistic missile system	As reported by ORCA Military on October 28, 2024, the Russian Iskander-E short-range ballistic missile system has been seen for the first time in Algeria, ahead of the military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Algerian Revolution. This sighting confirms Algeria’s acquisition of the Iskander after years of speculation and marks the first time this missile system has appeared in the arsenal of an Arab country.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Algeria received four regiments of the Iskander-E between 2014 and 2017, comprising around 50 vehicles and 48 missiles per regiment, including 12 launchers, 12 transporter-loaders, 11 command vehicles, and various support vehicles. (Picture source: FChillali) The Iskander system, developed by Russia, has a range of up to 500 kilometers and can reach speeds of up to Mach 6. It is designed to strike targets such as command centers, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure. The system's mobile design and rapid-launch capability make it difficult to detect or intercept. The Iskander-E variant, in service with Algeria since 2018, is capable of carrying various types of non-nuclear warheads, including high-explosive fragmentation and penetrating warheads. This acquisition enhances Algeria's missile capabilities, adding significant range and versatility to its existing military equipment. Algeria's acquisition of the Iskander system is part of broader efforts to modernize its military forces, especially amid increasing tensions with Morocco. Diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco have been strained since Algeria cut ties in 2021, citing Morocco’s support for separatist movements in Kabylie and its backing of Western Sahara claims. Morocco, meanwhile, has received international backing for its autonomy plan for Western Sahara, further intensifying the rivalry. Both countries have engaged in an arms race, boosting their military capabilities while maintaining a tense but non-violent standoff. The militarization on both sides continues, although a full-scale conflict remains unlikely. In this context, the Iskander system plays a significant role in Algeria's military planning, particularly due to its capacity to target strategic locations in Morocco. The system’s longer range, compared to Morocco’s M142 HIMARS system, allows it to reach targets such as command centers and air defenses. Morocco's HIMARS system, which has a range of up to 300 kilometers using ATACMS missiles, is designed for rapid fire support and precision strikes on fortified positions and troop concentrations. While the HIMARS offers greater battlefield mobility, the Iskander system’s longer range and hypersonic capabilities provide Algeria with a broader set of strategic options. Algeria's defense budget has grown significantly in recent years, reaching $18.3 billion in 2023, largely due to increased revenues from gas exports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This funding has supported the procurement of military equipment, primarily from Russia and China, including the Iskander system. The growing military rivalry with Morocco has also been reflected in Algerian domestic politics, where anti-Moroccan rhetoric is frequently used in election campaigns to gain popular support. Despite occasional calls for dialogue, tensions between Algeria and Morocco remain high, and the ongoing arms buildup indicates that a resolution is unlikely in the near future. The Iskander system’s appearance in the upcoming military parade further signals Algeria’s intent to maintain and demonstrate its military capabilities in response to regional security concerns. As both countries continue to acquire advanced military technology, the potential for future conflict, while not imminent, remains a significant issue. Algeria’s acquisition of the Russian Iskander and Morocco’s procurement of the American HIMARS in 2023 highlights the continuing arms race in North Africa. The Iskander system, with its longer range and ability to strike strategic targets, complements Algeria's defense strategy, while Morocco’s HIMARS provides tactical flexibility on the battlefield. The presence of the Iskander system in Algeria's military forces underscores the ongoing competition for military superiority in the region, as both countries seek to reinforce their positions without engaging in direct conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/algeria-reveals-acquisition-of-russian-iskander-e-ballistic-missile-system	2024-10-29T02:30:19-07:00

The agreement also provides logistical support, with engineering teams from the U.S. government and partner companies facilitating integration and deployment. The Finnish Ministry of Defense stated that AARGM-ER systems would be delivered per the operational schedule for the Finnish Air Force's F-35A. The first deliveries are expected between 2026 and 2030, ensuring compatibility with Finland's introduction of the F-35. The Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile - Extended Range (AARGM-ER), AGM-88G, is an advanced air-to-ground missile developed by Northrop Grumman to target and neutralize enemy air defenses. Based on the AGM-88E AARGM model, AARGM-ER features an optimized airframe, a larger rocket motor, and advanced electronics, providing a significantly enhanced range and speed essential for countering modern long-range surface-to-air missile systems. AARGM-ER’s operational profile focuses on neutralizing radar-based threats through an enhanced guidance system. This system combines passive homing sensors to detect radar emissions with an active millimeter-wave radar for terminal guidance, enabling precise targeting even if enemy radars attempt shutdown to avoid detection. This dual guidance capability makes the missile particularly effective against mobile air defense systems, enhancing its ability in Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD/DEAD) missions. Designed to fit within the internal weapons bay of the F-35, the AARGM-ER offers compatibility with multiple platforms, including the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler. This adaptability allows for deployment across U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps fleets. Initial tests began in 2021, demonstrating AARGM-ER’s capability to engage both mobile and stationary targets over long distances. The missile is now in low-rate initial production, with operational fielding expected soon. This decision follows a recent U.S. authorization to sell up to 100 AARGM-ER missiles to the Royal Australian Air Force for its EA-18G Growler aircraft, reflecting growing interest from U.S. allies in this missile system to bolster their capabilities in suppressing enemy air defenses.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/finland-strengthens-f-35-fleet-with-acquisition-of-150-aargm-er-missiles-from-united-states	2024-10-29T02:24:52-07:00	
South Korea Moves Up Deployment of Its Iron Dome in Response to North Korean Threats	South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced on October 29, 2024, that it has approved a plan to advance the deployment schedule of the country's Low Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system by two years, setting its operational timeframe between 2029 and 2033. This decision, disclosed during a National Defense Ministry committee meeting, reflects South Korea’s response to rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula as North Korea intensifies its provocations, compelling Seoul to enhance protection against potential attacks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA (Picture source: Rafael) The LAMD system, launched in 2022 with development expected to continue through 2033, is designed to strengthen South Korea's air defense capabilities against artillery fire and missile threats from the North. Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA. This system comprises radar, an engagement control center, launchers, and interceptor missiles to mitigate the impact of long-range artillery strikes from North Korea. DAPA has also approved the second phase of upgrades to its Patriot defense system, including the acquisition of the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system. This advanced system employs more agile and precise hit-to-kill interceptors rather than fragmentation warheads, as in previous versions. The PAC-3 system supports up to sixteen missiles per launcher compared to four with PAC-2, offering increased range and improved radar and tracking capabilities. These defense systems will operate alongside existing assets, including Patriot systems and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system provided by the United States, which targets missiles in their terminal phase upon reentry. THAAD’s initial deployment in South Korea in 2017 prompted objections from China due to the system’s powerful radar, capable of monitoring regional military activities. In response, China imposed economic and cultural sanctions, including restrictions on group travel to South Korea, leading former President Moon Jae-in to pledge not to increase THAAD deployments on South Korean soil. Tensions have escalated further with recent provocations from North Korea, including debris-laden balloons launched towards Seoul as retaliation against propaganda balloons sent by South Korean activists. Seoul, located just 55 kilometers from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and vulnerable to artillery strikes, remains particularly concerned about the thousands of artillery systems stationed by North Korea near the border. In parallel, South Korea is progressing with the development of its Long-range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) system, designed to intercept missiles at altitudes of 50 to 60 kilometers. This component of the Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system integrates with the PAC-3 and Cheongung II, enabling a multi-layered defense against North Korean missile threats. In addition to air defense initiatives, the South Korean government has approved a significant update to the K2 Black Panther main battle tank project. To reduce reliance on foreign equipment, the next 150 K2 tanks for the South Korean army will be outfitted with domestically developed transmissions by SNT Dynamics, alongside locally manufactured engines. This transmission system will also be exported to Turkey for use in the Altay battle tanks. Since the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea has strengthened its position as a major supplier of military equipment, particularly to European nations where defense demand has significantly increased. By consolidating its capabilities and enhancing self-reliance in defense, South Korea aims to establish itself as a prominent player on the international military stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-moves-up-deployment-of-its-iron-dome-in-response-to-north-korean-threats	2024-10-29T02:16:55-07:00	
SWATT Training: Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group Advances Warfighting Capabilities	According to information published by the US DoD on October 23, 2024, the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRF CSG) is actively participating in the Surface Warfare Advanced Tactical Training (SWATT), an intense at-sea training program designed to enhance warfighting capabilities and tactical proficiency across multiple domains.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crew members on the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the largest aircraft carrier in the world, perform flight operations while navigating the Atlantic Ocean. (Picture source: DVIDS) Overseen by the Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), SWATT is a critical phase in preparing units for deployment, allowing for integration and real-time tactical development. The Gerald R. Ford CSG consists of a formidable array of assets, including the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81), USS Mitscher (DDG 57), USS Mahan (DDG 72), USS Bainbridge (DDG 96), and USS Forrest Sherman (DDG 98). These vessels are supported by the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8, which adds a critical aerial dimension to the group's operations. SWATT provides a diverse range of training scenarios, bringing together individual, team, and unit-level exercises designed to sharpen the warfighting capabilities of each component. It also includes integrated in-port, live virtual construct, and at-sea training evolutions, which build on the tactical knowledge and proficiency of each participant. The goal is to deliver multi-domain combatants ready for full-spectrum combat operations. Led by SMWDC, SWATT is the premier advanced tactical training exercise tailored for the surface fleet, pushing units to achieve new levels of tactical precision and adaptability. It aims to equip watch teams, individual units, and warfare commanders with cutting-edge strategies and skills for the complexities of modern naval warfare. CSG 12, as the immediate superior in command of USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 2, CVW 8, and the five guided-missile destroyers, plays a central role in overseeing this readiness. The Gerald R. Ford CSG’s strengths begin with its multi-layered defense network. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, a sophisticated platform that supports anti-air, anti-missile, and anti-submarine operations, creating a protective buffer around the carrier and the entire strike group. This layered defense approach is essential in countering diverse threats, including missile attacks, submarines, and aerial incursions, which enhances the security and survivability of the group in complex operational theaters. However, the CSG faces notable weaknesses, beginning with its significant logistical demands. Operating such a complex group requires extensive support in terms of fuel, supplies, and maintenance, and maintaining a CSG over extended deployments is resource-intensive. These logistical demands mean that the CSG’s operational endurance can be limited by access to supply lines, especially in remote or contested areas where consistent resupply may be challenging. Cost is another substantial factor. The Gerald R. Ford-class carrier is one of the most expensive warships ever built, with each destroyer and supporting vessel further adding to the operational budget. These costs extend to maintenance and upgrades, making the CSG a considerable investment that requires sustained funding. The high expense also raises strategic questions about the long-term sustainability of carrier-based power projection, particularly as other nations develop countermeasures designed to challenge traditional carrier strike group operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/swatt-training-gerald-r-ford-carrier-strike-group-advances-warfighting-capabilities	2024-10-29T01:47:03-07:00	
Taiwan Secures US Deal for 1,000 Attack Drones Amid Rising PLA Drills	Taiwan’s Ministry of Defense has recently formalized an agreement with the U.S. government to purchase 1,000 attack drones, marking a significant step in the island’s defense strategy amid rising concerns over a potential military threat from China. Bloomberg reported on October 29, 2024, that this agreement was solidified with the signing of a 'letter of offer and acceptance' at the end of September, which precedes the final contracts specifying exact quantities, financial terms, and delivery timelines. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US Army Exercise with a Switchblade Drone in July 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) While the final contracts have yet to be signed, they are expected to be formalized in the coming weeks, according to informed industry sources who remain anonymous due to the unannounced nature of the transaction. A U.S. Department of State spokesperson declined to comment on ongoing sales to Taiwan. Attack drones have become increasingly central in modern warfare. In Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have ramped up their use of drones for reconnaissance and attacks, underscoring their effectiveness in active combat scenarios. Unmanned aerial vehicles were also deployed in an Iranian attack on Israel in April, reinforcing these systems as critical elements in contemporary military operations. According to Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, Senior Director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, this type of acquisition by Taiwan demonstrates 'that both Taiwan and the United States are applying key lessons from the conflict in Ukraine and translating those lessons into future procurement decisions.' Montgomery, who has visited Taiwan to assess its defense needs, views this agreement as a strategic move for the island as it seeks greater self-sufficiency in its deterrence capabilities. In June, the U.S. Department of State had notified Congress of its approval for an advanced drone sale to Taiwanese authorities. This arrangement included 291 Anduril Altius 600M-V systems, valued at approximately $300 million, and 720 AeroVironment Switchblade 300 drones, 'B' model, with an estimated value of $60 million. Anduril’s Altius 600M-V is a multi-mission aerial vehicle capable of conducting various operations with a single control unit. (Picture source: Anduril) Anduril’s Altius 600M-V is a multi-mission aerial vehicle capable of conducting various operations with a single control unit. With a flight time of nearly two hours and a range of 160 km, the system allows an operator to command multiple drones simultaneously, making it particularly well-suited for large-scale operations requiring precise and coordinated control. The AeroVironment Switchblade 300 model weighs 1.8 kg and is specifically designed for targeting missions, capable of hovering over a target for up to 20 minutes.

In addition to its strategic strike capabilities, the B-21 Raider is designed to perform a wide range of conventional missions, such as supporting military operations in conflict zones, conducting air interdiction, and carrying out precision strikes on mobile targets. For instance, during an air campaign against an enemy force, the B-21 could be used to attack defensive positions, ammunition depots, or military convoys, thereby disrupting the adversary's logistical and operational capabilities. Its stealth allows it to penetrate deep into enemy territory and operate in contested environments, reducing the risk for pilots while maximizing the effectiveness of its strikes. Additionally, the B-21's flexibility enables it to be quickly reconfigured to accommodate various types of conventional missions, adapting its weaponry and sensors to specific field requirements. Warden revealed during an earnings call on October 24, 2024, that the Air Force is conducting a comprehensive review of its force structure, including the B-21 fleet. This review is part of a congressionally mandated effort to reassess the service's future capabilities and requirements. It also coincides with the Air Force's efforts to complete the NGAD program's requirements analysis, following a pause ordered by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall earlier this year. The NGAD program, aimed at developing a sixth-generation fighter to replace the F-22 Raptor, was paused before a decision was made between two competing designs. Kendall cited concerns over the program's cost, with initial estimates suggesting that each aircraft could cost several hundred million dollars. He has since indicated a preference for reducing the per-unit cost to a range closer to that of the F-35 fighter, between $80 million and $100 million. The cost difference, if achieved, could translate into savings of tens of billions of dollars across a planned fleet of 200 to 250 NGAD fighters. While the official stance of the Air Force has maintained that a fleet of 100 B-21 Raiders would meet current operational needs, there are growing voices within the defense community advocating for a larger fleet. The B-21 is designed to replace the aging B-2 Spirit and B-1 Lancer bombers, providing the U.S. military with a long-range stealth bomber capable of penetrating advanced air defenses. The platform is a cornerstone of the Air Force's future strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities. Northrop Grumman, the B-21's prime contractor, has stated that it is ready to increase production if the Air Force decides to expand the fleet. According to Warden, the decision on fleet size will likely become clearer in the coming months as the force structure review progresses. She emphasized that the performance and cost targets achieved during the B-21's initial production phase could influence the Air Force's decision. The cost of the B-21 has been a central issue in these discussions. The bomber's original unit cost was contractually set at $550 million in 2010, equivalent to approximately $780 million today. Despite this, Kendall informed Congress in April that B-21 production costs had remained below projections during low-rate initial production. However, the cost ceiling is expected to rise as production ramps up in later batches. Several senior officials and defense analysts have argued for increasing the B-21 fleet beyond the initial 100 units. Retired Colonel Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, has been outspoken about the need to increase the Air Force's bomber capacity to address emerging threats. He points out that the current bomber force is too small to meet the demands of a rapidly changing strategic environment, especially in deterring and potentially responding to simultaneous threats from peer adversaries like Russia and China. Gunzinger believes that the B-21 is particularly well-positioned to strengthen both conventional and nuclear deterrence due to its stealth capabilities, long range, and substantial payload capacity. He asserts that acquiring more B-21s at an accelerated pace would be the most cost-effective approach to strengthening the United States' power projection capabilities and operating in contested environments. Expanding the bomber fleet would provide a dual benefit by bolstering both conventional defense and strategic deterrence. Air Force General Anthony J. Cotton, head of U.S. Strategic Command, has also expressed support for increasing the number of B-21 bombers, emphasizing their importance in maintaining a credible deterrent posture. His views are echoed by other analysts, such as Christopher Bowie, who have suggested that 100 aircraft may not be sufficient for the U.S. to achieve its strategic goals, given that even the most advanced bomber can only be in one place at a time. One of the central questions in the ongoing review is whether potential savings from reducing the NGAD program could be redirected to fund additional B-21 bombers. The Air Force is attempting to balance the competing demands of modernizing its aging fleet while adhering to budget constraints. However, some experts, including Gunzinger, caution against viewing the NGAD and B-21 programs as interchangeable. This pause has opened the door for the B-21 to play a more significant role in the Air Force's future force structure. Northrop Grumman's willingness to increase production adds to the service's strategic flexibility as it navigates the challenges of modernizing its fleet under fiscal constraints. Warden indicated that the Air Force is expected to award a second low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract for the B-21 before the end of the year. The first LRIP contract was awarded following the bomber's first flight last year, although specifics regarding the number of aircraft covered under the agreement have not been disclosed. The outcome of the current force structure review and ongoing budget negotiations will likely influence future production rates and fleet size decisions. As the Air Force continues to assess its options, the B-21 remains a key element in the broader strategy to enhance U.S. airpower capabilities. Whether the service will ultimately expand its fleet of stealth bombers will depend on a variety of factors, including cost considerations, technological developments, and the evolving threat landscape. In the meantime, Northrop Grumman is positioning itself to respond quickly to increased demand, offering the U.S. government flexibility in shaping the future of its bomber force. The reconsideration of the B-21 fleet size underscores the dynamic nature of the U.S. Air Force's modernization strategy, driven by both strategic needs and budgetary realities. With the ongoing review of the NGAD program and discussions about expanding the bomber fleet, the Air Force is at a critical juncture. The decisions made in the coming months will shape the future of American airpower and its ability to deter adversaries and project power worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/northrop-grumman-announces-massive-expansion-in-b-21-raider-stealth-bomber-production-to-counter-china	2024-10-28T05:56:13-07:00

Taiwan Unveils Torpedo Launch Tube of Huilong Unmanned Underwater Vehicle	According to information published by TaiwanPlus on October 26, 2024, Taiwan revealed the torpedo launch tube of its domestically developed 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan reveals its 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle, equipped with dual torpedo launch tubes and surveillance capabilities. (Picture source: TaiwanPlus) Earlier, images of the propeller at the vehicle’s rear were also released. However, Taiwan's Defense Minister recently clarified over a lunch with the media that the Huilong platform is primarily intended for testing purposes, specifically for sonar and underwater mine systems, and does not feature an active propulsion system. Consequently, during sea trials, it is towed by support vessels rather than operating independently. The 'Huilong' project is a joint effort between Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Lung Teh Shipbuilding. The development officially commenced in 2020 under the 'Huilong Project,' aiming to establish a versatile, unmanned underwater test platform. According to reports, the vehicle displaces nearly 100 tons and has dimensions measuring approximately 30 meters in length, 3.6 meters in width, and 6 meters in height, including its command tower casing. This UUV resembles a compact submarine and is equipped with dual torpedo tubes. Notably, it is also reportedly designed to deploy small unmanned vehicles, potentially enhancing its capabilities in surveillance, target acquisition, and strike operations against enemy assets. One of the Huilong UUV’s primary roles could be to extend Taiwan’s underwater monitoring capabilities. Equipped with sophisticated sonar, the UUV can detect and track adversary submarines and other vessels operating in the waters around Taiwan. This would be particularly advantageous in tracking potential incursions by Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) submarines, enabling early detection and providing intelligence on the movements of hostile forces. Given the importance of information superiority in modern conflicts, the Huilong’s ability to conduct real-time, covert reconnaissance could significantly enhance Taiwan’s situational awareness. Taiwan’s fleet of submarines is relatively small and would be vulnerable in the event of a conflict. However, integrating UUVs like the Huilong could serve as a force multiplier. Deployed alongside or in support of manned submarines, these UUVs could take on high-risk reconnaissance or even offensive roles, allowing manned vessels to operate with less exposure to detection or attack. In any conflict scenario with a larger naval power like China, Taiwan’s strategy would likely rely on asymmetric tactics. UUVs offer a cost-effective means to deploy a range of weapons or carry out sabotage missions against high-value enemy assets, like aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-unveils-torpedo-launch-tube-of-huilong-unmanned-underwater-vehicle	2024-10-28T04:51:34-07:00

Exclusive: Discover Ukraine's Sky Dragon Devastating Drone-Dropped Incendiary Thermite Weapon Against Russia	Recently, Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, shared a detailed graphic on his X account explaining Sky Dragon, a new Ukrainian weapon system using multi-rotor drones to deploy thermite incendiary devices against Russian forces. This approach, which involves bundling thermite grenades and dropping them over Russian-occupied tree lines, has proven highly effective. By leveraging drones for precise delivery, the Sky Dragon system enables Ukrainian forces to target fortified Russian positions in difficult-to-reach areas, especially in densely forested terrain, causing significant damage to enemy equipment and personnel.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An aerial view captures the devastating impact of Ukraine's Sky Dragon incendiary thermite weapon as a drone drops the fiery payload onto its target. The intense white-hot thermite reaction engulfs the area in flames, melting through metal and creating thick smoke plumes, showcasing this drone-deployed weapon's destructive power in the ongoing conflict. (Picture source: Social network and X account Chuck Pfarrer) The use of incendiary thermite weapons in Ukraine has been reported during the ongoing conflict, with instances of classic incendiary munitions being employed by both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Thermite is used primarily to destroy equipment, fortifications, or infrastructure due to its ability to generate extremely high temperatures, melt metal, and start fires. The first publicized reports of thermite being used in Ukraine emerged in 2014, during the initial stages of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, when Russian-backed separatists were accused of using incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to target Ukrainian military positions. Recently, there have been renewed reports of thermite weapons being used in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, particularly in the context of intense battles in eastern Ukraine. These reports suggest that both sides may be employing incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to destroy military equipment, fortifications, and infrastructure. In late 2022 and throughout 2023, videos and eyewitness accounts surfaced showing the use of incendiary shells, which may contain thermite, in areas like Bakhmut and Mariupol, where fierce urban fighting took place. Sky Dragon uses commercially available multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, to carry bundles of thermite grenades and drop them over enemy positions. Thermite, a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxides, burns at extremely high temperatures when ignited, making it ideal for destroying military equipment, bunkers, and fortifications. The drones deliver these thermite devices in a precise and targeted manner, allowing Ukrainian forces to strike deep within Russian-controlled zones, including fortified positions concealed under tree canopies and within dug-in trenches. The Sky Dragon system operates through a combination of advanced drone technology and destructive incendiary devices. It uses multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, which are capable of carrying heavy payloads and modified for military use. These drones fly over Russian positions, allowing for the precise delivery of their incendiary payloads. The core of the system consists of bundled thermite grenades strapped together with metal bands. These grenades are equipped with a Nonel instantaneous fuse system, commonly used in demolition, ensuring that all grenades ignite simultaneously once they reach the target. This synchronization maximizes the thermite's destructive power. To protect the drone from the extreme heat generated by the thermite, a heat shield is employed along with a tow line that holds the grenades at a safe distance during flight. Once released, the grenades ignite mid-air, raining down molten thermite on the target, making it nearly impossible for enemy infantry or equipment to withstand the intense heat, which can exceed 2,000°C. Sky Dragon is proving to be highly effective against entrenched Russian positions, especially in forested areas. Traditional artillery and mortar systems struggle to penetrate tree lines where Russian forces are often dug in. However, drones can navigate these complex environments, hovering over specific positions and deploying incendiary grenades with pinpoint accuracy. When ignited, thermite creates temperatures exceeding 2,000°C (3,600°F), capable of burning through metal and concrete, making it particularly useful for destroying ammunition depots, bunkers, armored vehicles, and other critical military infrastructure. Graphic by Chuck Pfarrer illustrating Ukraine's Sky Dragon, a drone-deployed incendiary thermite weapon used to target Russian forces. (Picture source X account Chuck Pfarrer ) Additionally, the drones are difficult to detect and intercept due to their small size and low altitude. This makes them ideal tools for engaging targets in areas where Russian air defense systems are concentrated, as drones can maneuver around obstacles and deliver their payloads without risking large aircraft or manned vehicles. The introduction of Sky Dragon highlights Ukraine's ability to adapt to the realities of modern warfare, leveraging low-cost commercial drones in innovative ways to inflict significant damage on Russian forces. The use of incendiary devices like thermite further underscores Ukraine's intent to target key Russian positions where traditional weapons might fail or struggle to reach. As the conflict drags on, the emergence of these new tactics could force Russian troops to adapt their defensive strategies, potentially making their positions more vulnerable to other forms of attack. Sky Dragon adds yet another dimension to the drone warfare that has come to define much of the conflict, where both sides increasingly rely on unmanned systems to deliver destructive payloads with minimal risk to personnel. Sky Dragon represents a significant development in Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities, offering a cost-effective and highly destructive solution to the challenge of entrenched Russian forces. As the war continues, innovations like Sky Dragon will likely play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics on the battlefield, demonstrating how modern technology and creative problem-solving can shift the balance of power in asymmetrical warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-discover-ukraines-sky-dragon-devastating-drone-deployed-incendiary-thermite-weapon-against-russia	2024-10-28T03:41:16-07:00

Preparatory work led to the development and testing of an innovative communication system capable of effectively linking the various aircraft involved in joint missions. The tests were carried out in several phases, first separately and then simultaneously, with operations conducted from the DGA-EM site on Île du Levant and another base in southern Italy. For the French side, the tests involved an H130 helicopter equipped with specific sensors, paired with a VSR700 drone developed by Airbus Helicopters. In Italy, the trials used a helicopter from Leonardo, paired with an SW-4 Solo, a hybrid aircraft that can be piloted or operated autonomously via a drone interface. Both test sites and the aircraft were interconnected via satellite, ensuring real-time communication and the ability to control drones over long distances. The flight demonstration on October 9, 2024, was a highlight of the project, marking a decisive step for interoperability. In the presence of a European Commission representative, the tests showed that interaction levels between helicopters and drones could be progressively increased. This culminated in an impressive demonstration where a drone operated from one country was controlled by a helicopter located 1,000 kilometers away, thus proving the feasibility of joint operations within the European Union. These successful tests anticipate new capabilities for future-generation helicopters, particularly the upgraded Guépard and Tiger models, which will be equipped to cooperate with drones in future military missions.

Indonesia Navy Expels Chinese Coast Guard Ship from North Natuna Sea	According to information published by the Indonesian government on October 25, 2024, Indonesia’s Maritime Security Agency, Bakamla RI, successfully detected and expelled a Chinese Coast Guard vessel, CCG 5402, from the North Natuna Sea. This vessel had been interfering with seismic survey activities led by PT Pertamina East Natuna, a state-owned oil and gas company, which was conducting 3D seismic data processing using the survey vessel MV Geo Coral.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Indonesian Coast Guard Tanjung Datu-class patrol vessel KN Tanjung Datu, the Chinese Coast Guard OPV 5402 and the Indonesian Navy Kapitan Patimura-class corvette. (Picture source: Indonesian government) The incident unfolded when Bakamla RI’s Command and Control Center (Puskodal) received intelligence that CCG 5402 was obstructing MV Geo Coral’s survey, which was being escorted by three chase vessels—UB Anugerah Bersama 17, AHT PSB Roller, and TB Teluk Bajau Victory. These activities were taking place within the operational area of PT Pertamina East Natuna, which is situated on Indonesia's continental shelf in the North Natuna Sea. Following this alert, Bakamla dispatched the Indonesian State Vessel (KN) Tanjung Datu-301 to the location. Upon arrival, KN Tanjung Datu-301 detected the Chinese vessel CCG 5402 at 5:30 a.m. WIB, positioned at a 125° bearing and approximately 7.3 nautical miles away. Despite efforts to establish communication via radio, CCG 5402 asserted that the area fell under Chinese jurisdiction, a claim that Indonesia firmly disputes. Shortly after, at around 5:38 a.m., Bakamla RI received reinforcement from the Indonesian Navy’s (TNI AL) patrol vessel KRI Sutedi Senaputera 378 and a maritime patrol aircraft. Together, these Indonesian patrol forces shadowed the Chinese vessel, ultimately succeeding in expelling CCG 5402 from Indonesia’s jurisdictional waters in the North Natuna Sea. China’s Foreign Ministry responded to the situation in a routine press conference on Thursday, stating that Chinese coast guard vessels were patrolling 'waters under China’s jurisdiction' according to both international and domestic laws. The ministry expressed its willingness to negotiate with Indonesia to resolve maritime issues between the two countries. Although Indonesia is not involved in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, China’s 'Nine-Dash Line' claim overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Natuna Islands. Chinese coast guard vessels have entered Indonesia’s Natuna Sea in recent years. However, it is noteworthy that these two recent incidents occurred within a week of Prabowo taking office. China has consistently expressed interest in collaborating with Indonesia to develop the North Natuna Sea, so these actions may be a way to test the new administration’s stance on potential cooperation. The Chinese coast guard entered Indonesia’s EEZ in the Natuna Sea immediately after Prabowo’s inauguration and his meeting with China’s Vice President Han Zheng, which could be seen as an unwelcome 'gift' for Prabowo.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/indonesia-navy-expels-chinese-coast-guard-ship-from-north-natuna-sea	2024-10-28T03:33:22-07:00

The two-year extension will see Raytheon continue to provide operations and maintenance support for the Sea-based X-band Radar and 13 Army-Navy Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Raytheon secures a $900 million contract extension with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to support and sustain advanced radar systems. (Picture source: Dvids) The Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX-1) remains a cornerstone of the U.S. ballistic missile defense strategy due to its unprecedented ability to detect and assess threats from vast distances, making it a powerful mobile asset for tracking and intercepting missile threats. Positioned on a self-propelled, semi-submersible oil platform, this radar provides coverage that can be quickly adapted to varying geopolitical hotspots across the Pacific, a region where missile threats from countries like North Korea, China, and Russia are a growing concern​. The SBX-1’s high-precision X-band radar, encased within a massive radome, has approximately 45,000 transmit/receive modules, allowing it to detect and discriminate between missiles, decoys, and debris. It can track objects as small as a baseball from up to 2,500 miles away, feeding critical data back to ground-based interceptors for midcourse corrections. This data transmission occurs through the In-Flight Interceptor Communications System Data Terminal onboard, which enables real-time adjustments for interceptors and heightens the radar’s utility in ballistic missile defense​. Operational since 2006, SBX-1 has been deployed extensively in the Pacific, often supporting defense readiness against North Korean missile tests and other emergent threats. However, recent deployments have highlighted both its strengths and limitations. While it offers exceptional tracking precision, its relatively narrow field of view poses challenges when responding to complex scenarios involving multiple missiles or advanced countermeasures such as decoys. In response, the SBX-1 has undergone upgrades and maintenance in Hawaii, addressing structural issues from its extensive 662-day deployment and enhancing its ability to support intercepts under higher demand from the U.S. Space Command and Space Force​. The SBX program has sometimes drawn criticism for its high operational costs, which stem from its maintenance-intensive mobile platform and the need for frequent crew rotations. Nonetheless, the radar’s mobility and ability to adjust to the Earth's curvature give it a distinct advantage over land-based radars, enabling tracking over oceanic expanses and the flexibility to relocate in response to shifting threat landscapes. These advantages remain critical as missile defense analysts underscore the necessity of monitoring emerging hypersonic threats, which can travel at extreme speeds and low altitudes, evading traditional missile defense systems​. Looking ahead, discussions around the SBX's future are ongoing, with considerations about whether additional units or complementary systems are required. Space-based sensors are also under evaluation as potential support for a more diversified missile defense network.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/raytheon-awarded-contract-to-maintain-us-navy-sea-based-x-band-radar	2024-10-28T02:52:00-07:00	
US Army’s Future XM30 Combat Vehicle to Redefine IFV with a 50mm Cannon and AI Technologies	According to Nicholas Drummond on October 27, 2024, the US Army’s future XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle is set to redefine the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category when it enters service in 2027, replacing the aging M2 Bradley. The US Army has awarded General Dynamics and Rheinmetall $800 million each to develop prototypes for this vehicle as part of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program. The total value of the program is estimated at $45 billion, with the Army planning to purchase approximately 3,800 units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, which has been in service since the 1980s. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The XM30 is expected to bring significant changes to the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category, featuring a 50x228 mm cannon in a remote-controlled turret, twin Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), an AI-enabled fire control system, and a hybrid drivetrain. The XM30 will have a crew of two (a driver and a commander) and will carry six infantry personnel. The vehicle’s size and capacity have been designed to maintain a balance between firepower and mobility while preventing it from becoming too large or heavy, as seen with some past IFV designs. It will be designed to work alongside future versions of the M1 Abrams and is expected to include protection against Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Digital engineering has been central to the development of the XM30. In the early phases of the program, five contractors were given approximately $60 million each to create digital designs based on draft requirements from the Army. Through this process that facilitated its design, development, and potential future upgrades, the US Army refined the vehicle's requirements and ensured they were achievable, avoiding issues that led to the cancellation of earlier programs. For instance, by using 3D models and simulations early in the design phase, the Army ensures that all requirements and subsystems, including sensors and fire control mechanisms, are aligned before physical prototypes are constructed. This approach minimizes development costs and helps contractors and the Army quickly address any design issues that arise during the process. The modular design of the XM30 supports future technological updates, enabling the integration of new systems with minimal changes to the vehicle's core architecture. Equipped with a hybrid-electric drivetrain and a variety of weapon systems, including a 50mm cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, the XM30 is configured to meet current operational requirements while maintaining flexibility for future needs. The vehicle's reduced crew size and its capacity to transport infantry are aimed at improving operational efficiency without increasing size or complexity. The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley, which has been in service since the 1980s. Despite several earlier attempts, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and Future Combat System programs, previous initiatives were not successful, often due to issues with aligning requirements, funding, technology, and schedule. Colonel Jeffery Jurand, the project manager for the XM30, has emphasized that the current program is aligned in these areas, supported by the use of digital engineering. This approach allows for the design and testing of the vehicle through digital models, avoiding some of the challenges faced by earlier programs. Both General Dynamics and Rheinmetall were selected to move forward in the competition, with the Army currently in phase three of a five-phase schedule. These contractors will deliver prototypes by late 2026, with the Army conducting critical design reviews by the first half of fiscal year 2025. The final selection of a single vendor for production will take place around the first quarter of fiscal year 2028, after testing and evaluation of the prototypes. The program is also supported by the 'digital trinity' approach, which includes models-based systems engineering, digital engineering, and development, security, and operations (DevSecOps). This digital approach has allowed for improved traceability and communication between contractors and the Army, with errors being identified and addressed earlier in the design process. The open architecture of the XM30 design has been highlighted as a way to accommodate future upgrades and reduce costs. The XM30 is one of six pathfinder programs identified by the Army to demonstrate the benefits of digital engineering. The Army's use of digital engineering for this project is intended to improve design efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the vehicle's modularity and adaptability for future needs. The program has drawn confidence from senior Army leaders, who have expressed support for its goals and its potential to provide long-term benefits, including cost savings through its open architecture. As the program moves forward, the remaining phases will focus on prototype development, testing, and evaluation. The Army is scheduled to begin testing the prototypes in 2026, with a final decision on production expected in 2028.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-armys-future-xm30-to-redefine-ifv-category-with-ai-driven-systems-and-50mm-remote-cannon	2024-10-28T02:29:56-07:00	
Satellite Images Reveal Rise of Chinese Forces with 59 New DF-26 Missile Launchers	In October 2024, new satellite images revealed a significant increase in Chinese production of launchers for DF-26 ballistic missiles, indicating a considerable strengthening of China’s strategic arsenal. An image taken on September 9, 2024, by Umbra's synthetic aperture radar (SAR) showed 59 mobile launchers at the Xinghang Electromechanical Equipment production site in Beijing. This observation highlights the growing capabilities of China, raising important strategic concerns, particularly in the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The DF-26 is an intermediate-range ballistic missile from the Dong Feng family, developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). With a range of 4,000 km, it is the first Chinese missile capable of striking conventional targets, such as U.S. bases in Guam. This solid-fuel, two-stage missile is 14 meters long and weighs 20 tons, capable of carrying a payload between 1,200 and 1,800 kg, including nuclear warheads and various conventional warheads. It is deployed on a mobile Taian HTF5680 launcher, allowing for rapid and discreet deployment. The DF-26’s modular design enables the warheads to be swapped based on mission requirements, with options for both land strikes and moving naval targets, supported by a terminal guidance system. Since its unveiling in 2015, production of the DF-26 has accelerated, with over 250 units produced by 2024. The brigades of the People’s Liberation Army equipped with these missiles benefit from their mobility and precision strike capabilities, targeting a range of assets including military installations and medium-sized ships. Its operational flexibility and extended range make it a key component of China’s anti-access and area denial strategy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Between 2023 and 2024, satellite images and industry reports indicate that the Beijing-Xinghang facility produced at least 72 new launchers, enough to equip two additional missile brigades. These units would join the seven existing brigades of the People’s Liberation Army, bringing the total number of DF-26 launchers to around 250. However, some experts, notably from the Federation of American Scientists, suggest that China may be inflating the actual number of launchers, potentially creating confusion about the true extent of its capabilities. The DF-26, part of the Dong Feng missile family ('East Wind'), offers enhanced strategic capabilities compared to earlier versions such as the DF-21. Its extended range, combined with improved accuracy through satellite-assisted inertial guidance, makes it a serious threat to high-value targets like military bases, airports, and naval facilities. The potential integration of terminal guidance could also enable the DF-26 to fulfill anti-ship roles, posing a threat to U.S. carrier strike groups operating in the Pacific. The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea. The expansion of China’s missile arsenal could also signal an intention to challenge U.S. access to its strategic bases, which play a crucial role in supporting regional alliances with Japan, South Korea, and other partners. Growing tensions in the region, combined with the DF-26's dual-use (nuclear and conventional) nature, raise concerns about the risk of unintended escalation in a crisis, particularly if a conventional strike is misinterpreted as a nuclear attack. As China strengthens its strategic forces, it continues to expand its nuclear capabilities. U.S. estimates suggest that by 2030, China's nuclear arsenal could exceed 1,000 warheads, primarily in the form of intercontinental missiles. In parallel, efforts are underway to increase the number of long-range missile launchers, including the DF-31 and DF-41, which are capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/satellite-images-reveal-rise-of-chinese-forces-with-59-new-df-26-missile-launchers	2024-10-28T02:23:01-07:00	
Ukraine's Su-24 Bomber Now Armed with Western SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow Missiles	Ukraine has successfully adapted its Soviet-era Su-24 bomber to carry and launch Franco-British SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow air-to-surface cruise missiles.

The integration of this powerful missile system into Ukraine’s air fleet significantly enhances its long-range strike capabilities, marking a critical development in its defense strategy against Russian aggression.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Ukrainian Su-24 fighter jet armed with two SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow cruise missiles, showcasing its newly integrated long-range strike capability with Western-supplied precision weapons. (Picture source: X Account French Aid to Ukraine) The Su-24 is a Soviet-era, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing bomber aircraft designed for all-weather, low-level penetration strikes. Developed by Sukhoi in the late 1960s and introduced into service in the early 1970s, the Su-24 was intended to provide the Soviet Air Force with a deep strike platform capable of carrying a wide array of conventional and nuclear weapons. It became the backbone of the Soviet Union's tactical bomber fleet, comparable to the U.S. F-111, and saw significant upgrades over the years. Widely exported to allied nations, the Su-24 has remained in service in several countries, including Russia and Ukraine, with modernization efforts extending its operational lifespan and capabilities, even in the post-Soviet era. The adaptation of Ukraine’s Su-24s to deploy the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missile is a notable achievement, as it allows the Ukrainian Air Force to strike enemy targets with high precision at extended ranges. The Su-24, originally a Soviet-designed, all-weather attack aircraft built for deep penetration missions, has been extensively modified by Ukrainian engineers to fire these advanced Western missiles. The modifications involved updating the avionics, fire control systems, and communication interfaces between the missile and the aircraft, ensuring full compatibility with the SCALP-EG’s guidance and targeting systems. This successful integration marks the first time a non-NATO platform has been adapted to use this sophisticated missile, a testament to Ukraine’s ingenuity in modernizing its Soviet-era fleet with Western technology. The Su-24’s variable-sweep wing design and its ability to operate at low altitudes make it an ideal platform for launching SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles, enabling Ukraine to carry out precision strikes on critical Russian military infrastructure while minimizing the risk of detection. The SCALP-EG, also known as Storm Shadow in the UK, was delivered to Ukraine in mid-2023 as part of a broader package of military aid from France and the United Kingdom. These missiles were provided in response to Ukraine’s urgent requests for advanced weaponry capable of countering Russian long-range artillery and missile attacks. The delivery was a turning point, as it allowed Ukraine to bridge the gap in its long-range strike capabilities, giving it the tools to target Russian positions far beyond the front lines. The SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow is a long-range, air-launched cruise missile designed for precision strikes, offering key advantages in range, accuracy, and stealth. Its extended range, exceeding 250 kilometers (and up to 560 kilometers in some variants), allows Ukrainian forces to hit deep targets within Russian-occupied territories without entering contested airspace. The missile is equipped with a 450 kg BROACH (Bomb Royal Ordnance Augmented Charge) warhead, a two-stage system that first penetrates hardened structures and then detonates inside, maximizing destruction against fortified targets such as bunkers, command centers, and ammunition depots. Guided by a combination of GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain-following radar, the SCALP-EG ensures precise targeting, especially in the final phase of its flight, where it uses infrared sensors to compare the target with pre-loaded images. This ensures high accuracy even in heavily defended areas. Additionally, the missile's low radar cross-section gives it a stealthy profile, making it difficult to detect and intercept by enemy air defenses, which enhances its ability to penetrate contested airspace. Together, these features—long range, significant destructive power, and pinpoint accuracy—make the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow an effective tool for disrupting enemy operations, particularly by degrading logistical and command structures. This offers Ukraine a crucial strategic advantage in the ongoing conflict. The ability to launch SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles from Su-24 aircraft gives Ukraine a new level of operational flexibility. Prior to this development, Ukraine’s ability to strike at long-range was limited, but the integration of these missiles now allows the Ukrainian Air Force to conduct deep strikes into Russian-held territory without exposing its aircraft to significant risk. With a range of over 250 kilometers, the SCALP-EG can reach critical Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs far behind the front lines. This allows Ukraine to disrupt supply lines, command centers, and infrastructure that are essential for sustaining Russian operations. The Su-24’s ability to deliver these strikes at low altitude, combined with the missile’s stealth characteristics, greatly increases the likelihood of successful missions. Recent reports indicate that Ukrainian forces have already employed the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow in several operations, targeting Russian logistics centers and ammunition depots with precision. The strikes not only degrade Russia’s operational capabilities but also force Russian forces to divert resources to defend rear-area positions that were previously out of Ukraine’s reach. The integration of SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles into Ukraine’s Su-24 aircraft marks a significant evolution in the nation’s military capabilities. This adaptation has transformed the Su-24 into a formidable long-range strike platform capable of hitting critical Russian targets with precision and stealth. As the conflict continues, Ukraine’s ability to carry out deep strikes against key Russian military assets will be crucial in shaping the course of the war. With Western support and Ukraine’s innovative approach to integrating advanced technologies into its existing fleet, the Su-24 armed with SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles represents a powerful tool in Ukraine’s fight to reclaim its territory and push back Russian forces. This new capability may well prove to be a game-changer as Ukraine continues to defend its sovereignty.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/ukraines-su-24-bomber-now-armed-with-western-scalp-eg-storm-shadow-missiles	2024-10-28T02:13:19-07:00

US Navy Eyes Patriot Missiles to Counter China’s Hypersonic Threats in Pacific	According to information published by The Economic Times on October 25, 2024, the U.S. Navy is advancing plans to deploy Patriot interceptor missiles on its warships, Amid rising security concerns over China’s potential use of advanced hypersonic weapons in the Indo-Pacific. This move is intended to counter the growing threat of Chinese missile technology, specifically anti-ship ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles capable of evading traditional defense systems, according to two senior defense officials.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of US Navy warships. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Patriot missiles, particularly the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) variant, are already employed by the U.S. Army for land-based air defense. These interceptors, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, offer agility and the capability to target highly maneuverable threats, positioning them as a potential solution to counter hypersonic advancements anticipated in Chinese arsenals. Integrating these interceptors into naval defense systems signals a notable shift in U.S. military strategy as tensions in the Indo-Pacific persist and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) rapidly modernizes its capabilities. The addition of the PAC-3 interceptors to the Navy's arsenal is seen as essential to expanding the layered defense system on U.S. vessels. Demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors has soared, driven by a heightened interest from foreign governments and the U.S. Army’s ambition to more than double production in the coming years. Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3’s manufacturer, is exploring avenues to increase production, including plans for a new production line for missile seekers in Florida. This facility would supplement Boeing’s existing manufacturing of seekers, and production for PAC-3 could eventually include Japan, a key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific region. The PAC-3's compact size, agility, and advanced 'hit-to-kill' technology—which allows the interceptor to destroy threats by direct impact rather than proximity detonation—make it well-suited for combating high-speed ballistic and hypersonic missiles. These interceptors would enhance existing capabilities aboard U.S. ships to target and neutralize fast-moving threats. The U.S. Navy has already conducted preliminary virtual tests of PAC-3 interceptors aboard a 'virtual Aegis ship,' using the Mk. 70 vertical launcher system, which is foundational for naval missile launches. However, the interceptors have yet to be physically deployed on a vessel, and additional testing is required to synchronize PAC-3 systems with the Navy's SPY-1 radar, a key component of the Aegis missile defense system. The PAC-3 interceptors have demonstrated significant capabilities in recent conflicts, successfully intercepting high-speed threats such as Russia’s Khinzal missiles in Ukraine. The missile’s success has spurred interest in incorporating it into the Navy’s defenses, adding a cost-effective layer against the sophisticated hypersonic and ballistic missiles developed by China. China’s missile capabilities, particularly the DF-21D 'carrier killer' and the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, are a central security concern for U.S. forces in the Pacific. The DF-27, which can cover a range of up to 5,000 miles, features an aerodynamic warhead that can maneuver, complicating defense strategies. This missile could pose a direct threat to U.S. naval forces and moving targets alike. While the Navy’s existing SM-6 missiles can reach targets in space, the PAC-3, though limited in range, offers greater agility due to rockets positioned near its nose, enabling it to respond effectively to high-speed threats in lower altitudes. The introduction of PAC-3 MSE interceptors could supplement these existing capabilities, enhancing the layered defense necessary to address the evolving threat environment in the Indo-Pacific.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-eyes-patriot-missiles-to-counter-chinas-hypersonic-threats-in-pacific	2024-10-25T05:18:04-07:00

Earlier reports, such as Tasnim in November 2023, confirmed Iran’s acquisition of Russian aircraft, including Mil Mi-28 attack helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 training jets. According to Sardar Seyed Mehdi Farhi, Deputy Minister of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, these acquisitions are part of ongoing efforts to enhance Iran’s military aviation capabilities, particularly focusing on helicopter upgrades and improvements to night flying and avionics systems. Farhi also mentioned the work of Iran’s Helicopter Support and Renovation Company (Panha) over the past three decades. This development aligns with discussions held in January 2023 between Igor Levitin, a special assistant to the Russian president, and Iran’s First Vice President, Mohammed Mokhbar. During this meeting, Levitin expressed Russia’s readiness to pursue joint helicopter production with Iran. Amir Mojtaba Rouhani, CEO of Panha, had previously noted Iran’s regional leadership in helicopter maintenance services. In June 2023, Iranian Air Force Commander Amir Hamid Vahedi, in an interview about the Su-35, stated, 'We need the said Sukhoi jet, but we don’t know when it will arrive.' Vahedi referred to the construction of underground air bases, such as 'Oryol 44,' designed to protect the country’s fighter jets from potential attacks, including bunker-buster munitions. He indicated that these bases are strategically located to ensure operational safety and readiness. Vahedi also highlighted the modernization of Iran’s fleet of F-4 and F-14 aircraft, focusing on radar upgrades and extending the range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Iran’s Air Force currently operates a diverse fleet of fighter jets, including American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, as well as Russian-made MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft. The fleet also includes domestically produced jets like the HESA Saeqeh and Kowsar.

These upgrades bolster the missile's performance in urban warfare, providing faster target engagement and increased effectiveness against a wide range of adversary targets. The TOW 2B represents a significant upgrade over previous versions of the TOW anti-tank missile system, particularly in how it engages armored targets. Earlier variants, like the TOW 2A, primarily relied on a direct attack mode, striking the sides or frontal areas of enemy vehicles, which often feature the heaviest armor. In contrast, the TOW 2B uses a top-attack profile, where the missile flies over the target and fires its explosively formed penetrators downward, striking the tank or vehicle at its most vulnerable point—typically the roof, where armor is thinner. This capability is supported by advanced sensors and fuzing mechanisms that detect the optimal moment to engage the target. Additionally, the TOW 2B's dual warhead design improves its effectiveness against reactive armor, providing superior penetration and lethality compared to earlier models. This makes the TOW 2B particularly valuable in countering modern tanks and armored vehicles, which increasingly incorporate sophisticated armor protection systems. 'The TOW anti-tank missilee system remains combat-proven, and these latest enhancements ensure it continues to excel in complex engagements, particularly in anti-tank operations,' said Tom Laliberty, President of Land and Air Defense Systems at Raytheon. The TOW missile has seen extensive service since its inception, with over 700,000 systems delivered to U.S. and international forces. It has been a critical asset in various conflicts, being deployed in combat more than 11,000 times since 2003.

South Korea reveals supersonic air-to-surface missile to strengthen fighter jets exports	On October 24, 2024, at the Sacheon Air Show, the South Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) unveiled a supersonic air-to-surface missile for the first time. This unveiling comes amidst concerns over delays in weapons integration, which have affected the export competitiveness of domestic fighter jets such as the FA-50 and the KF-21. However, the new missile offers promising export potential and may help strengthen the position of Korean defense exports in international markets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. (Picture source: YouTube/슈퍼소닉TV) The supersonic air-to-surface missile is designed to be mounted on aircraft and can strike key ground targets with precision from long range. Similar to missiles like the Cheonryong developed by LIG Nex1 and Germany’s Taurus, this missile performs the same fundamental task. However, unlike subsonic air-to-surface missiles that fly at speeds of 700–1,100 km/h, the newly unveiled missile reaches supersonic speeds of Mach 2.5, or around 3,000 km/h, making it much harder to detect and intercept. With a range of 300 km, the missile can hit its target in just about five minutes after launch, significantly reducing the reaction time for enemy defenses. The missile is also expected to incorporate stealth technology, making it less detectable by enemy radar. One of the key features enabling such high speeds is the ducted ramjet engine. This innovative propulsion system combines the advantages of jet and rocket engines, using atmospheric oxygen instead of carrying an onboard oxidizer. This design not only simplifies the structure but also allows for longer burn times and faster speeds compared to traditional jet engines. Another notable characteristic of this missile is its modular design, which enables it to perform multiple functions. By simply swapping modules, the missile can be configured to engage either ground targets or enemy ships. The missile’s seeker, equipped with both radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, further enhances its ability to accurately strike targets in various weather conditions and amidst electronic countermeasures. Although the missile displayed at the air show was a test model rather than a final product, it represents a significant step forward. Weapons intended for aircraft integration typically require extensive software development and flight testing, which incurs substantial costs. To address this, ADD has been using test models for preliminary drop and flight tests. Flight tests of this new missile are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform.

The system’s distinct feature lies in its motorized buttstock, which adjusts the rifle’s angle to optimize shooting accuracy, allowing the shooter to target drones more effectively. Unlike existing assisted-aiming systems like the SMASH 2000 series from Israeli firm Smart Shooter, ZeroMark’s FCS uses advanced vision algorithms to steer the weapon’s barrel, even making slight angular adjustments to maximize shot alignment. ZeroMark’s technology, described as a 'fire control system,' includes a small computer and motorized stock. CEO Joel Anderson explains that this motorized stock creates a virtual pivot between the shoulder and rifle, allowing small degree adjustments to refine shot trajectory and compensate for both drone and shooter movement, as well as variations caused by noise or torque. Installation on any rifle takes just 30 seconds, potentially making drone defense a manageable task for the average soldier. Anderson states that the system 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting an 18-meter-diameter circle,' making such skills accessible to a broader range of soldiers. A former U.S. Navy member and the first security director of MongoDB, Anderson says he drew inspiration for ZeroMark after driving a Tesla with autopilot and wondering why similar technology wasn’t available to soldiers. Seeing a growing need for anti-drone solutions, he presented the prototype to a16z partners, who encouraged him to launch the startup in 2022. ZeroMark’s development is focused solely on countering offensive drones. While acknowledging that the concept of a weapon 'that never misses' may be controversial, Anderson clarifies that the company avoids marketing its systems to law enforcement, stating: 'I don’t believe the world is ready for that, nor am I. I don’t want to see AI-enabled weapons in police hands.' To mitigate potential misuse, the company has incorporated remote management, license-based activation, and fleet management features to ensure responsible use. FCS units are already in use by private security firms to protect assets like boats against potential drone threats related to piracy. ZeroMark is in talks to send its devices to Ukraine and is engaging in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense for testing and evaluation that could lead to larger orders. Beyond self-targeting capabilities, Anderson envisions ZeroMark software being applied in other contexts, such as cameras capable of identifying drone types, origin, or payload. In the long term, he envisions integrating the system into head-up displays or auditory interfaces to deliver real-time critical information to soldiers. Anderson sums up his vision: 'Large systems like aircraft carriers don’t win wars. They help project power but don’t capture Husseins, don’t kill Bin Ladens, don’t bring hostages home; soldiers do... and I want them to be as untouchable as an F-22 in the sky.'	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-marines-integrate-moving-stock-aiming-system-to-enhance-rifle-accuracy-against-drones	2024-10-25T00:50:07-07:00

(Picture source: French Air Force) In the early 1980s, India sought to counter Pakistan's acquisition of F-16 fighters by acquiring a comparable aircraft. After reviewing available options, India chose the Mirage 2000 based on its design and performance. In 1982, an order for 36 Mirage 2000H and four Mirage 2000TH aircraft was placed with Dassault, and deliveries occurred between 1985 and 1994. The Mirage 2000 became an integral part of the IAF’s fleet. Although India initially considered domestic production of the Mirage 2000, this plan was set aside in favor of continuing defense cooperation with the Soviet Union, resulting in the acquisition of the MiG-29. In 2011, India approved an upgrade of its Mirage 2000 fleet to the Mirage 2000-5 Mk.2 standard, adding improvements to avionics, radar, electronic warfare systems, and the integration of MICA missiles. The Mirage 2000 was used during the 1999 Kargil War as part of Operation Safed Sagar, flying over 500 sorties for airstrikes. It was also deployed during the 2001–02 India-Pakistan standoff, where it used precision-guided bombs against Pakistani bunkers. In 2019, 12 Mirage 2000s were used in an airstrike on an alleged terrorist camp in Balakot, marking the first time since 1971 that IAF fighters entered Pakistani airspace. During the 2020 China-India standoff, Mirage 2000Is were deployed along the Line of Actual Control after the Galwan Valley skirmish. In 2021, India purchased retired Mirage 2000 airframes from France for parts to maintain its fleet, with the deal valued at ₹3,000,000,000 (approximately $36,000,000). This was intended to maintain the operational readiness of the IAF’s Mirage squadrons by securing spare parts.

US confirms 3000 North Korean soldiers moved to Russia for military training	On October 23, 2024, during a press conference, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the deployment of these 3,000 North Korean soldiers to eastern Russia. According to reports, these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan region in North Korea to Vladivostok, a major port in eastern Russia. They were then transferred to various military training centers in eastern Russia, where they are currently undergoing intensive training. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning (Picture source: KNCA) The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning. Fears of these troops engaging in combat alongside Russian forces have heightened concerns about further escalation in the war in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin echoed this concern, stating that this development would be a 'serious step' after North Korea had already supplied arms to Russia. The exact nature of the North Korean soldiers' mission, who are currently in training, remains unclear. This situation arises as Russia seeks to bolster its military capabilities in a conflict that has become protracted. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, the war has escalated, causing significant casualties on both sides, while remaining largely focused on the eastern front of Ukraine. The potential arrival of North Korean soldiers could mark a significant shift in this war of attrition. The U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation and has briefed Ukrainian authorities as well as international partners. Kirby added that should these North Korean soldiers enter combat, they would become 'legitimate targets' for the Ukrainian forces. The deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia is seen by many observers as a sign of weakness on the part of the Kremlin. The decision to turn to Pyongyang, a largely isolated state on the international stage, reflects the difficult position in which Moscow finds itself after more than two years of conflict. Relying on North Korean human resources further highlights Russia’s growing dependence on marginal alliances, even as its losses on the battlefield continue to mount. The South Korean government, for its part, has expressed concern about the potential military technology Russia might offer North Korea in exchange for this military support. Some experts suggest that Moscow could provide advanced military technologies to Pyongyang, particularly in the areas of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which would significantly enhance the threat posed by North Korea to the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has also indicated that this deployment could involve up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers by the end of the year. Despite denials from both Moscow and Pyongyang regarding troop deployments or arms transfers, the international community, especially NATO, views this growing military alliance between Russia and North Korea as a major concern. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been invited to Brussels to share intelligence on these developments with NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-confirms-3000-north-korean-soldiers-moved-to-russia-for-military-training	2024-10-24T01:10:49-07:00

A helicopter was also utilized in the exercise to deliver materials onto the ship, showcasing the vessel’s air replenishment capability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link China Type 093A comprehensive supply ship Kekexilihu. (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The Type 903A supply ships are integral to the PLA Navy’s logistics, designed to support naval operations through extensive replenishment functions. The Kekexilihu is equipped to deliver a wide array of supplies, including fuel and essential materials, while also facilitating helicopter operations. Replenishment operations Replenishment at sea (RAS) plays a crucial role in modern naval warfare by enabling fleets to remain operational far from their home bases for extended periods. This capability extends the endurance of naval forces by allowing them to resupply with fuel, ammunition, food, and other essential stores without returning to port, thus maintaining their presence in the operational area and maximizing combat effectiveness. During major naval campaigns like World War II, RAS allowed fleets, such as the U.S. Navy’s Task Force 58, to remain engaged in continuous operations, including long-range strikes against Japan, by refueling and resupplying at sea. The ability to conduct underway replenishments meant that fleets could avoid the lengthy transit times to distant bases, which would otherwise limit their operational tempo. By the end of the war, the U.S. had refined RAS to include not just fuel but also ordnance, enabling sustained high-tempo operations over vast distances​. In more recent conflicts, such as the Falklands War, the critical nature of RAS was highlighted when the British Navy operated 7,000 miles from home. The success of this operation relied heavily on the Navy’s ability to sustain its fleet through effective resupply at sea. Similarly, today’s complex naval missions—ranging from humanitarian aid to high-intensity conflict—depend on the logistical support provided by RAS to maintain forward-deployed naval forces​. Moreover, replenishment operations are not without risks. Ships involved in RAS are highly vulnerable, as their ability to maneuver is limited while they are connected for resupply. This vulnerability underscores the importance of coordination, precision, and technology, as modern RAS systems increasingly emphasize safety and reliability​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-supply-ship-kekexilihu-conducts-helicopter-replenishment-during-maritime-drill-in-yellow-sea	2024-10-24T00:50:54-07:00	
Leave SCAF for GCAP: Germany’s Growing Alliance with UK in Combat Drone Technology	The strategic relationship between Germany and the United Kingdom has taken on new following the announcement of the Trinity House Agreement on October 23, 2024. This defense agreement focuses on joint development efforts, particularly creating a combat drone. The collaboration between the two countries could signal a shift in Germany's defense alignment, as it also encompasses areas related to both the SCAF (Système de Combat Aérien du Futur) and GCAP (Global Combat Air Programme) projects. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance (Picture source: Leonardo ) In November 2023, rumors surfaced suggesting that Germany might abandon the SCAF program in favor of joining GCAP. Despite official denials, the Trinity House Agreement seems to bolster these claims by intensifying defense ties between Germany and the UK, including joint land-based weapons projects and drone development. The SCAF Project, also known as FCAS (Future Combat Air System), is a large-scale European initiative involving France, Germany, and Spain. It aims to develop a next-generation air combat system, expected to be operational around 2040. This program is based on a 'system of systems' approach, including three main components: the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), unmanned systems called Remote Carriers (RC), and a digital infrastructure known as the Combat Cloud. The NGF, led by Dassault Aviation, will serve as the central platform for advanced combat missions, assisted by RC drones that provide specific support capabilities. The Combat Cloud will enable integrated communication between all system elements, optimizing data management and decision-making, even in contested environments. The objective is to strengthen European technological sovereignty and ensure autonomous defense capabilities for future threats. The GCAP Project, launched in 2022, is a competing initiative led by the UK, Italy, and Japan. The goal is to develop a sixth-generation fighter that can operate alongside unmanned systems, combat drones, and advanced intelligent weapons. Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance. The project aims to replace the UK and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons and Japan's Mitsubishi F-2 by 2035. It benefits from industrial expertise provided by partners such as BAE Systems, Leonardo, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries​. While both programs aim to develop next-generation air combat capabilities, they differ in structure and ambition. SCAF focuses on enhancing European interoperability between existing platforms like the Rafale and Eurofighter, while GCAP involves broader cooperation with a focus on transnational alliances beyond Europe. However, delays in the SCAF program could lead to Germany reorienting part of its efforts toward projects that address its more immediate needs. The Trinity House Agreement, presented by the UK Ministry of Defense as a significant step for European security, underscores the growing importance of cooperation between the two largest European defense investors. In addition to enhanced joint exercises, the agreement includes provisions to protect critical underwater infrastructure and marks the first-ever temporary deployment of German P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in Scotland, bolstering the UK's surveillance capabilities. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon (Picture source: Army Recognition) A major component of this agreement is the defense industry collaboration, including plans for a large-caliber weapons manufacturing facility in the UK and joint work on ground-based drones (UGVs). This initiative could pave the way for British participation in the Franco-German MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) project. The agreement also emphasizes the rapid development of new, more precise long-range weapons systems. Although the German Defense Ministry has been vague on this point, these projects could fall under the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, which the UK recently joined. The Trinity House Agreement also touches on air defense cooperation, with plans to integrate British and German systems to better protect European airspace from long-range missile threats. Despite the UK's current limitations in this domain, as noted in a recent report, this cooperation could enhance collective security in Europe. One of the most notable aspects of this agreement is the commitment to developing autonomous aerial drones that can operate in coordination with fighter aircraft. Although Germany had initially planned to collaborate with France on the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS) project, Berlin's decision to purchase P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Boeing ended that initiative. The agreement with the UK could signal a shift toward solutions more tailored to the specific needs of both nations. The German Ministry of Defense clarified that these drones will be developed in close cooperation with allies, particularly France, as part of SCAF's third pillar, which Germany oversees. This pillar focuses on drones and connected effectors. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon. Although the technical details of this project remain undisclosed, it appears to align with the goals of the Trinity House Agreement. Finally, supporting Ukraine remains a central objective for both countries. This agreement reaffirms their commitment to providing Ukraine with the military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Concrete initiatives include integrating modern missile systems into the Sea King helicopters donated by Germany and closer collaboration between the UK and German defense industries to support Ukraine's war effort.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/leave-scaf-for-gcap-germanys-growing-alliance-with-uk-in-combat-drone-technology	2024-10-24T00:27:21-07:00
