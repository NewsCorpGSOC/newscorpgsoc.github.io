Denmark Ramps Up Rearmament to Counter European Tensions and American Influence	On 19 February 2025, Denmark announced an unprecedented plan to strengthen its defense, allocating an investment of 120 billion Danish kroner (16 billion euros) by 2033. This decision marks a break from decades of budget cuts and comes amid increasing tensions in Europe, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and uncertainty regarding U.S. engagement in the region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In December 2024, Denmark strengthened its cooperation with Sweden by signing a $2.5 billion contract with BAE Systems for the acquisition of 115 new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles (Picture source: Danish MoD) The Danish strategy follows a dual approach. An acceleration fund of 50 billion kroner will be allocated for 2025-2026 to finance short-term military acquisitions and reinforce support for Ukraine. An additional 70 billion kroner will be allocated between 2027 and 2033 to modernize the armed forces, recruit personnel, and develop infrastructure. This increase will bring defense spending to 3.2% of GDP in 2025, exceeding NATO’s 2% target. In 2024, Denmark implemented several significant measures to strengthen its military capabilities. A multiparty agreement was reached to achieve 2% of GDP in military spending that same year, six years ahead of the original plan. An allocation of 35.2 billion kroner (4.72 billion euros) was dedicated to acquiring CV90 infantry fighting vehicles, short- and medium-range air defense systems, and anti-submarine capabilities. The military service system was also reformed, increasing the number of annual conscripts from 4,700 to 7,500 and extending the service period from four to eleven months. In December 2024, Denmark strengthened its cooperation with Sweden by signing a $2.5 billion contract with BAE Systems for the acquisition of 115 new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles. These vehicles, equipped with upgraded turrets and advanced targeting systems, are intended to enhance Denmark’s heavy brigade and contribute to collective security. Denmark has also increased its support for Ukraine with arms and military equipment purchases amounting to 538 million euros. These acquisitions include Bohdana artillery systems, long-range strike drones, anti-tank missiles, and anti-ship missiles. In February 2025, an additional 50 billion kroner (6.99 billion euros) was allocated to address gaps in air defense systems and expedite military equipment acquisitions. Denmark justifies these measures by citing an increasing potential threat from Russia, which could pose a serious risk to the Baltic states and NATO members if the alliance does not strengthen its military capabilities. A recent Danish intelligence report warns of a credible threat in the Baltic Sea region within two years if the war in Ukraine ends or reaches a stalemate. The re-election of Donald Trump and shifts in U.S. foreign policy have further added to uncertainties. Statements suggesting a possible U.S. disengagement from European affairs and renewed interest in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, have prompted Copenhagen to reassess its strategic position. To accelerate military acquisitions, the Danish Ministry of Defense will undergo restructuring. The Chief of Defense will be given an expanded role, with certain administrative agencies placed under direct military command. This centralization aims to streamline decision-making. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated, 'There is only one directive for the Chief of Defense: buy, buy, buy,' adding that procurement processes will be expedited to facilitate quicker acquisitions, even if that means opting for alternatives when the best equipment is unavailable. Denmark is also enhancing its military presence in the Arctic and North Atlantic by acquiring additional Arctic patrol vessels and long-range drones to counter Russian military activities in the region. The issue of Greenland remains a focal point, particularly after the U.S. announced in January 2024 its intention to expand its military presence on the island. In response, Frederiksen reaffirmed that 'Greenland is not for sale' and emphasized Denmark’s sovereignty over the territory. This military buildup aligns with broader European trends. Lithuania has announced an increase in its defense budget to 5-6% of GDP by 2026, while Latvia plans to reach 4% in 2025. To finance these investments, Denmark is considering exceptional fiscal measures. The government has not ruled out introducing a 'war tax' to cover rising military expenditures, which could cost an average Danish household up to 85,000 kroner (11,927 euros) per year. This policy marks a shift for a country historically cautious in budgetary matters, having maintained surpluses since 2016 and holding the best fiscal balance in the European Union since 2019. Finally, Denmark has developed a 'Danish model' to support Ukraine, facilitating direct contracts between Kyiv and European defense manufacturers to accelerate weapons production. With these changes, Denmark is positioning itself as a key player in European security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/denmark-ramps-up-rearmament-to-counter-european-tensions-and-american-influence	2025-02-27T00:06:08-08:00	
British Navy Deploys New Mini Helicopter Drone Peregrine for Maritime Security Operations	The UK Royal Navy has successfully deployed its new mini remotely piloted helicopter, Peregrine, on a long-term maritime security mission in the Middle East. This marks the first operational use of the drone, which was first announced for deployment in 2023.

(Picture source: UK MoD) Peregrine, a 10ft long uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, including conducting extended sorties of up to five hours, operating beyond the horizon. The UAV was launched from the flight deck of the Type 23 frigate HMS Lancaster, where it played a key role in monitoring illicit activities on the so-called 'Hash Highway,' a major route for smuggling operations in the region. The Peregrine UAV is a variant of the Schiebel S-100, equipped with advanced UK military technology, customized for the Royal Navy’s requirements. Its features include radar and an infra-red/electro-optical camera, enabling it to operate in both day and night conditions, and in poor visibility. With a maximum speed of 125 mph, the drone provides real-time intelligence by relaying live radar feeds and imagery directly to the ship’s operations room. Lancaster's commanding officer, Sam Stephens, highlighted the significance of the integration of Peregrine into the longest-serving operational Type 23 frigate. He noted that the UAV represents a force-multiplier for the Navy, enhancing its ability to gain a strategic advantage over smugglers and other adversaries. 'This is just the start, as we continue to unlock the game-changing capability with every flight,' said Stephens. In addition to its surveillance capabilities, Peregrine has been instrumental in supporting board and search operations. During its operational debut, the drone assisted Royal Marines aboard HMS Lancaster in locating and boarding suspect dhows, leading to the successful seizure of drugs and contraband. Peregrine's deployment also highlights HMS Lancaster’s role as the first ship in the Indian Ocean to be equipped with a new counter-drone system. This system is especially significant in light of the recent surge in drone attacks by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region over the past 18 months. HMS Lancaster, which embarked on a three-year-long security mission in the Gulf in 2022, has undergone extensive maintenance and upgrades during its deployment. The ship's weapon systems and sensors were enhanced, and one of its diesel generators was replaced, requiring structural modifications to the frigate. This successful deployment of Peregrine marks a significant milestone for the Royal Navy, as it continues to integrate cutting-edge unmanned systems into its maritime operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/british-navy-deploys-new-mini-helicopter-drone-peregrine-for-maritime-security-operations	2025-02-27T00:01:16-08:00

Following this donation, Romania plans to purchase two additional V-BAT systems, comprising eight drones, through a direct government-to-government agreement with the United States for approximately $30 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Romania is set to receive a total of twelve V-BAT drones with the first four donated by the US and eight more to be purchased through a government-to-government deal. (Picture source: US DoD) The MQ-35A V-BAT drones, developed by the American company Shield AI, feature vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, allowing them to launch and land vertically on ship decks without requiring an airfield or airstrip. This design is intended to enhance operational flexibility, particularly for naval operations. The drones are designed primarily for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and can also be equipped with laser-guided munitions. The V-BAT's ducted-fan propulsion system increases thrust and safety by avoiding exposed rotors, allowing for use in confined or dynamic environments, including maritime scenarios. The Romanian Ministry of Defense has identified two primary focus areas for 2025: acquisitions and modernization. Planned acquisitions include the continuation of the minehunter program, with the second Sandown-class ship expected from the UK in May 2025, as well as maritime patrol vessels, intervention ships, maritime tugs, man-portable air-defense systems (MANPAD), the V-BAT unmanned aerial system, radio stations, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) equipment, and multifunctional wheeled vehicle transport platforms. Modernization projects will target maritime dredgers, frigates, missile carriers, maritime support and intervention ships, and corvettes. The V-BAT drones were previously utilized in Ukraine during late 2024 and early 2025, where they were reportedly effective against Russian electronic warfare measures. According to Brandon Tseng, president and co-founder of Shield AI, the drones were launched from approximately 40 kilometers behind the front lines, flew 100 kilometers into Russian-controlled territory, identified SA-11 surface-to-air missile systems, and provided targeting coordinates to a HIMARS airburst system. The operation resulted in the destruction of the missile systems, demonstrating the drones' capacity to gather targeting data and communicate with artillery units under conditions of advanced electronic warfare. The MQ-35A V-BAT drone weighs 57 kg, including a payload capacity of up to 11.3 kg, and offers an air endurance of up to 10 hours. It operates within a radio range of 130 km and can achieve a flight ceiling of 6,100 meters. The drone can carry a variety of payloads, including electro-optical (EO) and mid-wave infrared (MWIR) cameras, automated information systems (AIS), and land/maritime wide-area search (WAS) AI-based technologies. It is powered by a 288cc two-stroke EFI engine and has a maximum airspeed of 157 km/h, with a cruise speed of 98 km/h. The required landing zone is 4 by 4 meters, and it can transition from hover to flight in under 15 seconds. James Lithgow, director of Shield AI, mentioned at the Defense Tech Innovation Forum 2025 that discussions are underway to integrate laser-guided munitions developed in Ukraine with the V-BAT system. While specific Ukrainian partners were not disclosed, this integration would potentially expand the drone’s operational roles to include direct combat support. The V-BAT's modular architecture allows for the integration of a range of sensors and combat payloads, supporting mission-specific adaptability. Shield AI has also stated that the V-BAT was selected over 13 competitors for the US Navy and SOCOM’s MTUAS Increment 2 Program of Record. The drone’s design facilitates take-off and landing on stationary and moving platforms, including in high winds and on crowded ship decks with landing zones as small as 3.6 by 3.6 meters. The aircraft is designed for expeditionary operations, requiring only two personnel for deployment and capable of being transported in the bed of a pickup truck or a UH-60 Blackhawk. It can be prepared for flight in under 20 minutes, making it suitable for dynamic operational environments. The Romanian acquisition of V-BAT drones is part of a wider modernization initiative that also includes new minehunters, maritime patrol vessels, and multifunctional wheeled vehicles, as well as upgrades to frigates, missile carriers, and other naval assets.

Future Hellbound hypersonic drone could strengthen US strike capabilities against China and Russia	On February 12, 2025, the companies Cummings Aerospace and ATRX, both based in Huntsville, Alabama, partnered to develop an unmanned hypersonic drone. The drone will be a new variant of the Hellhound subsonic weapons system, which Cummings Aerospace is currently developing for the US Army. The collaboration focuses on integrating ATRX’s Air Turbo Rocket (ATR) propulsion system into a proven airframe, enhancing the Hellhound's performance to achieve supersonic and hypersonic speeds.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link According to ATRX, the ATR engine provides approximately 40% more thrust than an afterburning turbojet of the same size. It is intended for scenarios requiring short bursts of thrust, such as rapid take-offs, fast climbs, and high acceleration. (Picture source: ATRX) Cummings Aerospace specializes in producing missiles, radars, and command and control systems, and will utilize its Hellhound family of drones for this initiative. The Hellhound series includes multiple specialized variants, notably the Hellhound S3, developed for the US Army’s Loitering Munition program, which has recently completed flight tests. ATRX, a startup in aerospace propulsion technology, brings its ATR propulsion system to the project. The ATR, also known as a Multi-Mode Combined Cycle Propulsion Engine or Overjet, utilizes a rocket-type gas generator to power and overdrive the turbojet, featuring an air-breathing design that has undergone several prototype tests. The companies aim to incorporate the ATR engine into a Hellhound variant specifically designed for high-speed flight. The drone will use a modular 3D-printed design and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware to manage costs and enable quick payload swaps in less than five minutes without tools. According to ATRX, the ATR engine provides approximately 40% more thrust than an afterburning turbojet of the same size. It is intended for scenarios requiring short bursts of thrust, such as rapid take-offs, fast climbs, and high acceleration, with potential uses in space launch systems and missiles. ATRX CEO Felix Bustos III stated that the partnership would streamline ATR engine flight testing, leveraging a custom unmanned aerial system (UAS) based on a flight-proven airframe to support ATRX’s Hummingbird spaceplane development, intended to assist with launching over 50,000 commercial satellites into orbit in the coming years. Cummings Aerospace CEO Sheila Cummings noted that the partnership aims to meet the requirements of modern battlefields, which demand systems capable of greater speed and extended reach into contested airspace. The companies plan to conduct the first vertically launched test of the hypersonic drone within 18 to 24 months. The test will involve a Hellhound UAS that is up to 12 times larger than the loitering munition variant expected to compete in the US Army’s Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance (LASSO) competition later this year. Future development cycles are scheduled every 18-24 months, incorporating increased complexity. The Hellhound drones include multiple specialized variants, notably the Hellhound S3, developed for the US Army’s Loitering Munition program, which has recently completed flight tests. (Picture source: Cummings Aerospace) If the collaboration proceeds as planned, ATRX and Cummings Aerospace could become prominent suppliers of low-cost hypersonic drones to global military markets, as the development of hypersonic drones, including cost-effective models, has the potential to enhance the United States' capabilities against adversaries such as China and Russia. These drones, capable of speeds exceeding Mach 5, a milestone not yet reached by any US military branch, can engage time-sensitive and high-value targets, including mobile missile launchers and advanced air defense systems integral to China's and Russia's anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies. Their high velocity and maneuverability make interception by existing defense systems challenging, thereby increasing the likelihood of mission success. Additionally, deploying these drones from various platforms, such as aircraft, ships, and submarines, provides the U.S. military (and its allies) with flexible options for power projection in contested regions. Integrating low-cost hypersonic drones into the U.S. arsenal ensures that a sufficient quantity of these advanced weapons can be produced and deployed without imposing excessive financial burdens, maintaining a robust deterrent posture. Their rapid response time and extended operational range enhance the U.S. military's ability to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions, providing real-time intelligence and early warning of potential attacks. Therefore, the United States is pursuing hypersonic drone development through multiple projects, including the Hellhound UAS by Cummings Aerospace and ATRX, as well as Hermeus Corporation’s Quarterhorse series. The Hellhound UAS aims to combine ATRX’s Air Turbo Rocket with a modular 3D-printed design to achieve supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Separately, Hermeus Corporation is testing its Quarterhorse Mk 1 prototype, which is projected to reach Mach 4 and lay the groundwork for the Darkhorse drone, potentially matching Lockheed Martin’s SR-72 capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/future-hellbound-hypersonic-drone-could-strengthen-us-strike-capabilities-against-china-and-russia	2025-02-26T06:55:08-08:00

First South Korean Stealth Drone LOWUS Enhances Survivability of KF-21 Fighters	The Agency for Defense Development (ADD) and Korean Air held a rollout ceremony for the prototype of the Low Observable Unmanned Wingman System (LOWUS) at the Korean Air Tech Center in Busan on February 25, 2025. Designed to operate alongside piloted fighter jets in a manned-unmanned teaming system, this stealth drone autonomously carries out reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and strike missions under the supervision of a crewed aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The LOWUS Drone features a trapezoidal fuselage, sharply swept wings, a V-tail, and an overhead air intake, resembling the American XQ-58A Valkyrie drone (Picture source: DAPA) The development of LOWUS is part of a project initiated in 2021 by ADD and Korean Air, with support from the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). Its design prioritizes stealth, minimizing radar detection through the use of radar-absorbing materials and an optimized structure to reduce visibility to radar, acoustic, and optical sensors. A first flight is planned by the end of the year, followed by manned-unmanned teaming tests scheduled to continue until 2027, during which a crewed aircraft will take direct control of the drone in flight. LOWUS was designed from the outset to operate in coordination with crewed fighter jets, particularly the KF-21 Boramae, South Korea’s next-generation combat aircraft currently under development. It features a trapezoidal fuselage, sharply swept wings, a V-tail, and an overhead air intake, resembling the American XQ-58A Valkyrie drone. It also shares some visual similarities with Boeing’s MQ-28 Ghost Bat, developed for the Royal Australian Air Force. However, LOWUS distinguishes itself with an electro-optical sensor mounted under the nose, as well as the planned integration of an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and a domestically developed engine. Manned-unmanned teaming concepts are increasingly being explored by air forces worldwide, and South Korea is working to integrate this capability into its fleet. LOWUS is expected to complement certain limitations of the KF-21, particularly in its initial Block 1 configuration, which is dedicated to air superiority and does not feature an internal weapons bay. The drone could undertake air-to-ground missions, allowing the KF-21 to operate at a safer distance while leveraging its air-to-air missiles and advanced sensors. This operational approach would reduce the electronic signature of the crewed aircraft and enhance its survivability in combat scenarios. While primarily developed for the KF-21, LOWUS could also be integrated with the FA-50, a light combat aircraft produced by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and already exported to several countries. By providing a stealth drone dedicated to supporting piloted aircraft, South Korea could expand the FA-50’s appeal on the international market and strengthen its position in networked aerial warfare. This project aligns with South Korea’s broader strategy to advance its aeronautical defense capabilities. In 2021, a similar initiative led by KAI aimed to integrate drones with the country’s military helicopters, including the Surion and the LAH. In 2023, the South Korean military established a dedicated drone operations command to enhance surveillance, strike, and electronic warfare capabilities in response to asymmetric threats. The development of LOWUS represents a step in the evolution of South Korea’s air combat capabilities. Its integration with the KF-21 could provide a strategic advantage in future conflicts while also serving as an exportable option for countries seeking to modernize their air forces with next-generation manned-unmanned teaming systems. The rapid progress of the project suggests the potential adoption of this technology by other air forces, further establishing South Korea as a key player in the global defense aviation market.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/first-south-korean-stealth-drone-lowus-enhances-survivability-of-kf-21-fighters	2025-02-26T02:46:35-08:00	
Focus: Russia claims that new S-500 air defense system can intercept Western hypersonic missiles	According to Russian military expert Mikhail Khodarenok, the S-500 Prometheus air defense missile system, developed by Almaz-Antey, is capable of intercepting hypersonic missiles, including those developed by Western nations with characteristics comparable to Russia's Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile. The system, also known as the 55R6M Triumfator-M, entered service with the Russian Air Defense Forces in May 2021 and, in early January 2025, Russia announced plans to deploy up to twelve S-500 systems to defend the Crimean Bridge against potential Ukrainian strikes, with production set to increase to meet operational needs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new S-500 Triumfator-M air defense missile system is designed to counter a wide range of aerial threats, including stealth aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic missiles, and even low-orbit satellites. (Picture source: Russian social media) Several Western nations are currently developing hypersonic missile systems with capabilities comparable to Russia's Oreshnik. The United States is advancing multiple projects, including the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), also known as 'Dark Eagle,' a surface-to-surface boost-glide weapon with a range of up to approximately 2,776 km; the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC), an air-launched cruise missile capable of speeds exceeding Mach 5; and the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), designed to reach speeds over Mach 7. France is developing the ASN4G (Air-Sol Nucléaire de 4ème Génération), a nuclear-armed, air-launched hypersonic cruise missile expected to replace the ASMPA missile by 2035. Lockheed Martin is also working on the Mako hypersonic missile, intended for use with modern stealth fighters such as the F-35 and F-22. To counter these emerging hypersonic threats from Western nations, the S-500 system is designed to address a wide range of aerial threats, including stealth aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic missiles, and even low-orbit satellites. It offers a maximum operational range of 600 kilometers and an altitude capability of 200 kilometers, surpassing the capabilities of the S-300 and S-400 systems. The S-500 uses the 77N6-N and 77N6-N1 missiles, which support high-speed kinetic interception, including hypersonic targets. Its capacity to engage low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites could potentially disrupt NATO's surveillance and communication capabilities near Crimea. Russia has proposed joint production of the S-500 with India, but no final decision has been announced by India. Despite the capabilities of the Oreshnik, interception of such a hypersonic missile by the S-500 is considered feasible primarily during its initial flight phase, before reaching hypersonic speeds, according to Khodarenok. The S-500 Prometheus may have this capability, while Western systems, including the American Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), may encounter challenges in intercepting such high-speed targets. The THAAD system has demonstrated capabilities against short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, either inside or just outside the atmosphere, but its effectiveness against hypersonic missiles remains limited. Hypersonic missiles, which travel at speeds exceeding Mach 5 and can maneuver unpredictably, present challenges that THAAD was not originally designed to address. However, contrary to Mikhail Khodarenok's assertions, it seems that the S-500 is not the only air defense system that has either demonstrated or is developing the capability to intercept hypersonic missiles. The U.S. Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) system has reportedly intercepted maneuvering hypersonic missiles, including a Russian Kinzhal during engagements in Ukraine in May 2023. The U.S. Navy's Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, utilizing the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, intercepted an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) target in November 2020, indicating potential applicability against high-speed threats. Israel's Arrow 3 system, operational since 2017, is designed for exo-atmospheric interception of ballistic missiles and has engaged hypersonic targets, including Iran's Kheibar Shekan missiles. Additionally, the U.S. Navy is progressing with plans to integrate PAC-3 MSE interceptors onto its ships to enhance defenses against hypersonic threats. In parallel, the United States, in collaboration with Japan, is developing the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) to engage hypersonic missiles during their glide phase. The GPI is intended for deployment on Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense destroyers and Aegis Ashore systems. The Aegis Sea-Based Terminal (SBT) system offers limited capability against certain hypersonic missile threats, focusing on specific trajectory phases. Germany is developing the IRIS-T SLX, an upgraded IRIS-T surface-to-air missile system with an operational range of 80 km and a ceiling of 30 km, aimed at addressing advanced aerial threats, including hypersonic missiles. Despite advancements in these systems, achieving fully reliable interception of hypersonic threats remains a technological challenge, as no current system has demonstrated complete effectiveness against all hypersonic threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-russia-claims-that-new-s-500-air-defense-system-can-intercept-western-hypersonic-missiles	2025-02-26T02:39:26-08:00

Focus: Russia Set to Ramp Up Missile Production in 2025 with 750 Iskander and 560 Kh-101 Missiles	According to a report shared on February 24, 2025, by defense analyst John Hardie on his X (formerly Twitter) account, Russia is ramping up its missile production in 2025, with plans to produce more than 750 9M723 Iskander ballistic missiles and over 560 Kh-101 cruise missiles. These figures, drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Defence, signal a significant surge in missile production that could have substantial implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and for broader security dynamics in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Transloader (on the left) and 9P78-1 TEL on the right (Transporter Erector Launcher) equipped with 9M723K5 missiles, part of the 9K720 Iskander-M SRBM system, designed for rapid deployment and precision strikes. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The 9M723 Iskander, part of the Iskander tactical missile system, is a short-range ballistic missile designed to provide high accuracy and fast deployment. It can strike targets at ranges up to 500 kilometers, with various warhead options, including conventional and nuclear payloads. The Iskander system is known for its maneuverability during flight, which makes it more difficult for enemy air defenses to intercept. Its mobile launch platforms allow for rapid repositioning, enhancing its survivability in a contested battlefield environment. With 750 of these missiles planned for production in 2025, Russia aims to bolster its ability to conduct precise, high-impact strikes against key military and infrastructure targets. The Kh-101 is a long-range air-launched cruise missile that Russia primarily uses to target high-value strategic assets. With a range of up to 4,500 kilometers, the Kh-101 is a crucial weapon for Russia's long-range strike capabilities. The missile is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads, allowing for strategic flexibility. It is known for its stealth characteristics, designed to reduce its radar cross-section and increase its chances of penetrating advanced air defense systems. The missile’s ability to travel at subsonic speeds and fly at low altitudes enables it to avoid detection by radar, making it a formidable weapon for deep strikes against enemy territory. The production of 560 Kh-101 missiles in 2025 reflects Russia's effort to maintain a significant deterrence capability, particularly as the conflict in Ukraine continues to evolve. While Russia has set ambitious targets for missile production, Ukrainian defense officials remain cautious and vigilant. A Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) representative emphasized that Russia's missile production is still critically dependent on foreign components. Despite efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing capabilities, Moscow remains reliant on foreign suppliers for key parts, complicating efforts to maintain consistent production levels. This dependence on external sources underscores the importance of the international sanctions regime, which has limited Russia’s access to advanced components for missile and weapon systems. The GUR representative urged international bodies to tighten sanctions enforcement and strengthen monitoring to hamper further Russia’s ability to replenish its missile stockpiles. Russia has achieved relatively high monthly monthly production rates as part of its strategy to maintain a robust missile arsenal. According to Ukrainian intelligence estimates, Russia is capable of producing approximately 40 to 50 Iskander missiles per month. The Kalibr missiles, a family of cruise missiles launched from both ships and submarines, are being produced at a rate of 30 to 50 units per month. Additionally, about 50 Kh-101 missiles are being manufactured monthly, further contributing to Russia's missile capabilities. These production rates are significant, given the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. The ability to produce such quantities of missiles on a monthly basis could allow Russia to continue conducting large-scale missile strikes, potentially targeting critical infrastructure, military installations, and other key sites in Ukraine. The increase in Russia’s missile production, coupled with ongoing missile strikes in Ukraine, continues to create a persistent and escalating threat to Ukrainian civilians and military personnel. Ukrainian intelligence officials, particularly through the voice of representative Andriy Yusov, have urged citizens to take air raid warnings seriously, as large-scale Russian missile strikes remain a constant danger. The increasing frequency of missile attacks, combined with the growing stockpiles of Russia’s missile arsenal, makes it clear that air defense systems, early warning mechanisms, and civil protection measures will remain critical for Ukraine's defense in the coming months. Ukrainian authorities continue to emphasize the need for vigilance, as the risk of missile strikes is not expected to diminish anytime soon. The escalation of Russia's missile production in 2025 also has broader international implications. The increased missile stockpiles, along with Russia’s ongoing reliance on foreign components, highlight the critical role of sanctions in shaping the conflict. Western nations and allies of Ukraine will likely focus on strengthening the enforcement of sanctions to disrupt Russia’s missile production capacity. The situation presents a key challenge for both Russia and the international community, as the impact of sanctions will play a pivotal role in either constraining or enabling Russia's military actions in the near future. Russia's missile production plans for 2025 demonstrate its commitment to enhancing its missile stockpiles, particularly in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine. While the production of the Iskander and Kh-101 missiles is set to increase significantly, the ongoing reliance on foreign components remains a critical vulnerability. Ukrainian intelligence officials continue to monitor Russia’s production capabilities closely, while urging both international bodies and citizens to remain vigilant as the risk of large-scale missile strikes persists. The continued enforcement of sanctions and the monitoring of Russia's ability to acquire foreign components will play a crucial role in limiting the scope of Russia's missile production and its capacity for prolonged strikes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/focus-russia-set-to-ramp-up-missile-production-in-2025-with-750-iskander-and-560-kh-101-missiles	2025-02-25T03:22:36-08:00	
China Constructs Hypersonic Missile Submarine in Response to US Typhon Deployment in Philippines	The construction of a new Chinese nuclear-powered attack submarine, equipped with hypersonic missiles, could present a strategic challenge to the deployment of the United States' Typhon missile system in the Philippines. According to a report by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), citing a semi-official Chinese military publication, this submarine, currently under development at a shipyard in Wuhan, is part of Beijing’s broader strategy to counter the expansion of U.S. military influence in the region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A satellite image from Maxar captured on March 10, 2024, shows the Zhou-class submarine docked at the pier. (Picture source: Maxar) Although the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has not officially confirmed the existence of this submarine, the magazine Naval &amp; Merchant Ships, affiliated with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), has provided several details about its design and potential role. The publication suggests that the project aims to strengthen China’s deterrence capabilities within the 'first island chain,' a strategic zone stretching from Japan to the Philippines. This development follows the deployment of U.S. Typhon missile launchers on Luzon Island in the Philippines during a joint military exercise in April 2024. These launchers are capable of firing long-range missiles capable of reaching targets in China, Russia, and North Korea, altering the regional military balance. China has strongly opposed their presence, describing them as offensive and strategic weapons that pose a security threat. The United States, however, maintains that these systems are intended to deter potential threats and safeguard its allies. The Chinese submarine under construction is designed to be equipped with advanced hypersonic missiles, enabling it to carry out precision strikes over long distances and penetrate enemy defenses. According to the publication, it may also have the capability to deploy nuclear warheads, enhancing China’s ability to counter U.S. military assets in the western Pacific. If operationalized, this vessel could play a key role in China’s evolving naval doctrine, which emphasizes stealth, deterrence, and asymmetric warfare. The submarine was first identified in mid-2024 through satellite imagery captured at a shipyard in Wuhan, Hubei province. Analysts suggest it could belong to the Zhou-class (Type 041), which gained attention following an incident in May or June 2024 when the first unit allegedly sank during its fitting-out phase at Wuchang Shipbuilding along the Yangtze River. According to U.S. military assessments, the Type 041 is equipped with a hybrid propulsion system that combines conventional diesel-electric power with a small nuclear reactor. This configuration could provide increased operational endurance and greater strategic flexibility. One of the submarine’s notable technological features is its vertical launch system (VLS), allowing it to fire both cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles. Unlike traditional submarines that rely on torpedo tubes for missile launches, this capability enhances firepower, enables faster missile deployment, and provides greater tactical versatility. The vessel also incorporates an X-shaped tail fin, a design aimed at improving maneuverability and operational safety, particularly in deep-water environments. Another critical feature of this submarine is its air-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which reduces the need for surfacing to access oxygen. This technology would allow the vessel to remain submerged for extended periods, making it more difficult to detect and track. In the South China Sea, where China has been expanding its military presence, this capability could provide a significant strategic advantage. The region’s underwater geography, which includes reefs, sandbanks, deep trenches, and islands, presents both opportunities and challenges for stealth operations. Experts suggest that this submarine, capable of operating independently or in small formations, could complicate adversaries' operations by forcing them to disperse in response to an unpredictable undersea threat. This aligns with China’s asymmetric deterrence strategy, which seeks to counter technologically superior opponents through innovative means rather than direct confrontation. The vessel is reportedly armed with the YJ-21 hypersonic missile, already deployed on China’s Type 093 nuclear attack submarines and Type 055 cruisers. With an estimated range of 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers and a speed of up to Mach 10, this missile would significantly enhance the Chinese Navy’s strike capabilities against naval and land-based targets. This suggests that China is actively working on integrating hypersonic technology into its undersea forces, which could reshape the balance of power in the Western Pacific. The development of this submarine coincides with Beijing’s increasing opposition to U.S. military deployments in the region. China has strongly criticized the placement of Typhon missile systems in the Philippines, calling for their removal and arguing that they destabilize regional security. Meanwhile, the United States continues to expand its global missile defense network, considering additional Typhon deployments in Japan, Germany, and Denmark as part of a broader strategy aimed at limiting Chinese naval movements. Amid increasing militarization, the South China Sea could become a crucial testing ground for this submarine. With an average depth exceeding 1,200 meters and a complex underwater landscape, this area presents a strategic environment where stealth operations could play a decisive role. The submarine’s ability to navigate these waters undetected could be a key factor in China’s ability to project power and deter foreign military activities near its maritime borders. Although the PLA has not yet officially acknowledged the existence of this submarine, the detailed descriptions provided by a semi-official Chinese military publication indicate that it is in the development phase. If operationalized, it could mark a transformation in China’s naval capabilities, particularly in countering U.S. and allied military forces in the Indo-Pacific. The emergence of this submarine reflects the intensifying strategic competition between Beijing and Washington, as both powers continue to strengthen their military presence in contested waters of the Pacific.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/china-constructs-hypersonic-missile-submarine-in-response-to-us-typhon-deployment-in-philippines	2025-02-25T02:28:22-08:00

In addition to providing surveillance, Canadian naval forces contribute to the broader international mission of preventing North Korea from acquiring materials and financial resources that support its weapons programs. This latest operation reaffirms Canada's position as a strong partner in the global effort to curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. The HMCS OTTAWA is a Halifax-class frigate of the Royal Canadian Navy, designed for a wide range of missions, including surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, and surface combat operations. Equipped with advanced radar systems, communication technologies, and weapons platforms, the OTTAWA is capable of conducting complex operations in challenging environments. The frigate’s participation in monitoring illicit maritime activities showcases its versatility and the Royal Canadian Navy’s commitment to international peacekeeping and enforcement of global sanctions. Since North Korea's persistent attempts to circumvent UNSCR sanctions through ship-to-ship transfers, international maritime surveillance operations have become increasingly crucial. These transfers, often conducted by North Korean vessels, are typically used to move prohibited goods, such as petroleum, coal, and other materials that could contribute to the regime’s weapons development. In response to this growing concern, nations like Canada and Japan have escalated their efforts to monitor and interdict such activities, reinforcing the importance of international solidarity in the face of North Korea’s continued evasion of sanctions. Canada’s partnership with Japan in these operations underscores the strong ties between the two nations, particularly in ensuring the security and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. As tensions persist on the Korean Peninsula, these joint efforts are a critical part of the ongoing global strategy to achieve North Korea’s denuclearization. The cooperation between the Royal Canadian Navy, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and other international partners demonstrates a unified stance against North Korea’s illicit activities and a commitment to enforcing international law. In conclusion, the operation conducted by HMCS OTTAWA in February 2025 is a clear demonstration of Canada’s commitment to global security and the enforcement of UNSCRs. With continued collaboration between Canada, Japan, and other international partners, efforts to curb North Korea’s weapons programs and ensure the full implementation of international sanctions remain a top priority. The Royal Canadian Navy’s consistent involvement in such operations reaffirms the importance of multinational cooperation in addressing one of the most pressing security challenges in the Asia-Pacific region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/canadian-navy-frigate-hmcs-ottawa-confronts-north-koreas-illicit-maritime-activities-in-japanese-waters	2025-02-25T00:49:01-08:00	
Taiwan Arms F-CK-1 Fighters with Supersonic HF-3 Missile to Counter Growing Chinese Naval Threat	On February 21, 2025, the Taiwanese newspaper United Daily News (UDN) published what appears to be the first clear image of an air-launched HF-3 missile mounted on a Taiwan Air Force (ROCAF) F-CK-1 fighter. A few days later, the Liberty Times also released another image of the missile under the aircraft's wing, confirming progress in the program. These publications, widely shared on social media, indicate a new step in integrating the supersonic missile onto a combat aircraft, potentially altering Taiwan’s maritime strike capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An air-launched HF-3 missile mounted on a Taiwan Air Force (ROCAF) F-CK-1 fighter (Picture source: UND) The images show a single HF-3 missile mounted under one wing of the aircraft, with inscriptions and positioning markings suggesting its use in testing and evaluations. Observers noted the presence of a rotating sleeve at the missile’s end, which may assist in stabilization after release. Additional photos depict an F-CK-1 undergoing ground tests with two HF-3 missiles, an external fuel tank, and two Sky Sword air-to-air missiles for self-defense, indicating a possible future operational configuration. Although the project to equip F-CK-1 fighters with the HF-3 was first proposed in 2017, it faced multiple challenges, mainly due to the original missile’s size and weight, which measured 6.1 meters in length, 46 centimeters in diameter, and weighed approximately 1,500 kg. Adapting it for an aerial platform required significant reductions in both weight and dimensions, a task undertaken by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) in 2022. NCSIST engineers gradually scaled down the HF-3, resulting in a modified version measuring 5.5 meters in length, 36 centimeters in diameter, and weighing under 900 kg. One key modification was the removal of the solid-fuel boosters, previously used for launches from land and naval platforms, which reduced the missile’s weight by around 200 kg. The program experienced delays but resumed in September 2024 with renewed testing over maritime and flight environments. According to recent reports, operational tests are expected to begin in 2025, including separation tests and potentially a first live-fire test from an F-CK-1. The HF-3 sometimes referred to as a 'carrier killer,' is powered by a liquid-fuel ramjet engine, enabling it to reach speeds of Mach 3.5 with a range of up to 400 km. Compared to the AGM-84 Harpoon currently used by Taiwan’s air force, the HF-3 offers extended range and higher speed, making it more difficult to intercept. Its guidance system combines inertial navigation with active radar homing for terminal targeting. The missile's warhead, weighing 225 kg in land- and sea-based versions, is designed to maximize damage by directing the explosion toward a ship’s hull. Developed by NCSIST since the 1990s, the HF-3 was first tested in 1997 and integrated into Taiwan’s navy in 2007 aboard Kang Ding- and Cheng Kung-class frigates. It is also deployed on Tuo Chiang-class corvettes alongside other missile systems. Adapting it for aerial deployment represents a significant shift, allowing for a more mobile and unpredictable strike capability. By integrating the HF-3 into its F-CK-1 fighters, Taiwan expands its options for anti-ship operations and enhances its deterrence capabilities against the Chinese navy. Some analysts have suggested that if successful, this development could also extend the operational life of the F-CK-1 or even lead to the design of a new indigenous combat aircraft. As tensions in the Taiwan Strait continue to escalate, deploying an air-launched supersonic missile such as the HF-3 could become a key element in Taiwan’s defense strategy. If the program proceeds as planned, the ROCAF will soon have an additional capability to challenge China’s naval presence and complicate any potential blockade or invasion scenario.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/taiwan-arms-f-ck-1-fighters-with-supersonic-hf-3-missile-to-counter-growing-chinese-naval-threat	2025-02-25T00:31:37-08:00

First AI/ML-Powered Radar Warning Receiver for Fourth-Generation Aircraft	A new milestone has been reached in the field of electronic warfare with the first flight test of a Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) aboard a fourth-generation aircraft. This innovation promises to improve threat detection and enhance crew protection significantly. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-16D Fighting Falcon pilot assigned to the 40th Flight Test Squadron flies over the Florida Gulf. (Picture source: RTX) The Cognitive Algorithm Deployment System (CADS) is at the heart of this breakthrough. This solution combines high-performance graphics processors with a software stack designed for artificial intelligence. As a result, AI/ML models can now run directly on the RWR sensor, without relying on heavy, remote computing systems. In practice, the system can detect, classify, and prioritize threats in near real-time. Thanks to local processing on the sensor itself, latency is kept to a minimum. Pilots and operators thus gain a decisive advantage in quickly choosing the best tactical response to an increasingly sophisticated array of threats. Initial tests were conducted aboard an experimental aircraft, followed by a trial on an F-16 at the Air National Guard test range near Tucson, Arizona. During these demonstration flights, the AI-enhanced RWR proved its ability to respond to complex signals, typical of current and future threat environments. Several AI/ML research institutes and teams, including the Georgia Tech Research Institute and Vadum, Inc., collaborated on the integration of various cognitive algorithms. This 'containerized' approach makes it easy to load and run machine learning techniques, making system updates and upgrades faster and more cost-effective. Building on these results, the development team anticipates large-scale deployment of this technology as early as the beginning of 2025. The aim is to make existing fourth-generation fleets more resilient against emerging threats while paving the way for simpler integration on other airborne platforms. This new AI-boosted RWR illustrates the trend of moving computing power directly into the field rather than centralizing it in distant data centers. In an operational environment where rapid analysis and reaction are critical, this approach offers several key advantages. On the one hand, it provides near-instant reactivity in detecting and identifying threats, which significantly reduces the risk of critical errors. On the other hand, it enables greater interoperability: AI/ML solutions can be easily updated or replaced without major hardware modifications. The introduction of this next-generation RWR, which incorporates cognitive algorithms, marks another step toward more autonomous and efficient electronic warfare capabilities. In potential conflict zones where enemy jamming and detection systems are becoming more advanced, having technology that can learn and adapt during missions could offer a decisive tactical edge. Recent test campaigns on widely used aircraft like the F-16 demonstrate the maturity of the solution. In the future, this technology could be extended to other combat aircraft, whether they are fourth-, fifth-, or even sixth-generation. With this intelligent RWR, air forces will have a groundbreaking protective tool capable of instantly distinguishing harmless signals from genuine threats. This asset aligns with a broader effort to automate and optimize decision-making processes on the battlefield while reducing the cognitive load on the crew.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/first-ai-ml-powered-radar-warning-receiver-for-fourth-generation-aircraft	2025-02-25T00:09:02-08:00

French Navy Aims for Eighteen More Frigates to Address New Maritime Challenges from Mediterranean to Pacific	French Minister of the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, recently confirmed the objective of strengthening the French Navy by increasing its fleet to eighteen first-rank frigates. This announcement was made in Le Parisien on February 22, 2025, in response to an increasingly tense international context and an operational workload that far exceeds the strategic guidelines previously established. Currently, the French fleet consists of fifteen frigates, including five La Fayette-class ships, which until recently were not classified as first-rank vessels. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The primary objective of increasing the number of frigates is to meet France's evolving strategic needs, particularly amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Mediterranean, and the North Atlantic. (Picture source: French MoD) For several years, the French Navy has been advocating for an expansion of its fleet to meet the growing intensity of its missions. In 2017, Admiral Christophe Prazuck, then Chief of Staff of the Navy, had already pointed out the outdated nature of the operational contracts defined by the 2013 White Paper on Defense and National Security. That document outlined that the Navy was to conduct two permanent missions—deterrence and protection—while maintaining deployment capabilities in two operational theaters. However, in practice, it currently operates in five, significantly straining both personnel and equipment. Admiral Prazuck also highlighted that the White Paper's trajectory would reduce the number of frigates to fifteen by 2030, despite the increasing maritime threat, driven by renewed geopolitical rivalries and France's expanding military commitments. He cited the Falklands War as an example, where fourteen British vessels were damaged, underscoring the necessity of a more robust fleet adapted to contemporary strategic demands. This request has now been acknowledged and appears to align with a broader trend of reinforcing defense efforts. Sébastien Lecornu explicitly stated that maintaining a sufficient naval presence across multiple maritime zones required more than the current fleet of fifteen frigates, justifying the goal of expanding to eighteen. This objective is part of a broader effort to enhance France's military capabilities, including the acquisition of twenty to thirty additional Rafale fighter jets for the Air and Space Force and accelerated investments in drones and electronic warfare for the Army. However, achieving this expansion faces financial and industrial constraints. During discussions on the 2024-2030 Military Programming Law, Lecornu had advocated for a budget of €422 billion, but interministerial negotiations reduced it to €413 billion. This financial framework raises concerns regarding the timeline and feasibility of acquiring new frigates. According to current plans, the fifth and final Defense and Intervention Frigate (FDI) will not be delivered until 2032, which calls into question how quickly the target fleet size can be reached. The new frigates would likely follow the existing models. The most probable option is to reinforce the fleet with additional FDI frigates from Naval Group. Another possibility is to modernize FREMM-class frigates to enhance their air defense and electronic warfare capabilities. Currently, the French fleet comprises fifteen first-rank frigates: eight FREMM, two Horizon-class air defense frigates, and five La Fayette-class ships, which have been recently reclassified. The Navy also operates an aircraft carrier, several nuclear attack submarines, and amphibious assault ships, forming a well-balanced naval force but one that remains under significant operational pressure. The primary objective of increasing the number of frigates is to meet France's evolving strategic needs, particularly amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, the Mediterranean, and the North Atlantic. A larger fleet would allow continuous presence across multiple maritime theaters, enhancing deterrence and safeguarding national interests. However, several challenges remain, notably budgetary and industrial constraints. Expanding ship production within a short timeframe poses difficulties, as does the need for trained personnel and adequate maintenance infrastructure. Ultimately, the formal recognition of the need for eighteen first-rank frigates marks a shift in France's naval defense strategy. It reflects an awareness of the strategic challenges facing the Navy and the necessity of adapting its capabilities to evolving geopolitical conditions. However, achieving this goal will depend on financial and industrial capacities as well as the political commitment to sustaining this effort over time.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/french-navy-aims-for-eighteen-more-frigates-to-address-new-maritime-challenges-from-mediterranean-to-pacific	2025-02-24T00:16:41-08:00

Flash News: Iran’s Navy Enhances Underwater Warfare Capabilities with New Torpedo Launch from Fateh Submarine	According to information published on February 22, 2025, by the Iranian Mehr News Agency, during the operational phase of the army's joint Zolfaqar 1403 exercise, the Valfajr war torpedoes were successfully launched from the Fateh submarine. This launch, which also saw the deployment of the torpedo from multiple submarines including the Tariq and Ghadir-class vessels, highlights the operational readiness and increasing sophistication of Iran’s submarine force. The success of this exercise underscores Iran's commitment to modernizing and expanding its naval deterrence assets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During a recent exercise in the Sea of Oman, the Fateh-class submarine, a key asset in Iran's naval fleet, showcases its advanced stealth and firepower capabilities. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Valfajr torpedo represents a major leap forward in Iran’s torpedo development. Unlike traditional torpedoes, which use compressed air as a propellant, the Valfajr torpedo uses compressed pure oxygen as its fuel. This innovative design allows the torpedo to achieve higher performance and extended ranges, making it a critical component of Iran’s naval arsenal. The oxygen-powered design makes the weapon more efficient, ensuring effective operation in both shallow coastal waters and the deeper expanses of the Sea of Oman. The successful launch from various submarines demonstrates that Iran's submarine fleet is not only growing in numbers but also in technological sophistication, with advanced weaponry to match. The Fateh-class submarine, a diesel-electric coastal vessel, is central to Iran’s ongoing modernization of its submarine fleet. Commissioned in 2019, the Fateh-class marks a significant milestone in the IRIN’s (Iranian Navy) efforts to bolster its undersea warfare capabilities. With an estimated displacement of 600 tons and a length of 48 meters, the Fateh-class is designed for coastal defense and has demonstrated impressive operational features. It is capable of reaching submerged speeds of up to 23 knots and is equipped with six torpedo tubes, which can launch torpedoes as well as anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs). This versatility allows the Fateh-class to perform a variety of roles, from attacking surface targets to conducting strategic deterrence operations. Iran has announced plans to further enhance the Fateh-class submarines, most notably by integrating an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. The addition of AIP technology is expected to significantly extend the underwater endurance of these vessels, allowing them to operate more effectively in deeper waters and for longer durations without the need to surface. This upgrade would make the Fateh-class an even more formidable asset in Iran’s naval arsenal, enhancing both its stealth and operational reach. The IRIN currently operates a fleet of 19-27 submarines, including a variety of classes that contribute to Iran’s evolving maritime strategy. Among the most significant of these are the Kilo-class (Tareq-class in Iranian service), the Fateh-class, and the Ghadir-class mini-submarines. The Kilo-class (Tareq-class in Iranian service) submarines were imported from Russia in the 1990s and are the backbone of Iran’s submarine fleet. With a displacement of around 3,000 tons and six torpedo tubes, the Kilo-class submarines are capable of launching torpedoes, mines, and ASCMs. These submarines, however, are limited by their need for relatively deep waters and the challenges posed by the unique salinity and currents in the Persian Gulf, restricting their operational effectiveness in some areas. The Ghadir-class mini-submarines represent an important part of Iran’s expanding submarine capabilities. With a reported fleet size of 15-23 vessels, the Ghadir-class submarines are small, coastal diesel-electric boats, ideal for operations in shallow waters. These submarines are equipped with two 533mm torpedo tubes and have the ability to launch torpedoes or anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs). The Ghadir-class provides Iran with a more flexible option for operations close to shore, where larger submarines like the Kilo-class would be less effective. Notably, these mini-submarines are built indigenously, showcasing Iran's growing domestic submarine production capabilities. Iran also operates the Nahang-class mini-submarine, which is reportedly used for transporting special operations forces. Although this vessel lacks torpedo tubes, it may carry mines or torpedoes externally, giving it a niche role in Iran’s maritime operations. The Nahang-class, like the Ghadir-class, is designed for coastal and shallow water operations, contributing to the flexibility of Iran’s submarine fleet. While Iran has no nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) or ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), its focus on mini-submarines like the Ghadir-class and advancements in torpedo technology such as the Valfajr make it a formidable regional power in maritime security. These vessels, along with retrofitting efforts for older submarines and the development of new submersible technologies, ensure that Iran maintains an effective and adaptive naval force. Iran is also experimenting with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and swimmer delivery vehicles (SDVs) for special operations. These technologies, although still in their early stages, may further enhance Iran’s ability to conduct covert operations, reconnaissance, and asymmetric warfare in coastal waters and beyond. In particular, SDVs like the Sabehat-15, which has been tested by both the IRIN and the IRGCN, can be used for reconnaissance or to deploy mines, enhancing Iran's ability to conduct irregular warfare. The modernization of Iran’s submarine fleet is further exemplified by the Fateh-class's planned integration of an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system. This technology, which would allow the vessels to operate underwater for extended periods without the need to surface for air, would greatly enhance the operational endurance of these submarines. The upgrade to AIP is expected to give the Fateh-class submarines significantly improved performance, making them more capable of conducting extended missions in deeper waters like the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Iran’s expanding submarine fleet is not merely about enhancing military capabilities; it also plays a strategic role in Iran’s national security and its broader defense strategy. Submarines, especially in a region as geopolitically sensitive as the Persian Gulf, serve as a powerful deterrent against foreign naval presence and can influence global shipping routes, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz. By controlling access to this vital chokepoint, Iran can exert significant influence over the flow of global energy markets, especially oil and gas, which are crucial to the economies of many nations. The IRIN’s operations extend beyond the Persian Gulf, with Iranian submarines also deployed in the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and the Indian Ocean. The ability to operate in such diverse and challenging environments adds a layer of flexibility to Iran’s naval power projection. The combination of conventional submarine designs and cutting-edge technologies such as the Valfajr torpedo, AIP systems, and mini-submarines further bolsters Iran’s regional influence. The successful launch of the Valfajr torpedo from the Fateh-class submarine is not just a demonstration of Iran’s increasing technological sophistication but also a statement of its strategic intent. As Iran continues to modernize and expand its submarine fleet, integrating new technologies and refining its undersea warfare capabilities, the country’s naval forces are poised to remain a potent force in the region. Iran’s growing submarine capabilities, underscored by innovations such as the Valfajr torpedo and the anticipated AIP upgrade for the Fateh-class, are key components of its broader strategy to assert control over vital maritime regions and ensure national security in an increasingly volatile geopolitical environment.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-irans-navy-enhances-underwater-warfare-capabilities-with-new-torpedo-launch-from-fateh-submarine	2025-02-23T02:50:26-08:00

The upper section houses the electric propulsion system, designed to provide efficient and silent operation. The middle section contains the core electronics, power supply, and a fiber optic spool, which enables an alternative control link independent of radio signals. The lower section carries the warhead and targeting sensors, with an optimized arrangement to ensure a high probability of hit and target discrimination. Designed in two versions, the Libelle can be employed in a man-portable configuration or integrated into vehicles for enhanced operational flexibility. The portable variant, weighing less than 13 kg, can be easily transported in a backpack and deployed within minutes. Its operation is based on artificial intelligence-driven image recognition, allowing it to detect, classify, and track targets with minimal operator input. This level of autonomy is particularly useful in high-stress combat environments, where reaction time is critical. The munition is intended primarily for anti-tank engagements, utilizing an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead derived from the SMArt 155 sensor-fuzed projectile. Unlike traditional anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), which require line-of-sight engagements, the Libelle can loiter over the battlefield, identify armored targets, and strike from above, where vehicles have the least armor protection. One of the key advantages of the Libelle is its flexible control system. Operators can control the munition via a radio link or a fiber optic cable extending several kilometers. The fiber optic connection provides a significant tactical advantage, particularly in contested environments where electronic warfare systems are deployed to jam or disrupt communications. By eliminating electromagnetic emissions, the Libelle remains undetectable to enemy signal intelligence and direction-finding systems, increasing survivability and effectiveness in electronic warfare-heavy scenarios. The control interface is designed for ease of use, operating through a dedicated application compatible with standard military devices, eliminating the need for specialized ground control stations. Operationally, the Libelle is suited for a range of missions, including high-risk reconnaissance, urban combat, and anti-armor engagements. Its ability to loiter over a designated area and autonomously identify high-value targets enhances battlefield situational awareness while minimizing the risk to personnel. The munition’s small size and reduced acoustic signature make it difficult to detect and engage with traditional counter-drone measures, providing a stealth advantage in contested zones. Additionally, its reusability feature—uncommon among loitering munitions—adds to its cost-effectiveness and logistical sustainability. Diehl Defence plans to introduce the Libelle to the market in the near future, targeting military forces that require a flexible, precise, and survivable loitering munition for modern combat operations. With the increasing proliferation of drone warfare and loitering munitions in conflicts worldwide, the demand for such systems continues to rise. The Libelle represents an evolution in loitering munition technology, bridging the gap between traditional strike drones and guided missile systems. Its potential to complement existing anti-armor capabilities, particularly in environments where conventional ATGMs face limitations, could make it a valuable asset for armed forces integrating advanced loitering munition systems into their operational doctrines.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/diehl-defence-relies-on-libelle-loitering-munition-to-enhance-anti-tank-capabilities	2025-02-20T04:52:44-08:00

General Atomics Pursues Major MQ-9B SeaGuardian Drone Sale to Saudi Arabia	During the IDEX defense exhibition in Abu Dhabi, General Atomics announced ongoing discussions with Saudi Arabia regarding the potential sale of a number of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. While negotiations remain in the early stages, the company has emphasized Saudi Arabia’s strong interest in these remotely piloted aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link (Picture source: ) According to Dave Alexander, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, the Kingdom has substantial requirements for the MQ-9B, and if finalized, the deal could create thousands of jobs in the United States. However, specific details, including the number of drones and the overall scope of the agreement, have not been disclosed. The proposal reportedly includes a large fleet and involves local industrial participation in Saudi Arabia, though the exact nature of this involvement remains unspecified. Saudi Arabia has historically sourced drones from non-Western suppliers, primarily China and Turkey. In 2014, the Kingdom acquired CH-4 drones from China, followed by additional orders for Wing Loong II systems. More recently, in 2023, Saudi Arabia signed a defense agreement with Turkish manufacturer Baykar for Akinci combat drones, a deal described by Baykar’s CEO, Haluk Bayraktar, as the largest defense contract between the two nations. The interest in diversifying drone suppliers reflects broader concerns in the Gulf region regarding delays and restrictions imposed by U.S. export controls on military equipment. In 2021, Qatar faced prolonged delays in its request to purchase MQ-9B drones, with no clear explanations from Washington, leading to frustration among Qatari officials. Such challenges have prompted several regional states to explore alternative suppliers to meet their defense needs. Alexander expressed confidence that U.S. export policy could shift under a potential new Trump administration, facilitating defense agreements with Gulf allies and reducing conditions that have previously complicated procurement processes. He also expects the stalled sale of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones to the United Arab Emirates to be reconsidered under Trump. That deal, initially approved by the U.S. in 2020, was later suspended due to concerns over the UAE’s use of Chinese technology. General Atomics has clarified that its offer to Saudi Arabia is separate from any potential fighter jet deals with Lockheed Martin. The company aims to expand its presence in the Gulf region in 2025, considering it a pivotal year for finalizing ongoing negotiations. U.S.-Saudi relations have fluctuated in recent years, particularly during the Biden administration, which raised concerns over human rights issues in the Kingdom. In contrast, Trump has previously maintained closer ties with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a factor that could influence future defense agreements. If completed, the MQ-9B deal would mark a strategic shift in Saudi Arabia’s drone procurement approach while strengthening General Atomics’ position in a competitive regional market.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/general-atomics-pursues-major-mq-9b-seaguardian-drone-sale-to-saudi-arabia	2025-02-20T01:30:33-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) Vandenberg Space Force Base, located in Santa Barbara County, California, has played a pivotal role in the United States' intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and nuclear programs since its establishment in 1941 as Camp Cooke. Originally a training ground for infantry and armored divisions during World War II, the base transitioned into a crucial missile test and launch facility in the 1950s. With its ideal coastal location, allowing westward missile launches over the Pacific Ocean, Vandenberg became the primary site for testing and launching ICBMs, including the PGM-17 Thor, SM-65 Atlas, HGM-25A Titan I, LGM-25C Titan II, and LGM-30 Minuteman missiles Officials describe the Minuteman III as a critical element of the U.S. nuclear triad, contributing to national defense strategy. Acting Secretary of the Air Force Gary Ashworth stated that the test reflects the operational readiness of U.S. nuclear forces, while AFGSC Commander Gen. Thomas Bussiere noted the missile’s reliability. Col. Dustin Harmon, 377th TEG commander, emphasized the importance of data collection for maintaining Minuteman III and planning for the Sentinel ICBM. Over 300 similar tests have been conducted as part of the established program to assess system performance, collect data, and analyze missile system competencies. These routine tests support the evaluation of the Minuteman III as a consistent deterrent in the context of 21st-century threats, as the Minuteman III is currently the only land-based ICBM in the U.S. arsenal, representing the land leg of the nuclear triad alongside the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile and strategic bombers. The ICBM community, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and U.S. Strategic Command, uses data from test launches for ongoing force development evaluation. The LGM-30 Minuteman series has been a cornerstone of U.S. strategic defense since its introduction in 1962. The Minuteman III, which entered service in 1970, introduced multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to the U.S. ICBM arsenal. Initially, the missile could carry up to three W62 Mk-12 warheads, each with a yield of 170 kilotons of TNT, but now operates with a single W78 (335 kT) or W87 (300 kT) warhead due to arms reduction agreements. The Minuteman III is a solid-fuel, three-stage ICBM with a mass of 36,030 kg and a length of 18.3 m. It features a maximum operational range of 14,000 km and a flight ceiling of 1,120 km. The missile can achieve speeds up to Mach 23 (28,200 km/h) during its terminal phase. The missile's gimballed inertial navigation system (NS-50) provides a targeting accuracy of approximately 200 meters. Modernization plans involve transitioning from the Minuteman III to the LGM-35A Sentinel, with initial capability expected by 2029 and full capability by the mid-2030s. The replacement process includes retiring legacy equipment such as the Transporter Erector (TE) systems, transitioning to modern systems designed to improve operational readiness and reduce maintenance requirements. The 91st Missile Wing was the last unit using the old TE systems as part of the modernization strategy. The Air Force aims to maintain the Minuteman III as a viable deterrent until the Sentinel system achieves full operational capability in the mid-2030s. Initially, the Minuteman III could carry up to three W62 Mk-12 warheads, each with a yield of 170 kilotons of TNT, but now operates with a single W78 (335 kT) or W87 (300 kT) warhead due to arms reduction agreements.

France Issues a Tender for Acquisition of 24 New Maritime Surveillance Coastal Patrol Boats	The French Directorate General of Armament (DGA) has launched a tender for the acquisition of 24 new Maritime Surveillance Coastal Patrol Boats (VCSM), aimed at replacing its current fleet, which is primarily used by the Maritime Gendarmerie for missions related to the State’s action at sea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Currently, the Maritime Gendarmerie operates twenty-four Élorn-type coastal patrol boats. (Picture source: French MoD) Currently, the Maritime Gendarmerie operates twenty-four Élorn-type coastal patrol boats, designed by Raidco Marine and built by Chantiers Navals Bordelais (CNB) in the early 2000s. However, after Cyclone Chido hit Mayotte in December, two of these boats, the Verdon (P602) and the Odet (P611), are now out of service. The Élorn boats are 19 meters long and displace 41 tons when fully loaded. They are equipped with a 7.62mm machine gun, a water cannon, and a Furuno radar. Operated by a crew of eight gendarmes, these boats can reach a speed of 25 knots and have a range of approximately 400 nautical miles. In 2019, the DGA initiated the replacement process by issuing a tender under the 'New Generation Maritime Surveillance Coastal Patrol Boats' (VCSM NG) program. The shipyard Socarenam was selected to build three new units, two of which were initially intended for French Guiana. However, these plans were altered, and the first two boats, the Maroni and Oyapock, were reassigned to Dunkirk and Boulogne. The third boat, the Aber Ildut, was sent to Cherbourg instead of Roscoff. As the Élorn boats approach the end of their service life, the DGA has recently issued a new tender to replace them. The specifications for the new boats will be similar to those of the VCSM NG units currently in service. According to the terms of this tender, published on February 13, the new boats will be 22 meters in length and must be capable of reaching a minimum speed of 22 knots in sea state 4 conditions. They must be able to perform Category 3 crossings as per merchant marine regulations. Furthermore, they will be 'crewed by a maximum of seven personnel' and equipped with a stabilized long-range optronic system capable of operating during the day, at night, and at twilight. These boats will also need to maintain their maximum speed for several hours and ensure an operational phase of up to 60% of the sailing time at a speed of 8 knots. They will be powered by diesel propulsion with a 'slow-speed maneuvering device.' However, the nature of the materials for the hull and superstructures has not been specified. It is worth noting that the armament for these new boats is not mentioned in this tender. Interested manufacturers will need to demonstrate their ability to supply 24 new boats with a production rate of two boats every six months. For reference, the Maritime Gendarmerie is a specialized unit of the French National Gendarmerie, operating under the authority of the Chief of Staff of the French Navy (CEMM).	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/france-issues-a-tender-for-acquisition-of-24-new-maritime-surveillance-coastal-patrol-boats	2025-02-17T05:13:57-08:00

India Plans to Launch an International Tender in 2025 for 114 Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft	India is expected to issue a tender this year for acquiring 114 multi-role combat aircraft, according to two sources cited by Reuters. This initiative is part of a modernization effort for the Indian Air Force that dates back nearly two decades. The objective is to bolster a fleet currently reduced to 31 fighter squadrons, mainly composed of Russian or Soviet-origin aircraft, even as neighboring China rapidly expands its air capabilities and Pakistan also benefits from Chinese support. Analysts emphasize that India needs to fill its combat aircraft shortfall as quickly as possible, given that the approved operational requirement stands at 42 squadrons. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Illustration image: Gripen E jet fighter armed with IRIS-T and Meteor missiles. (Picture source: SAAB) Industry observers anticipate that several major manufacturers will compete for this contract, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing from the United States, Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation, France’s Dassault Aviation, Sweden’s Saab, as well as the European Eurofighter consortium. Each is preparing by developing supply chain plans, identifying local partners, and refining their proposals to offer aircraft equipped with cutting-edge technology while remaining cost-competitive. Although the Indian Air Force does not yet operate American-made fighter jets, some of its aircraft are already equipped with General Electric engines, and other aircraft using these engines are on order. Lockheed Martin’s willingness to offer the F-21, an evolution of the well-known F-16 adapted to India’s specific needs, illustrates foreign industry’s interest in this huge market. U.S. President Donald Trump has even expressed support for a long-term supply of F-35 fighters, but the Indian government has yet to initiate an official process. Russia, historically India’s main supplier of military equipment, also took advantage of Aero India 2025 to showcase the stealthy Su-57 and discuss the possibility of local production. The two countries had at one time considered a partnership to jointly develop this aircraft, then called the T-50, before terminating that project. With the war in Ukraine slowing down Russian supply chains, India is now seeking to diversify its sources while remaining open to industrial partnerships, provided they guarantee the maintenance and technology transfers necessary over the long term. Swedish manufacturer Saab also aims to position itself with its Gripen E, presented as a more economical solution in terms of both acquisition and maintenance costs. According to Kent-Åke Molin, who heads the Gripen campaign in India, Indian officials have reportedly shown considerable interest in this proposal, underscoring the strength of Saab’s manufacturing and local partnership plan. The current project for 114 multi-role aircraft continues an older program launched in 2007, which had planned the purchase of 126 aircraft. That effort was ultimately abandoned in 2015 when the Indian government opted for a direct purchase of 36 Rafales from Dassault Aviation. The French company, already present in India’s fleet, is obviously among the main contenders for this new phase of Air Force modernization. Experts estimate that an official request for proposals could be issued in the coming months, setting off intense competition among the aircraft manufacturers. India is focusing on industrial cooperation and technology transfer to develop its own production capabilities and reduce dependence on imports.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/india-plans-to-launch-an-international-tender-in-2025-for-114-multi-role-fighter-aircraft	2025-02-17T00:11:29-08:00

A key moment in this transformation occurred on October 20, 2024, when, according to information published by the U.S. Department of Defense, an F-35B Lightning II fighter jet from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) successfully landed on JS Kaga’s deck off the coast of southern California. This marked the first time an F-35B operated from a Japanese vessel, validating the modifications made to the ship. The sea trials confirmed Kaga’s ability to operate the F-35B and paved the way for its integration into Japan’s naval doctrine. JS Kaga can now carry up to 12 F-35B fighter jets, significantly enhancing Japan’s air combat capabilities at sea. Japan has committed to acquiring 42 F-35B aircraft, with an initial purchase of eight aircraft in 2019 as part of a broader plan to modernize its defense forces. The F-35B is the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II, designed for operations from amphibious assault ships and light aircraft carriers. It features stealth capabilities, advanced avionics, and the ability to conduct strike missions, electronic warfare, and intelligence gathering. As part of the Pacific Stellar 2025 naval exercise—running until February 18—JS Kaga is operating alongside the U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (VINCSG) and the French Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in a multi-national carrier task force. This exercise underscores Japan’s increasing role in regional security and power projection in the Indo-Pacific, especially amidst rising geopolitical tensions. The U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group includes the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Princeton (CG 59), and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Sterett (DDG 104) and USS William P. Lawrence (DDG 110). The French Carrier Strike Group is led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles De Gaulle (R 91), escorted by air-defense destroyers and multi-mission frigates. The JMSDF contingent includes JS Kaga and the Akizuki-class destroyer JS Akizuki (DD 115). Logistics support is provided by the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler USNS Tippecanoe (T-AO 199) and the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Charles Drew (T-AKE 10). JS Kaga’s first operational mission as a light aircraft carrier signals a major shift in Japan’s defense posture. Previously, Japan maintained a self-imposed restriction on operating 'offensive' military assets in line with its post-World War II pacifist constitution. However, growing regional threats, including China’s expanding naval influence and North Korea’s missile advancements, have prompted Japan to reinterpret its defense strategy. The integration of JS Kaga with the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group enhances interoperability between JMSDF and U.S. Navy carrier operations, improving Japan’s ability to respond to regional threats. By fielding F-35B-capable carriers, Japan extends its power projection beyond its home islands, reinforcing regional stability in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, Japan’s participation alongside the French Carrier Strike Group highlights its growing role in international maritime security and its deepening defense partnerships with NATO allies. The successful deployment of JS Kaga as a light aircraft carrier in Pacific Stellar 2025 marks a transformational moment for JMSDF and Japan’s broader security policy. This development strengthens Japan’s deterrence posture, improves interoperability with allied naval forces, and enhances regional maritime security in the face of emerging challenges. As JS Kaga continues its carrier-based operations, its role in future multinational exercises and real-world contingencies will be closely watched by both allies and adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-navys-js-kaga-conducts-first-operational-mission-as-light-aircraft-carrier-in-philippine-sea	2025-02-16T02:51:01-08:00

Its ability to operate with minimal emissions makes it less detectable by enemy forces, ensuring survivability on the battlefield. The Gravehawk Air Defense System is optimized for engaging low and medium-altitude threats in short-range engagements. Its primary function is to provide local air defense coverage, protecting military units, infrastructure, and urban centers from enemy missiles, drones, and aircraft. It specializes in short-range engagements, primarily targeting drones, cruise missiles, and helicopters at ranges of up to 30 km. Utilizing R-73 missiles, which are capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.5, the system ensures fast interception of threats. Guided by passive infrared homing, it operates stealthily, unlike radar-based systems, which emit signals that can be detected and jammed by enemy forces. Its high mobility, thanks to the 8x8 military truck, allows for rapid repositioning based on evolving battlefield threats, while the ability to launch missiles remotely ensures that the operating crew remains at a safe distance from enemy fire. The Gravehawk system is housed within a standard ISO-sized shipping container, making it easy to transport and deploy. The launcher contains two R-73 missiles, stored and fired from inside the container, with integrated power systems providing electrical support for targeting and tracking operations. For mobility, the container is mounted on an 8x8 heavy military truck chassis, commonly referred to as a Drops vehicle. This configuration enables the system to traverse rough terrain, relocate quickly, and reposition as needed. Inside the Gravehawk Air Defense System's container are two R-73 (AA-11 Archer) missiles, originally designed as Soviet air-to-air weapons for fighter jets like the MiG-29. Now repurposed for ground-based defense, these missiles are operated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. (Picture source: UK MoD) A high-resolution electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera is mounted on top of the container, which allows for real-time tracking of incoming threats. The system automatically detects and locks onto enemy drones or missiles, then relays precise targeting data to the missile guidance system. This passive tracking capability ensures that the system remains undetectable by enemy radar detection methods. The Gravehawk system repurposes R-73 air-to-air missiles, originally designed by the Soviet Union in the 1980s and given the NATO reporting name AA-11 Archer, for ground-based launch operations. The Vympel R-73 is a short-range air-to-air missile developed by the Russian company Vympel NPO, which entered service in 1984. It was designed to equip Soviet fighter jets, replacing older infrared-guided missiles such as the R-60 (AA-8 Aphid). The missile became the primary close-combat missile for Soviet and later Russian fighter aircraft, including the MiG-29, Su-27, and their derivatives. The missile features high agility and an advanced infrared seeker, making it capable of 'off-boresight' targeting, where it can lock onto targets even outside the aircraft’s direct line of sight. The missile measures 2.93 meters in length, with a diameter of 165 mm and a wingspan of 510 mm. It weighs 105 kg and carries a 7.4 kg high-explosive fragmentation warhead, guided by passive infrared homing. Its range extends up to 30 km, making it suitable for intercepting short-range threats at high speeds. The missile can reach Mach 2.5, enabling it to engage and destroy fast-moving enemy targets. The Gravehawk Mobile Air Defense System's targeting and tracking system features a high-resolution camera mounted on top of the container. It detects and identifies threats, then relays precise targeting data to the missile for engagement. (Picture source UK MoD) The Gravehawk system is operated remotely, with a five-person crew controlling the system from a portable unit located up to 50 meters away. This remote operation enhances survivability, allowing personnel to launch interceptors while remaining in a secure location. The deployment of the Gravehawk system significantly enhances Ukraine’s air defense network. While not a replacement for high-end SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) systems like NASAMS or Patriot, it serves as an effective complementary layer in Ukraine’s multi-tiered air defense strategy, focusing on short-range interceptions against drones and cruise missiles. Its ability to reuse existing missile stockpiles reduces costs and ensures an efficient use of Ukraine’s military resources. By repurposing air-to-air missiles for ground-based launches, the Gravehawk system offers a cost-effective solution that does not require developing new interceptors. Unlike Western high-tech systems, which rely on expensive and complex missile platforms, Gravehawk can use Ukraine’s stockpiles of Soviet-era R-73 missiles, allowing for sustained operations without the need for continuous resupply. The containerized nature of the system allows rapid deployment, camouflage, and easy relocation after engagements, making it highly survivable and adaptable. Unlike traditional radar-guided SAM batteries, Gravehawk does not emit active radar signals, making it harder to detect and destroy by enemy electronic warfare systems. Russia has intensified its use of Shahed-136 drones and cruise missiles to target Ukraine’s infrastructure and military positions. The Gravehawk system provides a cost-effective and efficient solution to counter these threats, significantly reducing damage to cities, power plants, and military assets. Its rapid mobility and ability to neutralize incoming threats at short notice make it a crucial addition to Ukraine’s defense strategy. The Gravehawk Mobile Air Defense System represents a crucial advancement in Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, offering mobility, stealth, and cost-effectiveness. By adapting R-73 (AA-11 Archer) air-to-air missiles into a ground-based system, Ukraine is able to maximize its existing missile stockpiles while strengthening its defense against enemy drone and missile attacks.

Greece's new Sarisa II rocket-armed drone confirms combat readiness after three days of live-fire testing	The Greek company SAS Technology completed a three-day live-fire testing campaign for its Sarisa II (also known as SRS-2A) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) at the Litochoro Firing Range from February 10 to 12, 2025. The tests were part of the certification process for the SRS-2A, confirming its capability to deploy both unguided and laser-guided 70mm (2.75-inch) rockets from Thales Belgium. The trials were conducted under the supervision of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense, in collaboration with Thales Belgium and Hellenic Defense Systems (HDS), whose technical support contributed to the program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The tests, which spread out over three days, were part of the certification process for the SRS-2A, confirming its capability to deploy both unguided and laser-guided 70mm (2.75-inch) rockets from Thales Belgium. (Picture source: SAS) On February 10, testing focused on the SRS-2A’s ability to launch unguided rockets while maintaining flight stability. The unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) fired a 70mm unguided rocket (UGR) while hovering, demonstrating control under the effects of rocket jet blast. The rocket followed a predictable trajectory, confirming the functionality of optical sighting methods. On February 11, the Sarisa II/SRS-2A was tested with the FZ275 laser-guided rocket (LGR) from Thales. The UCAV launched the rocket at a 5×5-meter target with a central 2×2-meter section. The impact was recorded with a deviation of 0.2 meters, confirming a circular error probable (CEP) of less than one meter. Due to range constraints and Weapon Danger Area (WDA) limitations, the test was conducted at 1,700 meters, close to the weapon’s minimum operational range. The FZ275 LGR is designed for engagement distances between 3 and 5 kilometers, with a maximum reach of 7 kilometers. The test conditions required launching the rocket at close range, where it reached supersonic speeds and deployed its guidance fins after 400 meters. The SRS-2A’s autonomous flight control system executed the firing sequence without manual operator input. On February 12, a live demonstration was held in the presence of military officials and personnel from the Hellenic Army, Navy, Air Force, and Special Forces, as well as international delegations. The SRS-2A launched a laser-guided FZ275 LGR rocket from an altitude of 450 meters above sea level, maintaining stability and achieving a CEP of less than one meter. Additionally, the Hellenic Special Forces' UCAV Empusa EMPX6T performed precision grenade drops using both training and live grenades in sequential and simultaneous release modes. The planned release of the AIHMI loitering munition from the SRS-2A was canceled due to low cloud cover. The FZ275 LGR, developed by Thales Belgium, is a semi-active laser (SAL) guided rocket designed to bridge the gap between unguided rockets and long-range missiles. It offers targeting precision while reducing collateral damage. The rocket has a range of 1,500 to 7,000 meters, with a CEP of less than one meter at 6 kilometers. It can engage ground vehicles, air defense installations, radar sites, communication infrastructure, aircraft on the ground, small ships and patrol boats, soft bunkers, and snipers. The FZ275 LGR is compatible with standard 2.75-inch rocket launchers and requires minimal integration work. It has various warhead configurations, including a high-explosive variant with a lethal radius of 9 meters and penetration capability against 6mm steel plates. The FZ275 LGR features semi-active laser guidance technology with Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) and Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capabilities.

The rocket can be fired from any standard FZ rocket launcher, and Thales Belgium has developed smart rocket launchers, including the FZ606 for helicopters and the FZ800 for aircraft, which enable bidirectional communication and in-flight laser code implementation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/greeces-new-sarisa-ii-rocket-armed-drone-confirms-combat-readiness-after-three-days-of-live-fire-testing	2025-02-15T23:06:30-08:00	
US Army starts to test the M10 Booker fire support vehicle for future deployment in the Arctic	As reported by Peter George, the Booker Combat Vehicle Product Manager, on February 15, 2025, the U.S. Army is conducting extreme cold weather testing on the M10 Booker combat vehicle at Fort Greely, Alaska. This testing could be seen as part of the US Department of Defense’s Arctic Strategy to assess operational effectiveness in sub-zero conditions. The results will inform decisions on full-rate production and deployment, ensuring the vehicle's performance in harsh environments where temperatures can drop below -50°C.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The M10 Booker is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE23 diesel engine producing 800 horsepower, marking the first use of an English MTU serial production engine in a U.S. Army land system in over four decades. (Picture source: Peter George) The U.S. Army is expanding Arctic operations to improve readiness in extreme environments. As part of this effort, training exercises such as Arctic Forge 25 are increasing, with additional forces deployed to key locations. Arctic Forge 25 will involve 330 U.S. Soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division and the 10th Mountain Division, 40 Canadian troops, and 500 Finnish personnel. Additionally, 110 Soldiers from the 41st Field Artillery Brigade will deploy to Norway to test long-range precision fires in Arctic conditions. The U.S. Army's efforts align with the broader goal of ensuring force interoperability and operational effectiveness in joint military exercises with NATO partners. The Arctic region is strategically significant due to geopolitical competition and environmental changes. Russia has expanded its military presence by reopening Soviet-era bases, while China has declared itself a 'near-Arctic state' and increased activities in the region. Melting ice is opening new maritime routes, increasing the necessity for military presence. The region’s extreme temperatures, low precipitation, and widespread permafrost create operational challenges requiring specialized equipment and training. The U.S. military's emphasis on Arctic operations also supports homeland defense by reinforcing early warning systems and rapid response capabilities against potential threats in the northern hemisphere. The M10 Booker provides direct fire support for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) against fortified positions and light armored threats. Despite a weight of 38 to 42 tonnes, it is classified by the US Army as an armored infantry support vehicle or an assault gun, not as a light tank, because it lacks the armor and firepower necessary for direct engagement with enemy main battle tanks. However, the M10 Booker is not designed to be airdropped due to its weight and structural configuration, requiring transport by aircraft such as the C-17 Globemaster III. The Army plans to field 14 M10 Bookers per IBCT, with the 82nd Airborne Division receiving the first units by late FY2025. The vehicle's integration into IBCTs aims to improve combined arms maneuver capabilities, allowing infantry units to operate with increased lethality and survivability. The U.S. Army has lacked a modern, lightweight, heavily armed vehicle since the retirement of the M551 Sheridan in 1997. Attempts to address this gap, such as the Stryker Mobile Gun System, faced technical challenges and were eventually phased out. The M10 Booker was selected in June 2022 under the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program. The first production units were delivered in February 2024, with plans to acquire up to 504 units under a contract valued at up to $1.14 billion, and to date, each M10 Booker is estimated to cost approximately $13.95 million. The Army envisions the M10 Booker and its crew of four as a key component in its shift from brigade-centric to division-centric operations, where armored firepower will play a more significant role in large-scale combat operations. The M10 Booker is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE23 diesel engine producing 800 horsepower. This marks the first use of an MTU serial production engine in a U.S. Army land system in over four decades. The engine is integrated into the PowerPack system, which includes transmission, cooling, and filtration components, supporting performance in diverse terrains, including Arctic conditions. Rolls-Royce's efforts to enhance the power output of this engine align with broader modernization initiatives to improve the performance of tracked combat vehicles within the Army's fleet. The M10 Booker is equipped with a 105mm M35 tank gun, a 12.7mm M2HB heavy machine gun, and a 7.62mm M240B machine gun. Compared to the M2 Bradley, the M10 Booker is optimized for infantry support thanks to a greater direct-fire capability, but the Bradley is better suited for mechanized infantry operations due to its troop-carrying capacity and missile armament. The Booker has a maximum speed of 64 km/h, an operational range of up to 560 km, and modular armor for protection. The vehicle features an advanced fire control system derived from the M1A2 Abrams for targeting accuracy. It also incorporates a hydropneumatic suspension system and advanced optics, including Safran Optics 1's PASEO Commander's Independent Tactical Viewer (CITV), to enhance situational awareness and targeting in varied combat environments. Additionally, the M10 Booker’s design leverages lessons learned from past vehicle development programs, ensuring it meets current operational requirements while maintaining future upgrade potential.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-starts-to-test-the-m10-booker-fire-support-vehicle-for-future-deployment-in-the-arctic	2025-02-15T07:36:59-08:00	
US Army confirms Precision Strike Missile's capability to engage enemy ballistic missiles	On February 12, 2025, the U.S. Army conducted a flight test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, involving two Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) Increment 1 engagements. Fired from an M142 HIMARS, both missiles followed their intended trajectories and engaged multiple targets, including a surrogate Scud ballistic missile, radar installations, and rotary-wing platforms. Lockheed Martin stated that this was a step toward full-rate production, following previous test flights in November and the first soldier-led test in December 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Measuring approximately 4 meters in length and 430 millimeters in diameter, the PrSM's design enables two missiles per launch pod, doubling the payload of M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS. (Picture source: US Army) Initially developed under the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) program, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is the U.S. Army's next-generation, surface-to-surface missile, replacing the older MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). Measuring approximately 4 meters in length and 430 millimeters in diameter, the PrSM's design enables two missiles per launch pod, doubling the payload of M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS launchers when compared to the single-missile ATACMS pods. Featuring a solid-propellant rocket motor, this new short-range ballistic missile employs an inertial navigation system (INS) with GPS guidance. Its pre-formed tungsten fragmentation warhead is suited for a variety of high-value targets, including air defense systems, missile launchers, command and control centers, and troop assembly areas. Additionally, the PrSM features an open-systems architecture, allowing for modular upgrades and future modifications. Development of the PrSM began in March 2016, with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon competing for the contract. By early 2020, Boeing and Raytheon had withdrawn from the competition, leaving Lockheed Martin as the sole developer. The US Army received the first batch of PrSM missiles on December 8, 2023. Subsequent tests in June 2024 included the sinking of the decommissioned Austin-class amphibious transport dock USS Cleveland in the North Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Island Range Complex, marking the first recorded use of the PrSM against a moving target. Moreover, a recently awarded contract, valued at up to $120 million, will support tooling efforts to increase production capacity to 400 missiles per year. The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) was originally constrained by the 500 km range limitation imposed by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. However, the U.S. withdrawal from the treaty in 2019 enabled the development of extended-range variants. The PrSM Increment 1, for instance, has an official range exceeding 500 km, while future increments are expected to enhance target acquisition and engagement with a new multi-mode seeker. This technology, expected to be integrated into PrSM Increment 2, will enable the missile to track and strike moving targets on both land and sea. Increment 2, also referred to as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM), is being developed in collaboration with Australia, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Army in July 2021. Australia has committed to acquiring PrSM Increments 3 and 4, expanding its long-range strike capabilities. Increment 3 is expected to introduce enhanced warhead configurations for increased effectiveness against hardened targets, while Increment 4 will focus on propulsion and aerodynamic refinements to extend the missile’s range beyond 1,000 km, doubling the range of existing systems. Additionally, the US Army is considering a fifth iteration of the PrSM that could be compatible with autonomous launch platforms such as the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML), an unmanned variant of the M142 HIMARS. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, leading the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, has stated that this effort remains in the science and technology phase, exploring potential designs for integration with unmanned ground vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-confirms-precision-strike-missiles-capability-to-engage-enemy-ballistic-missiles	2025-02-15T05:41:09-08:00

Could the future Leclerc Evolution tank succeed without financial support from France?	As reported by Opex360 on February 13, 2025, KNDS France is requesting support from the French Ministry of the Armed Forces for the development and potential export of the Leclerc Evolution main battle tank. This request follows Germany’s initiation of studies for the Leopard 3, an interim solution before the introduction of the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS). KNDS France presented the Leclerc Evolution at Eurosatory 2024, highlighting its modular turret and armament configurations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Leclerc Evolution is armed with the Ascalon system, initially configured with a 120mm gun but designed for retrofitting with a 140mm caliber. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program, initiated in 2017, is a Franco-German project designed to replace the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks by 2040 with an integrated network of crewed and uncrewed platforms. The program is developed by KNDS, a consortium of France’s Nexter and Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, and focuses on modularity, firepower, protection, and AI-assisted battlefield management. Disagreements remain on key technical aspects, particularly regarding the main armament, with France supporting the Ascalon gun, available in 120mm and 140mm calibers, and Germany favoring a 130mm alternative from Rheinmetall. Belgium, along with Italy and Spain, has shown interest in joining the program. Germany is financing the Leopard 3 as an interim solution while awaiting the MGCS, with the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology, and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) assigning research tasks to KNDS Deutschland, Rheinmetall, and Hensoldt. The Leopard 3 is expected to be introduced within five years, allowing Germany to maintain its main battle tank fleet. In contrast, France has not adopted a similar strategy and will continue operating 200 Leclerc XLR tanks with limited modernization until the more modern MGCS is introduced. However, as the Leopard 3 is expected to fire 130mm ammunition, some people think that it could influence future MGCS armament decisions. During a hearing at the French National Assembly on February 12, Alexandre Dupuy, Director of Systems at KNDS France, stated that the Leopard 3 does not conflict with MGCS, as MGCS is designed as a 'system of systems' integrating multiple platforms. He described the Leopard 3 as another standard within the Leopard series rather than a new platform. Dupuy estimated that MGCS deliveries will take place over an extended period and that the full fleet will not be immediately available, meaning that new tank acquisitions by European countries today do not preclude their participation in MGCS through the 2050s. He also stated that continued investment in French armored vehicle technology is necessary. Additionally, in this same hearing, he also announced that Belgium has received its first Griffon armored vehicle under the CaMo (Capacité Motorisée) program, as well as the Irish interest in armored vehicles from the Scorpion program. Therefore, KNDS France is seeking collaboration with the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) to advance the Leclerc Evolution, which was presented at Eurosatory 2024 as a next-generation main battle tank. The company is positioning the tank for potential export, citing restrictions in certain regions on German-manufactured defense equipment as a possible market opportunity. However, Dupuy noted that securing an order from the French Army would be critical to establishing the Leclerc Evolution in the international market. He added that financial backing is necessary to complete the tank’s development. The Leclerc Evolution is armed with the Ascalon system, initially configured with a 120mm gun but designed for retrofitting with a 140mm caliber. The modular turret can switch calibers in under an hour. The Ascalon system includes an autoloader with a 22-round capacity and a recoil management system to support stability. The gun is designed for extended barrel lifespan and reduced maintenance requirements. KNDS France has tested the Ascalon system in 120mm and 140mm configurations, with further evaluations planned in a fully integrated turret. The Leclerc Evolution is configured for a four-person crew, with a deputy commander in the chassis responsible for managing sensor and effector systems. It is equipped with the ARX 30 remote-controlled weapon station for counter-UAV operations and a loitering ammunition launcher with three intermediate-range munitions. The tank’s survivability is supported by a modular armor system, the Galix close protection system, an Active Protection System (APS), and a CBRN filtration system. The vehicle is powered by a 1,500 hp engine, reaching speeds of up to 68 km/h with an operational range of 470 kilometers.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/could-the-future-leclerc-evolution-tank-succeed-without-financial-support-from-france	2025-02-14T03:46:42-08:00	
French Army Shows Growing Interest in Locally Produced MALE Drone Aarok	The French Army is closely following the development of the Aarok MALE drone, designed by Turgis &amp; Gaillard, a project that attracted attention when it was unveiled at the 2023 edition of the Paris Air and Space Show at Le Bourget. Initially, this drone piqued the interest of the French Air and Space Force, particularly General Stéphane Mille, then Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, who expressed curiosity about its ability to transition from the design phase to the first flight tests. He even mentioned being willing to fund the trials if the resources were available. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since its unveiling, the Aarok has been the subject of a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov, aimed at developing a lighter and more 'consumable' version of the drone. (Picture source: Aarok) Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu also highlighted the 'very interesting' nature of the project. He mentioned the possibility of including the Aarok in the 2024-2030 military programming, specifying that the work done with Turgis &amp; Gaillard was of good quality and conducted in collaboration with the ministry's services. The Military Programming Law (LPM), which provides 5 billion euros for drone research, allowed Lecornu to indicate that this budget would enable the exploration of various concepts, including that of the Aarok drone. Since its unveiling, the Aarok has been the subject of a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov, aimed at developing a lighter and more 'consumable' version of the drone. It has also begun ground tests and was selected by the Directorate of Aeronautical Maintenance (DMAé) to test the concept of a 'certifiable but non-certified' drone, which aims to reduce the normative requirements for the certification of an aircraft. While the MALE drone segment primarily falls under the French Air and Space Force's responsibility, the French Army has not hidden its interest in this system, especially due to its features suited for surveillance and intervention missions. General Bruno Baratz, head of the Future Combat Command (CCF) of the French Army, expressed interest in the Aarok following a visit to Turgis &amp; Gaillard’s facilities. According to him, the Aarok could provide a 'simple, rugged, and affordable' means of surveillance and intervention, particularly suitable for the Army’s needs. Additionally, its 'decidedly multi-domain' design makes it a potential asset for land forces. General Baratz added that the French Army would closely monitor the development of this project, emphasizing the importance of a close collaboration between industry and the military, and highlighting the strength of the French defense industry in this field. The Aarok, which weighs 5.5 tons, is designed to have an endurance of over 24 hours, thanks to a 1,200-horsepower turboprop engine. It is equipped with a large optronic sensor, an electromagnetic payload, and a multimode radar. The drone can carry up to 1.5 tons of munitions and can be deployed on rough terrain, a feature of particular interest to the French Army. Additionally, its cost is estimated between 5 and 10 million euros, and it is designed without any American-origin components, making it 'ITAR Free' (free from U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations constraints). The possibility of the French Army purchasing the Aarok remains open. During debates on the 2025 finance bill, Minister Lecornu mentioned the possibility of using budget savings related to delays in the European MALE drone project, Eurodrone, to finance the acquisition of drones that could accelerate the 'droneification' of the French military. Therefore, although the acquisition of the Aarok drone has not yet been confirmed, it is not excluded that the French Army may consider acquiring it in the near future.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/french-army-shows-growing-interest-in-locally-produced-male-drone-aarok	2025-02-14T03:11:41-08:00	
Lithuanian Army Conscripts Boost Artillery Firepower with First PzH 2000 Howitzer Training	On February 11, 2025, the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense announced a significant milestone: conscripts of the Lithuanian Army conducted live-fire exercises with the PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers for the first time. This development marks a pivotal step in strengthening Lithuania's defense capabilities and preparing the next generation of artillery crews. The training of conscripts on these advanced artillery systems is part of a broader effort to modernize Lithuania’s armed forces, ensuring that the country remains prepared for any emerging threats in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lithuanian Army conscripts stand in front of a PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer during training exercises, marking their first live-fire drills with the advanced artillery system. (Picture source: Lithuania MoD) Lithuania's acquisition of the German-made PzH 2000 155mm tracked self-propelled howitzers dates back to September 2015, when the Ministry of National Defense signed a contract with the German Armed Forces to procure 21 of these advanced 155mm self-propelled howitzers. Of these, 16 were designated for combat purposes, two for training in firing and driving, and three were allocated for spare parts. The contract also included 26 M577 V2 armored command vehicles and six BPZ2 recovery tanks, all previously utilized by the German military. As part of Lithuania's artillery modernization efforts, the first upgraded PzH 2000 units were delivered to the General Romualdas Giedraitis Artillery Battalion in December 2018. These enhancements improved the fire control software, battlefield management systems, and increased the howitzers' overall efficiency. The PzH 2000 is renowned for its advanced artillery capabilities, boasting a firing range of up to 40 kilometers with standard ammunition, and even greater distances with specialized rounds. Its rapid-fire capability and precision make it a formidable asset on the modern battlefield. The system can fire multiple rounds in quick succession, enabling coordinated strikes on enemy positions, which is a key advantage in counter-artillery warfare. Lithuania's continued investment in these systems ensures that its military remains equipped with cutting-edge technology. Integrating the PzH 2000 howitzers into Lithuania's military arsenal significantly enhances the nation's artillery capabilities, which is particularly important given the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The war has underscored the critical role of advanced artillery systems in modern warfare, with artillery being central to Russia's military strategy. This has highlighted the need for Western forces, including NATO allies, to understand and counter such capabilities properly. Recognizing this, Lithuania has taken decisive steps to strengthen its firepower, particularly in long-range precision strikes. Beyond the PzH 2000, Lithuania has further expanded its artillery strength by joining the French CAESAR Mark II program. In December 2022, Lithuania signed a contract for 18 CAESAR NG self-propelled howitzers, with deliveries expected by 2027. These highly mobile systems will complement the PzH 2000 fleet, providing Lithuania with increased operational flexibility. The addition of the CAESAR NG demonstrates Lithuania’s long-term commitment to improving its indirect fire capabilities and modernizing its artillery forces. Lithuania's commitment to defense modernization extends beyond its artillery forces. In 2024, the country increased its defense budget to €2.3 billion, representing approximately 3.03% of its GDP, one of the highest defense expenditures among NATO allies. This financial commitment reflects the growing emphasis on military readiness, procurement of modern equipment, and strengthening Lithuania’s overall defense infrastructure. The funds are being allocated toward acquiring advanced weapon systems, enhancing troop training programs, and reinforcing Lithuania’s border security in response to heightened regional tensions. By equipping its forces with the PzH 2000 howitzers and ensuring that conscripts are proficient in its operation, Lithuania is bolstering its defense posture. This initiative not only strengthens national security but also contributes to the broader stability of the Baltic region, serving as a deterrent against potential aggressors. The training of new artillery crews with the PzH 2000 reinforces the preparedness of Lithuania’s armed forces, ensuring that they can effectively operate and maintain these systems in a conflict scenario. The recent live-fire exercises represent a culmination of years of strategic planning and investment in defense infrastructure. As regional tensions persist, Lithuania's commitment to enhancing its military capabilities underscores its dedication to national defense and its role within the NATO alliance. By strengthening its artillery, increasing its defense budget, and investing in long-term modernization programs, Lithuania continues to demonstrate its resolve to safeguard its sovereignty and contribute to the region's collective security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lithuanian-army-conscripts-boost-artillery-firepower-with-pzh-2000-howitzer-training	2025-02-14T03:02:15-08:00	
Russian Navy to deploy more Admiral Gorshkov frigates as Severnaya Verf shipyard confirms new orders	As reported by La souris on February 13, 2025, Russian shipbuilder Severnaya Verf recently released its annual financial report, confirming plans to secure contracts for additional frigates. The report details the construction of four new Project 22350 frigates, known as the Admiral Gorshkov class, with hull numbers 929 to 932, along with the continuation of the Project 22350M program, referred to as Super Gorshkov.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Admiral Gorshkov was laid down in 2006 and commissioned in 2018 after delays caused by disruptions in the supply of propulsion systems, primarily due to the termination of deliveries from Ukraine. (Picture source: Russian social media) In recent years, Severnaya Verf has expanded its slipway capacity and modernized its assembly processes to accommodate larger hulls and increase production efficiency for both the Project 22350 and the larger Project 22350M frigates. These enhancements include constructing a new slipway to assemble multiple ships simultaneously and upgrading welding and outfitting facilities to accelerate completion times. The Project 22350, known as the Admiral Gorshkov-class, is a series of guided missile frigates developed by the Severnoye Design Bureau and constructed at Severnaya Verf. The program was initiated in the early 2000s as part of Russia’s naval modernization strategy. The lead ship, Admiral Gorshkov, was laid down in 2006 and commissioned in 2018 after delays caused by disruptions in the supply of propulsion systems, primarily due to the termination of deliveries from Ukraine's Zorya-Mashproekt following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. This led to the necessity of developing domestic alternatives, which resulted in prolonged testing and integration challenges. The program has continued with seven hulls currently under construction and four additional units planned, bringing the total number of planned ships in the class to 12. Compared to Soviet-era frigates, this class features a reduced radar cross-section due to a redesigned superstructure and composite materials, along with an integrated combat system that enhances target acquisition, tracking, and fire control across multiple domains. Currently, three ships (Admiral Gorshkov, Admiral Kasatonov, and Admiral Golovko) are in service, and the four newly announced frigates (hulls 929 to 932) may be named after notable Russian naval figures, following existing class naming conventions. Potential names include Admiral Vysotsky, Admiral Kuroyedov, Admiral Komoyedov, and Admiral Evtukhin. The frigates from the Admiral Gorshkov-class have a full displacement of 5,400 tons and a length of 135 meters. They are powered by a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) propulsion system with two M90FR gas turbines and two 10D49 diesel engines, producing a combined output of 65,400 shp. This allows a top speed of 29.5 knots and an operational endurance of 30 days. The frigates are fitted with the Poliment-Redut air defense system, featuring 32 vertical launch system (VLS) cells capable of deploying 9M96, 9M96M, 9M96D/9M96DM(M2), and 9M100 surface-to-air missiles. Their offensive systems include either 16 or 32 (depending on variant) 3S14 VLS cells for Kalibr, Oniks, Zircon, or Otvet anti-submarine missiles. Additional weaponry includes a 130mm A-192M naval gun, Paket-NK anti-submarine torpedo launchers, and the Otvet anti-submarine missile system. Electronic warfare and radar systems comprise the 5P-27 Furke-4 air search radar, the 5P-20K Poliment AESA radar, and the Zarya-M sonar system for submarine detection. The ships are also equipped with Prosvet-M and Filin electro-optical suppression devices. Finally, a Kamov Ka-27 helicopter supports anti-submarine warfare operations. Nicknamed 'Super Gorshkov', the Project 22350M frigate brings three key improvements over its predecessor: increased firepower, extended operational range, and enhanced survivability. (Picture source: Russian social media) Nicknamed 'Super Gorshkov', the Project 22350M frigate is an upgraded variant of the Admiral Gorshkov-class, bringing three key improvements over its predecessor: increased firepower, extended operational range, and enhanced survivability. The Severnoye Design Bureau completed the outline design in 2019, and a final proposal was submitted for approval in 2023. The updated design includes an increased displacement of approximately 7,600 tons and expanded weapons capacity. Production of the first unit is planned to begin in 2025 following the completion of a new slipway at Severnaya Verf. The Project 22350M frigates will feature an upgraded propulsion system, replacing the CODAG configuration with a more powerful combined gas turbine and gas turbine (COGAG) setup using four M90FR gas turbines to achieve higher sustained speeds. The ships will integrate the Sigma-22350M combat management system, improving real-time target processing and coordination of multi-domain operations. Their electronic warfare suite will include Prosvet-M and additional countermeasure systems to enhance survivability against advanced threats. Their air defense systems will be enhanced with 64 Poliment-Redut VLS cells, enabling them to deploy 9M96 and 40N6E missiles with ranges of up to 400 kilometers. The offensive missile capacity will also be increased, with up to 64 3S14 VLS cells for Kalibr, Oniks, or Zircon cruise missiles. The Project 22350M frigates will feature an upgraded sonar suite, including the Minotavr-M sonar system for improved submarine detection and tracking. The anti-submarine warfare capability will be enhanced with additional Paket-NK torpedo launchers and the integration of advanced Otvet anti-submarine missile systems, increasing effectiveness against underwater threats at greater ranges. With a range exceeding 7,000 nautical miles, the Project 22350M frigates will support extended operations without frequent resupply. The class will accommodate up to two Ka-27 helicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to improve reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, and targeting capabilities. The sensor suite will include an upgraded AESA radar, potentially the Poliment-Redut system with improved long-range target detection, along with advanced electronic warfare capabilities, further reinforcing Russia’s ability to conduct sustained blue-water operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-navy-to-deploy-more-admiral-gorshkov-frigates-as-severnaya-verf-shipyard-confirms-new-orders	2025-02-14T02:05:30-08:00	
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth Prioritizes China’s Indo-Pacific Threat and America’s Response	During the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting held in Brussels on February 12, 2025, U.S. Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, delivered a stark assessment of global security dynamics, underlining the emerging and consequential threats facing the United States. As the world navigates the complexities of military conflicts, particularly in Europe, Hegseth highlighted that the U.S. must not lose sight of the growing challenge posed by China. His remarks underscored the centrality of the Indo-Pacific region, where China’s military rise has become an existential concern for the United States and its allies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The guided-missile submarine USS Ohio has arrived at Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, for a routine port visit, marking the start of a one-year deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet. Homeported at Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor, Washington, USS Ohio operates under Commander Submarine Group 7, reinforcing U.S. naval presence and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Indo-Pacific has become a primary theater of military competition between the U.S. and China, with Beijing rapidly enhancing its military capabilities. China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, coupled with its modernization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), pose direct challenges to regional stability. The Chinese military has become increasingly adept in the domains of anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD), cyber warfare, and space operations, all of which are crucial to Beijing’s strategy of preventing U.S. intervention in the region. China’s growing naval power, particularly its fleet of advanced warships and submarines, is seen as a direct counter to U.S. military supremacy in the Pacific. The recent commissioning of aircraft carriers such as the Shandong and Fujian signifies China's intent to establish a more robust and capable naval force capable of contesting U.S. forces in critical waters like the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Moreover, China’s missile forces, including advanced hypersonic weapons and long-range precision-guided missiles, are designed to hold U.S. assets at risk, complicating efforts to project power in the region. China’s anti-ship missile systems, such as the DF-21D and DF-26, are specifically tailored to target U.S. aircraft carriers and other large surface vessels, which remain cornerstone platforms for American naval power projection. These capabilities are complemented by China’s cyberwarfare and information operations designed to disrupt communications, targeting, and command-and-control functions, further eroding the U.S. military’s technological advantages. Secretary Hegseth’s remarks signal that the U.S. is pivoting towards a more focused strategy in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing deterrence to prevent conflict with China while maintaining a credible military presence in the region. The concept of strategic deterrence has evolved as the U.S. recognizes the need for a balance between preventing Chinese aggression and avoiding direct military confrontation. As of 2025, the U.S. military maintains a robust and forward-deployed presence in the Indo-Pacific, managed by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) headquartered in Hawaii. The U.S. has positioned over 300,000 military personnel across key locations to ensure deterrence and rapid response capabilities. In Japan, around 54,000 U.S. troops are stationed, including the 7th Fleet at Yokosuka Naval Base, Marine units in Okinawa, and air assets at Kadena Air Base. South Korea hosts approximately 28,500 U.S. troops, primarily at Camp Humphreys, which remains the largest U.S. overseas military base, ensuring regional security while countering Chinese influence. Guam continues to serve as a strategic hub, with Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam playing critical roles in power projection and bomber deployments. In response to China's growing assertiveness, the U.S. has strengthened its military cooperation with the Philippines under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), granting access to additional bases and bolstering joint military exercises. In Australia, the rotational presence of U.S. Marines in Darwin has expanded, with joint exercises becoming more frequent under the AUKUS security pact. Additionally, the U.S., Australia, and Japan have announced annual joint military exercises aimed at countering regional threats and reinforcing deterrence. Recent developments have further reinforced the U.S. commitment to military preparedness in the region. In April 2024, the U.S. Army deployed the Typhon missile system to the Philippines as part of joint military exercises, enhancing long-range strike capabilities against potential adversaries in the South China Sea. The U.S. Air Force is also set to conduct the REFORPAC exercise in mid-2025, involving nearly 300 aircraft across 25 locations, enhancing readiness and interoperability among allied forces. Despite its clear prioritization of the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. military faces significant resourcing challenges. As Hegseth noted, the reality of resource scarcity means the U.S. must make strategic tradeoffs in its defense planning. This involves balancing commitments to ongoing military operations in Ukraine and Europe with the imperative of preparing for potential conflicts in the Pacific. The integration of advanced technologies such as autonomous systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing is becoming increasingly critical to countering China’s military advancements and maintaining a technological edge. The U.S. is increasingly turning to multi-domain operations, where forces are trained to operate across land, sea, air, cyber, and space to ensure a credible deterrence. One key area of focus is the development and deployment of long-range strike capabilities that could target Chinese missile sites and critical infrastructure if necessary, minimizing the need for direct military engagement while maintaining a strong deterrent posture. The B-21 Raider, the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation stealth bomber, is one such platform that will enhance U.S. deterrence by allowing for long-range, precision strikes deep within contested areas. Furthermore, the U.S. is emphasizing the integration of partner nations’ forces into deterrence and response plans. The presence of U.S. forces in countries such as the Philippines, Japan, and Australia serves as a tripwire against Chinese aggression, and the strengthening of regional security alliances will be pivotal in maintaining peace through strength. China’s military ambitions extend beyond simply securing regional supremacy in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing’s global aspirations, particularly its efforts to build a network of strategic partnerships through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its push for military bases in regions such as Africa and the South Pacific, reflect its desire for global influence. The United States views these ambitions with concern, as they could potentially extend China's reach and threaten U.S. interests worldwide. Tensions remain high over Taiwan, where China has consistently signaled its intent to reclaim the island, either through coercion or military action. The U.S. has long adhered to a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding Taiwan, maintaining a commitment to defend Taiwan while stopping short of promising direct military intervention. However, this balance is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as China's military modernization progresses, with Beijing developing the capability to launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Such a development would not only destabilize the region but would also test the U.S. commitment to its Taiwan Relations Act. The United States' military strategy in the Indo-Pacific is focused on ensuring that China’s ambitions are contained and deterred. While the U.S. must balance multiple threats globally, Hegseth’s statements emphasize that the Indo-Pacific will remain the central focus of U.S. defense priorities in the coming years. Strengthening military alliances, modernizing defense capabilities, and investing in advanced technologies are key to maintaining a credible deterrent against China’s increasingly capable military forces. China's growing military might poses a direct threat to regional stability and global security, but the U.S. remains committed to securing peace in the Indo-Pacific by leveraging its technological, military, and diplomatic advantages. The next decade will be critical in determining whether the U.S. can effectively deter China’s ambitions while preventing a broader regional conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-prioritizes-chinas-indo-pacific-threat-and-americas-response	2025-02-14T01:58:13-08:00	
US proposes the F-35 fighter jet to India despite current restrictions on Türkiye	As reported by Reuters on February 14, 2025, the United States has announced plans to increase military sales to India, with newly re-elected President Donald Trump stating that the deal could eventually include F-35 fighter jets. Indian officials clarified that no formal procurement process has begun, and the U.S. offer is still under discussion. The announcement follows India’s ongoing efforts to expand its defense procurement from multiple sources while maintaining its long-standing relationship with Russia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The proposal is surprising given that Türkiye remains blocked from purchasing the US-made F-35 fighter jet due to its acquisition of Russia’s S-400 air defense system, which India has also procured. (Picture source: US Air Force) Following Trump’s statement, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that no acquisition process has been initiated. Misri emphasized that India follows a structured procurement process, requiring proposals from manufacturers and evaluations before any decision is made. Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35, confirmed that any sale would take place at a government-to-government level, with the Pentagon acting as an intermediary. Since 2008, India has purchased over $20 billion in U.S. defense equipment, including a recent acquisition of 31 MQ-9B SeaGuardian and SkyGuardian drones after negotiations lasting over six years. The U.S. Congressional Research Service estimates that India is projected to spend more than $200 billion on military modernization over the next decade. The proposal is surprising given that Türkiye remains blocked from purchasing the F-35 due to its acquisition of Russia’s S-400 air defense system, which India has also procured. Türkiye was removed from the F-35 program in 2019 after purchasing the S-400, as the U.S. raised concerns that the system could expose sensitive technological data on the aircraft’s stealth capabilities. Despite India also acquiring the S-400, the U.S. has not imposed similar restrictions on New Delhi, likely due to broader geopolitical considerations. Additionally, Russia has recently proposed manufacturing the Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter in India in the hope of reinforcing its longstanding defense ties with New Delhi. Under President Trump's renewed administration, the United States is focusing on recalibrating its relationship with India, which is viewed as a key strategic partner to counter China's military presence in the Indo-Pacific. Recent discussions between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have led to an agreement to initiate trade negotiations aimed at resolving tariff disputes and doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. The U.S. has expressed concerns over India's high tariffs on American goods, with President Trump emphasizing the need for 'fairness and reciprocity' in trade practices. In response, India has shown willingness to reduce certain tariffs and increase imports of U.S. products, including oil, gas, and military equipment. Additionally, both nations are exploring avenues to strengthen defense cooperation and reinforce their commitment to the Quad alliance to counterbalance China's influence. Despite these collaborative efforts, challenges will likely persist, particularly regarding trade deficits, the Make-In-India defense program, and immigration policies, as the U.S. continues to advocate for balanced trade and the repatriation of undocumented Indian nationals. As of February 2025, the Indian Air Force (IAF) operates a fleet of combat aircraft from multiple origins, including France, India, Russia, and the former Soviet Union. The multirole fighter fleet includes 36 Dassault Rafales, 31 HAL Tejas Mk.1s, and 259 Sukhoi Su-30MKIs, with 12 additional Su-30MKIs on order. The IAF also fields 52 Mikoyan MiG-29s, including 12 MiG-29UPGs, and 47 Dassault Mirage 2000s. The SEPECAT Jaguar fleet consists of 115 aircraft, including variants used for training and maritime strike. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Bison fleet, currently at 40 units, is being phased out. To modernize its fleet, the IAF has ordered 73 HAL Tejas Mk.1A aircraft, with an additional 97 approved for future acquisition. The IAF’s combat aircraft strength stands at 31 squadrons, below the sanctioned 42 squadrons, reaching its lowest level since 1965 due to the retirement of older aircraft without immediate replacements. Therefore, it is not surprising that India has had previous discussions regarding the F-35. In 2010, Lockheed Martin provided a briefing on the aircraft to the Indian Navy. In 2018, reports indicated that the Indian Air Force had shown interest in procuring 126 F-35A variants and requested a classified briefing. However, the Indian Air Force Chief of Staff at the time denied any formal request had been made. Although discussions have taken place, India has not formally begun the process of acquiring the F-35, and its current focus remains on upgrading its domestic fighter fleet. The U.S. Congressional Research Service estimates that India is expected to spend over $200 billion in the next decade on military modernization, further shaping potential discussions around the F-35. Additionally, as reported by Army Recognition on January 6, 2025, the United States recently approved India's participation in the co-production of Stryker armored fighting vehicles, making it the first foreign country authorized to manufacture this armored vehicle.

US Air Force Begins Initial Operational Tests and Evaluations of MH-139A Grey Wolf Helicopter	The 550th Helicopter Squadron at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana has reached a crucial milestone in integrating the MH-139A Grey Wolf into the U.S. Air Force's nuclear security operations. The squadron's recent participation in the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) phase marks a significant achievement for both the aircraft and the operational requirements of the 341st Missile Squadron. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The IOT&amp;E phase, which began with test flights on January 28, 2025, is designed to rigorously assess the MH-139A's ability to operate effectively in real-world, high-stakes environments. (Picture source: US DoD) The IOT&amp;E phase, which began with test flights on January 28, 2025, is designed to rigorously assess the MH-139A's ability to operate effectively in real-world, high-stakes environments. This process is mandated by Congress to confirm the operational suitability of the aircraft and its ability to replace the aging UH-1N Huey helicopters. The ultimate goal of these tests is to ensure that the Grey Wolf can accomplish a wide range of missions, including those related to U.S. Air Force nuclear security, without any degradation in its capabilities. Three key flight tests were conducted during the week of January 27, 2025. One test focused on the MH-139A's ability to support a convoy, a critical mission to ensure safe transport and operations in potentially hostile environments. The aircraft's communication systems were tested, as well as its support capabilities in coordination with the convoy's ground operations. The other two tests were aimed at evaluating emergency response capabilities, particularly for launch facility recapture and recovery missions. These scenarios required the MH-139A to react quickly to a simulated threat, mimicking the rapid escalation of a nuclear security incident. The aircraft was assessed on its response times, its ability to get airborne quickly, and its capability to carry a full tactical response loadout, complete with its own weapons. The MH-139A's performance during these tests is being analyzed to determine whether it can seamlessly take over the UH-1N Huey’s nuclear security mission. This transition is crucial, as the Huey, which has served for decades in various missions, is reaching the end of its lifecycle. The IOT&amp;E phase ensures that the MH-139A meets the mission's performance requirements, including its ability to survive and perform effectively in demanding conditions. Once the IOT&amp;E phase is complete, the results will be compiled into a report that will be shared with the 550th Helicopter Squadron and the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). These results will serve as the basis for the formal transition of the nuclear security mission to the MH-139A, allowing the retirement of the UH-1N Huey from Malmstrom Air Force Base. This transition to the MH-139A Grey Wolf is a crucial step in modernizing the U.S. Air Force's nuclear security fleet. The enhanced capabilities of this aircraft are expected to significantly improve operational readiness, ensuring that the U.S. Air Force is equipped to protect its nuclear deterrence infrastructure for many years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-air-force-begins-initial-operational-tests-and-evaluations-of-mh-139a-grey-wolf-helicopter	2025-02-14T00:01:47-08:00	
Analysis | Could China’s future Type 004 replace the USS Gerald R. Ford as the world’s most powerful aircraft carrier?	As reported by Rupprecht Deino on February 13, 2025, China is likely progressing with the development of its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the Type 004, as multiple reports and satellite imagery suggest early-stage construction activity at the Dalian shipyard. In early 2024, test sections of the C3 and C4 catapults were observed near the Dalian No. 2 Factory Dock, where the aircraft carrier Shandong was built. These structures are identical to the test section of the Hudong 076 catapult, first identified at the end of 2022. A J-15 mock-up was also reported at the site, reinforcing the possibility that these are the first verified Type 004 modules.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Type 004 nuclear aircraft carrier is expected to carry between 70 and 100 aircraft, including fixed-wing fighters, airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). (CG picture source: 大包CG/Weibo) More precisely, satellite imagery suggests a potential carrier module for the Type 004 has been seen at the Xianglujiao drydock in Dalian, a site used for maintaining the Liaoning and Shandong carriers. Some analysts identify the observed module as a port foredeck segment featuring grooves for catapults, noting that while the twin catapults on the starboard side are parallel, these grooves are crossed. Others suggest it is a test module rather than an indication of full-scale construction. Imagery from May 2024 has led to assessments that work on the Type 004 is progressing, though the exact stage remains uncertain. China’s Type 004 is projected to be the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and potentially the heaviest warship ever made. The vessel is estimated to have a displacement between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes, making it the world's largest aircraft carrier and the largest warship ever constructed, surpassing the USS Gerald R. Ford, which has a full-load displacement of approximately 100,000 tonnes. The Type 004, estimated at 330+ meters in length and 83 meters in width, would be similar in length but slightly wider than the USS Gerald R. Ford, which measures 333 meters in length and 78 meters in width. The Type 004 is also expected to utilize nuclear marine propulsion, developed under Project Longwei at the Nuclear Power Institute of China (NPIC), providing an extended operational range limited only by crew supplies and maintenance requirements, while the Ford-class requires mid-life refueling after approximately 25 years. The expected speed exceeds 30 knots, comparable to the Gerald R. Ford but surpassing the French Charles de Gaulle. The nuclear reactor for the Type 004 is reportedly being developed under Project Longwei at NPIC in Mucheng. Reports indicate that a land-based prototype reactor has been constructed, with satellite imagery confirming its location at NPIC’s Site No. 1, also referred to as Base 909. Procurement documents from China’s 701 Institute, responsible for aircraft carrier development, identify the reactor as designed for installation on a large surface warship. While technical specifications remain undisclosed, the reactor is expected to support integrated electric propulsion, enabling electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) and other high-energy systems, such as advanced radar and electronic warfare equipment. The reactor’s development aligns with China’s broader efforts to establish independent nuclear propulsion capabilities, with potential applications for future nuclear-powered surface vessels. Reports also indicate China has developed a land-based prototype nuclear reactor intended for naval propulsion. Analysis by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, based on satellite imagery and Chinese government documents, confirms the presence of this reactor at NPIC in Mucheng. The project, referred to as Project Longwei, includes procurement documents from China’s 701 Institute stating that reactor equipment was acquired for installation on a large surface warship. These findings suggest China is working toward nuclear propulsion for aircraft carriers, with the Type 004 program potentially providing technical experience for future nuclear-powered surface combatants, including cruisers and destroyers. The carrier’s design is reported to incorporate an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), enabling the launch of heavier aircraft with greater efficiency compared to steam catapults. In comparison, the USS Ford-class has four EMALS catapults with a maximum sortie rate of 270 per day. The Type 004's arresting wire system will support Catapult-Assisted Take-Off, Barrier-Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) operations. Observations from satellite imagery suggest the vessel’s deck configuration includes twin catapults on the starboard side, while an angled deck layout will facilitate simultaneous aircraft launch and recovery. The internal hangar deck is expected to accommodate a larger number of aircraft for storage and maintenance. China’s Type 004 is estimated to have a displacement between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes, surpassing the USS Gerald R. Ford, which has a full-load displacement of approximately 100,000 tonnes. (Picture source: US Navy) The Type 004 is anticipated to surpass the Ford-class, which carries approximately 75 aircraft, as the Chinese carrier is expected to carry between 70 and 100 aircraft, including fixed-wing fighters, airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The J-15T, a catapult-capable version of the J-15, is expected to operate alongside the J-35, a stealth aircraft under development. Some reports suggest the carrier could also host a new aircraft model, possibly designated as the J-50. The Xian KJ-600 is expected to provide AEW&amp;C capabilities similar to the U.S. E-2 Hawkeye. ASW operations will likely be supported by Z-20F (or newer Z-20J) and Z-18F helicopters, while UAVs may be included for reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and refueling missions, potentially similar to the U.S. MQ-25 Stingray. The Type 004’s expected defensive systems include close-in weapon systems (CIWS), such as the Type 1130, for countering incoming threats. It may also be equipped with surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, potentially including the HQ-10 short-range air defense system. Electronic warfare suites and decoy launchers could be integrated to improve survivability. Reports suggest the possible inclusion of directed-energy weapons such as railguns or laser-based systems, though no confirmation of these systems has been provided. The construction of Type 004 is reportedly taking place at the Dalian Shipyard, with carrier modules observed at the Xianglujiao drydock. Reports indicate that prototype testing of the nuclear propulsion system has been underway at NPIC, with estimates suggesting the reactor could be prepared for integration with the Type 004 carrier before its projected launch. The construction timeline remains unconfirmed, but estimates suggest module assembly and hull construction could occur between 2024 and 2025, followed by launch and fitting-out from 2026 to 2028. Commissioning into service could take place between 2030 and 2032. China’s aircraft carrier program has progressed from acquiring and studying foreign carriers to developing its own designs. In 1985, China purchased the decommissioned HMAS Melbourne from Australia, using its steam catapult and landing system for research. During the 1990s and early 2000s, China acquired former Soviet carriers, including the Minsk, Kiev, and Varyag, with the latter undergoing modifications before being commissioned as the Liaoning (Type 001) in 2012, becoming China’s first operational carrier. The Shandong (Type 002), launched in 2017 and commissioned in 2019, was the first domestically built carrier, featuring a ski-jump launch system similar to Liaoning. The Fujian (Type 003), launched in 2022, introduced electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) but remained conventionally powered, requiring refueling for extended operations. The Type 004’s nuclear propulsion would allow for longer operational endurance without the need for such refueling stops. The development of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier would significantly enhance the Chinese Navy's ability to maintain naval operations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Nuclear propulsion offers virtually unlimited range and endurance, allowing the carrier to operate far from Chinese shores without frequent refueling. This capability enables sustained power projection, extended deployments at greater distances, and rapid response to emerging situations worldwide. Additionally, nuclear-powered carriers generate substantial electrical power, supporting advanced systems such as electromagnetic catapults, which increase sortie rates and allow for the deployment of heavier and more diverse aircraft. This advancement would place China among the few nations—currently only the United States and France—possessing such high-end naval assets. However, the U.S. Navy, which operates 11 nuclear-powered carriers, maintains a significant operational advantage due to its global logistics network and decades of carrier operations experience. If successfully developed, Type 004 would represent China’s first attempt to integrate this capability into its fleet.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/analysis-could-chinas-future-type-004-replace-the-uss-gerald-r-ford-as-the-worlds-most-powerful-aircraft-carrier	2025-02-13T12:14:16-08:00

In a separate $899.6 million contract, Northrop Grumman will provide IBCS as the central command and control system for Poland’s WISŁA medium-range and NAREW short-range air defense programs. This agreement marks a major milestone in Poland’s long-term military modernization strategy, aligning its air defense network with NATO and U.S. forces for seamless coordination in joint operations. The Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) is revolutionizing air and missile defense by integrating sensors and weapons into a single network, enabling commanders to make faster and more informed decisions in real time. In 2024, Northrop Grumman delivered the first full set of major IBCS components to the U.S. Army, facilitating early deployment. A series of successful flight tests demonstrated the system’s ability to integrate emerging sensors and effectors, including the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), Patriot Advanced Capability–3 (PAC-3), and Integrated Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2). Further proving its capabilities, IBCS successfully integrated with the U.S. Army’s Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) system during a flight test at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, in December 2024. The system detected, tracked, and engaged multiple surrogate aerial threats, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a cruise missile, reinforcing its ability to provide a multi-layered defense solution. Poland’s investment in IBCS comes as part of a broader expansion of its air defense capabilities over the past five years, particularly in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine. In 2018, Poland initiated its Wisła program, securing two Patriot Configuration 3+ batteries equipped with PAC-3 MSE missiles, which were delivered between 2022 and 2023. In September 2023, Poland expanded the Wisła program, signing contracts worth $9.3 billion for an additional six Patriot batteries, with deliveries expected between 2026 and 2029. In addition to the Patriot system, Poland has also enhanced its short-range air defense capabilities through its NAREW and PILICA+ programs. In April 2023, Poland signed a £1.9 billion contract with MBDA to procure Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMM) and iLaunchers for the PILICA+ system, marking NATO’s largest European short-range air defense acquisition. Further strengthening its air defense infrastructure, Poland signed a $1.23 billion contract in August 2024 with Raytheon Polska and PGZ Huta Stalowa Wola to produce 48 M903 Patriot launchers domestically, reinforcing its commitment to self-sufficiency in military production. The war in Ukraine has accelerated Poland’s air defense modernization efforts, leading to a substantial increase in defense spending, now estimated at 4% of the country’s GDP. This investment underscores Poland’s commitment to protecting its airspace and strengthening NATO’s eastern flank against potential threats. With the integration of IBCS, Poland is taking a decisive step toward creating one of the world’s most advanced air defense networks, fully interoperable with the United States and NATO allies. These latest contracts highlight Northrop Grumman’s pivotal role in advancing global security through cutting-edge battle management technology. By securing these agreements, Poland ensures its military remains at the forefront of modern air defense, while the United States strengthens its strategic partnerships in Europe, reinforcing collective defense efforts against emerging threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-and-poland-enhance-their-air-defense-capabilities-with-new-us-combat-management-system	2025-02-13T05:15:28-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) The country is currently in the third phase of its modernization initiative, called 'Horizons,' which has allocated $35 billion for upgrading its defense capabilities over the next decade. These improvements are considered essential for protecting the territorial integrity of the Philippines, particularly due to its archipelagic geography, which presents unique defense challenges. In a recent speech before leading business figures, General Romeo Brawner, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, emphasized the importance of acquiring submarines. 'It’s a dream for us to get at least two submarines,' Brawner said. 'We are an archipelago. Therefore, we need this kind of capability because it is really difficult to defend the entire archipelago without submarines.' The Philippines' acquisition of defense technologies from India has already begun with the purchase of a BrahMos missile system worth $375 million in 2022. The government has confirmed additional orders for this advanced weapon system, which is expected to be delivered in the coming years. 'We are receiving more of this system this year, and in the years to come,' Brawner added. To further strengthen its defense infrastructure, the Philippines is also acquiring medium-range missiles and at least 40 fighter jets to improve its air and missile defense capabilities. Additionally, the country is expected to receive two corvettes from South Korea this year, further bolstering its naval assets. The strengthening of ties between South Korea and the Philippines is marked by the elevation of their bilateral relations to a strategic partnership last year. Brawner also indicated that the Philippines is working to include South Korea in the Quad, a strategic multilateral group composed of Australia, Japan, the United States, and the Philippines. This initiative reflects the emphasis on regional security cooperation in response to rising tensions with China, particularly in the South China Sea. The Philippines has noted a concerning increase in actions that the country describes as 'illegal, coercive, and deceptive' by China in the South China Sea. According to Brawner, the number of Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea, which refers to waters within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, has significantly increased. From 190 Chinese ships in 2021, the Philippines is now observing a daily average of 286 ships in its maritime zone. As the Philippines continues to bolster its defense capabilities, the situation in the South China Sea remains a central point. The ongoing military buildup aims to ensure that the Philippines can effectively protect its territorial waters and respond to regional security challenges in the face of China’s increasingly assertive actions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/philippines-seeks-to-expand-its-maritime-capabilities-with-acquisition-of-two-submarines	2025-02-13T02:08:00-08:00
