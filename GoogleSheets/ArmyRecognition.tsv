(Picture source: JMSDF) Japan’s recent investment in new Landing Craft Utility (LCU) vessels reflects a strategic push to meet a pressing need for enhanced transport capabilities to remote, strategically significant islands in the East China Sea, where traditional logistics have struggled. Japan’s southwestern islands, part of the Ryukyu Archipelago, represent critical territory where geopolitical tension is increasing, especially with nearby activities in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. These areas are at the forefront of Japan's defense priorities, which has led to a focus on efficient logistical and operational support, especially for rapid troop deployment and resupply efforts. Japan’s defense strategy has shifted to address not just traditional territorial security but also swift, coordinated responses to new-age challenges, such as rapid military mobilization and humanitarian assistance. The updated LCUs are expected to improve interoperability with allied forces, particularly the United States, facilitating joint operations in areas requiring amphibious capabilities. For example, recent drills demonstrated how Japan’s amphibious assets could work in tandem with U.S. assets, such as Marine Corps transport vehicles, to carry out complex logistics and tactical operations in the Indo-Pacific​. Beyond military transport, these new LCUs support Japan's emphasis on humanitarian and disaster relief readiness. Japan’s location makes it susceptible to natural disasters, and the ability to rapidly deploy aid and personnel to affected areas across its island chains is increasingly essential. The old fleet’s limitations in cargo capacity and range often meant slower responses or insufficient logistical reach, underscoring the need for modern, versatile ships. A Landing Craft Utility (LCU) is an amphibious vessel designed to transport troops, vehicles, and equipment directly from ship to shore, playing a crucial role in operations where traditional ports are unavailable or in contested areas. With a flat-bottomed design, LCUs are built for beach landings and feature a large, open cargo area equipped with a front ramp to facilitate quick unloading of vehicles and personnel. Capable of carrying significant loads, LCUs transport everything from troops to heavy equipment like tanks and trucks, making them indispensable in amphibious assault and logistics missions. Although not the fastest vessels, their steady range and durability allow them to operate continuously between ships and shorelines, ensuring a reliable flow of resources. In addition to combat scenarios, LCUs are versatile assets used in humanitarian missions and disaster relief, delivering aid and emergency teams to areas with limited infrastructure. Often deployed alongside larger amphibious ships, such as Landing Platform Docks (LPDs) and Landing Helicopter Docks (LHDs), LCUs are integral to naval fleets for their ability to rapidly support large-scale landing operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/lcu-nihonbare-joins-japans-defense-fleet-in-naikai-shipbuilding-launch	2024-10-30T06:48:16-07:00	
China Draws Inspiration from Russian War Tactics in Ukraine via Belarus	The People’s Republic of China (PRC) has shown growing interest in the military strategies implemented by Russian forces in Ukraine, observing these developments through a unique intermediary: the Belarusian armed forces. In October, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) highlighted the ongoing military cooperation between China and Belarus, suggesting that Beijing may be examining operational lessons learned by the Belarusian army in connection with the conflict in Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This growing partnership shows China, like other Central Asian nations, seeking to leverage Belarusian expertise in essential hybrid warfare tactics, such as drone use, trench clearing, and urban assaults (Picture source: China Military) According to Major General Vadim Denisenko, Commander of Belarusian Special Operations Forces, China has recently increased its military exchanges with Belarus.

In March 2017, Bangladesh initiated a tender for eight new multi-role combat aircraft, with an option for four additional units, to strengthen national air defense. The Rafale has been competing against the Eurofighter Typhoon for this contract, valued at nearly €2.5 billion. Prime Minister Yunus's administration appears more receptive to the French offer, potentially influenced by French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Dhaka in September 2023, the first by a French head of state in 33 years. Although no official response was given during this visit, France’s interest in this strategic market remains strong. In this competitive context, defense suppliers are highlighting their products' strengths while addressing perceived weaknesses in competitors' offerings. One argument raised against the Rafale is its presence within the Indian military, raising concerns in Bangladesh about reliance on the same suppliers as its neighboring country. Some contend that using the same fighter as India could put Bangladesh at a tactical disadvantage in potential conflicts, as India has a detailed understanding of Rafale's capabilities and limitations. BAF’s specifications for new combat aircraft are particularly stringent. Requirements include twin engines with a minimum dry thrust of 5,500 kg and over 8,000 kg with afterburner, at least eight hardpoints, and a payload capacity of at least 5,000 kg. Avionics must feature electronically scanned array radar with a range of 150 km for air-to-air missions and 50 km for air-to-ground. An integrated electronic warfare suite, infrared search and track system with a 50 km range, helmet-mounted display, and modern glass cockpit are also mandatory. The envisioned contract would encompass maintenance, training, and a set of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, with deliveries in two phases: an initial batch of four jets, followed by another within 18-24 months. Despite no official confirmation, Bangladesh's interest in 'Western' defense equipment is longstanding. The country previously considered acquiring helicopters from Bell Helicopter but later withdrew. Under its 'Force Goal 2030' program, BAF was also approached by Airbus Defence for the Eurofighter Typhoon, although Rafale remained a favored candidate. In 2021, Russia offered a batch of Mikoyan MiG-35 fighters, which Bangladesh quickly declined, signaling a gradual move away from Russian aerospace offerings.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/france-in-pursuit-of-a-strategic-agreement-to-sell-rafale-fighters-to-bangladesh	2024-10-30T04:13:18-07:00

South Korea Warns of Looming North Korean Nuclear Test Before US Election	On October 30, 2024, South Korea’s Ministry of Defense informed lawmakers that North Korea appears ready for a seventh nuclear test and an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch, potentially timed with the U.S. presidential election on November 5. Intelligence obtained during a confidential briefing indicates that North Korea has completed preparations for a nuclear test at its Punggye-ri site, with specific equipment and launch units in place, likely for an ICBM launch designed to demonstrate atmospheric reentry capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target (Picture source: KCNA) The session, conducted by representatives of South Korean military intelligence, also revealed signs of North Korean troops mobilized in Russia. Some units are reported to have joined the frontlines in the Kursk region, where Russian forces face Ukrainian counteroffensives. This deployment, observers note, underscores the strengthened strategic alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow amidst the ongoing Ukraine conflict, a factor North Korea appears to be leveraging to intensify its military activities. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been ramping up displays of power in recent months, accelerating missile tests and revealing a secret military-grade uranium production facility in September. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korea has deployed a mobile launcher, likely a 12-axle model recently shown in state media, for an ICBM launch potentially reaching U.S. territory. This move aligns with warnings from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that Pyongyang may orchestrate significant military provocations around U.S. elections to pressure Washington and its allies. The ICBM, possibly a Hwasong-18 or similar, would test the durability of reentry technology, crucial for ensuring the warhead survives extreme heat and friction en route to its target. While previous North Korean ICBM tests were conducted at steep angles to minimize distance and avoid neighboring territories, analysts suggest that a more standard trajectory would represent a major advancement in North Korea’s missile program. Such a test would confirm North Korea’s capability to target distant locations, including the U.S. mainland. The escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula since 2022, particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programs under reduced international scrutiny. In this context, recent reports from South Korean authorities leave little doubt regarding Kim Jong Un’s intentions to continue developing weapons of mass destruction while strengthening alliances with powers outside the Western sphere, such as Russia. For decades, North Korea has pursued nuclear capabilities to bolster its deterrence against perceived threats. Relying on asymmetric armament strategies to offset the limitations of its conventional forces, Pyongyang has made significant progress in nuclear warhead miniaturization and ICBM development, such as the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 models. These capabilities position North Korea as a nuclear power capable of targeting the U.S., thereby increasing geopolitical pressure on the United States and its allies. As North Korea strategically positions itself, the U.S. and its regional allies continue to closely monitor these preparations to anticipate any potential threat. The possibility of a nuclear test and an ICBM launch around the U.S. election period introduces an air of uncertainty, underscoring the importance of maintaining international vigilance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-warns-of-looming-north-korean-nuclear-test-before-us-election	2024-10-30T03:23:55-07:00

(Picture source: German MoD) This rollout is part of a larger modernization plan for the German tank fleet. Since 2017, the Bundeswehr has been upgrading its Leopard 2 tanks to the A7 standard. By 2025, the Leopard 2A8 model is expected to be delivered, incorporating more advanced systems, including a lighter version of Trophy with enhanced capabilities. The Leopard 2A7A1 will serve as an interim solution until the A8 becomes operational, by a German tank company, which is expected to be deployed to Lithuania as part of NATO's forward presence. The German government contracted KNDS Deutschland in February 2021 to produce and deliver 17 Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and an experimental prototype. Simultaneously, a government agreement with Israel was signed for the supply of Trophy kits, ammunition, special tools, and training. The total budget for this project is €120 million, with costs shared between KNDS and Israel. The new Leopard 2A7A1 tanks are scheduled to be fully delivered by 2025, after which they will enter active service in the German military. Once operational, the A8 tanks will also be equipped with Trophy and are expected to be deployed in Lithuania as part of Germany’s military presence in the region. The Leopard 2A7A1 with Trophy has external features such as radar antennas and launcher platforms, and internally, it is equipped with a control unit and power supply integrated into the turret and chassis. The 2A7A1 is fitted with a Rheinmetall 120mm/L55A1 cannon, designed for compatibility with a variety of munitions, including high-explosive rounds. It incorporates Hensoldt’s PERI R17 A3 thermal imaging sight, which enables target tracking in different environments. The tank also features a new communication system, a 20 kW auxiliary power unit (APU), and Ultracaps for stabilizing the power supply. Weighing 70 tons, it retains its mobility through adjustments to its transmission and an upgraded engine cooling system. The Trophy Active Protection System enhances defense against anti-tank threats. The Trophy Active Protection System (APS), developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is a vehicle-mounted defense system designed to protect against various anti-tank threats, including rockets and guided missiles. Operational in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since 2011, it uses multiple radar panels to detect incoming projectiles and neutralizes them by firing countermeasures, intercepting the threat before it reaches the vehicle. This system has been integrated into key Israeli platforms, such as the Merkava tank and Namer APC, and has attracted significant interest from other countries, including the U.S., which has equipped the M1 Abrams with Trophy, and Germany, which has fitted it to the Leopard 2. Despite successful interception, passive armor remains necessary, as fragments of neutralized projectiles may still impact the tank. Each launcher provides more than 180 degrees of coverage, ensuring 360-degree protection. The system operates autonomously, with the tank commander controlling only whether it is active or not. The Trophy's combat-proven capabilities have demonstrated a high interception rate, especially during operations involving the Israeli Defense Forces. It has also been successfully tested by European armies. In addition to protection, the system provides situational awareness through its Fire Source Location (FSL) capability, allowing vehicles to locate and respond to enemy fire effectively. As of 2023, the system has been fielded on more than 1,000 vehicles worldwide, underscoring its role as a critical component in modern armored warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-equips-leopard-2a7a1-tank-with-trophy-aps-to-enhance-protection-against-missiles	2024-10-30T03:09:57-07:00

Military doctors conducted emergency procedures and life-support drills. Piracy Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters has seen fluctuating trends in 2024, marked by a resurgence of high-severity incidents. Despite a global decrease in piracy rates, piracy remains persistent in this region, largely due to geopolitical instability and economic incentives for Somali pirate groups. Notably, Somali pirates have recently resumed hijackings, employing fishing vessels as 'mother ships' to launch skiff-based attacks on passing merchant ships, especially those less protected by armed security or defensive measures. Pirate tactics in the Gulf of Aden often include kidnapping crews for ransom, with recent months witnessing heightened violence against captured individuals. While many attacks are thwarted by security teams and vessel hardening measures, pirates continue to exploit vessels lacking rigorous defenses. Reports highlight cases where pirates intercept vessels using false distress calls or approach vessels under the guise of local fishermen, increasing the risk of misunderstandings and violence. The ongoing regional conflict, particularly involving Houthi attacks and Iranian-backed groups, has also destabilized the Gulf of Aden, further threatening commercial shipping. The recent uptick in anti-ship missile and drone attacks, some targeting vessels linked to Western interests, underscores the rising regional complexity. Consequently, international naval task forces such as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s Operation Aspides have expanded their protective scope to secure critical shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/chinese-navy-conducts-advanced-anti-piracy-drills-in-gulf-of-aden	2024-10-30T02:54:08-07:00

Israel has focused its efforts on undermining Hezbollah’s military infrastructure, while Hezbollah’s material resources, including advanced missiles and drones, underscore the group's resilient military stance despite substantial setbacks.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link IDF soldiers discovered a cache of weapons, including grenade launchers, shoulder-fired missiles, RPGs, combat vests, Kornet missiles, and other arms, inside a mosque located within a civilian neighborhood in southern Lebanon. (Picture source: Israel Defense Forces) Israel’s campaign has demonstrated formidable air power, relying heavily on precision-guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and advanced electronic warfare capabilities. The Israeli Air Force, with its fleet of F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters, has executed deep-penetration missions into Lebanese and Syrian territories, targeting Hezbollah's command centers and high-ranking leadership. Israel’s networked command and control systems facilitate coordinated strikes that are highly precise and capable of minimizing collateral damage, thus reinforcing its tactical upper hand. These air operations are supplemented by ground forces equipped with guided missiles and precision artillery, making Israeli forces exceptionally lethal in limited cross-border incursions. Israel's electronic warfare units have also disrupted Hezbollah's communications and tracking capabilities, a critical part of their strategy to undermine the group's command structure. Coupled with sophisticated intelligence operations, Israel’s ability to penetrate Hezbollah's defenses has been effective, targeting major figures within the organization, including the group's long-standing leader, Hassan Nasrallah. This intelligence-driven approach not only weakened Hezbollah’s operational structure but also underscored Israel’s mastery in cyber and signals intelligence, allowing it to predict and intercept Hezbollah’s strategic moves. Despite these losses, Hezbollah retains significant military material and resources, sourced primarily through its longstanding alliance with Iran. Precision-guided missiles, drones, and anti-tank weapons form the backbone of Hezbollah’s arsenal, enabling it to mount a sustained resistance and keep up the pressure on Israeli targets. Iran’s advanced weaponry, including Fateh-110 and Zolfaghar missiles, provides Hezbollah with extended reach, posing a direct threat to Israel's population centers. Hezbollah’s anti-tank guided missiles, such as the Kornet, are equally effective, capable of penetrating Israeli armor and challenging any ground incursion attempts by Israel. Hezbollah’s underground tunnel network across southern Lebanon is another critical asset, providing the group with a unique advantage in both defense and offense. These tunnels facilitate the safe movement of munitions and personnel while allowing Hezbollah to execute surprise attacks from fortified positions. Despite Israel’s efforts to locate and destroy segments of this network, Hezbollah’s tunnels remain extensive and resilient, presenting a substantial obstacle for Israeli forces and making ground operations increasingly complex. The involvement of the United States adds a layer of international support for Israel, both materially and diplomatically. The U.S. has invested heavily in Israel’s defense, providing funding for the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow missile defense systems, which are crucial in intercepting Hezbollah’s rockets. The advanced military cooperation between the U.S. and Israel extends to intelligence-sharing, bolstering Israel’s capability to detect and neutralize Hezbollah’s attempts to expand its material capacities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/inside-israels-precision-strikes-and-hezbollahs-missile-arsenal-in-lebanon-conflict	2024-10-29T07:53:33-07:00

Pentagon Faces Shortage of Air-Defense Missiles Amid Rising Demand	The United States is experiencing a reduction in its stockpile of air-defense missiles, raising concerns about the Pentagon's readiness to respond to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, as well as potential conflicts in the Pacific. These concerns, highlighted in a recent The Wall Street Journal article on October 29, 2024, focus on interceptors that are essential for countering missile and drone threats in the region. Demand for these munitions has surged as U.S. allies, notably Israel, confront escalating attacks orchestrated by Iran and affiliated militias. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An SM-3 Block 1B interceptor is launched from the USS Lake Erie during an MDA test (Picture source: US DoD) Since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, the United States has deployed over 100 Standard Missiles—interceptors typically launched from ships, crucial for countering Iranian threats and Houthi attacks on Western ships in the Red Sea. This rapid consumption, further accelerated by recent Israeli strikes against Iran, has heightened concerns about the U.S.'s ability to meet growing demands for these munitions, particularly should a conflict arise in the Pacific. The term Standard Missile in this context refers to a series of air-defense missiles developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies) for the U.S. Navy, including models such as the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), Standard Missile-3 (SM-3), and Standard Missile-6 (SM-6). These ship-launched missiles are critical for countering a variety of threats, from ballistic missiles to cruise missiles and aircraft, and are integrated into naval defense systems to protect U.S. forces and allies like Israel. The SM-2 primarily serves medium-range anti-aircraft defense, while the SM-3 and SM-6 add extended capabilities for intercepting ballistic and cruise missiles. The SM-2 is designed for medium-range air defense, capable of intercepting aircraft and cruise missiles within a range of approximately 170 kilometers at speeds of up to Mach 3. The SM-3, with greater range, is intended to neutralize ballistic missiles during their exo-atmospheric phase with a kinetic warhead, reaching targets up to 500 kilometers away. The SM-6 combines both anti-aircraft and anti-missile functions with a range of around 240 kilometers, excelling at intercepting low-altitude cruise missiles and high-speed aerial threats with multi-mode guidance. Pentagon officials, while keeping stockpile data classified to prevent strategic leverage by Iran and its allies, have acknowledged heightened pressure on resources. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh indicated that the Department of Defense is adjusting its posture to protect U.S. forces and support Israel, while maintaining focus on readiness and stockpiles. The high rate of interceptor use by the Pentagon raises challenges for responding to unexpected demands in both the Middle East and Europe. Additional concerns involve the responsiveness of the defense industry, which is often constrained by the need to expand production lines, facilities, and qualified personnel. Elias Yousif, Deputy Director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, noted that the U.S. has not developed a defense industrial base suited to prolonged attritional conflict, which complicates the current situation. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has advocated for increased production of Standard Missiles, though he acknowledged the challenges associated with producing such sophisticated munitions. The Pentagon is exploring alternative solutions, including soliciting new companies to help boost production of air-defense missiles. Despite recent stockpile increases, the launch rate observed in recent months has exceeded production capacity, according to defense analysts and officials. RTX, the manufacturer of Standard Missiles, produces a few hundred annually, though these munitions are also supplied to over 14 U.S. allies, limiting availability for the Pentagon. RTX spokesperson Chris Johnson stated that the company closely collaborates with the Department of Defense to meet production needs. Since the onset of the Hamas-Israel conflict last year, U.S. ships have launched over $1.8 billion in interceptors to protect Israel and ships passing through the Red Sea from Iranian threats. On average, two interceptors are launched per incoming missile to ensure accuracy, resulting in high costs to counter less sophisticated targets, such as Houthi drones. A congressional official noted that while costly, these munitions take months to replace. Last month, the U.S. deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to Israel, allowing the use of other types of interceptors in addition to Standard Missiles. The Pentagon also repositioned Patriot missile defense systems in the region, though their availability remains limited due to commitments in Ukraine. While the Pentagon aims to maintain current Standard Missile production levels, it may reduce production of older variants to fund newer models. The pace of interceptor use in the Middle East, however, could jeopardize U.S. readiness for a Pacific conflict. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery emphasized that the current use of Standard Missiles risks compromising the Navy’s preparedness for Pacific operations, underscoring the strategic impact of prolonged Middle Eastern engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/pentagon-faces-shortage-of-air-defense-missiles-amid-rising-demand	2024-10-29T07:07:52-07:00	
France's Navy enters Taiwan Strait Following US and Canadian Warships	According to information published by Yahoo on October 29, 2024, following the United States and Canada, France has now sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait amid heightened cross-strait tensions. This move by France comes shortly after China’s recent military exercises in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Navy's Floreal class frigate during exercise with Japanese Mogami-class frigate JS Noshiro. (Picture source: JMSDF) On October 20, the U.S. Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins and the Royal Canadian Navy’s Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver passed through the strait. According to The Mirror Media, the French Navy’s Floréal-class frigate Prairial (F731) sailed through the strait, moving from south to north. This transit aligns with the vessel’s recent regional activity, following its goodwill visit to Cebu from October 22 to 25. French military presence within the first island chain is quite frequent. Earlier this year, between April and May, the French Navy’s frigate Vendémiaire (F734) and Bretagne (D655) also conducted visits to the Philippines. Recent typhoon activity, including Typhoon Typhoon Saola and Typhoon Kanun, likely influenced Prairial’s timing to ensure safe and controlled navigation. France’s approach differs from the United States, as the French Navy typically refrains from issuing overt political statements during such transits. While the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) often dispatches ships to shadow foreign vessels in the region, it generally refrains from public commentary unless prompted by any perceived provocations. French Navy France’s stance on Taiwan and China is centered on maintaining freedom of navigation and supporting a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing non-confrontational yet assertive actions. As the only EU country with territories in the Indo-Pacific, France considers itself an Indo-Pacific power with obligations to uphold international laws in areas like the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. This commitment is driven by concerns over China's aggressive actions, such as military drills and territorial claims that disregard international rulings. In practice, the French Navy has regularly conducted freedom of navigation operations, sending vessels like the destroyer Lorraine to the South China Sea and the frigate Prairial through the Taiwan Strait. These moves are positioned as stabilizing efforts rather than provocations. French lawmakers have openly criticized China's actions, noting that Beijing's moves threaten not only regional stability but also global trade security, reinforcing France's resolve to maintain peace and security in the strait through strategic partnerships and multilateral dialogues​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/frances-navy-enters-taiwan-strait-following-us-and-canadian-warships	2024-10-29T06:51:08-07:00

Germany to Develop Next-Gen Taurus Neo Cruise Missile after Ukraine War Lessons	On October 27, 2024, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced an ambitious project to develop an advanced version of the Taurus cruise missile. This project, which involves acquiring 600 units of the new model called the Taurus Neo, comes as Ukraine increasingly calls on Berlin to provide long-range weapons to counter Russian attacks on its territory. The decision to develop the Taurus Neo marks a significant step in modernizing Germany's military capabilities and strengthening its strategic position in a tense geopolitical context. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link MBDA Taurus EX Air-Launched Cruise Missile (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Taurus Neo project aims to enhance the capabilities of the existing Taurus KEPD 350 cruise missile. According to parliamentary sources, the planned developments will include increased range, improved accuracy, and enhanced explosive power. The project's total cost is estimated at approximately €2.1 billion for acquiring 600 missiles, with initial deliveries expected from 2029. To launch the development, an initial funding of €350 million is required starting in 2025, while most of the budget will be allocated after 2029. The technical improvements of the Taurus Neo are expected to include a range exceeding 500 km, enabling it to reach more distant targets with greater accuracy. The guidance system will be modernized, integrating advanced inertial navigation and GPS correction technologies to improve precision on hard-to-reach targets. The missile is also expected to be equipped with a more powerful warhead, designed to penetrate heavily reinforced structures, such as bunkers or underground shelters. Additionally, the Taurus Neo may incorporate technologies to bypass missile defense systems, thus enhancing its ability to evade radars and penetrate enemy air defenses. The decision to launch the Taurus Neo project comes in a context where the war in Ukraine has heightened security concerns in Europe. Since the beginning of the conflict, Russia has intensified its use of cruise missiles to target strategic and civilian infrastructure, underscoring Ukraine's need for similar retaliatory capabilities. In response, the United Kingdom and France have already provided Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, which Ukrainian forces have adapted for use on Soviet-made aircraft. These missiles, equipped with sophisticated guidance systems combining GPS, inertial navigation, and infrared imaging (IIR), are mainly used to strike heavily defended targets like ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical hubs behind Russian lines. The Taurus KEPD 350, with its 500 km range and enhanced penetration capabilities, would offer Ukraine additional capabilities to target critical infrastructure and strategic points in Russia, particularly in Crimea. Unlike the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG missiles, the Taurus is equipped with a dual-stage warhead specifically designed to destroy heavily fortified and deeply buried targets. Currently, the German armed forces have about 600 Taurus KEPD 350 missiles, primarily used from Tornado fighters. Although the missile has also been tested on the Eurofighter EF2000, it is not yet used as a standard launch platform for the Taurus. The upcoming retirement of the Tornado raises questions about the launch platform for the Taurus Neo. The Eurofighter appears to be the most likely option, while integration on the F-35A, recently ordered by Germany, seems unlikely without a complete redesign of the missile to fit the internal bay of the American stealth fighter. In the longer term, Germany could consider integrating the Taurus Neo within the framework of the SCAF (Future Combat Air System) program, a next-generation fighter project developed in collaboration with France, Spain, and Belgium. The SCAF is expected to play a central role in modernizing European air capabilities in the coming decades. The development of the Taurus Neo could have considerable implications for European defense. As a long-range precision weapon, this missile could strengthen Germany's deterrence capabilities while offering additional strategic options for the continent's collective defense. The modernization of the German armed forces is part of a broader effort to respond to new security threats exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and rising tensions with Russia. However, funding for the Taurus Neo project remains a major challenge for the German government. The 2025 budget will need to include the €350 million necessary to launch the development, and expenses in subsequent years could be affected by current budget constraints. Nonetheless, the support expressed by the government coalition suggests a favorable outcome for the project, despite potential debates in Parliament on the appropriateness of prioritizing such expenditures in a challenging economic context. The announcement of the Taurus Neo project comes just two days after the signing of a historic defense agreement between Germany and the United Kingdom aimed at rapidly developing new, more advanced long-range strike weapons than the Storm Shadow. This agreement was followed by the announcement of the UK's membership in the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), an initiative led by France and involving Germany, Poland, and Italy. ELSA aims to develop a missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 km by the 2030s. Although the integration of the Taurus Neo into these programs remains uncertain, the growing interest in long-range strike weapons in Europe reflects an increasing awareness of the need to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities in the face of emerging threats. The Taurus Neo project could therefore fit into a broader dynamic aimed at bolstering collective security on the European continent while positioning Germany as a key player in the development of new defense technologies. The development of advanced cruise missiles, such as the Taurus KEPD 350, represents a critical strategic asset for Western armed forces, particularly in the context of modern conflicts where precision and long-range strike capabilities are crucial. For Ukraine, the use of missiles provided by its allies, such as the Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, has demonstrated the effectiveness of these weapons in striking deep behind enemy lines at strategic targets. These missiles allow for the neutralization of critical military infrastructure, such as ammunition depots, command centers, and logistical nodes, thereby disrupting adversary operations and weakening their support capabilities for frontline forces. The Taurus, with its extended 500 km range and reinforced penetration capability, would offer Ukraine increased ability to target strategic sites in Crimea or Russia, expanding the range and impact of Ukrainian operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-to-develop-next-gen-taurus-neo-cruise-missile-after-ukraine-war-lessons	2024-10-29T04:15:55-07:00

Key improvements to the T-72B3M include an upgraded fire control system, a 1,130 hp V-92S2F engine, and advanced sighting equipment. However, the inclusion of the Arena-M APS marks a particularly notable enhancement, aimed at safeguarding the tank and its crew against an array of anti-tank threats. The Arena-M is a Russian-designed active protection system created to intercept and destroy incoming projectiles, such as anti-tank missiles and rockets, before they reach the tank. The system uses a radar array to detect and track incoming threats within a certain radius around the vehicle. Once a threat is detected, Arena-M calculates its trajectory, allowing the system to deploy countermeasures that neutralize the projectile at a safe distance. The APS is specifically designed to handle threats from multiple directions, enhancing protection against high-speed projectiles fired from modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) or rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). This added layer of defense significantly reduces the likelihood of armor penetration, thus improving the survivability of the T-72B3M on the battlefield. Russia’s choice to integrate the Arena-M system into the T-72B3M rather than reserving it exclusively for newer tanks like the T-90M and T-14 Armata underscores the continued relevance of the T-72 in modern warfare. With over 25,000 units produced since its inception in the 1970s, the T-72 has seen widespread deployment across various theaters and remains in service with numerous militaries worldwide. Upgrading these tanks with APS technology extends their operational lifespan, making them capable of countering threats posed by the latest anti-tank systems. The T-72B3M’s combination of affordability, ease of maintenance, and robust firepower makes it a versatile asset for large-scale military operations. The addition of the Arena-M APS, with its ability to repel contemporary anti-tank weaponry, ensures that the T-72B3M remains relevant in scenarios that demand both maneuverability and resilience. Russia’s decision to install the Arena-M system on its main battle tanks reflects a growing trend within the global military community toward equipping armored vehicles with active protection systems. As anti-tank weapon technology advances, the need for countermeasures has become increasingly critical. Arena-M’s effectiveness and the expanded protection it provides offer a glimpse into future armored warfare, where active defenses could be as crucial as the armor itself. While the current configuration of the T-72B3M with the Arena-M APS offers substantial protection, experts speculate that future variants could incorporate additional features, including modular reactive armor and more advanced electronic warfare countermeasures. Such enhancements would further augment the tank’s ability to operate in contested environments where electronic and cyber warfare elements are increasingly prevalent.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-equips-t-72b3m-tanks-with-advanced-arena-m-active-protection-system	2024-10-29T02:49:48-07:00	
Algeria reveals acquisition of Russian Iskander-E ballistic missile system	As reported by ORCA Military on October 28, 2024, the Russian Iskander-E short-range ballistic missile system has been seen for the first time in Algeria, ahead of the military parade commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Algerian Revolution. This sighting confirms Algeria’s acquisition of the Iskander after years of speculation and marks the first time this missile system has appeared in the arsenal of an Arab country.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Algeria received four regiments of the Iskander-E between 2014 and 2017, comprising around 50 vehicles and 48 missiles per regiment, including 12 launchers, 12 transporter-loaders, 11 command vehicles, and various support vehicles. (Picture source: FChillali) The Iskander system, developed by Russia, has a range of up to 500 kilometers and can reach speeds of up to Mach 6. It is designed to strike targets such as command centers, air defense systems, and critical infrastructure. The system's mobile design and rapid-launch capability make it difficult to detect or intercept. The Iskander-E variant, in service with Algeria since 2018, is capable of carrying various types of non-nuclear warheads, including high-explosive fragmentation and penetrating warheads. This acquisition enhances Algeria's missile capabilities, adding significant range and versatility to its existing military equipment. Algeria's acquisition of the Iskander system is part of broader efforts to modernize its military forces, especially amid increasing tensions with Morocco. Diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco have been strained since Algeria cut ties in 2021, citing Morocco’s support for separatist movements in Kabylie and its backing of Western Sahara claims. Morocco, meanwhile, has received international backing for its autonomy plan for Western Sahara, further intensifying the rivalry. Both countries have engaged in an arms race, boosting their military capabilities while maintaining a tense but non-violent standoff. The militarization on both sides continues, although a full-scale conflict remains unlikely. In this context, the Iskander system plays a significant role in Algeria's military planning, particularly due to its capacity to target strategic locations in Morocco. The system’s longer range, compared to Morocco’s M142 HIMARS system, allows it to reach targets such as command centers and air defenses. Morocco's HIMARS system, which has a range of up to 300 kilometers using ATACMS missiles, is designed for rapid fire support and precision strikes on fortified positions and troop concentrations. While the HIMARS offers greater battlefield mobility, the Iskander system’s longer range and hypersonic capabilities provide Algeria with a broader set of strategic options. Algeria's defense budget has grown significantly in recent years, reaching $18.3 billion in 2023, largely due to increased revenues from gas exports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This funding has supported the procurement of military equipment, primarily from Russia and China, including the Iskander system. The growing military rivalry with Morocco has also been reflected in Algerian domestic politics, where anti-Moroccan rhetoric is frequently used in election campaigns to gain popular support. Despite occasional calls for dialogue, tensions between Algeria and Morocco remain high, and the ongoing arms buildup indicates that a resolution is unlikely in the near future. The Iskander system’s appearance in the upcoming military parade further signals Algeria’s intent to maintain and demonstrate its military capabilities in response to regional security concerns. As both countries continue to acquire advanced military technology, the potential for future conflict, while not imminent, remains a significant issue. Algeria’s acquisition of the Russian Iskander and Morocco’s procurement of the American HIMARS in 2023 highlights the continuing arms race in North Africa. The Iskander system, with its longer range and ability to strike strategic targets, complements Algeria's defense strategy, while Morocco’s HIMARS provides tactical flexibility on the battlefield. The presence of the Iskander system in Algeria's military forces underscores the ongoing competition for military superiority in the region, as both countries seek to reinforce their positions without engaging in direct conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/algeria-reveals-acquisition-of-russian-iskander-e-ballistic-missile-system	2024-10-29T02:30:19-07:00

The first deliveries are expected between 2026 and 2030, ensuring compatibility with Finland's introduction of the F-35. The Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile - Extended Range (AARGM-ER), AGM-88G, is an advanced air-to-ground missile developed by Northrop Grumman to target and neutralize enemy air defenses. Based on the AGM-88E AARGM model, AARGM-ER features an optimized airframe, a larger rocket motor, and advanced electronics, providing a significantly enhanced range and speed essential for countering modern long-range surface-to-air missile systems. AARGM-ER’s operational profile focuses on neutralizing radar-based threats through an enhanced guidance system. This system combines passive homing sensors to detect radar emissions with an active millimeter-wave radar for terminal guidance, enabling precise targeting even if enemy radars attempt shutdown to avoid detection. This dual guidance capability makes the missile particularly effective against mobile air defense systems, enhancing its ability in Suppression and Destruction of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD/DEAD) missions. Designed to fit within the internal weapons bay of the F-35, the AARGM-ER offers compatibility with multiple platforms, including the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler. This adaptability allows for deployment across U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps fleets. Initial tests began in 2021, demonstrating AARGM-ER’s capability to engage both mobile and stationary targets over long distances. The missile is now in low-rate initial production, with operational fielding expected soon. This decision follows a recent U.S. authorization to sell up to 100 AARGM-ER missiles to the Royal Australian Air Force for its EA-18G Growler aircraft, reflecting growing interest from U.S. allies in this missile system to bolster their capabilities in suppressing enemy air defenses.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/finland-strengthens-f-35-fleet-with-acquisition-of-150-aargm-er-missiles-from-united-states	2024-10-29T02:24:52-07:00	
South Korea Moves Up Deployment of Its Iron Dome in Response to North Korean Threats	South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced on October 29, 2024, that it has approved a plan to advance the deployment schedule of the country's Low Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system by two years, setting its operational timeframe between 2029 and 2033. This decision, disclosed during a National Defense Ministry committee meeting, reflects South Korea’s response to rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula as North Korea intensifies its provocations, compelling Seoul to enhance protection against potential attacks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA (Picture source: Rafael) The LAMD system, launched in 2022 with development expected to continue through 2033, is designed to strengthen South Korea's air defense capabilities against artillery fire and missile threats from the North. Engineered to shield critical areas, particularly the capital Seoul, the LAMD system is anticipated to rival, and potentially surpass, Israel’s Iron Dome, according to DAPA. This system comprises radar, an engagement control center, launchers, and interceptor missiles to mitigate the impact of long-range artillery strikes from North Korea. DAPA has also approved the second phase of upgrades to its Patriot defense system, including the acquisition of the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system. This advanced system employs more agile and precise hit-to-kill interceptors rather than fragmentation warheads, as in previous versions. The PAC-3 system supports up to sixteen missiles per launcher compared to four with PAC-2, offering increased range and improved radar and tracking capabilities. These defense systems will operate alongside existing assets, including Patriot systems and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system provided by the United States, which targets missiles in their terminal phase upon reentry. THAAD’s initial deployment in South Korea in 2017 prompted objections from China due to the system’s powerful radar, capable of monitoring regional military activities. In response, China imposed economic and cultural sanctions, including restrictions on group travel to South Korea, leading former President Moon Jae-in to pledge not to increase THAAD deployments on South Korean soil. Tensions have escalated further with recent provocations from North Korea, including debris-laden balloons launched towards Seoul as retaliation against propaganda balloons sent by South Korean activists. Seoul, located just 55 kilometers from the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and vulnerable to artillery strikes, remains particularly concerned about the thousands of artillery systems stationed by North Korea near the border. In parallel, South Korea is progressing with the development of its Long-range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) system, designed to intercept missiles at altitudes of 50 to 60 kilometers. This component of the Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system integrates with the PAC-3 and Cheongung II, enabling a multi-layered defense against North Korean missile threats. In addition to air defense initiatives, the South Korean government has approved a significant update to the K2 Black Panther main battle tank project. To reduce reliance on foreign equipment, the next 150 K2 tanks for the South Korean army will be outfitted with domestically developed transmissions by SNT Dynamics, alongside locally manufactured engines. This transmission system will also be exported to Turkey for use in the Altay battle tanks. Since the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea has strengthened its position as a major supplier of military equipment, particularly to European nations where defense demand has significantly increased. By consolidating its capabilities and enhancing self-reliance in defense, South Korea aims to establish itself as a prominent player on the international military stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korea-moves-up-deployment-of-its-iron-dome-in-response-to-north-korean-threats	2024-10-29T02:16:55-07:00	
SWATT Training: Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group Advances Warfighting Capabilities	According to information published by the US DoD on October 23, 2024, the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRF CSG) is actively participating in the Surface Warfare Advanced Tactical Training (SWATT), an intense at-sea training program designed to enhance warfighting capabilities and tactical proficiency across multiple domains.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crew members on the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the largest aircraft carrier in the world, perform flight operations while navigating the Atlantic Ocean. (Picture source: DVIDS) Overseen by the Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), SWATT is a critical phase in preparing units for deployment, allowing for integration and real-time tactical development. The Gerald R. Ford CSG consists of a formidable array of assets, including the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81), USS Mitscher (DDG 57), USS Mahan (DDG 72), USS Bainbridge (DDG 96), and USS Forrest Sherman (DDG 98). These vessels are supported by the Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8, which adds a critical aerial dimension to the group's operations. SWATT provides a diverse range of training scenarios, bringing together individual, team, and unit-level exercises designed to sharpen the warfighting capabilities of each component. It also includes integrated in-port, live virtual construct, and at-sea training evolutions, which build on the tactical knowledge and proficiency of each participant. The goal is to deliver multi-domain combatants ready for full-spectrum combat operations. Led by SMWDC, SWATT is the premier advanced tactical training exercise tailored for the surface fleet, pushing units to achieve new levels of tactical precision and adaptability. It aims to equip watch teams, individual units, and warfare commanders with cutting-edge strategies and skills for the complexities of modern naval warfare. CSG 12, as the immediate superior in command of USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 2, CVW 8, and the five guided-missile destroyers, plays a central role in overseeing this readiness. The Gerald R. Ford CSG’s strengths begin with its multi-layered defense network. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, a sophisticated platform that supports anti-air, anti-missile, and anti-submarine operations, creating a protective buffer around the carrier and the entire strike group. This layered defense approach is essential in countering diverse threats, including missile attacks, submarines, and aerial incursions, which enhances the security and survivability of the group in complex operational theaters. However, the CSG faces notable weaknesses, beginning with its significant logistical demands. Operating such a complex group requires extensive support in terms of fuel, supplies, and maintenance, and maintaining a CSG over extended deployments is resource-intensive. These logistical demands mean that the CSG’s operational endurance can be limited by access to supply lines, especially in remote or contested areas where consistent resupply may be challenging. Cost is another substantial factor. The Gerald R. Ford-class carrier is one of the most expensive warships ever built, with each destroyer and supporting vessel further adding to the operational budget.

This initiative is part of a broader review of the Air Force's force structure, which could also impact the Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider Stealth Bomber was unveiled to the public at a ceremony Dec. 2, 2022 in Palmdale, California (Picture source: US DoD) The B-21 Raider Bomber provides the U.S. Armed Forces with a crucial capability for long-range stealth bombing, allowing it to penetrate advanced enemy air defenses and deliver both conventional and nuclear payloads. Its advanced design improves strategic deterrence and enables the U.S. to project power globally, meeting modern operational requirements in contested environments. With rising threats from peer adversaries such as Russia and China, a larger B-21 fleet would enhance the Air Force's ability to respond quickly and effectively across multiple regions, addressing the need for versatile and survivable strike capabilities. Expanding the B-21 fleet is considered a cost-effective way to enhance U.S. defense posture, particularly as older bombers like the B-1 and B-2 near retirement. Acquiring more B-21s would not only modernize the bomber force but also provide a dual benefit by supporting both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence. As a platform already in production, scaling up B-21 procurement could swiftly improve U.S. military readiness without the delays associated with developing new systems like the NGAD fighter. Russia and China are developing their own long-range stealth bombers to rival the U.S. B-21. Russia is working on the PAK DA, a stealth bomber designed to replace its older fleet, featuring advanced radar-evading capabilities and long-range strike potential. Meanwhile, China is developing the H-20 stealth bomber, which aims to extend China's strategic reach and conduct missions deep into enemy territory. Both aircraft are intended to challenge U.S. air superiority and enhance their respective nations' strike capabilities. The B-21 Raider stands out due to its cutting-edge stealth technology, advanced materials, and digital design, which enhance its ability to evade radar detection more effectively than older bombers. Its modular architecture allows for future upgrades, making it adaptable to changing threats. Moreover, the B-21 is built with versatility in mind, supporting both conventional and nuclear missions, giving the U.S. a significant advantage in strategic deterrence and long-range precision strike capabilities. The B-21 Raider could be deployed in a strategic strike mission aimed at neutralizing heavily defended adversary military installations, such as missile launch sites or command centers deep within enemy territory. With its advanced stealth capabilities, the B-21 could penetrate sophisticated air defenses undetected, deliver precise strikes with conventional or nuclear munitions, and exit the area safely. For example, in a crisis scenario with an adversary possessing advanced anti-aircraft systems, the B-21 could be used to destroy radars or surface-to-air missile batteries, paving the way for other air forces to conduct offensive operations. In addition to its strategic strike capabilities, the B-21 Raider is designed to perform a wide range of conventional missions, such as supporting military operations in conflict zones, conducting air interdiction, and carrying out precision strikes on mobile targets. For instance, during an air campaign against an enemy force, the B-21 could be used to attack defensive positions, ammunition depots, or military convoys, thereby disrupting the adversary's logistical and operational capabilities. Its stealth allows it to penetrate deep into enemy territory and operate in contested environments, reducing the risk for pilots while maximizing the effectiveness of its strikes. Additionally, the B-21's flexibility enables it to be quickly reconfigured to accommodate various types of conventional missions, adapting its weaponry and sensors to specific field requirements. Warden revealed during an earnings call on October 24, 2024, that the Air Force is conducting a comprehensive review of its force structure, including the B-21 fleet. This review is part of a congressionally mandated effort to reassess the service's future capabilities and requirements. It also coincides with the Air Force's efforts to complete the NGAD program's requirements analysis, following a pause ordered by Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall earlier this year. The NGAD program, aimed at developing a sixth-generation fighter to replace the F-22 Raptor, was paused before a decision was made between two competing designs. Kendall cited concerns over the program's cost, with initial estimates suggesting that each aircraft could cost several hundred million dollars. He has since indicated a preference for reducing the per-unit cost to a range closer to that of the F-35 fighter, between $80 million and $100 million. The cost difference, if achieved, could translate into savings of tens of billions of dollars across a planned fleet of 200 to 250 NGAD fighters. While the official stance of the Air Force has maintained that a fleet of 100 B-21 Raiders would meet current operational needs, there are growing voices within the defense community advocating for a larger fleet. The B-21 is designed to replace the aging B-2 Spirit and B-1 Lancer bombers, providing the U.S. military with a long-range stealth bomber capable of penetrating advanced air defenses. The platform is a cornerstone of the Air Force's future strategic deterrence and conventional strike capabilities. Northrop Grumman, the B-21's prime contractor, has stated that it is ready to increase production if the Air Force decides to expand the fleet. According to Warden, the decision on fleet size will likely become clearer in the coming months as the force structure review progresses. She emphasized that the performance and cost targets achieved during the B-21's initial production phase could influence the Air Force's decision. The cost of the B-21 has been a central issue in these discussions. The bomber's original unit cost was contractually set at $550 million in 2010, equivalent to approximately $780 million today. Despite this, Kendall informed Congress in April that B-21 production costs had remained below projections during low-rate initial production. However, the cost ceiling is expected to rise as production ramps up in later batches. Several senior officials and defense analysts have argued for increasing the B-21 fleet beyond the initial 100 units. Retired Colonel Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, has been outspoken about the need to increase the Air Force's bomber capacity to address emerging threats. He points out that the current bomber force is too small to meet the demands of a rapidly changing strategic environment, especially in deterring and potentially responding to simultaneous threats from peer adversaries like Russia and China. Gunzinger believes that the B-21 is particularly well-positioned to strengthen both conventional and nuclear deterrence due to its stealth capabilities, long range, and substantial payload capacity. He asserts that acquiring more B-21s at an accelerated pace would be the most cost-effective approach to strengthening the United States' power projection capabilities and operating in contested environments. Expanding the bomber fleet would provide a dual benefit by bolstering both conventional defense and strategic deterrence. Air Force General Anthony J. Cotton, head of U.S. Strategic Command, has also expressed support for increasing the number of B-21 bombers, emphasizing their importance in maintaining a credible deterrent posture. His views are echoed by other analysts, such as Christopher Bowie, who have suggested that 100 aircraft may not be sufficient for the U.S. to achieve its strategic goals, given that even the most advanced bomber can only be in one place at a time. One of the central questions in the ongoing review is whether potential savings from reducing the NGAD program could be redirected to fund additional B-21 bombers. The Air Force is attempting to balance the competing demands of modernizing its aging fleet while adhering to budget constraints. However, some experts, including Gunzinger, caution against viewing the NGAD and B-21 programs as interchangeable. This pause has opened the door for the B-21 to play a more significant role in the Air Force's future force structure. Northrop Grumman's willingness to increase production adds to the service's strategic flexibility as it navigates the challenges of modernizing its fleet under fiscal constraints. Warden indicated that the Air Force is expected to award a second low-rate initial production (LRIP) contract for the B-21 before the end of the year. The first LRIP contract was awarded following the bomber's first flight last year, although specifics regarding the number of aircraft covered under the agreement have not been disclosed. The outcome of the current force structure review and ongoing budget negotiations will likely influence future production rates and fleet size decisions. As the Air Force continues to assess its options, the B-21 remains a key element in the broader strategy to enhance U.S. airpower capabilities. Whether the service will ultimately expand its fleet of stealth bombers will depend on a variety of factors, including cost considerations, technological developments, and the evolving threat landscape. In the meantime, Northrop Grumman is positioning itself to respond quickly to increased demand, offering the U.S. government flexibility in shaping the future of its bomber force. The reconsideration of the B-21 fleet size underscores the dynamic nature of the U.S. Air Force's modernization strategy, driven by both strategic needs and budgetary realities. With the ongoing review of the NGAD program and discussions about expanding the bomber fleet, the Air Force is at a critical juncture. The decisions made in the coming months will shape the future of American airpower and its ability to deter adversaries and project power worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/northrop-grumman-announces-massive-expansion-in-b-21-raider-stealth-bomber-production-to-counter-china	2024-10-28T05:56:13-07:00

Taiwan Unveils Torpedo Launch Tube of Huilong Unmanned Underwater Vehicle	According to information published by TaiwanPlus on October 26, 2024, Taiwan revealed the torpedo launch tube of its domestically developed 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan reveals its 'Huilong' unmanned underwater vehicle, equipped with dual torpedo launch tubes and surveillance capabilities. (Picture source: TaiwanPlus) Earlier, images of the propeller at the vehicle’s rear were also released. However, Taiwan's Defense Minister recently clarified over a lunch with the media that the Huilong platform is primarily intended for testing purposes, specifically for sonar and underwater mine systems, and does not feature an active propulsion system. Consequently, during sea trials, it is towed by support vessels rather than operating independently. The 'Huilong' project is a joint effort between Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and Lung Teh Shipbuilding. The development officially commenced in 2020 under the 'Huilong Project,' aiming to establish a versatile, unmanned underwater test platform. According to reports, the vehicle displaces nearly 100 tons and has dimensions measuring approximately 30 meters in length, 3.6 meters in width, and 6 meters in height, including its command tower casing. This UUV resembles a compact submarine and is equipped with dual torpedo tubes. Notably, it is also reportedly designed to deploy small unmanned vehicles, potentially enhancing its capabilities in surveillance, target acquisition, and strike operations against enemy assets. One of the Huilong UUV’s primary roles could be to extend Taiwan’s underwater monitoring capabilities. Equipped with sophisticated sonar, the UUV can detect and track adversary submarines and other vessels operating in the waters around Taiwan. This would be particularly advantageous in tracking potential incursions by Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) submarines, enabling early detection and providing intelligence on the movements of hostile forces. Given the importance of information superiority in modern conflicts, the Huilong’s ability to conduct real-time, covert reconnaissance could significantly enhance Taiwan’s situational awareness. Taiwan’s fleet of submarines is relatively small and would be vulnerable in the event of a conflict. However, integrating UUVs like the Huilong could serve as a force multiplier. Deployed alongside or in support of manned submarines, these UUVs could take on high-risk reconnaissance or even offensive roles, allowing manned vessels to operate with less exposure to detection or attack. In any conflict scenario with a larger naval power like China, Taiwan’s strategy would likely rely on asymmetric tactics. UUVs offer a cost-effective means to deploy a range of weapons or carry out sabotage missions against high-value enemy assets, like aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-unveils-torpedo-launch-tube-of-huilong-unmanned-underwater-vehicle	2024-10-28T04:51:34-07:00

Exclusive: Discover Ukraine's Sky Dragon Devastating Drone-Dropped Incendiary Thermite Weapon Against Russia	Recently, Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL, shared a detailed graphic on his X account explaining Sky Dragon, a new Ukrainian weapon system using multi-rotor drones to deploy thermite incendiary devices against Russian forces. This approach, which involves bundling thermite grenades and dropping them over Russian-occupied tree lines, has proven highly effective. By leveraging drones for precise delivery, the Sky Dragon system enables Ukrainian forces to target fortified Russian positions in difficult-to-reach areas, especially in densely forested terrain, causing significant damage to enemy equipment and personnel.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An aerial view captures the devastating impact of Ukraine's Sky Dragon incendiary thermite weapon as a drone drops the fiery payload onto its target. The intense white-hot thermite reaction engulfs the area in flames, melting through metal and creating thick smoke plumes, showcasing this drone-deployed weapon's destructive power in the ongoing conflict. (Picture source: Social network and X account Chuck Pfarrer) The use of incendiary thermite weapons in Ukraine has been reported during the ongoing conflict, with instances of classic incendiary munitions being employed by both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Thermite is used primarily to destroy equipment, fortifications, or infrastructure due to its ability to generate extremely high temperatures, melt metal, and start fires. The first publicized reports of thermite being used in Ukraine emerged in 2014, during the initial stages of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, when Russian-backed separatists were accused of using incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to target Ukrainian military positions. Recently, there have been renewed reports of thermite weapons being used in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, particularly in the context of intense battles in eastern Ukraine. These reports suggest that both sides may be employing incendiary munitions, including thermite-based weapons, to destroy military equipment, fortifications, and infrastructure. In late 2022 and throughout 2023, videos and eyewitness accounts surfaced showing the use of incendiary shells, which may contain thermite, in areas like Bakhmut and Mariupol, where fierce urban fighting took place. Sky Dragon uses commercially available multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, to carry bundles of thermite grenades and drop them over enemy positions. Thermite, a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxides, burns at extremely high temperatures when ignited, making it ideal for destroying military equipment, bunkers, and fortifications. The drones deliver these thermite devices in a precise and targeted manner, allowing Ukrainian forces to strike deep within Russian-controlled zones, including fortified positions concealed under tree canopies and within dug-in trenches. The Sky Dragon system operates through a combination of advanced drone technology and destructive incendiary devices. It uses multi-rotor drones, such as quadcopters or octocopters, which are capable of carrying heavy payloads and modified for military use. These drones fly over Russian positions, allowing for the precise delivery of their incendiary payloads. The core of the system consists of bundled thermite grenades strapped together with metal bands. These grenades are equipped with a Nonel instantaneous fuse system, commonly used in demolition, ensuring that all grenades ignite simultaneously once they reach the target. This synchronization maximizes the thermite's destructive power. To protect the drone from the extreme heat generated by the thermite, a heat shield is employed along with a tow line that holds the grenades at a safe distance during flight. Once released, the grenades ignite mid-air, raining down molten thermite on the target, making it nearly impossible for enemy infantry or equipment to withstand the intense heat, which can exceed 2,000°C. Sky Dragon is proving to be highly effective against entrenched Russian positions, especially in forested areas. Traditional artillery and mortar systems struggle to penetrate tree lines where Russian forces are often dug in. However, drones can navigate these complex environments, hovering over specific positions and deploying incendiary grenades with pinpoint accuracy. When ignited, thermite creates temperatures exceeding 2,000°C (3,600°F), capable of burning through metal and concrete, making it particularly useful for destroying ammunition depots, bunkers, armored vehicles, and other critical military infrastructure. Graphic by Chuck Pfarrer illustrating Ukraine's Sky Dragon, a drone-deployed incendiary thermite weapon used to target Russian forces. (Picture source X account Chuck Pfarrer ) Additionally, the drones are difficult to detect and intercept due to their small size and low altitude. This makes them ideal tools for engaging targets in areas where Russian air defense systems are concentrated, as drones can maneuver around obstacles and deliver their payloads without risking large aircraft or manned vehicles. The introduction of Sky Dragon highlights Ukraine's ability to adapt to the realities of modern warfare, leveraging low-cost commercial drones in innovative ways to inflict significant damage on Russian forces. The use of incendiary devices like thermite further underscores Ukraine's intent to target key Russian positions where traditional weapons might fail or struggle to reach. As the conflict drags on, the emergence of these new tactics could force Russian troops to adapt their defensive strategies, potentially making their positions more vulnerable to other forms of attack. Sky Dragon adds yet another dimension to the drone warfare that has come to define much of the conflict, where both sides increasingly rely on unmanned systems to deliver destructive payloads with minimal risk to personnel. Sky Dragon represents a significant development in Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities, offering a cost-effective and highly destructive solution to the challenge of entrenched Russian forces. As the war continues, innovations like Sky Dragon will likely play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics on the battlefield, demonstrating how modern technology and creative problem-solving can shift the balance of power in asymmetrical warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-discover-ukraines-sky-dragon-devastating-drone-deployed-incendiary-thermite-weapon-against-russia	2024-10-28T03:41:16-07:00

The project is co-managed by the French Defense Innovation Agency (AID) and the DGA, involving teams from the 3D Action Management Unit, DGA Engineering and Projects, and DGA-EM. Preparatory work led to the development and testing of an innovative communication system capable of effectively linking the various aircraft involved in joint missions. The tests were carried out in several phases, first separately and then simultaneously, with operations conducted from the DGA-EM site on Île du Levant and another base in southern Italy. For the French side, the tests involved an H130 helicopter equipped with specific sensors, paired with a VSR700 drone developed by Airbus Helicopters. In Italy, the trials used a helicopter from Leonardo, paired with an SW-4 Solo, a hybrid aircraft that can be piloted or operated autonomously via a drone interface. Both test sites and the aircraft were interconnected via satellite, ensuring real-time communication and the ability to control drones over long distances. The flight demonstration on October 9, 2024, was a highlight of the project, marking a decisive step for interoperability. In the presence of a European Commission representative, the tests showed that interaction levels between helicopters and drones could be progressively increased. This culminated in an impressive demonstration where a drone operated from one country was controlled by a helicopter located 1,000 kilometers away, thus proving the feasibility of joint operations within the European Union. These successful tests anticipate new capabilities for future-generation helicopters, particularly the upgraded Guépard and Tiger models, which will be equipped to cooperate with drones in future military missions. The addition of drones will significantly expand the scope of possible missions, providing the armed forces with an important strategic asset thanks to the introduction of unmanned platforms, thereby increasing the reach and effectiveness of operations. The MUSHER testing campaign represents a notable advancement in military aerospace, paving the way for more integrated manned and unmanned systems in European air operations.

Indonesia Navy Expels Chinese Coast Guard Ship from North Natuna Sea	According to information published by the Indonesian government on October 25, 2024, Indonesia’s Maritime Security Agency, Bakamla RI, successfully detected and expelled a Chinese Coast Guard vessel, CCG 5402, from the North Natuna Sea. This vessel had been interfering with seismic survey activities led by PT Pertamina East Natuna, a state-owned oil and gas company, which was conducting 3D seismic data processing using the survey vessel MV Geo Coral.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Indonesian Coast Guard Tanjung Datu-class patrol vessel KN Tanjung Datu, the Chinese Coast Guard OPV 5402 and the Indonesian Navy Kapitan Patimura-class corvette. (Picture source: Indonesian government) The incident unfolded when Bakamla RI’s Command and Control Center (Puskodal) received intelligence that CCG 5402 was obstructing MV Geo Coral’s survey, which was being escorted by three chase vessels—UB Anugerah Bersama 17, AHT PSB Roller, and TB Teluk Bajau Victory. These activities were taking place within the operational area of PT Pertamina East Natuna, which is situated on Indonesia's continental shelf in the North Natuna Sea. Following this alert, Bakamla dispatched the Indonesian State Vessel (KN) Tanjung Datu-301 to the location. Upon arrival, KN Tanjung Datu-301 detected the Chinese vessel CCG 5402 at 5:30 a.m. WIB, positioned at a 125° bearing and approximately 7.3 nautical miles away. Despite efforts to establish communication via radio, CCG 5402 asserted that the area fell under Chinese jurisdiction, a claim that Indonesia firmly disputes. Shortly after, at around 5:38 a.m., Bakamla RI received reinforcement from the Indonesian Navy’s (TNI AL) patrol vessel KRI Sutedi Senaputera 378 and a maritime patrol aircraft. Together, these Indonesian patrol forces shadowed the Chinese vessel, ultimately succeeding in expelling CCG 5402 from Indonesia’s jurisdictional waters in the North Natuna Sea. China’s Foreign Ministry responded to the situation in a routine press conference on Thursday, stating that Chinese coast guard vessels were patrolling 'waters under China’s jurisdiction' according to both international and domestic laws. The ministry expressed its willingness to negotiate with Indonesia to resolve maritime issues between the two countries. Although Indonesia is not involved in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, China’s 'Nine-Dash Line' claim overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Natuna Islands. Chinese coast guard vessels have entered Indonesia’s Natuna Sea in recent years. However, it is noteworthy that these two recent incidents occurred within a week of Prabowo taking office. China has consistently expressed interest in collaborating with Indonesia to develop the North Natuna Sea, so these actions may be a way to test the new administration’s stance on potential cooperation.

Raytheon awarded contract to maintain US Navy Sea-based X-band Radar	According to information published by the US DoD on October 25, 2024, Raytheon has secured a substantial $900 million contract modification from the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The two-year extension will see Raytheon continue to provide operations and maintenance support for the Sea-based X-band Radar and 13 Army-Navy Transportable Radar Surveillance and Control Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar systems. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Raytheon secures a $900 million contract extension with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to support and sustain advanced radar systems. (Picture source: Dvids) The Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX-1) remains a cornerstone of the U.S. ballistic missile defense strategy due to its unprecedented ability to detect and assess threats from vast distances, making it a powerful mobile asset for tracking and intercepting missile threats. Positioned on a self-propelled, semi-submersible oil platform, this radar provides coverage that can be quickly adapted to varying geopolitical hotspots across the Pacific, a region where missile threats from countries like North Korea, China, and Russia are a growing concern​. The SBX-1’s high-precision X-band radar, encased within a massive radome, has approximately 45,000 transmit/receive modules, allowing it to detect and discriminate between missiles, decoys, and debris. It can track objects as small as a baseball from up to 2,500 miles away, feeding critical data back to ground-based interceptors for midcourse corrections. This data transmission occurs through the In-Flight Interceptor Communications System Data Terminal onboard, which enables real-time adjustments for interceptors and heightens the radar’s utility in ballistic missile defense​. Operational since 2006, SBX-1 has been deployed extensively in the Pacific, often supporting defense readiness against North Korean missile tests and other emergent threats. However, recent deployments have highlighted both its strengths and limitations. While it offers exceptional tracking precision, its relatively narrow field of view poses challenges when responding to complex scenarios involving multiple missiles or advanced countermeasures such as decoys. In response, the SBX-1 has undergone upgrades and maintenance in Hawaii, addressing structural issues from its extensive 662-day deployment and enhancing its ability to support intercepts under higher demand from the U.S. Space Command and Space Force​.

Nonetheless, the radar’s mobility and ability to adjust to the Earth's curvature give it a distinct advantage over land-based radars, enabling tracking over oceanic expanses and the flexibility to relocate in response to shifting threat landscapes. These advantages remain critical as missile defense analysts underscore the necessity of monitoring emerging hypersonic threats, which can travel at extreme speeds and low altitudes, evading traditional missile defense systems​. Looking ahead, discussions around the SBX's future are ongoing, with considerations about whether additional units or complementary systems are required. Space-based sensors are also under evaluation as potential support for a more diversified missile defense network.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/raytheon-awarded-contract-to-maintain-us-navy-sea-based-x-band-radar	2024-10-28T02:52:00-07:00	
US Army’s Future XM30 Combat Vehicle to Redefine IFV with a 50mm Cannon and AI Technologies	According to Nicholas Drummond on October 27, 2024, the US Army’s future XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle is set to redefine the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category when it enters service in 2027, replacing the aging M2 Bradley. The US Army has awarded General Dynamics and Rheinmetall $800 million each to develop prototypes for this vehicle as part of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program. The total value of the program is estimated at $45 billion, with the Army planning to purchase approximately 3,800 units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, which has been in service since the 1980s. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The XM30 is expected to bring significant changes to the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) category, featuring a 50x228 mm cannon in a remote-controlled turret, twin Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs), an AI-enabled fire control system, and a hybrid drivetrain. The XM30 will have a crew of two (a driver and a commander) and will carry six infantry personnel. The vehicle’s size and capacity have been designed to maintain a balance between firepower and mobility while preventing it from becoming too large or heavy, as seen with some past IFV designs. It will be designed to work alongside future versions of the M1 Abrams and is expected to include protection against Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Digital engineering has been central to the development of the XM30. In the early phases of the program, five contractors were given approximately $60 million each to create digital designs based on draft requirements from the Army. Through this process that facilitated its design, development, and potential future upgrades, the US Army refined the vehicle's requirements and ensured they were achievable, avoiding issues that led to the cancellation of earlier programs. For instance, by using 3D models and simulations early in the design phase, the Army ensures that all requirements and subsystems, including sensors and fire control mechanisms, are aligned before physical prototypes are constructed. This approach minimizes development costs and helps contractors and the Army quickly address any design issues that arise during the process. The modular design of the XM30 supports future technological updates, enabling the integration of new systems with minimal changes to the vehicle's core architecture. Equipped with a hybrid-electric drivetrain and a variety of weapon systems, including a 50mm cannon and anti-tank guided missiles, the XM30 is configured to meet current operational requirements while maintaining flexibility for future needs. The vehicle's reduced crew size and its capacity to transport infantry are aimed at improving operational efficiency without increasing size or complexity. The XM30 program is a continuation of the US Army’s efforts to replace the M2 Bradley, which has been in service since the 1980s. Despite several earlier attempts, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and Future Combat System programs, previous initiatives were not successful, often due to issues with aligning requirements, funding, technology, and schedule. Colonel Jeffery Jurand, the project manager for the XM30, has emphasized that the current program is aligned in these areas, supported by the use of digital engineering. This approach allows for the design and testing of the vehicle through digital models, avoiding some of the challenges faced by earlier programs. Both General Dynamics and Rheinmetall were selected to move forward in the competition, with the Army currently in phase three of a five-phase schedule. These contractors will deliver prototypes by late 2026, with the Army conducting critical design reviews by the first half of fiscal year 2025. The final selection of a single vendor for production will take place around the first quarter of fiscal year 2028, after testing and evaluation of the prototypes. The program is also supported by the 'digital trinity' approach, which includes models-based systems engineering, digital engineering, and development, security, and operations (DevSecOps). This digital approach has allowed for improved traceability and communication between contractors and the Army, with errors being identified and addressed earlier in the design process. The open architecture of the XM30 design has been highlighted as a way to accommodate future upgrades and reduce costs. The XM30 is one of six pathfinder programs identified by the Army to demonstrate the benefits of digital engineering. The Army's use of digital engineering for this project is intended to improve design efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the vehicle's modularity and adaptability for future needs. The program has drawn confidence from senior Army leaders, who have expressed support for its goals and its potential to provide long-term benefits, including cost savings through its open architecture.

The Army is scheduled to begin testing the prototypes in 2026, with a final decision on production expected in 2028.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-armys-future-xm30-to-redefine-ifv-category-with-ai-driven-systems-and-50mm-remote-cannon	2024-10-28T02:29:56-07:00	
Satellite Images Reveal Rise of Chinese Forces with 59 New DF-26 Missile Launchers	In October 2024, new satellite images revealed a significant increase in Chinese production of launchers for DF-26 ballistic missiles, indicating a considerable strengthening of China’s strategic arsenal. An image taken on September 9, 2024, by Umbra's synthetic aperture radar (SAR) showed 59 mobile launchers at the Xinghang Electromechanical Equipment production site in Beijing. This observation highlights the growing capabilities of China, raising important strategic concerns, particularly in the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The DF-26 is an intermediate-range ballistic missile from the Dong Feng family, developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). With a range of 4,000 km, it is the first Chinese missile capable of striking conventional targets, such as U.S. bases in Guam. This solid-fuel, two-stage missile is 14 meters long and weighs 20 tons, capable of carrying a payload between 1,200 and 1,800 kg, including nuclear warheads and various conventional warheads. It is deployed on a mobile Taian HTF5680 launcher, allowing for rapid and discreet deployment. The DF-26’s modular design enables the warheads to be swapped based on mission requirements, with options for both land strikes and moving naval targets, supported by a terminal guidance system. Since its unveiling in 2015, production of the DF-26 has accelerated, with over 250 units produced by 2024. The brigades of the People’s Liberation Army equipped with these missiles benefit from their mobility and precision strike capabilities, targeting a range of assets including military installations and medium-sized ships. Its operational flexibility and extended range make it a key component of China’s anti-access and area denial strategy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Between 2023 and 2024, satellite images and industry reports indicate that the Beijing-Xinghang facility produced at least 72 new launchers, enough to equip two additional missile brigades. These units would join the seven existing brigades of the People’s Liberation Army, bringing the total number of DF-26 launchers to around 250. However, some experts, notably from the Federation of American Scientists, suggest that China may be inflating the actual number of launchers, potentially creating confusion about the true extent of its capabilities. The DF-26, part of the Dong Feng missile family ('East Wind'), offers enhanced strategic capabilities compared to earlier versions such as the DF-21. Its extended range, combined with improved accuracy through satellite-assisted inertial guidance, makes it a serious threat to high-value targets like military bases, airports, and naval facilities. The potential integration of terminal guidance could also enable the DF-26 to fulfill anti-ship roles, posing a threat to U.S. carrier strike groups operating in the Pacific. The recent increase in DF-26 production is viewed as a response to perceived shifts in U.S. military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea. The expansion of China’s missile arsenal could also signal an intention to challenge U.S. access to its strategic bases, which play a crucial role in supporting regional alliances with Japan, South Korea, and other partners. Growing tensions in the region, combined with the DF-26's dual-use (nuclear and conventional) nature, raise concerns about the risk of unintended escalation in a crisis, particularly if a conventional strike is misinterpreted as a nuclear attack. As China strengthens its strategic forces, it continues to expand its nuclear capabilities. U.S. estimates suggest that by 2030, China's nuclear arsenal could exceed 1,000 warheads, primarily in the form of intercontinental missiles. In parallel, efforts are underway to increase the number of long-range missile launchers, including the DF-31 and DF-41, which are capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/satellite-images-reveal-rise-of-chinese-forces-with-59-new-df-26-missile-launchers	2024-10-28T02:23:01-07:00

(Picture source: X Account French Aid to Ukraine) The Su-24 is a Soviet-era, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing bomber aircraft designed for all-weather, low-level penetration strikes. Developed by Sukhoi in the late 1960s and introduced into service in the early 1970s, the Su-24 was intended to provide the Soviet Air Force with a deep strike platform capable of carrying a wide array of conventional and nuclear weapons. It became the backbone of the Soviet Union's tactical bomber fleet, comparable to the U.S. F-111, and saw significant upgrades over the years. Widely exported to allied nations, the Su-24 has remained in service in several countries, including Russia and Ukraine, with modernization efforts extending its operational lifespan and capabilities, even in the post-Soviet era. The adaptation of Ukraine’s Su-24s to deploy the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missile is a notable achievement, as it allows the Ukrainian Air Force to strike enemy targets with high precision at extended ranges. The Su-24, originally a Soviet-designed, all-weather attack aircraft built for deep penetration missions, has been extensively modified by Ukrainian engineers to fire these advanced Western missiles. The modifications involved updating the avionics, fire control systems, and communication interfaces between the missile and the aircraft, ensuring full compatibility with the SCALP-EG’s guidance and targeting systems. This successful integration marks the first time a non-NATO platform has been adapted to use this sophisticated missile, a testament to Ukraine’s ingenuity in modernizing its Soviet-era fleet with Western technology. The Su-24’s variable-sweep wing design and its ability to operate at low altitudes make it an ideal platform for launching SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles, enabling Ukraine to carry out precision strikes on critical Russian military infrastructure while minimizing the risk of detection. The SCALP-EG, also known as Storm Shadow in the UK, was delivered to Ukraine in mid-2023 as part of a broader package of military aid from France and the United Kingdom. These missiles were provided in response to Ukraine’s urgent requests for advanced weaponry capable of countering Russian long-range artillery and missile attacks. The delivery was a turning point, as it allowed Ukraine to bridge the gap in its long-range strike capabilities, giving it the tools to target Russian positions far beyond the front lines. The SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow is a long-range, air-launched cruise missile designed for precision strikes, offering key advantages in range, accuracy, and stealth. Its extended range, exceeding 250 kilometers (and up to 560 kilometers in some variants), allows Ukrainian forces to hit deep targets within Russian-occupied territories without entering contested airspace. The missile is equipped with a 450 kg BROACH (Bomb Royal Ordnance Augmented Charge) warhead, a two-stage system that first penetrates hardened structures and then detonates inside, maximizing destruction against fortified targets such as bunkers, command centers, and ammunition depots. Guided by a combination of GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain-following radar, the SCALP-EG ensures precise targeting, especially in the final phase of its flight, where it uses infrared sensors to compare the target with pre-loaded images. This ensures high accuracy even in heavily defended areas. Additionally, the missile's low radar cross-section gives it a stealthy profile, making it difficult to detect and intercept by enemy air defenses, which enhances its ability to penetrate contested airspace. Together, these features—long range, significant destructive power, and pinpoint accuracy—make the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow an effective tool for disrupting enemy operations, particularly by degrading logistical and command structures. This offers Ukraine a crucial strategic advantage in the ongoing conflict. The ability to launch SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles from Su-24 aircraft gives Ukraine a new level of operational flexibility. Prior to this development, Ukraine’s ability to strike at long-range was limited, but the integration of these missiles now allows the Ukrainian Air Force to conduct deep strikes into Russian-held territory without exposing its aircraft to significant risk. With a range of over 250 kilometers, the SCALP-EG can reach critical Russian military installations, ammunition depots, and logistical hubs far behind the front lines. This allows Ukraine to disrupt supply lines, command centers, and infrastructure that are essential for sustaining Russian operations. The Su-24’s ability to deliver these strikes at low altitude, combined with the missile’s stealth characteristics, greatly increases the likelihood of successful missions. Recent reports indicate that Ukrainian forces have already employed the SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow in several operations, targeting Russian logistics centers and ammunition depots with precision. The strikes not only degrade Russia’s operational capabilities but also force Russian forces to divert resources to defend rear-area positions that were previously out of Ukraine’s reach. The integration of SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles into Ukraine’s Su-24 aircraft marks a significant evolution in the nation’s military capabilities. This adaptation has transformed the Su-24 into a formidable long-range strike platform capable of hitting critical Russian targets with precision and stealth. As the conflict continues, Ukraine’s ability to carry out deep strikes against key Russian military assets will be crucial in shaping the course of the war. With Western support and Ukraine’s innovative approach to integrating advanced technologies into its existing fleet, the Su-24 armed with SCALP-EG/Storm Shadow missiles represents a powerful tool in Ukraine’s fight to reclaim its territory and push back Russian forces. This new capability may well prove to be a game-changer as Ukraine continues to defend its sovereignty.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/ukraines-su-24-bomber-now-armed-with-western-scalp-eg-storm-shadow-missiles	2024-10-28T02:13:19-07:00

US Navy Eyes Patriot Missiles to Counter China’s Hypersonic Threats in Pacific	According to information published by The Economic Times on October 25, 2024, the U.S. Navy is advancing plans to deploy Patriot interceptor missiles on its warships, Amid rising security concerns over China’s potential use of advanced hypersonic weapons in the Indo-Pacific. This move is intended to counter the growing threat of Chinese missile technology, specifically anti-ship ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles capable of evading traditional defense systems, according to two senior defense officials.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of US Navy warships. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Patriot missiles, particularly the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) variant, are already employed by the U.S. Army for land-based air defense. These interceptors, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, offer agility and the capability to target highly maneuverable threats, positioning them as a potential solution to counter hypersonic advancements anticipated in Chinese arsenals. Integrating these interceptors into naval defense systems signals a notable shift in U.S. military strategy as tensions in the Indo-Pacific persist and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) rapidly modernizes its capabilities. The addition of the PAC-3 interceptors to the Navy's arsenal is seen as essential to expanding the layered defense system on U.S. vessels. Demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors has soared, driven by a heightened interest from foreign governments and the U.S. Army’s ambition to more than double production in the coming years. Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3’s manufacturer, is exploring avenues to increase production, including plans for a new production line for missile seekers in Florida. This facility would supplement Boeing’s existing manufacturing of seekers, and production for PAC-3 could eventually include Japan, a key U.S. ally in the Indo-Pacific region. The PAC-3's compact size, agility, and advanced 'hit-to-kill' technology—which allows the interceptor to destroy threats by direct impact rather than proximity detonation—make it well-suited for combating high-speed ballistic and hypersonic missiles. These interceptors would enhance existing capabilities aboard U.S. ships to target and neutralize fast-moving threats. The U.S. Navy has already conducted preliminary virtual tests of PAC-3 interceptors aboard a 'virtual Aegis ship,' using the Mk. 70 vertical launcher system, which is foundational for naval missile launches. However, the interceptors have yet to be physically deployed on a vessel, and additional testing is required to synchronize PAC-3 systems with the Navy's SPY-1 radar, a key component of the Aegis missile defense system. The PAC-3 interceptors have demonstrated significant capabilities in recent conflicts, successfully intercepting high-speed threats such as Russia’s Khinzal missiles in Ukraine. The missile’s success has spurred interest in incorporating it into the Navy’s defenses, adding a cost-effective layer against the sophisticated hypersonic and ballistic missiles developed by China. China’s missile capabilities, particularly the DF-21D 'carrier killer' and the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, are a central security concern for U.S. forces in the Pacific. The DF-27, which can cover a range of up to 5,000 miles, features an aerodynamic warhead that can maneuver, complicating defense strategies. This missile could pose a direct threat to U.S. naval forces and moving targets alike. While the Navy’s existing SM-6 missiles can reach targets in space, the PAC-3, though limited in range, offers greater agility due to rockets positioned near its nose, enabling it to respond effectively to high-speed threats in lower altitudes. The introduction of PAC-3 MSE interceptors could supplement these existing capabilities, enhancing the layered defense necessary to address the evolving threat environment in the Indo-Pacific.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-eyes-patriot-missiles-to-counter-chinas-hypersonic-threats-in-pacific	2024-10-25T05:18:04-07:00

Earlier reports, such as Tasnim in November 2023, confirmed Iran’s acquisition of Russian aircraft, including Mil Mi-28 attack helicopters, Su-35 fighter jets, and Yak-130 training jets. According to Sardar Seyed Mehdi Farhi, Deputy Minister of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, these acquisitions are part of ongoing efforts to enhance Iran’s military aviation capabilities, particularly focusing on helicopter upgrades and improvements to night flying and avionics systems. Farhi also mentioned the work of Iran’s Helicopter Support and Renovation Company (Panha) over the past three decades. This development aligns with discussions held in January 2023 between Igor Levitin, a special assistant to the Russian president, and Iran’s First Vice President, Mohammed Mokhbar. During this meeting, Levitin expressed Russia’s readiness to pursue joint helicopter production with Iran. Amir Mojtaba Rouhani, CEO of Panha, had previously noted Iran’s regional leadership in helicopter maintenance services. In June 2023, Iranian Air Force Commander Amir Hamid Vahedi, in an interview about the Su-35, stated, 'We need the said Sukhoi jet, but we don’t know when it will arrive.' Vahedi referred to the construction of underground air bases, such as 'Oryol 44,' designed to protect the country’s fighter jets from potential attacks, including bunker-buster munitions. He indicated that these bases are strategically located to ensure operational safety and readiness. Vahedi also highlighted the modernization of Iran’s fleet of F-4 and F-14 aircraft, focusing on radar upgrades and extending the range of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles. Iran’s Air Force currently operates a diverse fleet of fighter jets, including American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, as well as Russian-made MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft. The fleet also includes domestically produced jets like the HESA Saeqeh and Kowsar.

In recent years, Iran has been working toward acquiring Su-35 fighter jets from Russia. Although there have been multiple reports about anticipated deliveries, Iranian officials have denied these claims. In April 2024, Tehran refuted reports that 12 Su-35 jets would be delivered imminently, which had been circulated in Iranian media and later retracted by the country’s Student News Network (SNN). Similar expectations were reported earlier in January 2023, indicating that the jets would arrive by March, yet the deliveries were postponed. Despite these delays, confidence in the eventual delivery of Su-35 fighter jets remains strong, bolstered by Iran’s successful procurement of Yak-130 trainers and Mil Mi-28 helicopters in November 2023. The Su-35’s specifications include enhanced avionics and radar systems designed for both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. The aircraft has a maximum speed of Mach 2.25 and an operational range of 3,600 kilometers, featuring an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar that allows for tracking multiple targets. As part of these efforts, the Yak-130 trainer has been integrated into the fleet alongside the planned acquisition of Su-35 fighter jets. These additions represent a significant step in Iran’s strategy to upgrade its air capabilities amid ongoing scrutiny and increasing attention to its defense partnerships with Russia.

Three NATO Countries Commit to Lithuania in Air Defense Rotation Agreement	The Lithuanian Ministry of Defense has confirmed that starting next year, three NATO allies will send their air defense systems as part of a rotational deployment. Details, shared by Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas on Žinių Radijas radio, indicate that these rotations aim to ensure a nearly continuous presence of NATO’s air defense capabilities in the Baltic states. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kasčiūnas confirmed that the Netherlands would be among the participating countries, though he did not specify the others (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) Kasčiūnas confirmed that the Netherlands would be among the participating countries, though he did not specify the others. When asked about potential Swedish involvement—particularly relevant as Lithuania strengthens military ties with Sweden through the acquisition of CV90 infantry fighting vehicles—the minister stated he could not confirm this possibility at this time. Germany, with its advanced Patriot systems and strong commitment to regional security, is a likely participant, as are the United States, which also has significant air defense capabilities. Poland, neighboring Lithuania, possesses modern Patriot systems and could be another key actor in these rotations. Additionally, France, equipped with SAMP/T systems, and potentially Sweden, now a NATO member and strengthening military links with Lithuania, are also plausible candidates. The rotational air defense initiative, approved by NATO last year, aims to bolster security in the Baltic Sea region by addressing rising security challenges. This rotation model seeks to offset the lack of permanent air defense systems in the Baltic states by maintaining a steady presence of allied forces, providing enhanced protection against potential threats. The Netherlands has previously deployed its long-range Patriot system at Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania this summer as part of the BALTCON24 exercise. This deployment marked a significant step toward closer cooperation between the two nations. Kasčiūnas also mentioned the possibility of a regular Patriot deployment from the Netherlands for exercises in Lithuania, underscoring the strategic value of this partnership. Alongside NATO's rotational deployments, Lithuania is actively strengthening its own air defense. Two agreements signed in October 2024 with European manufacturers reflect this commitment. The first, signed with Saab Dynamics on October 1, secures additional short-range air defense systems, RBS 70 NG, based on portable missiles, for approximately €130 million. These systems offer increased mobility and responsiveness against low-altitude aerial threats. The second agreement, concluded with Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace, involves the acquisition of the NASAMS medium-range system, valued at around €234 million. Originally scheduled for 2030, this acquisition was advanced by seven years through additional funding, allowing for early deployment of these essential capabilities. NASAMS will enhance the air defense of Lithuanian armed forces, providing improved coverage against mid-range aerial threats. These initiatives align with Lithuania’s defense strategy to reduce reliance on allied capabilities for air defense and reinforce collective security in the region. NATO's decision to take responsibility for the Baltic Sea region’s rotational air defense, in collaboration with member states, further demonstrates the Alliance’s commitment to safeguarding the Baltic countries against potential threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/three-nato-countries-commit-to-lithuania-in-air-defense-rotation-agreement	2024-10-25T02:26:06-07:00

South Korea reveals supersonic air-to-surface missile to strengthen fighter jets exports	On October 24, 2024, at the Sacheon Air Show, the South Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) unveiled a supersonic air-to-surface missile for the first time. This unveiling comes amidst concerns over delays in weapons integration, which have affected the export competitiveness of domestic fighter jets such as the FA-50 and the KF-21. However, the new missile offers promising export potential and may help strengthen the position of Korean defense exports in international markets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. (Picture source: YouTube/슈퍼소닉TV) The supersonic air-to-surface missile is designed to be mounted on aircraft and can strike key ground targets with precision from long range. Similar to missiles like the Cheonryong developed by LIG Nex1 and Germany’s Taurus, this missile performs the same fundamental task. However, unlike subsonic air-to-surface missiles that fly at speeds of 700–1,100 km/h, the newly unveiled missile reaches supersonic speeds of Mach 2.5, or around 3,000 km/h, making it much harder to detect and intercept. With a range of 300 km, the missile can hit its target in just about five minutes after launch, significantly reducing the reaction time for enemy defenses. The missile is also expected to incorporate stealth technology, making it less detectable by enemy radar. One of the key features enabling such high speeds is the ducted ramjet engine. This innovative propulsion system combines the advantages of jet and rocket engines, using atmospheric oxygen instead of carrying an onboard oxidizer. This design not only simplifies the structure but also allows for longer burn times and faster speeds compared to traditional jet engines. Another notable characteristic of this missile is its modular design, which enables it to perform multiple functions. By simply swapping modules, the missile can be configured to engage either ground targets or enemy ships. The missile’s seeker, equipped with both radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, further enhances its ability to accurately strike targets in various weather conditions and amidst electronic countermeasures. Although the missile displayed at the air show was a test model rather than a final product, it represents a significant step forward. Weapons intended for aircraft integration typically require extensive software development and flight testing, which incurs substantial costs. To address this, ADD has been using test models for preliminary drop and flight tests. Flight tests of this new missile are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. (Picture source: 23.BLT) According to the data released by ADD, the missile has been under development since 2022, with full completion expected by 2026. Flight tests are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. Key defense contractors such as Hanwha Aerospace and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) are participating in the missile's development. Once integrated with the FA-50, the supersonic air-to-surface missile will offer an unparalleled capability within its class, significantly boosting the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jet. In contrast, rival jets like the F-16V and JAS-39E Gripen currently only operate subsonic air-to-surface missiles. While France’s Rafale can carry supersonic air-to-surface missiles, these are equipped with nuclear warheads, making them unsuitable for export. As a result, the supersonic missile will be an exclusive asset for the FA-50 and KF-21. Countries that have already purchased the FA-50, such as Poland, are expected to express interest in this missile as well. For instance, the South Korean Air Force (ROKAF) first deployed the FA-50 in 2014, assigning 20 units to an Air Force wing. ROKAF ordered a total of 60 FA-50s, and in 2014, the aircraft successfully conducted a test firing of an AGM-65 Maverick missile. Indonesia signed a contract in 2011 for 16 T-50i aircraft, a variant of the FA-50 with light attack capabilities, followed by additional orders in 2021. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute to the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jets. (Picture source: Twitter/KalisGo) Iraq also signed a contract for 24 FA-50IQ variants in 2013, receiving the first batch in 2017, though operational challenges delayed their deployment until 2022. The Philippine Air Force procured 12 FA-50PH units in 2014, and since 2017, these aircraft have been used in various combat operations, including airstrikes against terrorist positions. Additional orders are being considered as part of the PAF's Flight Plan 2028. Several other countries have purchased or shown interest in the FA-50. Thailand ordered a total of 12 T-50TH units, with deliveries starting in 2018. Poland is acquiring 48 FA-50 aircraft to replace its aging MiG-29 and Su-22 fleets, with deliveries beginning in 2023. Malaysia finalized a contract for 18 FA-50 Block 20 aircraft in 2023, with the possibility of future orders. Other nations expressing interest or considering the FA-50 include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brunei, Colombia, Croatia, Egypt, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, Spain, Slovakia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Vietnam. Some of these countries have explored options for joint production, while others are considering the FA-50 for advanced tactical and training purposes. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute not only to the enhancement of military power but also to the growth of defense exports. By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles.

US Marines Integrate Moving Stock Aiming System to Enhance Rifle Accuracy Against Drones	The U.S. Marines are exploring an automated targeting system for standard infantry rifles, aimed at improving every soldier’s capacity to defend against the rising threat of drones on the battlefield. The ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS) innovation incorporates an automatic adjustment mechanism to fine-tune the aiming point, optimizing precision against unmanned aerial threats. Currently undergoing tests with the 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii, this equipment marks a significant advancement for accurately targeting moving threats, which are often challenging to counter through traditional methods. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marine fires a ZeroMark Fire Control System attached to an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle during a live-fire demonstration on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Oct. 23, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Developed by New York-based startup ZeroMark, founded in 2022, the ZeroMark FCS has received investment from prominent backers, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Ground Up Ventures, and benefits from $7 million in funding for research and development. The system relies on sophisticated machine vision technology, with electro-optical cameras and LiDAR sensors to detect and track targets in real time. The system’s distinct feature lies in its motorized buttstock, which adjusts the rifle’s angle to optimize shooting accuracy, allowing the shooter to target drones more effectively. Unlike existing assisted-aiming systems like the SMASH 2000 series from Israeli firm Smart Shooter, ZeroMark’s FCS uses advanced vision algorithms to steer the weapon’s barrel, even making slight angular adjustments to maximize shot alignment. ZeroMark’s technology, described as a 'fire control system,' includes a small computer and motorized stock. CEO Joel Anderson explains that this motorized stock creates a virtual pivot between the shoulder and rifle, allowing small degree adjustments to refine shot trajectory and compensate for both drone and shooter movement, as well as variations caused by noise or torque. Installation on any rifle takes just 30 seconds, potentially making drone defense a manageable task for the average soldier. Anderson states that the system 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting an 18-meter-diameter circle,' making such skills accessible to a broader range of soldiers. A former U.S. Navy member and the first security director of MongoDB, Anderson says he drew inspiration for ZeroMark after driving a Tesla with autopilot and wondering why similar technology wasn’t available to soldiers. Seeing a growing need for anti-drone solutions, he presented the prototype to a16z partners, who encouraged him to launch the startup in 2022. ZeroMark’s development is focused solely on countering offensive drones. While acknowledging that the concept of a weapon 'that never misses' may be controversial, Anderson clarifies that the company avoids marketing its systems to law enforcement, stating: 'I don’t believe the world is ready for that, nor am I. I don’t want to see AI-enabled weapons in police hands.' To mitigate potential misuse, the company has incorporated remote management, license-based activation, and fleet management features to ensure responsible use. FCS units are already in use by private security firms to protect assets like boats against potential drone threats related to piracy. ZeroMark is in talks to send its devices to Ukraine and is engaging in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense for testing and evaluation that could lead to larger orders. Beyond self-targeting capabilities, Anderson envisions ZeroMark software being applied in other contexts, such as cameras capable of identifying drone types, origin, or payload. In the long term, he envisions integrating the system into head-up displays or auditory interfaces to deliver real-time critical information to soldiers. Anderson sums up his vision: 'Large systems like aircraft carriers don’t win wars. They help project power but don’t capture Husseins, don’t kill Bin Ladens, don’t bring hostages home; soldiers do... and I want them to be as untouchable as an F-22 in the sky.'	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-marines-integrate-moving-stock-aiming-system-to-enhance-rifle-accuracy-against-drones	2024-10-25T00:50:07-07:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Qatar’s Mirage 2000-5 aircraft, consisting of nine single-seaters and three two-seaters, were originally delivered in 1997. These aircraft have been maintained in a way that allows for substantial remaining operational life. They took part in NATO’s Odyssey Dawn operation over Libya in 2011, enforcing a no-fly zone. Despite Qatar's decision to retire these aircraft, they remain in good condition. Qatar's modernization program includes acquiring more advanced multirole aircraft like the Boeing F-15QA and Eurofighter Typhoon, reducing the country’s dependence on the Mirage 2000s. Price remains a significant sticking point in the negotiations. Qatar is asking for ₹4,160,000,000 (approximately $49,920,000) per aircraft, while the IAF is seeking a price closer to ₹3,000,000,000 (approximately $36,000,000) per aircraft, which would include spare engines and additional MICA air-to-air missiles. Some within the IAF support delaying the purchase to focus on developing the domestically produced Tejas MkII fighter, which offers a projected service life of 40 years and could potentially lower operational costs. However, the Tejas MkII is still under development, and the gap it would leave in the IAF's fighter capability may require interim solutions such as the Mirage 2000-5. The decision on whether to proceed with the procurement of the Qatari Mirage 2000s will depend on the IAF's analysis of cost-effectiveness, operational compatibility, and long-term strategic objectives. Negotiations continue, with both sides working to reach an agreement that addresses India's fighter jet needs within its budget constraints. If the deal with Qatar is finalized, the IAF's Mirage 2000 fleet would increase to 60 aircraft.

(Picture source: French Air Force) In the early 1980s, India sought to counter Pakistan's acquisition of F-16 fighters by acquiring a comparable aircraft. After reviewing available options, India chose the Mirage 2000 based on its design and performance. In 1982, an order for 36 Mirage 2000H and four Mirage 2000TH aircraft was placed with Dassault, and deliveries occurred between 1985 and 1994. The Mirage 2000 became an integral part of the IAF’s fleet. Although India initially considered domestic production of the Mirage 2000, this plan was set aside in favor of continuing defense cooperation with the Soviet Union, resulting in the acquisition of the MiG-29. In 2011, India approved an upgrade of its Mirage 2000 fleet to the Mirage 2000-5 Mk.2 standard, adding improvements to avionics, radar, electronic warfare systems, and the integration of MICA missiles. The Mirage 2000 was used during the 1999 Kargil War as part of Operation Safed Sagar, flying over 500 sorties for airstrikes. It was also deployed during the 2001–02 India-Pakistan standoff, where it used precision-guided bombs against Pakistani bunkers. In 2019, 12 Mirage 2000s were used in an airstrike on an alleged terrorist camp in Balakot, marking the first time since 1971 that IAF fighters entered Pakistani airspace. During the 2020 China-India standoff, Mirage 2000Is were deployed along the Line of Actual Control after the Galwan Valley skirmish. In 2021, India purchased retired Mirage 2000 airframes from France for parts to maintain its fleet, with the deal valued at ₹3,000,000,000 (approximately $36,000,000). This was intended to maintain the operational readiness of the IAF’s Mirage squadrons by securing spare parts. The Mirage 2000 is a single-seat multirole fighter, measuring 14.36 meters in length, 9.13 meters in wingspan, and 5.2 meters in height.

The Qader-2, an upgraded version of Iran's Qader-1 missile, was specifically engineered for precision strikes and enhanced destructive capability. It boasts a maximum range of approximately 300 kilometers, surpassing the 200-kilometer range of its predecessor, making it more versatile in targeting deeper Israeli territory. The missile's pinpoint accuracy, reportedly within five meters, gives Hezbollah a tactical advantage in hitting strategic and critical infrastructure targets with high precision. According to the Iranian Press Agency, Hezbollah launched these missiles in response to air strikes on Lebanese territory in recent days. The Qader-2 missiles were part of a broader missile barrage that included Nasr 1 missiles, aimed at the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Iran has been a critical supporter of Hezbollah, providing the group with financial, military, and logistical backing for decades. This support includes the supply of advanced weaponry, such as the Qader and other ballistic missiles, which significantly enhance Hezbollah’s military capabilities. Iran's Revolutionary Guard plays a pivotal role in training Hezbollah fighters and aiding in the development of their missile programs, including the construction of underground launch sites. This relationship allows Hezbollah to maintain a robust arsenal and operational infrastructure, enabling it to challenge Israeli forces and carry out sophisticated attacks. Iran’s support of Hezbollah is part of its broader strategy to exert influence in the region and confront Israel indirectly through proxy forces. What makes this attack particularly concerning is the method of deployment. The Qader-2 missiles were fired from underground silos, demonstrating Hezbollah's increasing reliance on concealed and hardened launch sites. This tactic complicates efforts to detect and intercept such missiles, making it more difficult for Israel's missile defense systems to neutralize before launch. The use of underground missile sites underscores Hezbollah's capability to strike while minimizing exposure to counterstrikes. The Qader-2 missile represents a significant leap in Hezbollah's military technology, enhanced to meet the group’s specific operational needs. With an increased range, accuracy, and destructive power, these missiles enable Hezbollah to carry out more precise attacks on Israeli territory, including heavily fortified areas. This latest round of missile strikes marks a new chapter in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, intensifying regional tensions as both sides continue to escalate their military actions. As Hezbollah deploys more advanced weaponry like the Qader-2 from underground silos, the threat to Israeli cities and infrastructure grows, raising the stakes in the ongoing confrontation. The key threat to Israel from Hezbollah's missile attacks lies in the advanced technology and tactics the group employs. Missiles like the Qader-2, with an extended range of up to 300 kilometers and precision targeting within five meters, can strike deep into Israeli territory, including densely populated cities and critical infrastructure. Hezbollah's use of underground silos for launching these missiles makes detection and pre-emptive strikes difficult, reducing Israel's ability to neutralize threats before launch. Despite Israel's sophisticated air defense systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling, the sheer volume of missile barrages combined with Hezbollah's ability to conceal launch sites strains these defenses, increasing the likelihood of successful strikes and further complicating Israel’s military response.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-hezbollah-launches-qader-2-missiles-from-underground-silos-targeting-israel	2024-10-24T02:18:21-07:00

US confirms 3000 North Korean soldiers moved to Russia for military training	On October 23, 2024, during a press conference, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the deployment of these 3,000 North Korean soldiers to eastern Russia. According to reports, these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan region in North Korea to Vladivostok, a major port in eastern Russia. They were then transferred to various military training centers in eastern Russia, where they are currently undergoing intensive training. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning (Picture source: KNCA) The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning. Fears of these troops engaging in combat alongside Russian forces have heightened concerns about further escalation in the war in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin echoed this concern, stating that this development would be a 'serious step' after North Korea had already supplied arms to Russia. The exact nature of the North Korean soldiers' mission, who are currently in training, remains unclear. This situation arises as Russia seeks to bolster its military capabilities in a conflict that has become protracted. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, the war has escalated, causing significant casualties on both sides, while remaining largely focused on the eastern front of Ukraine. The potential arrival of North Korean soldiers could mark a significant shift in this war of attrition. The U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation and has briefed Ukrainian authorities as well as international partners. Kirby added that should these North Korean soldiers enter combat, they would become 'legitimate targets' for the Ukrainian forces. The deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia is seen by many observers as a sign of weakness on the part of the Kremlin. The decision to turn to Pyongyang, a largely isolated state on the international stage, reflects the difficult position in which Moscow finds itself after more than two years of conflict. Relying on North Korean human resources further highlights Russia’s growing dependence on marginal alliances, even as its losses on the battlefield continue to mount. The South Korean government, for its part, has expressed concern about the potential military technology Russia might offer North Korea in exchange for this military support. Some experts suggest that Moscow could provide advanced military technologies to Pyongyang, particularly in the areas of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which would significantly enhance the threat posed by North Korea to the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has also indicated that this deployment could involve up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers by the end of the year. Despite denials from both Moscow and Pyongyang regarding troop deployments or arms transfers, the international community, especially NATO, views this growing military alliance between Russia and North Korea as a major concern. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been invited to Brussels to share intelligence on these developments with NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-confirms-3000-north-korean-soldiers-moved-to-russia-for-military-training	2024-10-24T01:10:49-07:00

A helicopter was also utilized in the exercise to deliver materials onto the ship, showcasing the vessel’s air replenishment capability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link China Type 093A comprehensive supply ship Kekexilihu. (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The Type 903A supply ships are integral to the PLA Navy’s logistics, designed to support naval operations through extensive replenishment functions. The Kekexilihu is equipped to deliver a wide array of supplies, including fuel and essential materials, while also facilitating helicopter operations. Replenishment operations Replenishment at sea (RAS) plays a crucial role in modern naval warfare by enabling fleets to remain operational far from their home bases for extended periods. This capability extends the endurance of naval forces by allowing them to resupply with fuel, ammunition, food, and other essential stores without returning to port, thus maintaining their presence in the operational area and maximizing combat effectiveness. During major naval campaigns like World War II, RAS allowed fleets, such as the U.S. Navy’s Task Force 58, to remain engaged in continuous operations, including long-range strikes against Japan, by refueling and resupplying at sea. The ability to conduct underway replenishments meant that fleets could avoid the lengthy transit times to distant bases, which would otherwise limit their operational tempo. By the end of the war, the U.S. had refined RAS to include not just fuel but also ordnance, enabling sustained high-tempo operations over vast distances​. In more recent conflicts, such as the Falklands War, the critical nature of RAS was highlighted when the British Navy operated 7,000 miles from home. The success of this operation relied heavily on the Navy’s ability to sustain its fleet through effective resupply at sea. Similarly, today’s complex naval missions—ranging from humanitarian aid to high-intensity conflict—depend on the logistical support provided by RAS to maintain forward-deployed naval forces​. Moreover, replenishment operations are not without risks. Ships involved in RAS are highly vulnerable, as their ability to maneuver is limited while they are connected for resupply. This vulnerability underscores the importance of coordination, precision, and technology, as modern RAS systems increasingly emphasize safety and reliability​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-supply-ship-kekexilihu-conducts-helicopter-replenishment-during-maritime-drill-in-yellow-sea	2024-10-24T00:50:54-07:00	
Leave SCAF for GCAP: Germany’s Growing Alliance with UK in Combat Drone Technology	The strategic relationship between Germany and the United Kingdom has taken on new following the announcement of the Trinity House Agreement on October 23, 2024. This defense agreement focuses on joint development efforts, particularly creating a combat drone. The collaboration between the two countries could signal a shift in Germany's defense alignment, as it also encompasses areas related to both the SCAF (Système de Combat Aérien du Futur) and GCAP (Global Combat Air Programme) projects. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance (Picture source: Leonardo ) In November 2023, rumors surfaced suggesting that Germany might abandon the SCAF program in favor of joining GCAP. Despite official denials, the Trinity House Agreement seems to bolster these claims by intensifying defense ties between Germany and the UK, including joint land-based weapons projects and drone development. The SCAF Project, also known as FCAS (Future Combat Air System), is a large-scale European initiative involving France, Germany, and Spain. It aims to develop a next-generation air combat system, expected to be operational around 2040. This program is based on a 'system of systems' approach, including three main components: the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), unmanned systems called Remote Carriers (RC), and a digital infrastructure known as the Combat Cloud. The NGF, led by Dassault Aviation, will serve as the central platform for advanced combat missions, assisted by RC drones that provide specific support capabilities. The Combat Cloud will enable integrated communication between all system elements, optimizing data management and decision-making, even in contested environments. The objective is to strengthen European technological sovereignty and ensure autonomous defense capabilities for future threats. The GCAP Project, launched in 2022, is a competing initiative led by the UK, Italy, and Japan. The goal is to develop a sixth-generation fighter that can operate alongside unmanned systems, combat drones, and advanced intelligent weapons. Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance. The project aims to replace the UK and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons and Japan's Mitsubishi F-2 by 2035. It benefits from industrial expertise provided by partners such as BAE Systems, Leonardo, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries​. While both programs aim to develop next-generation air combat capabilities, they differ in structure and ambition. SCAF focuses on enhancing European interoperability between existing platforms like the Rafale and Eurofighter, while GCAP involves broader cooperation with a focus on transnational alliances beyond Europe. However, delays in the SCAF program could lead to Germany reorienting part of its efforts toward projects that address its more immediate needs. The Trinity House Agreement, presented by the UK Ministry of Defense as a significant step for European security, underscores the growing importance of cooperation between the two largest European defense investors. In addition to enhanced joint exercises, the agreement includes provisions to protect critical underwater infrastructure and marks the first-ever temporary deployment of German P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in Scotland, bolstering the UK's surveillance capabilities. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon (Picture source: Army Recognition) A major component of this agreement is the defense industry collaboration, including plans for a large-caliber weapons manufacturing facility in the UK and joint work on ground-based drones (UGVs). This initiative could pave the way for British participation in the Franco-German MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) project. The agreement also emphasizes the rapid development of new, more precise long-range weapons systems. Although the German Defense Ministry has been vague on this point, these projects could fall under the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, which the UK recently joined. The Trinity House Agreement also touches on air defense cooperation, with plans to integrate British and German systems to better protect European airspace from long-range missile threats. Despite the UK's current limitations in this domain, as noted in a recent report, this cooperation could enhance collective security in Europe. One of the most notable aspects of this agreement is the commitment to developing autonomous aerial drones that can operate in coordination with fighter aircraft. Although Germany had initially planned to collaborate with France on the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS) project, Berlin's decision to purchase P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Boeing ended that initiative. The agreement with the UK could signal a shift toward solutions more tailored to the specific needs of both nations. The German Ministry of Defense clarified that these drones will be developed in close cooperation with allies, particularly France, as part of SCAF's third pillar, which Germany oversees. This pillar focuses on drones and connected effectors. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon. Although the technical details of this project remain undisclosed, it appears to align with the goals of the Trinity House Agreement. Finally, supporting Ukraine remains a central objective for both countries. This agreement reaffirms their commitment to providing Ukraine with the military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Concrete initiatives include integrating modern missile systems into the Sea King helicopters donated by Germany and closer collaboration between the UK and German defense industries to support Ukraine's war effort.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/leave-scaf-for-gcap-germanys-growing-alliance-with-uk-in-combat-drone-technology	2024-10-24T00:27:21-07:00

The SA-35MM combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system and a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The TUGA radar, part of the hybrid fire control system, operates on continuous wave modulation by frequency (FMCW) with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna in the X-band. This radar technology uses low transmitted signal power, making it difficult to detect by enemy reconnaissance devices, thus increasing operational security. Despite its low power and compact size, the TUGA radar has a detection range from 50 meters to 50 kilometers and can detect small drones at distances up to 5 kilometers. The development of this artillery system is a collaborative effort involving Pit-Radwar, the Military University of Technology, and the defense company Mesko. The project is co-financed by Poland's National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR), as part of Competition no. 12/2022 for projects in development works for state defense and security. The Tactical and Technical Assumptions have been approved by the AU Chief, with the objective to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system. The implementation period spans from December 20, 2022, to June 20, 2025. During the congress, Pit-Radwar conducted demonstrations showcasing the system's capabilities. One test involved targeting a small unmanned aerial vehicle located 1,000 meters away, with an angular size of 0.5x2.0 milliradians. The AG-35 cannon achieved a dispersion of no more than 0.5 milliradians, closely matching the dimensions of the drone, demonstrating the system's precision. Field test results indicated that achieving a 99% probability of hitting the target with at least one projectile required firing 24 rounds of typical TP-T/FAPDS-T ammunition. In contrast, using programmable ABM ammunition, firing only seven projectiles achieved a probability of hitting at the level of 97%, with each projectile releasing over 50 subprojectiles. This represents a significant reduction in ammunition consumption while maintaining a high probability of target destruction. The objective is to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system, before June 20, 2025. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) Pit-Radwar proposed integrating the 35mm cannon into self-propelled artillery systems mounted on the AS-35 wheeled chassis.

British army Intel Reports Russia's Escalation in Use of One-Way Attack Drones Against Ukraine	According to a report published by the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) Intelligence Service on September 23, 2024, Russia launched over 1,300 One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (OWA-UAVs) into Ukraine during September alone. This marks the highest number of such drone strikes in a single month since the beginning of the conflict, signaling a significant escalation in the use of these unmanned aerial systems. The British MoD warns that, based on the current rate of operations, it is almost certain that Russia will surpass this figure in October 2024, reflecting a growing trend of intensified aerial assaults against Ukrainian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Debris of a Russian Shahed-136 (Geran-2) drone scattered across a Ukrainian field. (Picture source: Russian Social Network) While it remains unclear whether Russia can sustain this aggressive rate of OWA-UAV (One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles ) strikes throughout the year, intelligence reports suggest that Moscow is likely expanding its capacity to produce these drones domestically. Previously reliant on Iranian-supplied UAVs, Russia is believed to be increasing its production capabilities to maintain and even amplify its ability to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine. This shift in supply lines is seen as part of a broader strategy to mitigate the risks of sanctions and supply chain disruptions, giving Moscow a more resilient capability to sustain its drone warfare efforts. OWA-UAVs, often colloquially referred to as 'kamikaze drones,' are primarily employed to strike critical Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly energy facilities. These drones, due to their low cost and ability to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory, have proven effective in disrupting energy supplies and damaging critical civilian infrastructure, particularly ahead of the harsh winter months. This has put enormous pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems, which are tasked with countering both conventional missile strikes and these swarming UAVs. In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, several Russian One-Way Attack (OWA) drones, or loitering munitions, have been deployed, each with specific technical features. The Shahed-136 (Russian designation: Geran-2), developed by Iran, is one of the most frequently used OWA drones. It is known for its delta-wing design, giving it a distinctive appearance. The Shahed-136 is powered by a small engine, typically the MD-550, and has a range of about 2,500 kilometers. It carries a warhead of approximately 40-50 kilograms and is designed to strike static targets such as infrastructure and supply depots. While its speed is relatively low (about 185 km/h), its main strength lies in the ability to be deployed in large numbers, making it difficult for defense systems to intercept all of them​. The Shahed-131 (Russian designation: Geran-1) is a smaller version of the Shahed-136 and shares much of the same design, though with a smaller payload and range. It has a range of about 900 kilometers and carries a warhead weighing around 10-15 kilograms. It also features a delta-wing design and is primarily used for shorter-range attacks on military targets​. Russia’s domestically produced Lancet drone, developed by ZALA Aero, features more advanced targeting capabilities compared to the Shahed drones. The Lancet is equipped with electro-optical systems for greater precision and can carry a payload of up to 3 kilograms, depending on the model. It has a range of up to 40 kilometers and a speed of about 110 km/h. It is designed for tactical strikes on specific targets such as artillery, vehicles, and air defense systems. The Lancet’s modular design allows it to be used for both surveillance and attack missions​. Each of these drones plays a crucial role in Russia’s strategy in Ukraine, especially in targeting rear positions and forcing Ukraine to expend significant resources on air defense. Despite their widespread use, many of these drones have been intercepted by Ukrainian defense systems, but their low cost and mass deployment make them a persistent threat​. The increased tempo of drone attacks is likely aimed at exhausting Ukrainian air defense resources, compelling Ukraine to divert attention from other threats, such as ballistic and cruise missile strikes. In addition, these drone assaults are part of Russia's broader strategy to weaken Ukraine’s economic resilience, particularly by targeting its energy grid. The surge in drone attacks is raising significant concerns in Kyiv and among Ukraine's Western allies. Ukrainian officials have warned that the continuous targeting of energy infrastructure could lead to widespread blackouts, severely impacting both civilian life and military operations. As winter approaches, such attacks on power stations, substations, and other critical utilities could lead to further humanitarian challenges, especially in regions already hard-hit by the war. Ukraine has requested additional Western support, particularly in the form of advanced air defense systems capable of intercepting these UAVs. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are working to adapt their tactics to counter the evolving drone threat, employing electronic warfare and anti-drone systems to mitigate the impact. As Russia escalates its OWA-UAV campaign, Ukraine faces increasing pressure on multiple fronts. The British MoD’s report highlights not only the unprecedented scale of these drone attacks but also the potential for further intensification as Russia builds up its domestic production capabilities. With winter looming and infrastructure already under strain, the coming months could prove to be a critical period in the ongoing conflict, with both sides seeking to gain the upper hand in a war of attrition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/british-army-intel-reports-russias-escalation-in-use-of-one-way-attack-drones-against-ukraine	2024-10-23T01:58:54-07:00

UK’s first E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft receives VIII Squadron livery and NATO markings	On October 17, 2024, the Royal Air Force (RAF) marked a significant event as its first E-7 AEW&amp;C (Airborne Early Warning and Control) aircraft, built by Boeing UK, rolled out from Southend Airport. This is the first time the E-7 has been painted in RAF livery. The aircraft, designated WT001, carries the markings of VIII Squadron, which is set to operate the Wedgetail. The squadron’s badge, a sheathed Arabian dagger known as a Jambiya, reflects its long association with Arabia, a symbol approved by King George VI in 1943 to signify their role.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The VIII squadron’s badge, a sheathed Arabian dagger known as a Jambiya, reflects its long association with Arabia, a symbol approved by King George VI in 1943 to signify their role. (Picture source: British MoD) In addition to RAF roundels and markings, the aircraft bears the emblem of NATO’s Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Force (NAEW&amp;CF), linking the UK’s Wedgetail with NATO’s airborne surveillance mission. The E-7 has been selected by NATO as its next command and control aircraft, and the RAF’s Wedgetails will contribute to NATO’s Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Force. After departing Southend Airport, the Wedgetail returned to STS Aviation Services in Birmingham for additional modifications and is scheduled to undergo further testing and evaluation before entering full service in 2025. This aircraft will serve as the most advanced AEW&amp;C platform for the RAF, providing the UK with expanded airborne surveillance capabilities to improve situational awareness. Wing Commander McDonnell, Officer Commanding VIII Squadron, noted the significance of the UK’s first painted Wedgetail, highlighting that it represents a step toward achieving operational capability. The RAF’s Wedgetail fleet will operate under No. 8 Squadron and be stationed at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, alongside the nine Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Both the Wedgetail and Poseidon are based on the Boeing 737-700 increased gross weight (IGW) airframe, known for its reliability and reduced maintenance requirements. The 737 series benefits from a global supplier base and support network, which supports the long-term operation of these fleets. RAF Lossiemouth has undergone infrastructure upgrades to accommodate the Wedgetail, including a maintenance facility built by McLaughlin &amp; Harvey. This facility supports both the Wedgetail and Poseidon fleets, and at its peak employed over 175 people, with involvement from five Scottish subcontractors. The facility was officially opened in September 2024 and is expected to support the AEW&amp;C fleet for at least 20 years. The first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. (Picture source: Boeing) The UK’s decision to acquire the E-7 began in October 2018, when the British government entered discussions with Boeing to replace its aging E-3D Sentry fleet. These discussions also involved potential cooperation with Australia, which already operated the Wedgetail. The decision to proceed without a competitive tender process led to some criticism, including concerns over favoritism toward Boeing. Saab, a competitor, expressed opposition, stating it could offer its Erieye system on an Airbus A330 MRTT platform. Despite this, in March 2019, the UK finalized a $1.98 billion deal (approximately $2.33 billion in 2023) to purchase five Wedgetail AEW1 aircraft. In December 2020, reports indicated that the UK might reduce its Wedgetail order from five to three aircraft. This reduction was confirmed in the 2021 Integrated Defence Review, raising concerns that only one aircraft might be available for operational tasking at a time. However, in February 2023, Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston suggested the order might eventually increase to five aircraft depending on future requirements. Initially, Marshall Aerospace was selected to carry out airframe modifications, but the company withdrew in May 2020. Boeing then contracted STS Aviation Group’s UK branch to complete the modifications in Birmingham, where more than 100 specialists are converting two commercial airliners, with the remaining aircraft being newly built. Each conversion takes around 24 months, and the first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. Sharing key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER, the E-7 has undergone several modifications to fulfill its AEW&amp;C role, including the addition of ventral fins to balance the radar’s weight and countermeasures mounted on the nose, wingtips, and tail. (Picture source: British MoD) The E-7 Wedgetail shares key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER and is intended to provide the UK with AEW&amp;C capabilities beyond those offered by ground-based systems and fighter aircraft sensors.

India quietly launches fourth nuclear missile submarine amid rising maritime focus	According to information published by Hindustan Times on October 22, 2024, India has launched its fourth nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), codenamed S4*.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the Arihant-class submarine S4*. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The launch, which occurred on October 16 at the Ship Building Centre (SBC) in Visakhapatnam, was conducted quietly amidst ongoing diplomatic tensions with Canada. The event came just a day after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Very Low Frequency Naval Station in Telangana, aimed at enhancing command and communications with the Navy's strategic assets. The S4* SSBN is an advanced model in India's Arihant-class submarines, with nearly 75% indigenous content. Equipped with K-4 nuclear ballistic missiles, the submarine significantly enhances India’s strike capability, boasting a range of 3,500 kilometers. This places it well above the earlier INS Arihant, which carries shorter-range K-15 missiles. The S4* is the last of the current class, following the earlier vessels INS Arihant, INS Arighat, and the soon-to-be-commissioned INS Aridhaman. India’s focus on strengthening its SSBN fleet underscores its strategic shift towards undersea nuclear deterrence. Given the vulnerability of surface assets like aircraft carriers to long-range missile systems, particularly those fielded by China’s PLA Navy, nuclear-powered submarines provide a critical edge. The Cabinet Committee on Security recently cleared plans to develop two more nuclear attack submarines. India’s investment in both nuclear and conventional submarine capabilities is poised to play a pivotal role in securing its interests in the Indian Ocean Region. The commissioning of the sixth Kalvari-class diesel-electric submarine, INS Vagsheer, later this year, further underscores this trend. Technical data The Arihant and Arighaat displace around 6,000 tons (5,900 long tons; 6,600 short tons) when surfaced, while the S4 and S4* displace approximately 7,000 tons (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons). These submarines also differ in length, with the Arihant and Arighaat measuring 111 meters (364 feet) long, and the S4 stretching to 130 meters (430 feet). All vessels share a beam of 11 meters (36 feet) and a draft of 15 meters (49 feet). Their propulsion system is powered by a single CLWR-B1 pressurized water reactor, delivering 83 MW to a single shaft. This system allows the submarines to reach speeds of 12–15 knots (22–28 km/h) while surfaced, and up to 24 knots (44 km/h) when submerged. The submarines have an unlimited range, restricted only by the need to replenish food supplies, and can dive to a test depth of 450 meters (1,480 feet). Each vessel typically operates with a complement of 95 personnel.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/india-quietly-launches-fourth-nuclear-missile-submarine-amid-rising-maritime-focus	2024-10-22T00:47:14-07:00	
South Korea’s KF-21 and Lockheed Martin’s F-16 shortlisted for Philippines fighter jet contract	The defense market in the Philippines is intensifying as two major competitors, South Korea's KF-21 and the American F-16 from Lockheed Martin, have been shortlisted for the Philippine government’s multirole fighter (MRF) aircraft procurement project. According to an article from The Korea Economic Daily published on October 18, 2024, the KF-21 is considered a strong contender for meeting the Philippines' needs. With an estimated budget of 400 billion Philippine pesos ($6.95 billion), this project aims to address the growing threat China poses in the South China Sea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Only the KF-21 Boramae from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Lockheed Martin's F-16 were shortlisted, setting up a two-way competition (Picture source: KAI/US DOD) The Philippine Air Force launched this project in August, seeking to acquire around 40 multirole fighter jets. In the first phase, a budget of 61.2 billion pesos ($1.1 billion) has been allocated to purchase 10 combat aircraft. Initially, several aircraft were considered, including the Swedish Gripen, the French Rafale, and the European Eurofighter Typhoon. However, only the KF-21 Boramae from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Lockheed Martin's F-16 were shortlisted, setting up a two-way competition. The KF-21, South Korea’s first domestically developed fighter, offers advanced technology. This 4.5-generation fighter features partial stealth capabilities, a maximum payload of 7,700 kilograms, and 10 hardpoints for air-to-air missiles and other weapons. With a top speed of 2,200 km/h and a range of 2,900 kilometers, it is equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems such as the AESA radar and is powered by a GE Aerospace F414 engine. The unit cost of the KF-21 is estimated at $71.5 million, around $36.5 million less than its European competitors like the Typhoon or Rafale. The KF-21 Boramae is a 4.5-generation multirole fighter developed by South Korea to replace older models such as the F-4 Phantom II and KF-5E/F in the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). The project began in the early 2000s and involved several feasibility studies, with international collaboration from Indonesia. The aim of the KF-21 project is to bolster South Korea’s domestic fighter production capabilities and reduce reliance on foreign military technology suppliers. The KF-21 includes several planned variants, such as Block I, Block II, and Block III, along with potential derivatives like the KF-21N (carrier-based version), KF-21EA (electronic warfare variant), and KF-21SA (export version). Block I focuses on air-to-air capabilities, while Block II aims to enhance air-to-ground missions and sensor systems. Block III (KF-21EX) is expected to incorporate more advanced stealth features and integration with unmanned systems. The design of the KF-21 emphasizes reducing its radar cross-section (RCS) and includes provisions for future upgrades, such as full stealth capabilities. The Block I version, scheduled for production between 2024 and 2028, is configured primarily for air-to-air combat with limited air-to-ground capabilities. It features semi-embedded weapons and advanced radar and sensor systems. Forty units are planned for delivery to the ROKAF, with an additional 50 for the Indonesian Air Force. The KF-21’s design includes a delta-wing configuration with canards for improved agility and maneuverability. It also provides for an internal weapons bay in later versions and uses composite materials to reduce weight and optimize performance. Key features include a glass cockpit with a large-area display (LAD) and advanced avionics, such as sensor fusion technology, which integrates data from multiple onboard and external sensors. The aircraft employs a digital Fly-By-Wire (FBW) control system, nonlinear dynamic model inversion control, and safety features such as automatic terrain following and ground collision avoidance systems. It also uses radar-absorbing materials (RAM) and radar-absorbing structures (RAS) to minimize radar visibility. KAI plans to add air-to-ground capabilities by 2028, with mass production of upgraded versions expected to follow (Picture source: KAI) In terms of performance, the KF-21 is powered by the F414-GE-400 engine, providing a thrust-to-weight ratio comparable to the Eurofighter Typhoon. The aircraft is designed for maneuverability, featuring low wing loading and advanced flight control systems to support agility and high-angle-of-attack capabilities. It has a maximum speed of Mach 1.8 and a combat radius of approximately 1,800 kilometers, depending on mission profile and loadout. The KF-21 is equipped with an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, enabling the simultaneous tracking and engagement of multiple targets. This is complemented by an infrared search and track (IRST) system and electro-optical targeting pods (EOTGP) for extended-range aircraft detection and targeting. The avionics suite includes an integrated electronic warfare system with radar warning receivers (RWR), electronic countermeasures (ECM), and countermeasure dispensing systems (CMDS), offering data fusion capabilities to enhance situational awareness and targeting. The KF-21 can carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder, AIM-120 AMRAAM, MBDA Meteor, and IRIS-T missiles. It is equipped with 10 external hardpoints, with plans for an internal weapons bay in future versions. Ground-attack capabilities include guided bombs, anti-ship missiles, and various domestically developed munitions, such as the Cheonryong air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Additionally, the KF-21 is armed with an M61A2 Vulcan cannon for short-range engagements. The F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles (Picture source: US DoD) On the other hand, the F-16 has proven its capabilities on the battlefield. Since its debut in 1978, over 4,500 units have been sold to 25 countries, making it one of the most widely sold fighter jets in the world. However, as a fourth-generation fighter, the F-16 lacks the stealth and advanced electronic warfare systems featured in the KF-21. Its price is estimated at $43 million per unit, making it a less expensive option compared to the South Korean fighter. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is known for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and a range of precision-guided missiles. One of its notable features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing improved detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry various air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfights. With its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X can lock onto targets from extreme angles, making it highly effective in close combat. This combination of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate both long-range and short-range engagements. The F-16 compensates for its older design with better maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures against radar-guided threats. Its agility, combined with helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to target enemies by looking at them, gives the F-16 an advantage in close combat. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, its ability to engage multiple targets at different ranges and its integrated defensive measures provide a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While the Philippines have shown interest in acquiring the F-16, other factors may influence their decision. The country aims to eventually acquire the F-35, regarded as the most advanced fighter jet in operation. The Philippines may choose the F-16 as a stepping stone toward future F-35 procurement. However, the U.S. government strictly controls the sale of the F-35, and some nations, including the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, have had their requests denied. Korea Aerospace Industries is also leveraging its previous success in military aircraft exports. In 2014, KAI delivered 12 FA-50s to the Philippines and has since provided logistical and military support, including maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. Similar models have also been sold to countries such as Poland and Malaysia. KAI hopes to build on this success by offering similar services, including system and weapon upgrades for the KF-21, should the Philippines choose to purchase it. Currently, the KF-21 is limited to air-to-air combat. KAI plans to add air-to-ground capabilities by 2028, with mass production of upgraded versions expected to follow. If KAI secures the contract to supply 10 aircraft to the Philippines, it would mark the first export of the KF-21, a significant milestone for South Korea’s defense industry, which aims to become the third-largest arms exporter within the next five years. The KF-21 Boramae is a joint project between South Korea and Indonesia, aimed at developing a next-generation supersonic fighter with homegrown technology for key components. A prototype was unveiled in April 2021, and mass production is expected to begin by the end of this year, with the first delivery to the South Korean Air Force scheduled for the second half of 2026.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/south-koreas-kf-21-and-lockheed-martins-f-16-shortlisted-for-philippines-fighter-jet-contract	2024-10-22T00:24:05-07:00	
Focus | Russia’s war in Ukraine triggers Sweden’s biggest defense investment since Cold War	On October 15, 2024, the Swedish government introduced its defense strategy for 2025–2030. The plan allocates 170 billion SEK (€14.9 billion) for military defense and 35.7 billion SEK (€3.1 billion) for civil defense, aiming to raise defense spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2028. It also includes a gradual increase in conscription, targeting 10,000 conscripts annually by 2030 and up to 12,000 by 2035​.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2035, the wartime organization of the Swedish Armed Forces is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. (Picture source: Sweden MoD) Sweden’s transition from military neutrality to full NATO membership has evolved over recent years, particularly in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This shift in policy represents a significant change from Sweden’s traditional stance, which had prioritized neutrality during the Cold War. Sweden began enhancing its defense posture in 2015 and further increased support to Ukraine after the invasion. As part of its integration into NATO, Sweden has aligned its national defense strategy with collective defense obligations. This transition has involved increasing military readiness, modernizing key systems, and preparing to support NATO operations. The new plan reflects Sweden’s commitment to NATO’s collective security framework. This article examines the details of Sweden's 2025–2030 defense budget, which includes significant investment in military upgrades, expansion of personnel, and improvements across various defense sectors. The strategy aims to strengthen Sweden’s military capabilities and civil defense infrastructure. Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided approximately €4.2 billion of military aid to Ukraine across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. (Picture source: 45oabr) Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, totaling 48 billion SEK (approximately €4.206.600.000) across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. This experience underscores the importance of maintaining stockpiles and rapidly replenishing donated equipment, which explains why the new defense strategy highlights the need for logistical support in prolonged conflicts. The Swedish government has committed 75 billion SEK (€6.572.812.500) over three years (2024–2026) for military assistance to Ukraine, covering financial donations, soldier training, and procurement through the Defense Materiel Administration. Sweden’s participation in capability coalitions (focusing on drones, maritime security, and demining) further demonstrates its dedication to supporting Ukraine's defense. For Swedish authorities, the conflict also highlights the critical role of civilian defense, emphasizing societal resilience and cyber defense. To protect critical infrastructure, the new defense strategy includes the creation of a national cybersecurity center to counter Russian cyberattacks. Another lesson from Ukraine is the importance of technological adaptability in warfare. Rapid integration of new technologies and modifications to existing systems are seen as crucial. The Ukraine conflict also revealed the high resource consumption associated with intense warfare, particularly in terms of ammunition and other vital supplies. Consequently, Sweden plans to collaborate with the defense industry and government to enhance readiness for innovation, ensuring stockpiles of key materials and systems with long delivery times. Additionally, the strategy recognizes the significance of layered air defense and long-range strike capabilities. The strategy emphasizes improving intelligence, particularly in reconnaissance and surveillance, with the Swedish Air Force set to receive new reconnaissance aircraft. The value of unmanned aerial systems in Ukraine has prompted Sweden to plan for their expanded use in operations to enhance situational awareness and mobility. For instance, this has led BAE Systems Hägglunds and UAV manufacturer Airolit to join forces in integrating autonomous drone surveillance capabilities into the CV90 combat vehicle. The Swedish government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) One of the most critical aspects of Sweden’s defense strategy is the significant expansion of conscription and personnel within the Swedish Armed Forces. By 2035, the wartime organization is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. To achieve this, the annual intake of conscripts will gradually increase, with targets of 10,000 conscripts by 2030 and 12,000 between 2032 and 2035. This expansion highlights the government's view that conscription is essential to maintaining the Swedish Armed Forces at a level sufficient for national defense and meeting NATO commitments under Article 3. The government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. Additionally, a fourth testing center will be established to manage the increased recruitment and testing of conscripts. In line with Sweden's integration into NATO, conscripts may participate in the alliance's collective defense efforts. In an Article 5 scenario, Swedish conscripts could be deployed internationally to support NATO operations. This represents a shift in Sweden’s defense approach, with conscripts expected to contribute to collective defense beyond national borders. The Swedish defense strategy further emphasizes improving the unit turnover system, ensuring operational units remain ready through refresher training exercises. The Total Defense Conscription and Testing Agency will play a key role in reaching the increased conscription targets and preparing the forces for both peacetime and wartime scenarios. Efforts to retain personnel and address current shortages are also part of the strategy. These include increasing the number of professional officers and group leaders, expanding officer training programs, and boosting civilian staffing to free military personnel for tasks requiring specific expertise. By addressing these challenges, Sweden aims to build a defense force capable of fulfilling both national and NATO obligations in the future. Priorities for the Swedish Army include modernizing the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle, acquiring additional combat vehicles and tanks such as the STRV 122 and STRV 123A, and upgrading artillery and air defense systems by 2030. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) By 2030, Sweden plans to have four fully operational brigades, with conscription increasing to 10,000 by 2030 and 12,000 by 2035. The strategy focuses on enhancing the Army's capacity to operate in larger formations, such as divisions and corps, in alignment with NATO’s requirements. New territorial units will be established to support national defense and NATO operations, working alongside the Home Guard. These territorial units, including rifle battalions, communications teams, and support units, will operate independently using equipment from upgraded field units, providing flexibility. Their development will occur between 2025 and 2035. This reorganization aims to align Sweden’s military structure with its new NATO commitments. Modernization efforts will also extend to field units, which will receive additional combat and support resources. This includes two artillery battalions, a rocket artillery unit, and battalions specializing in intelligence, engineering, air defense, and logistics. The procurement of rocket artillery and cruise missiles is a key element of the strategy, enhancing Sweden’s deterrence capabilities for national defense and NATO operations, particularly during crises. The government recognizes the need to improve the Army's readiness, noting that some equipment is nearing the end of its lifecycle. Priorities include modernizing the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle, acquiring additional combat vehicles and tanks such as the STRV 122 and STRV 123A, and upgrading artillery and air defense systems by 2030. To improve the Army's capabilities in areas such as reconnaissance, surveillance, command and control, and fire control, various types of unmanned remotely operated aerial vehicles will also be acquired. By 2030, the Swedish Air Force will retain six fighter squadrons equipped with JAS 39 aircraft, split equally between the JAS 39E variant and the older JAS 39C/D models. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) The Swedish Air Force is set to implement significant upgrades aimed at improving its integration into NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) system. A key focus will be on enhancing control over Sweden’s airspace in coordination with allied forces, with the capacity for rapid responses to potential threats. By 2030, the Air Force will retain six fighter squadrons equipped with JAS 39 aircraft, split evenly between the JAS 39E variant and the older JAS 39C/D models. The Swedish government has recognized the need to make a strategic decision by 2030 regarding the replacement of the JAS 39 fighter jet, requiring broad political consensus and thorough evaluation. Although the JAS 39 is expected to remain in service beyond 2050, the lengthy development timeline of up to 25 years for a new fighter system necessitates early planning. Consequently, the government has tasked the Armed Forces with conducting a concept study. In response, Saab has announced the development of both manned and unmanned fighter concepts, aiming to establish a sixth-generation combat air platform for Sweden's defense needs. This study will assess three potential options: developing a domestic system, collaborating internationally, or procuring a foreign system. The decision, which must be made by 2030, will consider the time needed to specify requirements, develop, and introduce a new system, with long-term financial commitments expected beyond 2035. A parliamentary reference group will be included in the study to ensure the necessary political support. Another aspect of the Air Force's development will involve upgrading airbase infrastructure. Sweden plans to disperse and mobilize air assets across five main airbases, allowing for swift responses to threats and ensuring continuous operations. These efforts include developing a network of national sensor, control, and response systems, modernizing command centers to meet NATO standards, and enhancing the ability to host allied forces. Sweden is also planning to acquire long-range strike capabilities, focusing on procuring munitions and systems to enable extended-range operations in line with NATO’s expectations for mobility and precision strikes. The supply of various ammunition types for air, maritime, and land targets is planned for the 2025–2030 period and beyond. The capability for long-range land attack will be introduced during 2025–2030 within the fighter divisions, in line with the 2020 defense decision. The integration of the S 106 Global Eye airborne early warning and control system will enhance Sweden's detection and tracking capabilities, replacing the older ASC 890, which will be transferred to Ukraine. (Picture source: Saab) Additionally, the integration of the S 106 Global Eye airborne early warning and control system will enhance threat detection and tracking, replacing the older ASC 890, which will be transferred to Ukraine. To address personnel shortages, Sweden will expand its fighter pilot training programs, including some international training opportunities. The Air Force will also replace outdated equipment, such as the Saab 105/SK 60 training aircraft with the Grob G 120 TP (SK 40), and invest in new counter-drone capabilities. The procurement of unmanned aerial systems for reconnaissance and security will be a priority in the coming years. Sweden’s transport aviation capabilities will be bolstered by replacing its six C-130H Hercules (TP 84) aircraft to ensure continued tactical airlift capacity. Additional upgrades will involve reviewing the replacement of the Saab 340B (TP 100) and Gulfstream IV (TP 102) aircraft used for personnel transport and addressing operational challenges with the NH90 Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTP), designated by Sweden as HKP 14. As noted in the document, the HKP 14 has low availability and high operational costs, and its maritime version (HKP 14F) is not yet fully operational. Therefore, the Swedish Armed Forces propose phasing out the land version (HKP 14E) as more Sikorsky UH-60M (HKP 16) units are delivered. The Armed Forces also propose acquiring a new ship-based maritime helicopter for the new Luleå-class surface combat vessels, with the new system to be delivered by 2035 as an integrated part of the vessel’s capabilities. Finally, space operations are an integral part of Sweden’s defense strategy, with plans to enhance capabilities in communication, reconnaissance, and early warning through the acquisition of surveillance satellites, secure satellite communications, and satellite launch capacity from Esrange. These developments support Sweden’s strategic autonomy and its contribution to NATO operations, particularly in the Arctic. The Navy’s surface combat capabilities will be strengthened through the mid-life upgrades of the Visby-class corvettes and the acquisition of new surface combat ships of the Luleå-class between 2025 and 2030. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) The Swedish Navy's role in securing control over maritime areas, particularly in the Baltic Sea region, is a central component of the new defense strategy. Its primary mission is to protect critical sea routes essential for trade and the transport of military units and supplies. This responsibility aligns with Sweden's duties as a NATO member, ensuring open sea routes and supporting the Alliance's deterrence and defense operations. The Navy will maintain high availability, readiness, and operational mobility, enhancing its capabilities both independently and in cooperation with NATO forces. The Navy’s surface combat capabilities will be strengthened through the mid-life upgrades of the Visby-class corvettes. These upgrades include arming the ships with air defense missile systems, improving sensors for air, surface, and underwater surveillance, and enhancing electronic warfare capabilities. The Navy is also gradually introducing command support systems to increase interoperability with NATO. Additionally, the acquisition of new surface combat ships of the Luleå-class is set to begin between 2025 and 2030. These ships will provide extended endurance, enhanced air defense capabilities, and leadership functions at sea. The enhanced air defense system, integrated with the Air Force's command and surveillance systems, will improve Sweden's air defense capability and contribute to NATO's integrated air and missile defense. Mine clearance remains crucial for ensuring mobility for both national and allied forces. Between 2025 and 2030, existing mine clearance vessels will be supplemented with unmanned, autonomous, and remotely controlled systems. The current naval mine clearance systems are outdated, prompting the Armed Forces to initiate studies and concepts to assess future capability needs and replacements. Seagoing platforms, combined with unmanned mine clearance systems, will form the core of this effort. Additionally, the development and procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles will begin. Amphibious units will further specialize in both land and sea operations and will receive new indirect fire capabilities, as well as new vessels to replace the Combat Boat 90H. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) Submarines continue to be critical to Sweden's defense strategy. A life-extension program for Gotland-class submarines is planned for 2025–2030 to maintain their capabilities and increase availability. The production of Blekinge-class submarines will also continue, with preparatory work beginning to eventually replace the Gotland-class submarines during 2025–2030. Amphibious units will further specialize in both land and sea operations and will receive new indirect fire capabilities. Procurement of air defense systems for amphibious units and weapons systems for engaging both land and sea targets will commence. Command systems will be upgraded to achieve greater interoperability. The replacement of older transport boats, including the Combat Boat 90H, will also occur. The ability to support special forces and NATO's special operations using parts of the amphibious units will be further developed.

North Korea Develops Drones Equipped with Reverse-Engineered American Hellfire Missiles	North Korea is intensifying its efforts in military drone development by equipping its unmanned systems with reverse-engineered copies of American Hellfire missiles. This information, shared by Brigadier General Patrick Costello during the 2024 United States Army Association conference, has raised significant concerns in the U.S., particularly regarding the growing threats in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft over the Nevada Test and Training Range and fires an Air-to-Ground Missile-114 Hellfire missile on August 30, 2023 (Picture source: US DoD) According to General Costello, North Korea's newly revealed drones not only resemble U.S. models like the MQ-9 Reaper and the RQ-4 Global Hawk, but they are also equipped with missiles modeled after the AGM-114 Hellfire, a guided air-to-surface missile used on U.S. drones. Costello noted that Pyongyang has focused on developing drones that weigh approximately 600 kilograms or less, fitting into the categories of small to medium-sized drones with multirole capabilities. These statements follow North Korea's display of two drones in July 2023, which garnered attention due to their striking resemblance to U.S. models. While the exact capabilities of these drones and their missiles remain unclear, the U.S. military now believes they were developed with some knowledge of American technologies. Videos released by North Korean state media showed one of the drones firing missiles closely resembling the Hellfire, further drawing comparisons in the West. This development comes as the U.S. military braces for the growing threat posed by drones, a phenomenon that has intensified in recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine. General Costello emphasized that the technological transfers and relationships observed in ongoing conflicts, particularly between North Korea and Russia, warrant close monitoring. Russia, which is engaged in the war in Ukraine, could benefit from North Korea’s new capabilities to bolster its military arsenal. General David Stewart, Director of the Joint Counter-UAS Office, also noted that drone threats have now become an integral part of modern military environments, regardless of the conflict zone. In response, the U.S. Department of Defense has requested a budget of $2.4 billion for unmanned aerial systems in the 2025 fiscal year. Various branches of the U.S. military are also seeking additional funding to develop counter-drone technologies, with an unfunded request for $741 million in this fiscal year alone.

Companies like Anduril, led by Palmer Luckey, have signed multibillion-dollar contracts with U.S. Special Operations Command to provide counter-drone technologies. Recently, the Pentagon awarded the company another $250 million contract for 500 reusable drones and associated jamming technologies. North Korea’s advances in military drones, combined with its progress in missile reverse-engineering, present significant challenges for the U.S. and its allies. Although these North Korean drones are less sophisticated than their American counterparts, they still pose a serious threat in conflict scenarios, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. As the U.S. continues to strengthen its drone defense capabilities, it is becoming evident that mastery of this technology by nations like North Korea could redefine the nature of modern conflicts. U.S. intelligence services recently confirmed the extent of North Korean reverse-engineering during the October 2024 U.S. Army Association conference. At the event, **Business Insider** revealed that North Korea had modeled its Saetbyol-4 and Saetbyol-9 drones after the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These North Korean drones were first observed during a July 2023 military parade, where one was filmed launching missiles similar to the Hellfire. While it remains unclear how Pyongyang acquired these technologies, U.S. officials suspect espionage or the recovery of parts from conflict zones. This situation is especially concerning as North Korea could potentially share these weapons with Russia, aiding Moscow’s war efforts in Ukraine.

Canadian frigate conducts joint transit through Taiwan Strait amid regional tensions	According to information published by the US DoD on October 20, 2024, the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins (DDG 76) and the Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver (FFH 331) completed a joint transit through the Taiwan Strait.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver. (Picture source: Canadian DND) The operation, described as routine by both navies, underscores their commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in this critical waterway, which is claimed by China as part of its territorial waters. The transit occurred amidst heightened military activity in the region, with China recently conducting large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. HMCS Vancouver HMCS Vancouver is a Halifax-class frigate of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) that has been heavily involved in operations across the Indo-Pacific in 2024. As part of Operation Horizon, it has been deployed in the region for six months, contributing to international maritime security and stability efforts. A milestone for the ship during this deployment was its participation in the first forward missile rearmament outside North America, a complex operation conducted in Broome, Australia. This involved loading Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), a critical part of the frigate's air defense system. Canada-China relations Canada's defense relations with China and Taiwan are shaped by distinct geopolitical considerations and policies. Canada's relationship with China has become increasingly strained, especially following tensions over Chinese interference in Canadian affairs and China's aggressive posture toward Taiwan. Recent diplomatic exchanges between Canada and China, including defense ministers' meetings in 2024, have focused on sensitive issues such as foreign interference, China's military activities around Taiwan, and its support for Russia. Although Canada remains committed to dialogue with China, there is growing concern over Beijing’s actions in the Taiwan Strait, where Canada participates in U.S.-led naval exercises to assert freedom of navigation. These actions have drawn strong responses from China, reflecting broader regional tensions. On the other hand, Canada's ties with Taiwan are shaped by the 'One China' policy, which limits formal defense relationships. However, Canada has engaged in unofficial defense and trade-related exchanges with Taiwan. These include the provision of military technology and expertise for Taiwan's naval capabilities, as well as collaboration on resilience-building in areas such as cybersecurity. Additionally, Canada's Indo-Pacific Strategy has highlighted the importance of Taiwan as a key economic and strategic partner, particularly in terms of technology and supply chain security, though military cooperation remains constrained by its official stance on Taiwan's status.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/canadian-frigate-conducts-joint-transit-through-taiwan-strait-amid-regional-tensions	2024-10-21T02:45:20-07:00	
Poland Considers Acquisition of CH-47F Chinook Heavy Transport Helicopters to Address Logistical Gaps	In an interview on October 15, 2024, with the Portal Obronny, Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz announced that Poland is seriously considering the acquisition of heavy transport helicopters including the CH-47 Chinook, to address a critical shortfall within its armed forces. He emphasized the need for larger helicopters capable of carrying heavy loads and more troops to inaccessible areas, while also facilitating the evacuation of personnel. The minister noted that an order could be finalized shortly, signaling a shift in Warsaw’s logistical strategy in response to operational challenges and recent crises. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kosiniak-Kamysz mentioned the potential purchase of the CH-47F Chinook, an American-made model by Boeing (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) This decision aligns with Poland’s ongoing efforts to modernize its military capabilities since the war in Ukraine began. Despite the acquisition of numerous assets, including M1A2 Abrams tanks, F-35A fighters, and HIMARS artillery systems, the absence of heavy transport helicopters remains a notable gap. The urgency of this need became apparent during relief operations following last month’s storm 'Boris,' which caused widespread flooding in Poland. These events highlighted the necessity for helicopters capable of carrying larger numbers of people, supplies, and heavy materials required to temporarily repair damaged flood defenses. While the Polish Navy has already acquired four AW-101 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare missions, which also belong to the heavy transport category, Kosiniak-Kamysz mentioned the potential purchase of the CH-47F Chinook, an American-made model by Boeing. Already in service with several NATO members, this helicopter's interoperability could be a decisive factor in Poland’s choice. Germany, for instance, cited this reason when it decided in 2022 to purchase 60 of these helicopters. The CH-47F Chinook is a heavy transport helicopter designed to carry substantial loads under varied conditions. Equipped with two Honeywell T55-GA-714A engines, each providing 4,777 shp, it can reach a maximum speed of 315 km/h and carry over 9,500 kg of payload. Its cargo area spans 42m³, allowing for the transportation of up to 50 troops or two HMMWVs. The cabin can also be configured for medical evacuation, accommodating 24 stretchers. The Chinook’s triple-hook system enables the external transport of heavy loads, making it essential for complex logistical missions. The CH-47F Chinook is a heavy transport helicopter designed to carry substantial loads under varied conditions (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) In terms of armament, the CH-47F is equipped with three machine guns, two mounted on the starboard crew door and one on the port side. Its advanced avionics include the Rockwell Collins Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) and BAE Systems' Digital Advanced Flight Control System (DAFCS), enhancing navigation and communication capabilities. Combined with a reinforced structure, these systems allow the Chinook to operate in challenging environments while minimizing maintenance requirements. Another option for Poland could be the CH-53K King Stallion, offered by Sikorsky, a subsidiary of Lockheed-Martin. However, the Chinook seems to have an advantage due to its integration within NATO forces and defense cooperation agreements. The number of helicopters Poland plans to acquire has not yet been disclosed, but this information is expected once the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DCSA), the U.S. body responsible for military equipment exports, delivers its opinion on the potential purchase.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/poland-considers-acquisition-of-ch-47f-chinook-heavy-transport-helicopters-to-address-logistical-gaps	2024-10-21T02:30:02-07:00	
US approves sale of Rolling Airframe Missiles to Japan for enhanced defense	According to information published by the US Gov on October 18, 2024, the US State Department has approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Japan, which could see the transfer of up to 212 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Block 2B Tactical Missiles, alongside related equipment, for an estimated value of $360 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS New Orleans (LPD-18) fires a RIM-116 missile from its RAM launcher during a live-fire exercise off the coast of California. (Picture source: Dvids) The sale includes the advanced RIM-116E RAM Block 2B, known for its enhanced area defense capabilities, designed to protect key maritime and coastal regions from incoming missile threats. This package also comprises supporting elements, including RAM Guided Missile Round Packs, specialized shipping containers, training gear, technical manuals, and logistical support. Notably, the sale will also aid in establishing an Intermediate Level Maintenance Facility (ILMF) in Japan to support these systems. Technical comments The RAM Block 2B missile system that Japan is acquiring brings a highly adaptable and advanced defensive capability to its maritime forces. Designed to counter sophisticated threats, the RAM Block 2B employs an enhanced dual-mode seeker using both passive radio frequency and infrared guidance. This enables it to track and engage advanced anti-ship missiles, even those that utilize countermeasures like radar jamming or infrared decoys. The improved guidance system allows the missile to operate in complex electronic warfare environments, increasing the likelihood of successful target interception. In terms of its kinetic performance, the RAM Block 2B is a supersonic missile, reaching speeds in excess of Mach 2. Its high maneuverability and speed allow it to engage agile sea-skimming missiles, which are designed to evade radar by flying at very low altitudes. This capability is critical as Japan faces growing concerns over China’s deployment of highly advanced anti-ship missiles such as the YJ-12, which poses a significant threat to its naval forces. The RAM’s ability to counter these fast-moving threats at close range offers a crucial layer of defense in high-risk zones like the East China Sea. Technologically, one of the key advancements of the Block 2B variant is its missile-to-missile link, which allows missiles launched in salvo to coordinate and share targeting information in real-time. This system optimizes the defense against complex and simultaneous missile raids by improving engagement efficiency. It is particularly important when dealing with saturation tactics, where a large number of incoming missiles can overwhelm traditional defense systems. Japan’s decision to integrate RAM Block 2B into its naval platforms reflects a broader strategic goal of building a multi-layered defense system. The missile’s modular design allows it to be installed on a variety of ships, from smaller patrol vessels to larger Aegis-equipped destroyers, enhancing the defensive network across Japan’s fleet. By providing close-in defense capabilities, RAM Block 2B complements longer-range systems, creating a more robust defense architecture. This adaptability is crucial for Japan, as it seeks to defend its maritime territory against increasingly sophisticated and fast-evolving missile threats from regional actors like China and North Korea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-approves-sale-of-rolling-airframe-missiles-to-japan-for-enhanced-defense	2024-10-21T01:51:15-07:00	
US Says THAAD Anti-Missile System is Now in Place in Israel	On October 21, 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Ukraine that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system was now in place, though he did not confirm if it was fully operational. This system was deployed to Israel on September 25, 2024, in response to recent escalations between Israel and Iran. The deployment followed Iran’s launch of approximately 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel earlier in October, an event seen as retaliation for Israeli strikes on Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon and the death of a Hamas leader in Tehran. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The US military deploys a THAAD missile defense system in Israel, in March 2019 (Picture source: US DoD) The THAAD system, a key component of the U.S. military's layered air defense network, has now been positioned in Israel to enhance the country’s already strong missile defense capabilities. According to Austin, the system is 'in place' and can be quickly made operational, though specific details on its current readiness were not provided. THAAD adds an important layer to Israel’s defense system, complementing existing systems like the Patriot by covering larger areas and intercepting threats at ranges of up to 200 kilometers. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile system is designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of up to 150 km and ranges between 150 and 200 km. It is a transportable ground-based system equipped with eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 radar for target detection, and a control and communication center to manage operations. THAAD uses hit-to-kill technology, where the missile's kinetic energy neutralizes incoming warheads either within or outside the atmosphere. Developed by Lockheed Martin, THAAD was first deployed in 2008. Several U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and more recently Germany and Japan, have acquired or integrated THAAD into their air defense systems. With its high mobility and ability to intercept at high altitudes, THAAD plays a critical role in protecting military forces, infrastructure, and civilian populations from ballistic missile threats. Israeli sources indicate that the system is already operational, with up to three batteries in use. These reports come amid rising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation, which could prompt an Israeli military response. While the scope of future Israeli strikes remains unclear, Austin emphasized the importance of de-escalating tensions while continuing to meet Israel’s defense needs. He also noted that the U.S. is diplomatically working to reduce tensions between Iran and Israel, though any military actions would ultimately be Israel’s decision. US Air Force shows a US Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense at Fort Bliss, Texas, on Feb. 23, 2019 (Picture source: US DoD) The Pentagon had previously confirmed the arrival of an advance team and essential components needed to operate the THAAD system in Israel, with additional personnel and equipment arriving in the days following. This deployment involves approximately 100 U.S. personnel, putting American forces on the ground in Israel and deepening U.S. involvement in the region. The deployment of THAAD signals a significant shift as the U.S. moves from a supportive role to a more active defense posture, potentially placing American forces at greater risk should hostilities intensify. Developed in the 1990s and operational since 2008, this missile defense system includes truck-mounted launchers, radar systems, and fire control components. Each battery consists of six launchers, each equipped with eight interceptors. THAAD is specifically designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at high altitudes, providing a critical defense layer against Iranian missile threats. The deployment of THAAD to Israel demonstrates the continued U.S. commitment to Israel’s defense, particularly in light of the growing missile threats from Iran. The Pentagon has confirmed that the THAAD system will soon be fully operational and capable of defending Israeli airspace. Despite the complexity of the situation, the U.S. continues to prioritize diplomatic efforts aimed at reducing tensions while maintaining a robust defense posture in the region. This development also coincides with a warning from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Israeli officials, urging them to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The U.S. has made clear that continued military support will depend on significant efforts to address the humanitarian crisis, and Israel has since facilitated the entry of aid trucks into Gaza.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-says-thaad-anti-missile-system-is-now-in-place-in-israel	2024-10-21T01:49:05-07:00	
Chinese DF-31AG Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Launched from Hainan Island	On September 25, 2024, China's Ministry of National Defense announced that the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) had conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the South Pacific. This exercise, described as part of China's annual training plan, drew attention due to its unusual launch site: Hainan Island. The missile, a DF-31AG, traveled an estimated 11,700 km before landing in the Pacific, marking the first time since 1980 that China has targeted this area during an ICBM test. The last such event involved a DF-5 missile launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An image of the DF-31AG launch was released by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on September 25, 2024 (Picture source: PLA) The launch has sparked discussions regarding China’s nuclear posture and its advancing military modernization. Navigation warnings and trajectory calculations quickly identified that the missile had been fired from northeast Hainan Island, a location not typically used for ICBM launches and lacking a permanent ICBM brigade. This unusual choice suggests that China used a mobile launcher for the test, likely a DF-31AG, as confirmed by images released shortly after the event. The DF-31AG is a modernized version of the DF-31, China’s first solid-fuel ICBM, introduced in 2017 to replace earlier models. The DF-31AG is mounted on an eight-axle mobile transporter, which offers improved maneuverability and requires less logistical support than previous versions. The Dong Feng 31 (DF-31), also known as CSS-9 according to NATO classification, is a mobile, long-range ICBM developed by China. This three-stage missile, powered by solid fuel, was designed in the 1980s as a successor to the DF-4. First unveiled during China's National Day Parade in 1999, the DF-31 is housed in a large container mounted on an eight-wheeled trailer, providing significant operational flexibility. With an estimated range of 8,000 to 11,700 kilometers, it can strike targets across much of the continental United States, giving China a second-strike nuclear capability that is difficult to counter. The missile's accuracy is estimated at around 150 meters for mobile launches and 100 meters for silo-based launches. The DF-31 can carry a single 1-megaton nuclear warhead or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), capable of delivering three to four warheads with yields ranging from 20 to 150 kilotons. It uses an inertial navigation system coupled with stellar and GPS updates to improve precision. In terms of mobility, the missile is transported on HY4430 trailers towed by off-road trucks designed to operate in rugged conditions. The DF-31 remains a central component of China's nuclear deterrent, offering rapid strike capabilities and an extended range, making it difficult to neutralize. An image of the DF-31AG missile driving on Hainan Island shortly after the launch (Picture source: X Channel @Resonant_News) The DF-31AG used a cold-launch method, where the missile is ejected from its canister using compressed gas before its engine ignites. This method makes it more challenging to geolocate the exact launch site, as there are no burn marks left on the ground. This test is significant for China, which has not conducted an ICBM test in the Pacific for over four decades, typically opting for high-apogee tests within its own borders. The missile was likely transported from the Shaoyang brigade, about 800 km from Hainan, via rail and sea before being driven to the final launch site. Analysis of images and videos identified a probable launch area near Wenchang, on Hainan Island, which appears to be part of a newly developed military training zone, reinforcing the strategic importance of this location for future observations. The decision to launch an ICBM from Hainan could serve multiple purposes, such as allowing a full-range test without debris fallout or overflight of other countries. This test may also be part of a broader PLARF strategy to restore credibility following internal issues such as corruption scandals and leadership changes. Furthermore, by conducting this test as part of a military drill rather than a technological development program, China may be aiming to demonstrate combat readiness while reinforcing its status as a global nuclear power. The Pentagon confirmed it had received prior notice of the launch, which could set a precedent for future risk-reduction communications. It remains to be seen whether China will continue conducting such tests outside its borders and whether it will maintain this policy of pre-launch notifications to relevant states.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/chinese-df-31ag-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-launched-from-hainan-island	2024-10-21T00:51:27-07:00

RTX Coordinates Autonomous UAV Airstrike During US Army's EDGE24 Exercise	On October 14, 2024, three uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) from RTX scanned miles of rugged terrain to identify potential threats during the U.S. Army’s EDGE24 military exercise. The drones detected and assessed risks using RF signals, recording their positions. Within seconds, this information was relayed to a command center, which then deployed additional UAVs to confirm the targets and simulate a strike. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link While UAVs are already used for reconnaissance and strike missions, this demonstration showed that they can now operate with minimal human intervention, relying on autonomy to make real-time decisions (Picture source: US Army) This demonstration, conducted as part of the U.S. Army's EDGE24 exercise in Yuma, Arizona, marked a significant step for RTX. Teams from Collins Aerospace and Raytheon, both divisions of RTX, completed a flight mission that had previously been tested only in simulations. While UAVs are already used for reconnaissance and strike missions, this demonstration showed that they can now operate with minimal human intervention, relying on autonomy to make real-time decisions. Two key RTX technologies were employed in this test: Collins Aerospace's RapidEdge mission system and Raytheon’s CODE autonomy. Rather than following precise commands or preplanned routes, the UAVs were assigned a broad objective. They communicated with one another to strategize and adapt to obstacles encountered during the mission. Even when the communication link between the drones and the ground station was severed, simulating a communication-denied environment, the UAVs continued to execute the mission autonomously. They also coordinated their actions with Raytheon’s Coyote Block 3 system, demonstrating the technology's capability in realistic and challenging conditions. Bernd Knox, Collins’ business development lead, highlighted the system’s ability to quickly and effectively distribute critical data to both Raytheon’s team and the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team. He emphasized the importance of timely information sharing to leverage the system’s capabilities fully. This exercise supports the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift initiative, with Peter Laird noting that autonomous behavior adds complexity that can only be fully validated in real flight conditions (Picture source: US Army) The EDGE24 event, also known as the Experimentation Demonstration Gateway Event, tested emerging launched effects technologies and their integration with other systems on a simulated battlefield. This exercise supports the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift initiative, which seeks to modernize its rotorcraft fleet. Peter Laird, Collins’ program manager for autonomy and launched effects, pointed out the complexity added by autonomous behavior, which can only truly be validated in real flight conditions, despite the inherent challenge of flying the UAVs themselves. The demonstration also showcased the speed and agility of Collins’ RapidEdge team. They developed the system used in the EDGE24 exercise in just five months, using advanced prototyping, integration, and simulation techniques. These simulations can execute entire missions in seconds, while hardware-in-the-loop testing combines simulation data with real flight equipment to fine-tune performance before the final real-world test. RTX aims to go beyond providing standalone collaborative autonomy capabilities by supporting the development of flexible platforms capable of performing multiple mission types. Although the systems demonstrated at EDGE24 are still in development, the team plans to build on this experience to refine and enhance the technology for future deployments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/rtx-coordinates-autonomous-uav-airstrike-during-us-armys-edge24-exercise	2024-10-21T00:08:34-07:00	
North Korean Hwasong-9 Ballistic Missiles Reportedly Used By Russia To Target Ukraine	Credible reports have emerged indicating that North Korea’s Hwasong-9 medium-range ballistic missiles have been deployed against Ukrainian targets. According to an update shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six leader and renowned military analyst, these North Korean missiles have been used on Ukrainian territory since November of last year.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hwasong-9 is a medium-range ballistic missile developed by North Korea based on the Hwasong-6 (Scud-C) design. It is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile capable of striking targets up to 500-700 kilometers away . (Picture source: MDAA website) Pfarrer's report highlights the potential deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, with North Korea's provision of strategic missile support representing a notable escalation. North Korea's Hwasong-9 missiles are a critical component of its ballistic missile arsenal, developed indigenously from the earlier Hwasong-6, which is itself a variant of the Soviet-era Scud-C missile. The Hwasong-9 is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile (SSM) capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. It was designed to improve on the Hwasong-6, which North Korea has had in its inventory for several decades. The Hwasong-9 has an estimated range of around 500-700 kilometers, allowing it to strike targets within short to medium distances. The missile's mobility and versatility are key attributes, as it is mounted on a transport erector launcher (TEL), allowing for rapid repositioning and surprise launches. This development demonstrates North Korea’s long-standing strategy of adapting foreign technology, like the Scud-C, to suit its own military needs and ambitions. It also raises significant concerns about the ongoing transfer of military technologies between countries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. North Korea has played a significant role in supplying munitions for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, reportedly providing about half of the large-caliber ammunition used on the battlefield in 2024. Ukrainian sources indicate that over 2 million rounds of ammunition were supplied, alongside KN-23 ballistic missiles, which were utilized in dozens of strikes across Ukraine during the winter of 2023-2024. In May 2024, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed through debris analysis that Russia was indeed deploying North Korean missiles, following a summit between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin in September 2023. The deployment of the Hwasong-9 against Ukraine marks the first clear instance of North Korea’s military involvement in the conflict. The specific targets struck by these missiles remain unclear, but such an involvement suggests a growing alignment between Russia and North Korea, particularly in military terms. This alliance has been developing since the start of the war, with Russia reportedly seeking North Korean arms and ammunition to bolster its military supplies, strained by more than a year and a half of intense fighting in Ukraine. For Ukraine, the addition of a new type of ballistic missile to the conflict adds another layer of complexity to its defense strategy. Ukraine has largely relied on air defense systems provided by Western allies to intercept Russian missile strikes. However, the inclusion of North Korean systems, such as the Hwasong-9, will likely force Ukraine to adapt further, as it is unfamiliar with North Korean missile technology.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korean-hwasong-9-ballistic-missiles-reportedly-used-by-russia-to-target-ukraine	2024-10-20T11:34:40-07:00

Britain Joins European Cooperation for Long-Range Missile Development	The war in Ukraine continues to shift the military balance in Europe, prompting NATO to intensify its response. On October 17, 2024, Britain officially announced its participation in a program for developing long-range missiles alongside Germany, France, Poland, and other European partners. This initiative aims to address a gap in military stockpiles highlighted by the conflict in Ukraine, where the use of long-range missiles has become strategically important. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. (Picture source: MBDA) British Defense Secretary John Healey confirmed this commitment during a meeting with his NATO counterparts in Brussels. He explained that the UK is formally joining the long-range missile development program, which is intended to improve the integration of European air defense systems, enhancing their collective effectiveness. According to Healey, these missiles will provide capabilities far beyond those currently available to participating nations, in line with NATO's broader goal of strengthening deterrence and protecting Europe. At the NATO summit in Washington in July, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland had already signed a letter of intent to collaborate on developing missiles with a range of more than 500 kilometers. Military sources at the time indicated that the goal was to create a new land-based cruise missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers to meet NATO's deterrence requirements. Britain's participation underscores the importance of the program as Europe seeks to protect itself against external threats, particularly from Russia. As part of this cooperation, the United States and Germany also announced that starting in 2026, they will temporarily deploy U.S. long-range missiles on German soil, including SM-6, Tomahawk missiles, and developmental hypersonic weapons. This deployment, criticized by Moscow as a 'very serious threat' to Russian national security, is seen as a temporary measure until Europe develops its own long-range missiles. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. Moscow has increased cross-border strikes, while Kyiv has responded by targeting sites within Russian territory. Existing European stocks of cruise missiles, such as Britain's Storm Shadow, France's Scalp, and Germany's Taurus, which have a range of around 500 kilometers, have become critical in addressing these escalating threats. Alongside the missile development program, Healey also confirmed that Britain is ready to quickly deploy troops to Estonia, if necessary, to bolster NATO's eastern flank against the Russian threat.

(Picture source: Fleetphoto) Eighteen oil tankers and four liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers have been added to the sanctions list, making it the largest single action to date against Russia’s maritime fleet. These vessels will be barred from accessing British ports and services, bringing the total number of sanctioned Russian ships to 43. This network of tankers is crucial for maintaining Russian oil exports, a significant source of revenue funding its ongoing war in Ukraine. The United States and Canada have joined the UK’s 'Call to Action' initiative, first announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in July, which now has 47 signatories. These countries are working together to address the shadow fleet's violation of international safety standards and the potential environmental hazards it poses, such as the risk of oil spills. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the importance of cutting off Russia’s financial lifelines, noting that the shadow fleet poses a threat not only to maritime safety but to the global economy. As a result of the sanctions, Russia’s state-controlled shipping giant, Sovcomflot, has been scrambling to evade penalties by renaming and reassigning its vessels. Despite these efforts, many ships have been forced to idle in international waters, unable to unload their cargo or generate revenue. This development has added strain to Russia's energy sector, where flagship companies like Gazprom have already reported significant losses, including a $6.9 billion net deficit in 2023—their first in over two decades. The sanctions also extend beyond the shadow fleet, targeting key players in Russia's gas industry, such as Rusgazdobycha JSC. Background The UK's latest sanctions on Russia’s 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers represent a critical escalation in the effort to cripple the financial resources fueling President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. These measures are part of a broader campaign, which has already blocked Russia from accessing over $400 billion in assets and revenues since the start of the war. The shadow fleet, a collection of vessels designed to evade sanctions and continue the illicit trade of Russian oil, has become a primary target, with the UK's actions disrupting operations of vessels that have collectively transported billions in oil since February 2022​. This crackdown aligns with wider international efforts, with the US, Canada, and several European countries backing the UK's initiative to halt Russia’s oil trade. Notably, the shadow fleet comprises ships operating under complex management systems often based in non-Western jurisdictions, making enforcement challenging.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uk-imposes-largest-sanctions-yet-on-russian-oil-tankers-targeting-shadow-fleet	2024-10-18T03:39:36-07:00

France and United Arab Emirates in Talks for Joint Financing of Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development	According to the French newspaper La Tribune on October 16, 2024, France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are engaged in discussions on joint financing for the development of the future Rafale F5 fighter jet standard. This potential partnership, initiated within the informal framework of the 'Rafale Club,' would allow the UAE to participate in the evolution of the French fighter, thus strengthening the strategic bond between the two nations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development Program (Picture source: French MoD) The military relationship between France and the UAE has deepened over the decades, based on strategic cooperation and mutual trust that extend far beyond arms contracts. This alliance is notably illustrated by the permanent presence of French forces in the UAE since 2009, symbolizing a partnership that spans training, intelligence, and joint operations. The UAE has become a major partner for France in the Gulf region, supported by large-scale military contracts, such as the 2021 agreement for the purchase of 80 Rafale F4 aircraft, valued at more than €16 billion—the largest arms export contract in French history. Abu Dhabi would benefit from direct involvement in future innovations of the aircraft, also providing financial relief for the French Ministry of Armed Forces in a context of budgetary constraints. France’s Ministry of Armed Forces recently announced the start of Rafale F5 development without disclosing the details of these advanced discussions with the UAE. This co-financing would cover only non-sovereign elements of the Rafale, leaving France with exclusive control over critical components. In return for this cooperation, the UAE is considering an additional order of 20 Rafales, complementing the 80 aircraft acquired in 2021 under a historic contract, including Mica NG and Black Shaheen missiles. Led by the General Directorate of Armament (DGA), the Rafale program aims to launch the F5 standard in the next decade. This new version introduces significant advancements in connectivity and data processing to enhance the operational capabilities of client air forces. This upgrade will include a new radar, a state-of-the-art electronic warfare system, advanced optronic sensors, and the integration of the ASN4G missile for French forces. Additionally, the Rafale F5 will be supported by a stealth combat drone inspired by the Neuron demonstrator, designed to assist the aircraft in penetrating enemy defenses. This companion drone, a key feature of the F5 standard, will be engineered for maximum stealth and advanced connectivity, allowing operations over extended ranges thanks to aerial refueling. Its mission, enhanced by native integration of artificial intelligence, will enable direct collaboration with the Rafale in adaptive combat strategies, providing a foundational component of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This potential partnership with the UAE arises as France seeks to optimize its defense budget for the 2024–2030 period, with a €413 billion military programming budget. In 2023, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu discussed the possibility of Rafale Club members contributing to development costs while ensuring sovereignty over critical components. This shared financing would also strengthen France’s relations with Rafale clients, while maintaining national control over sensitive elements. Expected by 2030, the Rafale F5 fighter jet will succeed the F4 standard, addressing modern threats for both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence missions within the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS). It represents a new generation of connected fighters, integrating interoperable systems with other ground and aerial platforms. For the UAE, this project represents not only a military upgrade but also an extension of their cooperation with France in defense, consolidating their position as one of France's privileged allies. The UAE Armed Forces are among the best-trained and most capable among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. While Iran remains a major strategic concern, partly due to an ongoing dispute over islands in the Strait of Hormuz, the UAE has shown an increasing capacity to project influence and engage militarily beyond its borders. Their involvement in conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as their crucial role in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, has reinforced their experience and strategic approach to managing military risks. This orientation towards international engagement is supported by foreign bases, including a French base and a South Korean contingent, as well as diversified defense relations, particularly with Israel, Turkey, and China, while maintaining a primary partnership with the United States.

Netherlands Confirms a Reduced Order of H225M Caracal Helicopters for Special Forces	In a letter to the House of Representatives, the new State Secretary for Defence, Gijs Tuinman, confirmed on October 16, 2024, the project to purchase 12 Airbus H225M Caracal helicopters, with a contract signing planned no later than November 2024. This announcement marks a significant revision to the acquisition program, initially set to procure 14 helicopters. The project is now reduced to 12 units, with deliveries extended over time. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Derived from the Cougar Mk2 model, the Caracal meets the demands of combat search and rescue (CSAR), special operations, and tactical transport missions (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) This adjustment, implemented due to budget constraints and specific requirements of the special operations forces, aims to tailor each helicopter to the missions of the elite 300 Special Operations Squadron. This compromise allows for the replacement of the aging Cougar helicopters, in service since 1996, though the first Caracals are only expected to arrive by early 2030. Full fleet delivery is projected for 2032, two years behind the initially planned schedule. The H225M Caracal, originally known as the Eurocopter EC725, is a medium-sized, twin-engine military helicopter developed by Airbus Helicopters. Derived from the Cougar Mk2 model, the Caracal meets the demands of combat search and rescue (CSAR), special operations, and tactical transport missions. After its maiden flight in November 2000, it entered service with the French Air Force in 2005. Its versatility and advanced avionics have since made it popular with military forces worldwide, including in Brazil, Malaysia, and Singapore. The H225M Caracal can carry up to 29 soldiers or a combination of personnel and cargo, with a total payload capacity of up to 4,750 kg for underslung loads. Inspired by the Cougar family, it incorporates several enhancements, such as a five-blade main rotor and a reinforced transmission gearbox, which increase its payload capacity, range, and speed. Powered by two Safran Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines, each delivering 2,382 horsepower, the helicopter reaches a maximum speed of 324 km/h. It has a range of around 1,200 kilometers with additional fuel tanks and can operate at altitudes up to 6,095 meters (20,000 feet), making it suitable for high-altitude missions. The cabin can be configured for various missions, including medical evacuations, with space to accommodate up to 11 stretchers. Equipped with advanced avionics, the H225M Caracal features a digital cockpit with multifunction displays, a digital map, and an autopilot system that eases pilot workload and supports operations in challenging environments. The five-blade main rotor is designed to optimize lift and reduce vibrations, ensuring stable flight performance. The helicopter has been deployed in several notable missions, such as evacuations during the 2006 Lebanon conflict and support operations in Afghanistan. Its international adoption is highlighted by orders like Brazil’s purchase of 50 units. The H225M’s survivability is enhanced by a radar warning receiver, missile approach warning system, laser warning receiver, and chaff/flare dispensers. (Picture source: Army Recognition) According to the Ministry of Defence, the decision to reduce the order was necessary to remain within the allocated budget, which ranges between 1 and 2.5 billion euros. Customization and adaptation costs for the Caracal to meet the unique demands of special operations have been higher than anticipated. This adjustment, communicated to Dutch parliament members, shows the need for various contracts to equip the helicopter with advanced mission systems. Although Airbus Helicopters remains the program’s primary contractor, the Dutch Defence Ministry also plans complementary contracts to equip nine of the helicopters with specific capabilities. Among the selected suppliers, Israel’s Elbit Systems will provide a proven self-protection suite already installed on the Gulfstream G650ER and future C390M transport aircraft for Dutch Defence. This suite will enhance the Caracal’s survivability against modern threats. Additionally, radio equipment from the American group L3 Harris will be integrated through the Foxtrot program, ensuring secure communications and improved interoperability with allied forces. Airbus Helicopters, in partnership with the Netherlands and Germany, is also developing a new mission computer to centralize all data flows in a single display, facilitating real-time decision-making. The acquisition of these helicopters includes infrastructure and training programs. Next-generation simulators will be implemented through a separate program starting next year, aiming to increase training hours from 700 for the current Cougar fleet to between 2,000 and 3,000 for the Caracal, preserving the aircraft while enhancing pilot and operator readiness for critical missions. This adjustment will impact the operational capacity of the 300 Special Operations Squadron. While the initial plan anticipated the ability to conduct two simultaneous missions over six months, the current configuration limits capacity to one long-term mission, with a second short-term mission possible if needed. This change reflects Defence’s intent to maximize capabilities within budget constraints, taking into account rising integration costs and logistical challenges. Anticipated delivery delays also stem from technical challenges associated with integrating numerous mission systems and high demand on Caracal’s production lines internationally. The Dutch Ministry of Defence acknowledges that further delays cannot be ruled out, though contractual safeguards aim to minimize this risk. In the worst case, an extension of the Cougar helicopters’ operational life may be considered to offset scheduling delays. With the acquisition’s preparatory phase now complete, a final agreement with Airbus Helicopters is expected next month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/netherlands-confirms-a-reduced-order-of-h225m-caracal-helicopters-for-special-forces	2024-10-17T06:13:43-07:00

Armenia Could Be First Country to Acquire India's Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile	On October 16, 2024, News.Az reported that the Indian Ministry of Defense authorized the export of Pralay quasi-ballistic missiles to Armenia, marking an important step in strengthening the defense partnership between India and Armenia. This decision, which has yet to receive official confirmation from the Armenian Ministry of Defense, reflects India's intent to conclude an agreement aimed at bolstering Armenia’s defensive capabilities in a context of regional tensions. According to Alpha Defense, this potential agreement is at an advanced stage, with sources indicating that India is actively negotiating to finalize it in the near future.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link India Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Pralay missile, developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), is an advanced short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile, primarily designed for tactical use in combat conditions. Launched in 2015, the Pralay program represents a strategic advancement for India’s missile arsenal, incorporating sophisticated quasi-ballistic trajectory adjustments that allow the missile to evade interceptors and anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses. The missile has already successfully completed several tests, with the first two conducted in December 2021 and a third in November 2023, each demonstrating the missile’s accuracy, payload capacity, and terminal maneuverability. The Pralay's unique quasi-ballistic trajectory enables it to shift from a traditional ballistic path to a flatter trajectory after launch, making interception more difficult by reducing its radar profile. This feature, combined with high speed and terminal maneuverability, brings the Pralay closer to the Russian Iskander-M missile, which has proven effective in recent conflicts, notably in Ukraine. The Pralay shares characteristics with the Iskander-M, such as a CEP (Circular Error Probable) of around 10 meters, highlighting its high accuracy and ability to evade air defenses. India and Russia have long-standing collaboration in missile technology, a partnership that has significantly shaped India's missile capabilities. One of the most notable outcomes of this cooperation is the BrahMos missile, developed jointly by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyenia. Launched as the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, the BrahMos demonstrates both high speed and precision, making it a valuable asset in India’s arsenal. This collaboration has allowed India to integrate Russian expertise in propulsion and guidance systems with its own indigenous technological advancements, setting a foundation for India's development of future missile systems. Russia’s involvement in India’s missile program has also extended through technology transfers and support in ballistic missile defense research, further strengthening India's defense capabilities and boosting its strategic autonomy in missile production. To comply with international arms control regulations, India has committed to limiting export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 kilometers and a payload capacity not exceeding 500 kilograms. This adherence to missile technology control guidelines requires technical modifications to the Pralay system, an adaptation that India is actively pursuing. Powered by a solid-fuel motor and integrating maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MaRV) technology, the missile can carry payloads ranging from high-explosive fragmentation warheads to runway denial submunitions. These capabilities enable it to effectively target and neutralize critical military infrastructure such as radar installations, command centers, and forward airstrips, with enhanced precision and lethality. Armenia’s interest in acquiring the Pralay missile stems from its need to counterbalance the capabilities acquired by Azerbaijan through its purchase of LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missiles developed by Israel Aerospace Industries. With a range of 400 kilometers and a CEP of 10 meters, the LORA missile represents a significant threat to Armenia’s strategic assets. The Pralay’s compatibility with various warhead types and its advanced guidance system, using both inertial navigation and a DSMAC (Digital Scene-Matching Area Correlation) seeker for increased accuracy, provide Armenia with an adequate response to Azerbaijan’s missile capabilities. A distinctive feature of the Pralay is its fused silica radar dome (RADOME), which enhances its evasion capabilities and survivability in hostile airspace. The jet vane thrust vector control system allows the Pralay to perform evasive maneuvers in the terminal phase, effectively countering enemy defense systems. Additionally, the Pralay includes two sets of small fins that help reduce its radar signature, further complicating interception efforts. The Indian Pralay missile and the Israeli LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missile are two quasi-ballistic systems with short to medium range, but their performances and capabilities differ in several aspects. The Pralay has a theoretical range between 150 and 500 km, with a payload capacity ranging from 350 kg to 700 kg, allowing it to target strategic installations such as radars, command centers, and airstrips. However, to comply with international arms control regulations, India has limited export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 km and a payload not exceeding 500 kg. This technical adaptation, necessary to adhere to missile technology control guidelines, ensures that exported versions meet international standards. The LORA, on the other hand, has a maximum range of 400 km and a payload capacity of approximately 570 kg. This missile was operationally used by Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, demonstrating high accuracy with a CEP of 10 meters, particularly on targets such as bridges and critical infrastructure. Its guidance system, using GPS and TV imaging in the terminal phase, ensures high precision, although it remains potentially vulnerable to electronic countermeasures. Thus, the Pralay prioritizes better terminal maneuverability to evade interceptions, while the LORA stands out for its extreme precision in targeted strikes, with each featuring specific adaptations according to their usage contexts and regulatory requirements. The Indian armed forces have shown strategic interest in the Pralay missile, with substantial orders from both the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. In 2022, the Indian Ministry of Defense approved the purchase of 120 missiles for the Air Force, followed in 2023 by the acquisition of a regiment of 250 missiles for the Army, intended to strengthen tactical capabilities along sensitive borders with China and Pakistan. If the agreement with Armenia is finalized, this country would become the first international buyer of the Pralay missile, marking a historic milestone in Indian defense exports. Defense relations between India and Armenia have considerably strengthened in recent years, illustrated by the transfer of sophisticated weaponry to meet Armenia's growing security needs in a tense regional context. In 2020, India sold Armenia four Swathi radars, capable of detecting and locating enemy artillery fire, as well as M982 Excalibur precision artillery shells, enhancing Armenia’s defensive and retaliatory capabilities. Armenia is also interested in ATAGS (Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System) howitzers developed by DRDO, which offer extended range and increased accuracy, with the capability to fire projectiles up to 48 km. The addition of ATAGS would strengthen Armenia's offensive capabilities, complementing its current arsenal. Additionally, the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, also developed by DRDO, has attracted significant interest from Armenia. Capable of launching a salvo of twelve rockets in less than 45 seconds and reaching a range of 40 to 75 km depending on the variant, the Pinaka would provide mobile and versatile firepower, ideal for saturation strikes and ground support missions. Integrating the Pinaka would further strengthen Armenia's tactical options, while consolidating India as a key partner in defense.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/armenia-could-be-first-country-to-acquire-indias-home-made-pralay-quasi-ballistic-missile	2024-10-17T04:52:13-07:00

UK maintains Challenger 3 Tank schedule toward 2030 full capability	As reported by the UK Defence Journal on October 11, 2024, the British Ministry of Defence has confirmed the continued progress of the Challenger 3 main battle tank program, in response to questions from Danny Kruger, MP for East Wiltshire, regarding the review's potential impacts on the program and recent discussions with the Army Board. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Luke Pollard clarified that the Challenger 3 is set to achieve Initial Operating Capability by 2027, with Full Operating Capability expected by 2030.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Pollard noted that the Strategic Defence Review aims to align future capability development with the UK’s security needs. As part of this process, the Ministry will provide regular updates to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Secretary of State for Defence, with a comprehensive final report anticipated by mid-2025. This review is intended to ensure that the UK’s defense infrastructure supports both current and future requirements. The Challenger 3, developed by the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL), represents an upgrade of the existing Challenger 2 tanks rather than the deployment of entirely new vehicles. The program evolved from the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme (LEP), designed to improve mobility, lethality, and survivability for continued use through the 2030s. The primary modification in the Challenger 3 is the integration of a new turret with a 120mm L55A1 smoothbore gun, replacing the previous L30A1 rifled gun. This modification aligns with NATO standards, improving interoperability, although it requires a new kinetic energy round to be developed in collaboration with Germany, as the smoothbore system is incompatible with current Challenger 2 ammunition. Initial deliveries of pre-production Challenger 3 tanks began in early 2024, with live-firing trials starting in Germany in April. The British Army is scheduled to receive a total of 148 tanks, with the first units entering service in 2025. The project’s estimated cost is approximately $1.17 billion, and it is expected to support around 300 jobs at RBSL’s Telford facility, with an additional 450 positions across the UK defense supply chain.

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system. The tank also features upgraded targeting systems for the commander and gunner, including advanced thermal imaging. While the adoption of the smoothbore gun introduces an ammunition compatibility issue, the Ministry of Defence has partnered with German defense companies to develop a new Enhanced Kinetic Energy (EKE) round, suitable for both the Challenger 3 and the Leopard 2 tanks. The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. The Challenger 3 continues this progression with modular armor upgrades and enhanced survivability features, including Active Protection Systems (APS). Previous trials on the Challenger 2 tested APS such as the Rheinmetall ROSY Rapid Obscurant System and the MUSS system, providing a basis for their integration into the Challenger 3. Additionally, the Challenger 3 is powered by a Perkins CV12-9A 26.1-liter V12 diesel engine, delivering 1,500 bhp, and utilizes a David Brown Santasalo TN54E transmission system with updated components. The development of the Challenger 3 reflects the UK's approach to modernizing its existing tank fleet rather than procuring new models from other countries. In a 2021 report, the Defence Select Committee noted challenges in the LEP, including budget overruns and delays. Later that year, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would upgrade 148 Challenger 2 tanks into Challenger 3 models through a contract with RBSL valued at £800 million. This contract solidified the selection of Rheinmetall’s upgrade proposal, which includes the 120mm smoothbore gun. Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system.

In recent years, Iran has conducted missile attacks against Israel, and the B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. The Houthis have continued to attack merchant vessels in the Red Sea since October 2023, and CENTCOM’s strikes align with efforts to secure these waters against further disruptions to commercial shipping. The Houthis claim their attacks target vessels linked to Israel, the U.S., and the U.K., citing these countries' involvement in the Gaza conflict, although some targeted vessels have not been directly connected to the conflict. Additionally, Houthi attacks have seized one vessel, sunk two others, and led to the deaths of four sailors, prompting ongoing concerns about the group’s impact on maritime security. The Northrop B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy strategic bomber developed under the Advanced Technology Bomber program in the late 1970s. Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. Originally intended to replace the Mach 2-capable B-1A, the B-2 program faced significant delays and rising costs, leading to extensive debate in Congress. The B-2 can carry up to 18,000 kg of ordnance, including conventional and nuclear payloads, and has a maximum unrefueled range of 11,000 km, with a service ceiling of 15,000 m. (Picture source: US DoD) Ultimately, the planned production was reduced from 132 units to 21, reflecting changing strategic priorities after the Cold War. Entering service in 1997, the B-2 made its combat debut during the Kosovo War in 1999 and has since been deployed in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The B-2’s flying wing design, which lacks both a fuselage and tail, contributes to a reduced radar cross-section and increased aerodynamic efficiency, enabling extended range operations. The aircraft’s structure includes radar-absorbing materials and advanced flight controls for stability, allowing a two-person crew to operate the bomber. Maneuverability is achieved through a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust, supporting the aircraft’s low radar profile. The B-2 is equipped with the AN/APQ-181 radar, which provides multi-mode functionality to support navigation and target acquisition. During the RIMPAC 2024 exercise, the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit bomber also employed the QUICKSINK maritime strike capability, designed to sink surface vessels with modified JDAM precision-guided bombs, marking the first publicly reported test of this system. Conducted during the second SINKEX exercise, the test demonstrated the B-2’s capability in maritime strike roles. Developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, QUICKSINK converts JDAMs into precision-guided bombs equipped with GPS-assisted INS guidance, a radar seeker, and an Imaging Infrared camera, allowing them to target moving maritime threats. Ongoing modernization programs for the B-2, supported by a recent $7 billion contract with Northrop Grumman, focus on enhancing defensive and communication systems to address emerging threats, including cyber risks.

These measures were implemented as of yesterday and will remain in place indefinitely. Similar Incidents in Germany This development follows similar actions taken in Germany earlier this year, where heightened security was introduced at various military bases due to concerns over sabotage. In August, the NATO Air Base in Geilenkirchen, near the borders of the Netherlands and Belgium, saw an increase in security measures due to a 'potential threat.' Additionally, a week earlier, a major German airbase near Cologne was temporarily locked down after concerns arose over possible water supply tampering. A soldier discovered a breach in the fence surrounding the base's drinking water facility, and abnormal readings were detected in the water. Similar security precautions were also implemented at another German NATO base for related reasons. The broader European security landscape has been deeply influenced by Russia's continued covert operations, which have included cyberattacks, sabotage, and espionage targeting NATO members and their critical infrastructure. The Belgian government’s response is part of a collective effort by European nations to safeguard military operations amidst these growing challenges. Pro-Russian hacker groups have previously targeted Belgian infrastructure, and while no official connection has been made, this escalation follows a pattern of cyber and physical sabotage that has been observed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine​. Security analysts have noted that these incidents are likely part of a larger strategy to disrupt Western military and defense logistics. Recent events such as the attempted sabotage of water supplies at German airbases and fire incidents at defense facilities have put NATO countries on high alert. The possibility of espionage and sabotage being used to weaken European military capacities, especially those involved in supporting Ukraine, continues to be a significant concern for NATO and EU member states alike.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/belgian-military-barracks-tighten-security-amid-sabotage-and-espionage-threats	2024-10-17T00:31:39-07:00
