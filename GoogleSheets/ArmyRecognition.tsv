It aims to create an interconnected family of systems, including tanks, drones, and robots, integrated into a 'combat cloud.' Despite its ambitious vision, the project, expected to become operational around 2040, presents significant challenges, especially concerning the maintenance of current operational capabilities until its deployment. The MGCS was launched in 2017 to deliver a next-generation tank, with France's Nexter (part of KNDS) and Thales working alongside Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (also in KNDS) and Rheinmetall. The project received renewed momentum in April 2024 through an agreement to organize it around eight technological pillars divided equally between the two nations. Nevertheless, the program has encountered multiple obstacles, including disagreements over technology choices and responsibility sharing, causing notable delays. These tensions raise questions about the viability of Franco-German defense cooperation. Additionally, competing developments, such as Rheinmetall’s partnership with Italy’s Leonardo to produce the Panther KF51 tank, add further pressure, challenging MGCS’s relevance within Europe’s defense landscape. To address these delays, Chiva confirmed that efforts are underway to extend the operational lifespan of the Leclerc tank to 2040. He also mentioned a potential 'intermediate solution,' already proposed by KNDS France, involving an upgraded Leclerc model equipped with advancements like the ASCALON cannon. The DGA also raised the possibility of France and Germany developing separate heavy tanks within a shared architecture. This approach could meet each nation’s specific needs while maintaining collaborative elements. However, such an initiative would require national funding, which could reflect a degree of strategic independence, particularly for France. Despite the challenges, Chiva expressed support for French innovation, citing ASCALON as a major technological achievement. He emphasized that the French Military Programming Law was designed to avoid capability gaps, although restarting production lines remains a complex issue. While no details were provided on a potential 'Plan B,' he stressed the importance of fostering innovation and overcoming logistical hurdles. Both the MGCS and the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) embody Franco-German ambitions to strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy in defense. These programs aim to integrate advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and interconnected systems, into next-generation combat platforms. However, since their inception in 2017, both have faced industrial and political challenges, delaying progress and raising concerns over their future. These difficulties highlight broader issues in building an effective European defense framework. Disputes over MGCS and SCAF underline the complexity of multinational cooperation in defense, where national interests can conflict with collective goals. Achieving meaningful strategic autonomy for Europe will require aligning member states' priorities, fostering industrial cohesion, and overcoming existing barriers. Success in projects like MGCS and SCAF is crucial for Europe's defense aspirations and its role on the global stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/frances-uncertainty-amid-challenges-for-future-main-ground-combat-system	2024-12-12T00:51:54-08:00

US Deploys A-10 Thunderbolt II Ground Attack Aircraft Squadron to Counter China Threats in the Philippines	On December 11, 2024, the United States deployed A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, nicknamed 'Warthogs,' to the Philippines for joint training exercises with the Philippine Air Force. This deployment underscores the longstanding defense partnership between the two nations and takes place amid rising tensions in the South China Sea. The A-10s, assigned to the 25th Fighter Squadron based in South Korea, landed at Clark Air Base on December 6 and will remain in the Philippines until December 15. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US A-10 Thunderbolt II Ground Attack Aircraft (Picture source: US MoD) This training is part of the U.S. Air Force's Dynamic Force Employment (DFE) strategy, which aims to ensure strategic predictability while maintaining operational unpredictability in contested regions. Officially adopted in 2018, the DFE strategy combines strategic foresight with operational flexibility to respond effectively to threats in disputed areas. Developed against the backdrop of growing rivalries with powers like China and Russia, this approach prioritizes agile and short-term deployments over prolonged or fixed rotations. Since its implementation, DFE missions have been conducted in strategic regions, including Europe and the Indo-Pacific, to test and demonstrate force responsiveness. These rapid, often unannounced, deployments are designed to keep adversaries uncertain about U.S. intentions while enhancing deterrence. At the same time, this strategy maximizes troop readiness for rapidly evolving geopolitical threats, a critical factor in sensitive areas like the Indo-Pacific, where DFE was recently applied with the A-10 deployment to the Philippines in December 2024. This joint training operation occurs against the backdrop of escalating tensions in the South China Sea, where reports from late November 2024 indicated the presence of nearly 100 Chinese vessels near Thitu Island, occupied by the Philippines. The contested waters are central to overlapping territorial claims involving China, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian nations. The Mutual Defense Treaty signed in 1951 between the United States and the Philippines obligates both nations to respond jointly to any attack on their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces in the Pacific region, highlighting the importance of these military collaborations. Military ties between the Philippines and the United States are deeply rooted, dating back to the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951, which commits both nations to mutual defense in the event of armed attacks in the Pacific region. These ties were further solidified by the 1947 military base agreement, which allowed the U.S. to maintain strategic installations such as Clark Air Base, north of Manila, and Subic Bay Naval Base, on the western coast of Luzon. Although the U.S. withdrew from these bases in 1991 following a Philippine Senate vote, cooperation resumed vigorously with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed in 2014. This agreement grants U.S. forces access to several key bases, including Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, near the South China Sea, and Basa Air Base in Pampanga, for temporary rotations. These bases play a strategic role in regular joint exercises like Balikatan, which aim to enhance interoperability and address security challenges, particularly amid China's growing claims in the South China Sea. Today, this alliance remains a cornerstone of stability in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Department of Defense has designated the Indo-Pacific region as a priority due to escalating Chinese military and maritime activities. Regular joint training exercises, such as the arrival of A-10s and a recent air drill over the Philippine Sea in November, are central to Washington's strategy for maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. According to U.S. officials, these exercises aim to bolster interoperability and shared capabilities, ensuring preparedness for emerging regional challenges. The A-10 Thunderbolt II, commonly known as the 'Warthog,' is a twin-engine attack aircraft renowned for its rugged design and close air support capabilities. Powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines, it achieves a maximum speed of 833 km/h and has a combat range of 460 km. The aircraft is heavily armored to withstand ground fire and features redundant systems for enhanced survivability. Its primary weapon is the GAU-8/A Avenger 30mm rotary cannon, capable of firing 3,900 rounds per minute, optimized for destroying armored vehicles. Additionally, the A-10 can carry up to 7,260 kg of mixed ordnance, including missiles, bombs, and rockets, across 11 hardpoints. Its ability to operate at low altitude and slow speeds makes it unmatched in close air support and battlefield interdiction. The development of the A-10 Thunderbolt II dates back to the late 1960s when the U.S. Air Force initiated the AX (Attack Experimental) program to design an aircraft capable of providing close air support in hostile environments. The A-10's maiden flight occurred in May 1972, and it officially entered service in 1976. Designed to withstand ground fire and neutralize enemy armor, the A-10 first demonstrated its combat prowess during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, destroying hundreds of Iraqi tanks. It is equipped with the GAU-8/A Avenger rotary cannon, utilizing depleted uranium armor-piercing (API) or high-explosive incendiary (HEI) ammunition to neutralize heavily armored targets. The aircraft has also proven effective in conflicts such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, and more recently in Syria, where it was deployed against Islamic State positions. Despite multiple attempts to retire the aircraft due to its age, field reports emphasize its durability, precision, and unique ability to support ground troops, qualities that continue to justify its active service.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-deploys-a-10-thunderbolt-ii-ground-attack-aircraft-squadron-to-counter-china-threats-in-the-philippines	2024-12-11T02:10:48-08:00	
Greece Prioritizes M113 Modernization Over US Bradleys and French VBCIs	According to information published by the specialized website OnAlert on December 9, 2024, the Greek military has decided to modernize its fleet of M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) rather than acquire new vehicles like the American M2 Bradleys or the French VBCIs. This decision, driven by budgetary constraints and operational requirements, represents a significant move in Greece's efforts to upgrade its armored vehicle fleet while addressing its military needs. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Hellenic Army soldiers conducted a convoy operation to an objective during force-on-force training at Petrochori Range, Triantafyllides Camp, Greece, as part of Olympic Cooperation 2021 (Picture source: US DoD) For years, the Greek General Staff has sought to modernize its mechanized infantry, which has faced growing obsolescence in its equipment. The Kentauros Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) project, launched in the 2000s, was abandoned, leaving Greece without a viable replacement for its aging vehicles. In 2020, a proposal was made to acquire M2A2/M2A2OD Bradleys from the United States. Although approved in 2023 for the transfer of 300 units, the refurbishment costs of the vehicles proved prohibitive. Even an offer involving 62 Bradleys free of charge and 102 more under favorable financial terms was deemed unaffordable by Athens due to budgetary limitations. Simultaneously, France proposed a compelling alternative: the immediate delivery of 120 VBCIs, with an additional 250 units to be co-produced with Greek industry. However, this option was also considered too costly. A competing offer from Rheinmetall for its KF-41 Lynx failed to secure interest for similar reasons. Ultimately, the Greek military opted for a more economical solution by modernizing its M113 fleet. This program, a collaboration between the Israeli company Rafael and the Greek firm METKA, involves upgrading over 500 M113 vehicles. The modernization includes the installation of remote-controlled weapon stations with 30mm cannons, enhanced armor, a new, more powerful propulsion system, advanced communication systems, and modern optronic sensors. The upgrades will be conducted at METKA’s facility in Magnesia, with costs significantly lower than the alternatives proposed, making this option particularly attractive for Athens. However, M113s remain APCs with a weight of 12 tons, which is significantly lighter than modern IFVs like the Bradley and VBCI, which weigh nearly twice as much and offer superior firepower. The standard M113 armament includes a 12.7mm heavy machine gun, suitable for defense against infantry and lightly armored threats. In contrast, the VBCI is equipped with a 25mm cannon mounted on a remote turret, while the Bradley boasts a 25mm M242 cannon and can be fitted with TOW anti-tank missiles, providing substantial offensive capabilities against heavily armored targets. Regarding protection, the M113 features aluminum armor designed to withstand small arms fire and shell fragments but remains vulnerable to modern anti-tank weapons. By contrast, the VBCI and Bradley provide more robust protection against ballistic threats and improvised explosive devices. Both IFVs also incorporate advanced detection and communication systems, enhancing their battlefield efficiency. While the M113 fulfills its primary role as a troop carrier, the VBCI and Bradley surpass it in firepower, protection, and operational versatility. This choice reflects a pragmatic approach by Greece to extend the lifespan of existing equipment while addressing immediate operational needs. Modernizing the M113 fleet offers a cost-effective alternative to acquiring modern IFVs, especially considering the purchase, maintenance, and training costs associated with new vehicles. Moreover, the program supports local industry through partnerships like that with METKA, contributing to the Greek defense economy. Modernizing the M113 allows Greece to respond swiftly to operational demands. While these vehicles do not match the capabilities of Bradleys or VBCIs, upgrades such as remote weapon stations, improved armor, and advanced communication systems enhance their battlefield utility. This approach also enables Greece to deploy a larger number of modernized vehicles, reinforcing its mechanized forces quantitatively, even if qualitatively they remain behind modern IFVs. Currently, the Greek military possesses approximately 2,900 M113 APCs, including various variants acquired over decades to meet operational requirements. The decision to modernize these vehicles underscores Greece’s commitment to strengthening its military capabilities within strict budgetary limits. Although economical, this strategy raises questions about its long-term viability in addressing evolving threats and operational challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-prioritizes-m113-modernization-over-american-bradleys-and-french-vbcis	2024-12-10T23:53:47-08:00	
Analysis: With Fewer Forces Than Cold War British Army Could Collapse in 6 Months of Ukraine-Style War	Veterans Minister Al Carns, a former Royal Marine colonel, has issued a grave warning about the readiness of the British Armed Forces. He cautioned that in a conflict of the scale and intensity of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the British Army could be 'expended in six months to a year.' This stark assessment underscores significant limitations in the UK’s capacity to sustain prolonged, high-intensity military engagements, raising pressing questions about its ability to fulfill national defense obligations and meet NATO commitments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link British soldiers during training exercises, highlighting efforts to maintain readiness as the Army faces historic reductions in troop numbers and challenges in sustaining prolonged high-intensity conflicts. (Picture source: British MoD) Data released earlier this year by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) lends weight to these concerns. British troop numbers have plummeted to their lowest levels since the early 1800s, with a 38% decline in recruits over the past two decades. Total personnel in the armed forces has dropped from 207,000 in 2000 to just 131,000 in 2024. The British Army now fields approximately 73,000 regular soldiers—the smallest force in its modern history—while the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force stand at 29,000 and 33,000 personnel, respectively. This dramatic erosion contrasts sharply with the Cold War, when the UK maintained robust military forces designed to counter large-scale threats such as the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the British Army was one of NATO’s strongest and most capable forces. Though smaller than the U.S. military, the UK played a pivotal role in the alliance’s defense strategy, particularly in Europe. Its reputation rested on a combination of highly trained personnel, modern equipment, and strategic positioning, bolstered by its independent nuclear deterrent. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), stationed in West Germany, exemplified this strength, consisting of four armored divisions equipped with over 800 Chieftain and Challenger 1 tanks, advanced artillery, and air defense systems like the Rapier missile. The UK’s global reach further enhanced its military power. The Royal Navy operated over 130 combat vessels, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, and a formidable submarine fleet. Meanwhile, the Royal Air Force fielded more than 850 aircraft, including Tornado, Harrier, and Jaguar fighters, alongside robust reconnaissance and transport capabilities. Today, this once-formidable capability has been significantly diminished. The British Army now operates only 227 Challenger 2 tanks, with upgrades to Challenger 3 underway. Artillery inventories have been severely reduced, and the British Army’s ability to sustain high-volume, long-range firepower in prolonged engagements falls short of modern requirements. The Royal Navy, once boasting 130 vessels, now operates just 73, including two Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but with only 19 frigates and destroyers to escort them. Similarly, the Royal Air Force’s fleet has declined to around 500 aircraft, even as advanced platforms like the Typhoon and F-35 Lightning II have entered service. The war in Ukraine vividly illustrates the resources and resilience required for sustained, high-intensity conflict. Ukraine’s ability to resist Russia has depended on continuous supplies of tanks, artillery, drones, and ammunition, much of it provided by NATO allies. If the UK faced a similar-scale conflict, the British Armed Forces would likely struggle to sustain operations beyond a few months. Insufficient ammunition stockpiles, aging equipment, and gaps in critical systems such as air defense are significant vulnerabilities. British ammunition reserves, in particular, would be quickly exhausted, given the consumption rates observed in Ukraine, where thousands of artillery rounds are fired daily. Logistical endurance remains a critical challenge. The lack of robust air defense systems capable of countering drones and precision missile strikes further exposes vulnerabilities in prolonged engagements. These deficiencies underscore the UK's challenges as it seeks to modernize its forces and rebuild its capacity. Efforts to address these issues are underway. The Future Soldier initiative aims to restructure the British Army into smaller, agile Brigade Combat Teams with enhanced digital capabilities. Procurement projects, including upgrades to Challenger 3 tanks, the acquisition of Archer self-propelled howitzers, and investments in counter-drone technologies, represent steps in the right direction. However, the pace of modernization has been slow, and the gap between current capabilities and the demands of high-intensity warfare remains substantial. Financial constraints further complicate these efforts. The UK’s defense budget for the 2023/24 fiscal year was £53.9 billion, with planned increases to £56.9 billion in 2024/25 and £59.8 billion in 2025/26. This represents an annual real-terms growth rate of 2.3%. While former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030—potentially delivering an additional £75 billion—specific plans to achieve this target remain unclear. Current allocations may be insufficient to address existing capability gaps and modernization needs. The warnings from Veterans Minister Al Carns, coupled with British MoD data and lessons from the Ukraine war, highlight the urgent need for a reassessment of the UK’s defense priorities. The sharp decline in personnel, equipment, and logistical endurance underscores a critical challenge in maintaining a credible deterrent.

Taiwan ramps up Wanjian cruise missile production to strengthen the country’s naval and air capabilities	As reported by the Liberty Times on December 7, 2024, Taiwan has completed the mass production of its domestically developed Wanjian air-to-ground cruise missile, providing new capabilities for preemptive strikes on key Chinese military positions. Over 150 units of the Wanjian-1 bomb, with a range of 200 kilometers, have been produced, and the development of an extended-range version, the Wanjian-2 with a range of 400 kilometers, is now being carried out under the Ministry of National Defense's annual budget for further testing and small-batch production.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. (Picture source: Twitter/Taepodong) The development of Taiwan's Wanjian missile, also known as the Wan Chien or the 'Ten Thousand Swords Bomb,' began in the early 2000s as a response to the growing threat posed by China's military advancements. Initiated under the codename 'Project Divine Axe' by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), the missile was designed to neutralize strategic targets such as airstrips, radar installations, and troop concentrations on the southeastern coast of mainland China. Drawing inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the Storm Shadow, its development incorporated advanced features like GPS and inertial navigation guidance, as well as a turbofan engine for extended range. The missile first underwent testing in the mid-2000s, achieved combat readiness in 2010, entered service in 2011, and entered mass production in 2015 after system integration with Taiwan’s AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter jets. Production of the Wanjian-1 bomb commenced in 2015 and was carried out under a special budget, producing approximately 50 units annually during peak production periods. Live-fire exercises by F-CK-1 units in Tainan and Taichung demonstrated its effectiveness, targeting simulated installations on the southeastern coast of China, including strikes targeting facilities in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces from positions near the midline of the Taiwan Strait. It supports Taiwan’s defensive strategy by enabling precision strikes on key installations beyond the reach of short-range defenses. The Wanjian bomb is integrated with the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo, with each aircraft capable of carrying one missile under each wing. The missile is guided by GPS, inertial navigation, and terrain recognition (TERCOM) systems for mid-flight adjustments, along with terminal guidance technologies such as image infrared (IIR) and digital scene matching area correlation (DSMAC). The missile’s design features a square body, foldable wings for compact storage and aerodynamic performance, an X-shaped rudder for directional control, and a turbofan engine that allows subsonic speeds up to Mach 0.8. It carries a 350-kilogram warhead containing submunitions equipped with delayed fuzes. These submunitions are engineered to penetrate surfaces and detonate underground, maximizing damage to hardened targets. The development of the Wanjian-2, also known as the Extended-Range Wanjian Bomb, is now being carried out to realize precision strikes at ranges up to 400 km. Also designed for the F-CK-1 fighter, it features a cluster munition warhead capable of targeting runways, radars, and troop concentrations. The missile utilizes GPS and inertial navigation with advanced terminal guidance for enhanced accuracy. Its design includes foldable wings, an X-tail configuration, and a turbofan engine for subsonic flight. It seems that small-scale production of the Wanjian-2 variant is set to continue under Taiwan's annual defense budget to bolster long-range strike capabilities. This extended-range version will enhance strike capabilities by allowing deeper penetration into adversary-controlled areas. However, it remains in the development phase under the Ministry of National Defense’s regular budget allocations. The Wanjian draws inspiration and technical input from Western missiles, particularly the U.S. AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) and the British Storm Shadow. (Picture source: NCSIST) Despite its capabilities, the Wanjian missile's reliance on a non-stealthy design and subsonic speed makes it vulnerable to modern air defense systems, particularly during low-altitude flight paths needed for accurate targeting of runways or other fixed installations. The missile's effectiveness is further constrained by the limited range and survivability of its carrier platform, the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter, which risks interception before launch in contested airspace. Additionally, dependence on civilian GPS navigation rather than military-grade systems reduces its accuracy under electronic countermeasure conditions. These factors could collectively undermine the Wanjian's operational potential in high-threat environments. In addition to its existing applications, the feasibility of adapting the Wanjian bomb for use on helicopters was proposed by Kuomintang legislators in 2019. The proposal emphasized the need to overcome the dependency on operational runways during a conflict, addressing the expected asymmetry in air force readiness caused by immediate damage to airfields. However, a feasibility assessment by the Air Force concluded that adapting the Wanjian bomb for helicopter deployment is both technically challenging and impractical. The assessment cited the size and weight of the missile, the limited payload capacity of helicopters, and the need for U.S. approval for modifications to American-made rotorcraft as significant obstacles. While the suggestion aimed to reduce dependency on runways, the Air Force stated that the Wanjian bomb’s current integration with AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo aircraft remains the optimal approach. In recent years, Taiwan has been enhancing its cruise missile capabilities through the development and deployment of several systems. For instance, the Ching Tien (擎天) supersonic cruise missile, with a range of 2,000 kilometers, has entered mass production and is being deployed by the Air Force, enabling it to reach targets north of Beijing. The Hsiung Sheng, an extended-range variant of the Hsiung Feng IIE land-attack cruise missile, is planned for deployment in 2024, offering a range of up to 1,200 kilometers to target critical sites such as the People's Liberation Army's Eastern and Southern Theater Command bases. With the production of the Wanjian missile system, these missiles are part of Taiwan's efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities amid regional security concerns. Taiwan is responding to increased military pressure from China by enhancing its defense capabilities through various measures. The United States has approved arms sales to Taiwan, including a $2 billion package featuring the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Taiwan has increased its defense budget by 7.7% for 2025, with allocations for new fighter jets and missile production. Domestically, Taiwan launched its first indigenously built submarine, the Haikun, to strengthen naval deterrence. The US Department of Defense is also working with Taiwan on deploying drone swarms aimed at deterring potential Chinese actions. These measures reflect Taiwan’s efforts to address regional security tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/taiwan-ramps-up-wanjian-cruise-missile-production-to-strengthen-the-countrys-naval-and-air-capabilities	2024-12-10T02:15:20-08:00	
Breaking News: Taiwan Launches Combat Readiness Exercises Following China's Deployment of 90 Warships	China's recent deployment of approximately 90 naval and coast guard vessels near Taiwan represents a large escalation in regional tensions, prompting a robust response from Taiwan. On December 9, 2024, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense announced the launch of combat readiness exercises to counter this unprecedented show of force, the largest in recent months. The deployment spans waters near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas, surpassing previous military activities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwan has raised its alert level following the sighting of over 90 Chinese naval and coast guard ships in the region. However, the defense ministry has not officially classified the movements as drills. (Picture source: Taiwanese Media TV screenshot) The Taiwanese Ministry of Defense has also established an emergency response center to monitor the situation closely and address all 'gray zone' incursions—non-traditional military operations designed to exert pressure without open conflict. This escalation coincides with Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's recent visit to Guam, a move Beijing views as provocative due to its opposition to official interactions between Taiwan and the United States. China's actions align with its broader strategy to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, potentially through military force. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has undergone rapid modernization and expansion, significantly enhancing its power projection capabilities. Beijing's possible plans for a naval assault include several scenarios. One potential strategy is a large-scale amphibious invasion, requiring substantial lift capacity and coordination to transport troops and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. However, China's current amphibious fleet may fall short of the requirements for a full-scale invasion, potentially necessitating the use of civilian vessels. While increasing transport capacity, these vessels are more vulnerable to Taiwan’s asymmetric defenses, such as missile-armed fast attack boats and stealthy corvettes. Another strategy could involve imposing a maritime blockade to sever Taiwan's critical supply lines, aiming to force political concessions without direct confrontation. Taiwan's heavy reliance on maritime trade makes it particularly susceptible to such a strategy. Additionally, China might continue to employ gray zone tactics, such as deploying maritime militias and conducting frequent incursions into Taiwanese waters and airspace, designed to test Taiwan’s responses and exert sustained pressure without triggering outright conflict. Taiwan's Republic of China Navy (ROCN) is a critical component of its defense strategy, tasked with countering these potential threats. As of 2024, the ROCN comprises approximately 40,000 personnel and a diverse fleet. The navy operates four Kee Lung-class guided-missile destroyers, which are former U.S. Navy vessels serving as the backbone of Taiwan's surface combatants. It also operates 22 frigates, including eight Cheng Kung-class frigates (based on the U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry-class) and six Kang Ding-class frigates, offering versatile capabilities for maritime defense. Two Tuo Chiang-class stealth corvettes have been commissioned, designed for high-speed operations and equipped with advanced anti-ship missiles. The ROCN maintains four submarines, including two Hai Lung-class and two older Hai Shih-class vessels, focused on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Taiwan has launched an ambitious program to construct seven new diesel-electric submarines over the next decade, significantly bolstering its undersea capabilities. Additionally, the navy operates eight amphibious ships, including tank landing ships and a recently commissioned Yushan-class amphibious transport dock, as well as various support vessels for logistics and replenishment. Recent efforts to develop asymmetric warfare capabilities focus on smaller, stealthier vessels equipped with precision-guided weaponry to offset the PLAN's numerical superiority.The Republic of China Marine Corps (ROCMC), Taiwan's elite amphibious warfare unit, plays a critical role in the defense of the island nation. With a strength of approximately 8,000 to 10,000 personnel, the ROCMC is trained for specialized missions, including amphibious assaults, coastal defense, and the protection of Taiwan's offshore islands such as Kinmen and Matsu. Equipped with a diverse array of weapons and platforms, the Marine Corps fields modern assault rifles, machine guns, mortars, and rocket launchers for ground operations. For amphibious missions, they rely on vehicles like the AAV-7A1 amphibious assault vehicles, capable of transporting troops from ships to shore under combat conditions. The ROCMC also trains extensively in urban warfare, jungle operations, and joint exercises with other branches of Taiwan's military to ensure interoperability. These forces are prepared to respond swiftly to invasions or incursions, emphasizing the defense of Taiwan's sovereignty and the recovery of occupied territory in a conflict scenario. China's naval forces have seen rapid growth, making the PLAN (People's Liberation Army Navy - Chinese Navy) the world's largest navy, with over 370 ships and submarines, including more than 140 major surface combatants. The PLAN’s modern arsenal includes advanced warships such as the Type 055 destroyers and the aircraft carrier CNS Fujian, reflecting China’s ambition to project power and assert its maritime claims. China’s shipbuilding capacity, which is over 230 times greater than that of the United States, has enabled this rapid expansion. The current developments mark a critical juncture in cross-strait relations, with China's substantial military presence near Taiwan heightening regional tensions. Taiwan's proactive defense measures and calls for international support reflect its determination to safeguard its sovereignty amidst growing external pressures. The evolving naval capabilities of both Taiwan and China will play a pivotal role in shaping the future security dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-taiwan-launches-combat-readiness-exercises-following-chinas-deployment-of-90-warships	2024-12-10T02:03:37-08:00	
Russia May Exchange MiG-29 and Su-27 Fighter Jets for North Korean Troops Deployed in Ukraine	Russia and North Korea have reportedly reached a strategic agreement marking a significant step in their military cooperation. This deal aligns with Moscow’s strategy to strengthen its alliances amidst Western sanctions, while Pyongyang sees a rare opportunity to modernize its outdated air force. According to information disclosed by Admiral Samuel Paparo at the Reagan National Defense Forum on December 7, 2024, North Korea would receive Russian MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets. In return, North Korea is believed to have sent approximately 12,000 soldiers to support Russian military operations in Ukraine. These troops, though not directly involved in combat, are reportedly deployed in conflict zones. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This agreement offers North Korea a critical upgrade from its outdated second-generation aircraft fleet to more advanced MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters (Picture source: Vitaly V. Kuzmin) The delivery of MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter jets is part of Russia’s broader strategy to leverage its allies to counter international pressures. While the exact number of aircraft to be transferred remains unclear, their inclusion in North Korea’s fleet would significantly bolster Pyongyang’s military capabilities. However, these jets are technically inferior to fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. This agreement comes as North Korea’s air force, historically reliant on Soviet and Chinese support, struggles with decades of stagnation and international sanctions. Its current fleet is largely composed of Soviet-era aircraft from the 1980s, many of which are no longer operational. The MiG-29, developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich, is a twin-engine, fourth-generation fighter designed for air superiority. It is equipped with a Phazotron N019 radar capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' operations. The jet’s armament includes a 30mm cannon and air-to-air missiles such as the medium-range R-27 and short-range R-73. Renowned for its exceptional maneuverability, the MiG-29 features advanced aerodynamics and a high thrust-to-weight ratio, reaching speeds of Mach 2.3 and operating at altitudes up to 17,000 meters. The Su-27, designed by Sukhoi, is a long-range air superiority fighter equipped with a Phazotron N001 Myech radar, also capable of 'look-down/shoot-down' targeting. It is armed with a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 30mm cannon and up to ten hardpoints for air-to-air missiles like the R-73 and R-27. Known for its agility, the Su-27 incorporates advanced fly-by-wire controls and can execute complex maneuvers such as the 'Cobra.' It achieves speeds of Mach 2.35 and operates at altitudes up to 18,500 meters. For North Korea, this agreement addresses a major strategic gap. Its air force currently includes over 400 combat aircraft, but a significant portion belongs to the second generation, such as the Chinese-made J-5 and J-6, copies of the Soviet MiG-17 and MiG-19. Adding MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters from the 1980s would represent a considerable technological upgrade. These jets, equipped with relatively modern radars and weapon systems for their era, would enhance Pyongyang’s defensive capabilities against advanced South Korean forces. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) The deal also underscores Pyongyang’s broader interest in advanced military technologies. In addition to fighter jets, North Korea may seek Russian expertise in ballistic missile re-entry vehicles, modern submarines, and air defense systems. This cooperation could help North Korea counter South Korea’s 'three-axis' doctrine, which focuses on neutralizing North Korean threats through preemptive, defensive, and offensive measures. This exchange occurs amid heightened regional tensions between the two Koreas. In June 2024, North Korean soldiers crossed into South Korea before retreating under warning shots from South Korean forces. More recently, in October 2024, North Korea destroyed sections of roads symbolizing reunification efforts and bolstered defensive structures along the border. These incidents highlight escalating tensions, marked by border clashes and military threats. Integrating MiG-29 and Su-27 jets into North Korea’s air force could improve its air defense and air superiority capabilities. However, these aircraft remain outclassed by fifth-generation fighters like South Korea’s F-35s. Additionally, the operational effectiveness of these jets will depend on pilot training and maintenance, areas where North Korea faces significant challenges. While this agreement strengthens North Korea’s air fleet quantitatively, it is unlikely to shift the aerial power balance significantly in the Korean Peninsula. Russia’s collaboration with Pyongyang aligns with its broader military partnerships with other U.S. adversaries, such as Iran and China. Recently, Iran received Su-35 jets and Mi-28 helicopters, while China has benefited from increased Russian technological support in sensitive areas like submarines and missiles. These partnerships reflect Russia’s growing reliance on allies to sustain its military capabilities under international sanctions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/russia-may-exchange-mig-29-and-su-27-fighter-jets-for-north-korean-troops-deployed-in-ukraine	2024-12-10T01:55:42-08:00	
Russia to receive newest nuclear submarine Arkhangelsk with Kalibr Missiles in summer 2025	According to information published by Russian sources on December 6, 2024, the Russian Navy is preparing to enhance its underwater warfare capabilities with the addition of the Arkhangelsk, a multipurpose nuclear-powered submarine, slated for delivery in the summer of 2025. This submarine, part of the modernized Project 885M Yasen-M class, is being constructed by Sevmash, a division of the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Arkhangelsk, Russia's advanced Yasen-M class nuclear-powered submarine, is set to join the Navy in 2025, equipped with Kalibr and Oniks missiles. (Picture source: Paluba Media) Currently undergoing state trials, the Arkhangelsk represents the latest in naval engineering and technology. The submarine entered sea trials in June 2024. It was launched on November 29, 2023, from Sevmash's shipyard in Severodvinsk for final outfitting and floating completion. In the event of a military conflict between NATO and Russia, the Arkhangelsk submarine, as part of the modernized Yasen-M class, could play a pivotal role in shifting the balance of power in the maritime domain and beyond. Its advanced capabilities make it an asset capable of addressing several strategic and tactical objectives: The Arkhangelsk is equipped with Kalibr-PL cruise missiles, capable of striking NATO targets at long distances, including critical infrastructure, command centers, and military bases. This capability serves as a strong deterrent, as the threat of precision strikes can dissuade adversaries from escalating conflict. Additionally, its ability to launch Oniks supersonic missiles provides a credible countermeasure to NATO surface fleets, including aircraft carrier strike groups. Operating in key maritime regions such as the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, or the Arctic, the Arkhangelsk could enforce sea denial strategies, restricting NATO's freedom of movement. Its stealth capabilities enable it to approach high-value targets undetected, posing a constant threat to NATO naval operations. By deploying near NATO maritime chokepoints, the submarine could effectively challenge or block naval reinforcements. With its advanced sensors, weaponry, and stealth design, the Arkhangelsk would likely be a formidable opponent in undersea warfare. It could hunt NATO submarines, including those tasked with deploying ballistic or cruise missiles, thus undermining NATO’s strategic deterrent capabilities. The submarine’s ability to operate covertly in the Atlantic could allow it to disrupt NATO's vital maritime supply routes between North America and Europe. Striking supply convoys and transport vessels would complicate NATO’s logistical efforts, potentially delaying reinforcements and resupply operations. The Kalibr-PL missiles on board the 'Arkhangelsk' are capable of precision strikes on land-based targets. In a conflict, the submarine could launch coordinated missile barrages against NATO military installations, communication hubs, or missile defense sites, potentially neutralizing critical components of NATO’s operational network. Given its Arctic-capable design, the 'Arkhangelsk' could support operations in the increasingly contested Arctic region. Control over this region is crucial for both Russia and NATO, as it holds strategic sea lanes and natural resources. The submarine could patrol under the Arctic ice, undetected, projecting power and securing Russian claims in the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-to-receive-newest-nuclear-submarine-arkhangelsk-with-kalibr-missiles-in-summer-2025	2024-12-10T01:32:35-08:00	
US Army Explores PrSM Inc. 5 Missile for Autonomous Launchers Exceeding 1000 km	The US Army is advancing its technological capabilities in long-range precision strikes with plans to develop a fifth iteration of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), designed to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers. During a December 3, 2024 event hosted by the Association of the US Army, two senior military officials shared insights into this project, which could significantly enhance the Army's strike range capabilities. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Major General Winston Brook, commander of the Fires Center of Excellence, presented a slide that identified the PrSM Increment 5 as a prospective future capability. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, explained that preliminary work on this fifth version of the PrSM has commenced, with a formal science and technology development initiative scheduled for fiscal year 2026. According to Brig. Gen. Crooks, the primary goal of Increment 5 is to develop a missile that can be launched from an autonomous platform, departing from traditional systems like the M142 HIMARS and M270 MLRS. This innovation involves creating a launcher without a cab, allowing for potentially larger and longer-range munitions. 'If you’re familiar with an MLRS pod, it’s about 13 feet long. With an autonomous system, you might be able to use something longer,' Crooks noted, suggesting the possibility of achieving ranges currently deemed unrealistic. Although the program has received initial funding for science and technology research, Crooks clarified that there is no definitive timeline for formal competition or development. This highlights the program's exploratory nature, with its future depending on results from these early stages. For several years, the Army has been developing earlier versions of the PrSM to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and ensure compatibility with current launch systems like HIMARS and the M270A2 MLRS. Currently, Increment 1 missiles, produced by Lockheed Martin, are being fielded and are capable of striking targets at distances of at least 500 kilometers. Subsequent increments include Increment 2, which features a multimode seeker known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and Increment 3, which is designed to incorporate enhanced lethality payloads. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team are working on competing designs for Increment 4, which aims to double the range of earlier versions, surpassing 1,000 kilometers. The development of Increment 5 represents a pivotal step toward integrating autonomous technologies for advanced military operations. Despite significant technical challenges, the initiative underscores the Army’s commitment to extending the boundaries of precision long-range strikes. If successful, the PrSM Increment 5 could offer substantial strategic advantages in future military scenarios. Though the PrSM Increment 5 remains conceptual, it reflects the Army's clear ambition to modernize its arsenal through innovative technology. The program's trajectory will depend on the progress achieved in the coming years, with potential implications for the future of warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-explores-prsm-inc-5-missile-for-autonomous-launchers-exceeding-1000-km	2024-12-10T01:16:48-08:00

Each mine includes GPS for precise geolocation and can alert operators to positional changes. The mines can be deployed on the surface or buried, with real-time adjustability. They use a directional warhead designed to penetrate up to 140 mm of rolled homogeneous armor. Anti-handling mechanisms prevent tampering, and unused mines can be retrieved and redeployed. Deployment requires intervals of 2.5 meters, and nine mines are sufficient to block a standard two-lane road. The system is designed to achieve similar effectiveness to conventional mines with fewer units. Lithuania has also procured the Sentry system, purchasing a batch for €5.9 million ($6.51 million). These mines are being deployed as part of a counter-mobility initiative along Lithuania’s borders with Belarus and Russia’s Kaliningrad region. Lithuanian authorities highlighted the system’s ability to differentiate between friendly and hostile forces and its remote activation and deactivation capabilities as operational advantages. This deployment forms part of a broader strategy to strengthen border defenses, including physical barriers and other obstacles. The Czech Republic is enhancing its military capabilities due to heightened security concerns in Europe, particularly related to Russia's military actions in Ukraine. According to the 2023 Defence Strategy, Russia is identified as the primary long-term threat to the Czech Republic and NATO, marking the highest risk of military conflict since the Cold War. The strategy underscores the necessity for stronger national defense and increased NATO cooperation to address these risks. Modernization efforts include the acquisition of new military equipment and international defense partnerships. The Czech government has approved the purchase of 24 F-35 fighter jets from the U.S., with deliveries scheduled between 2029 and 2033. Additionally, up to 28 Leopard 2A4 and 77 Leopard 2A8 tanks are being procured from Germany to replace Soviet-era T-72 tanks, reducing reliance on Russian-manufactured equipment. The Czech Republic has also provided $288 million in military aid to Ukraine, including aircraft, tanks, and ammunition. Furthermore, it is coordinating the procurement of artillery shells for Ukraine, financed through frozen Russian assets within the EU. These initiatives aim to strengthen national defense and address regional security objectives.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/czech-republic-to-reinforce-anti-tank-capabilities-with-10-000-finnish-sentry-mines	2024-12-09T08:17:28-08:00

The vehicles will enhance the Armed Forces' operational capacity during the ongoing State of Exception and are intended to address an increased activity of organized crime and narco-terrorism. These units are to be deployed to conflict-prone regions immediately. The announcement was made during a ceremony at Wing 23 in Manta, attended by Minister of Defense Gian Carlo Loffredo and President Daniel Noboa, who reviewed the vehicles. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ecuador's massive procurement of modern armored vehicles is a response to increasing violence related to organized crime and drug trafficking, particularly along its northern border. (Picture source: Ecuador MoD) Ecuador's procurement of advanced armored vehicles is a response to increasing violence related to organized crime and drug trafficking, particularly along its northern border. The presence of Colombian armed groups and dissidents, including remnants of the FARC-EP, has intensified security issues. This latest delivery follows the August addition of 51 vehicles, bringing the total to over 100. Under a $65 million contract with Elbit Systems in 2022, Ecuador has acquired 137 vehicles, including Israeli-made MDT Armor Tiger MKII 4x4 and South African Mbombe 6 6x6 models. These vehicles are intended to support surveillance, control operations, and counterinsurgency missions in high-risk areas. The Mbombe 6, produced by South Africa’s Paramount Group, is a 6x6 armored vehicle providing STANAG Level 3 protection and a V-shaped hull designed to withstand up to 10 kilograms of TNT. It is armed with a 30 mm cannon and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun. The vehicle accommodates 11 personnel, including the driver and commander, and offers a payload capacity of 2,300 kilograms. With a top speed of 100 kilometers per hour and an operational range of 700 kilometers, it is designed for use in urban, rural, and border operations. The MDT David 4x4, manufactured by MDT Armor Corporation, a subsidiary of Israel’s Shladot LTD, is based on the Toyota Hilux platform and provides STANAG Level II ballistic protection. It can transport up to eight personnel and is configurable with 3, 4, or 5 doors. The vehicle features a 148 horsepower engine with 408 Nm of torque, options for manual or automatic transmission, a ground clearance of 279 mm, and approach and departure angles of 35° and 30°, respectively. With a gross vehicle weight of 4,200 kilograms, it is designed for personnel transport, reconnaissance, and tactical missions. In 2024, Ecuador introduced its first locally developed Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, the Blindex Armorings C.A-Hino Dutro 716. This vehicle has NIJ Level III ballistic protection, a monocoque body, and reinforced structures capable of withstanding 7.62 x 51 mm NATO rounds. It can transport up to ten occupants, including a gunner, and is equipped with fire suppression systems, security cameras, and ballistic glass windows. It is designed for anti-terrorism and counter-narcotics operations. Additionally, Ecuador procured 20 Otokar Cobra II 4x4 tactical vehicles from Turkey’s Otokar company in August 2023, followed by 15 Otokar Ural 4x4 tactical vehicles in November 2023. These acquisitions form part of a broader effort to improve operational capabilities against criminal and insurgent activities. Ecuador is experiencing a significant security crisis driven by organized crime and drug trafficking. In January 2024, the escape of drug lord Adolfo Macias, alias Fito, exacerbated the situation. In early December 2024, ten individuals, including nine Colombians, were killed in El Guabo, El Oro Province, in an attack linked to gang conflicts. In another incident, footballer Pedro Pablo Perlaza was kidnapped in Esmeraldas but later rescued by police. Additionally, Olger Moreno, the deputy security chief of Cotopaxi prison, was assassinated in late November. Ecuador has accepted military assistance from over 38 nations, including the United States and Argentina, as part of its efforts to address these issues. A state of emergency has been declared, and military forces have been deployed to support police operations against criminal groups. Despite these measures, violence remains a concern, particularly in areas where Colombian and Ecuadorian drug trafficking organizations compete for control of cocaine production and trafficking routes along the Amazonian border. These efforts reflect Ecuador's attempt to strengthen its security infrastructure and respond to escalating threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/ecuador-deploys-over-100-new-israeli-mdt-david-and-south-african-mbombe-6-armored-vehicles-to-address-escalating-violence	2024-12-09T08:09:24-08:00	
Qatar Increases Air Combat Power with Additional Order of Twelve New Typhoon Fighters	On December 6, 2024, the Qatari government announced its intention to acquire 12 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighters, thereby strengthening its military aviation capabilities and deepening defense ties with the United Kingdom. The agreement was disclosed following the state visit of Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, to the United Kingdom, where he met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This decision marks a significant step in the growing partnership between the two countries, particularly in the field of defense cooperation. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Qatari government announced its intention to acquire 12 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighters. (Picture source: BAE Systems) The contract, valued at approximately £2.8 billion, will benefit the production facilities of BAE Systems in Samlesbury and Warton, ensuring continuity of operations at these key sites. This new order builds on Qatar’s 2017 purchase of 24 Typhoons and complements its diverse fleet, which also includes French Rafales and American F-15QAs. The integration of the Typhoons into the joint No. 12 Squadron, operated by the Qatari Air Force and the British Royal Air Force, underscores their strategic role in strengthening bilateral military collaborations. Qatar has significantly enhanced its military air fleet over the past decade by adopting a strategy of supply diversification to ensure its security and operational independence. In 2017, Doha signed a €5.6 billion contract for the acquisition of 24 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters from the Eurofighter consortium (BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo), reinforced by an additional order for 12 units announced in December 2024, valued at an estimated £2.8 billion. These aircraft are integrated into the joint No. 12 Squadron with the British Royal Air Force, symbolizing strengthened military cooperation between Qatar and the United Kingdom. In December 2024, during the state visit of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani to the United Kingdom, the two nations strengthened their defense partnership by signing agreements to extend their collaboration on joint squadrons of Typhoon and Hawk aircraft. On this occasion, two Typhoon fighters from the joint No. 12 Squadron escorted the Emir’s aircraft as it entered British airspace, illustrating their operational synergy. This visit highlights the deepening military ties between the United Kingdom and Qatar, based on their historical relationship and shared commitment to regional security. The Typhoon offers Qatar’s armed forces a modern and versatile combat platform capable of meeting diverse operational needs. With its advanced avionics, high-speed performance (Mach 2), and exceptional maneuverability, it is perfectly suited for air-to-air combat and ground attack missions. Equipped with the AESA Captor-E radar and a wide array of precision-guided munitions, including Meteor and Brimstone missiles, the Typhoon enhances Qatar’s air superiority and strike capabilities. Additionally, its integration into the joint No. 12 Squadron between the United Kingdom and Qatar provides valuable training, NATO-standard interoperability, and a strategic partnership with a key ally, further strengthening Qatar’s defensive posture and regional influence. In parallel, Qatar has also invested in French Rafale fighters, signing an initial contract for 24 aircraft in 2015, followed by an additional order for 12 units in 2017, bringing the total cost to approximately €6.3 billion. These Rafales are expected to be upgraded to the F4 standard, adding enhanced capabilities such as advanced connectivity systems and next-generation armaments. Finally, Qatar purchased 36 American F-15QA fighters under a $12 billion contract signed in 2017. These acquisitions reflect a pragmatic strategy, balancing strategic alliances and military enhancement, with a fleet combining the strengths of major aviation powers. While the announcement surprised France, where negotiations for additional Rafales and other military equipment were ongoing, it illustrates Qatar’s delicate balance between maintaining operational readiness and developing strong relationships with major defense suppliers. This agreement is particularly significant as the Typhoon had not received recent export orders before Qatar’s renewed interest, positioning the United Kingdom as a key strategic partner for Doha in a competitive regional landscape. This development also reflects changes in Qatar’s defense procurement strategy, including its exploration of joint infantry mechanisms with the United Kingdom, potentially centered on ARTEC’s Boxer armored vehicle. By diversifying its defense assets and partnerships, this Typhoon agreement highlights Qatar’s commitment to a robust and versatile military posture aligned with NATO standards and adapted to an increasingly complex geopolitical environment. Qatar’s decision not to opt for additional Rafales, despite the aircraft’s excellent performance, can be attributed to several strategic and political reasons. Firstly, Qatar already has 36 Rafales in its fleet, which may limit the immediate appeal of a new order, especially with existing aircraft undergoing upgrades to the F4 standard. In contrast, the Typhoon provides an opportunity to further diversify operational capabilities and strategic partnerships, strengthening the already solid military cooperation with the United Kingdom, particularly through the joint No. 12 Squadron. Additionally, the purchase of new Typhoons can be seen as a political decision aimed at balancing relationships with multiple major defense suppliers, avoiding over-reliance on France, which has already supplied Rafales and various military equipment. Furthermore, support for the British industry, facing challenges with the Typhoon in the international market, may have influenced the decision. This strategic choice also allows Qatar to leverage the specific advantages of the Typhoon, such as its enhanced air superiority through the Captor-E radar and Meteor missile, complementing the capabilities already offered by the Rafale. In summary, this decision seems driven more by diplomatic and strategic considerations than by any technical shortcomings of the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon operated by Qatar is a high-tech multirole fighter equipped with the most advanced technologies. It features the AESA Captor-E radar for superior target detection and tracking, along with the advanced Defensive Aids Subsystem (DASS) for enhanced survivability and modern avionics that ensure high operational versatility. Powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines, the Typhoon reaches a maximum speed of Mach 2 and has a combat range of over 1,500 km. Its armament systems include a wide range of air-to-air missiles, such as the Meteor, precision-guided munitions, and the Brimstone missile for ground-attack missions, making it a formidable force in modern aerial combat.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/qatar-increases-air-combat-power-with-additional-order-of-twelve-new-typhoon-fighters	2024-12-09T07:28:26-08:00	
Breaking News: Dutch F-35 Fighter Jets Conduct First Interceptions of Russian Spy Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	Dutch Air Force F-35 fighter jets stationed in Estonia have successfully conducted their first operational interceptions over the Baltic Sea, showcasing the Netherlands’ commitment to NATO’s collective defense. On Friday, December 6, two Dutch F-35s were scrambled twice under the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) protocol to intercept and monitor Russian aircraft operating near NATO airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link During an interception mission, a Dutch Air Force F-35A Lightning II escorts a Russian SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea, demonstrating NATO's vigilance in safeguarding its airspace. (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) During the first interception, the Dutch F-35 fighter jets identified a Russian Antonov AN-73/74 'Coaler' transport aircraft and a Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' reconnaissance jet. The SU-24MR specializes in electronic intelligence gathering, highlighting the persistent surveillance activities conducted by Russian forces near NATO territory. Later in the day, the QRA was activated again, with the F-35s intercepting an Ilyushin IL-20 'Coot A,' an advanced surveillance aircraft equipped for electronic monitoring. The Sukhoi SU-24MR 'Fencer E' is a specialized variant of the SU-24, a supersonic, all-weather tactical bomber developed by the Soviet Union. The SU-24MR is configured specifically for reconnaissance missions, equipped with advanced sensors and electronic intelligence-gathering systems. Although the Russian planes remained in international airspace, the Dutch F-35s closely monitored and escorted them to the edge of NATO’s area of responsibility. These interceptions demonstrate NATO’s operational readiness and ability to secure its airspace amid increased tensions in the Baltic region. The deployment of Dutch F-35s to Estonia is part of NATO’s Air Policing mission, which aims to protect the airspace of its eastern members. Since December 1, the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) has operated four F-35A Lightning II fighters from Ämari Air Base. This deployment underscores the Netherlands’ dedication to NATO and the security of its allies in Eastern Europe. The F-35 program has been a cornerstone of the Netherlands’ air defense modernization strategy. The acquisition process began in the early 2000s when the Netherlands joined the Joint Strike Fighter program as a Level 2 partner, contributing significantly to the aircraft’s development. The first operational F-35A arrived in the Netherlands in October 2019 at Leeuwarden Air Base. By December 2021, the RNLAF declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its fleet, signaling readiness for limited combat operations. Initially, the Netherlands planned to acquire 85 F-35As to replace its aging F-16 fleet, but budget constraints later reduced the order. As of 2022, the Ministry of Defence expanded its plans, increasing the total to 52 aircraft. The first operational deployment of Dutch F-35s occurred in April 2022 when four jets were stationed in Bulgaria to support NATO’s enhanced Air Policing mission. The F-35A’s advanced stealth, sensor fusion, and electronic warfare capabilities have made it an essential component of NATO operations. Its introduction has significantly enhanced the RNLAF’s ability to detect, monitor, and respond to threats, particularly in high-tension areas like the Baltic. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans praised the rapid response of Dutch forces during the recent interceptions. 'This is why our people are there: to protect our collective airspace against Russian threats. As was once again evident on Friday, Russian forces are active in various ways near NATO airspace. Our allies in the Baltic states are pleased with our efforts. I am proud of our people who were able to immediately demonstrate their value to our security,' he said. The Baltic region remains a hotspot for military activity, with frequent incursions by Russian aircraft testing NATO’s readiness. These incidents underscore the importance of the QRA protocol, which allows NATO fighter jets to scramble within minutes to intercept and identify potential threats. The successful interception mission by Dutch F-35s highlights NATO’s resolve to protect its members and affirms the Netherlands’ role as a critical player in the alliance’s defense strategy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-dutch-f-35-fighter-jets-conduct-first-interceptions-of-russian-spy-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2024-12-09T06:59:02-08:00	
Peru Modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean 4x4 K808 IFVs and K2 Tanks to Replace Soviet-Era Vehicles	On December 9, 2024, in Lima, the Peruvian Army unveiled the K808 'White Tiger' armored personnel carrier during the celebrations of the Battle of Ayacucho and Army Day. In May 2024, Hyundai Rotem and STX were selected to supply 30 K808 'Baekho' wheeled armored vehicles to Peru under a contract valued at $60 million. This order marks the first export of South Korean armored vehicles to Latin America. Initially planned for 30 units, the contract could expand to a total of 120 vehicles depending on the future needs of the Peruvian Armed Forces. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Peruvian Army modernizes Armored Fleet with South Korean K808 'White Tiger' IFVs. (Picture source: Peru MoD) On November 16, 2024, also in Lima, Hyundai Rotem signed a second memorandum of understanding with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian Army’s weapons and ammunition factory, for the supply of K2 'Black Panther' main battle tanks. Although financial details and the exact number of tanks have not been officially disclosed, sources suggest that Peru plans to acquire approximately 100 K2 tanks to replace its aging fleet of T-55 tanks. This initiative is part of a broader modernization program for the Peruvian Armed Forces, aimed at strengthening their operational capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment. On December 9, 2024, three K808 'White Tiger' vehicles paraded, proudly displaying the Peruvian and South Korean flags, symbolizing South Korea's growing importance to the Peruvian Armed Forces and Peru’s commitment to modernizing its aging fleet. The fleet, still largely composed of Soviet-era vehicles such as the T-55 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), demonstrates the need for modernization. The BMP-1, developed in the 1960s, is equipped with a 73mm cannon and anti-tank missile launcher but is outdated in terms of armor and weaponry by current standards. This reliance on aging equipment underscores the necessity for Peru to upgrade its armored fleet to meet the demands of modern battlefields and provide better protection and operational effectiveness for its troops. Peru has shown an increasing willingness to diversify and modernize its armed forces by turning to Western partners. This trend was reinforced in September 2024 when the government included funding for 24 new fighter jets in the 2025 budget. Among the options considered, the French Rafale emerged as a favorite, outpacing competitors like the American F-16 and Swedish Gripen. In November 2024, this shift continued with the Peruvian Congress authorizing the entry of 600 U.S. military personnel to assist with security preparations for the 2024 APEC meetings, further strengthening military ties with the United States. This shift represents a notable departure from Peru’s historical reliance on Russian military equipment. In the 2010s, the country had considered acquiring T-90 tanks to replace its aging T-55s. However, in 2023, significant challenges in obtaining spare parts for its MiG-29 fleet highlighted the limitations of cooperation with Russia. While relations with Moscow persist, decisions made between 2023 and 2024 demonstrate Peru’s growing commitment to strengthening partnerships with Western nations to meet the demands of modernizing its armed forces and aligning with contemporary military standards. Discussions about the South Korean agreements began several years ago, supported by consistent diplomatic efforts. In 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol sent a letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, celebrating 60 years of bilateral relations and emphasizing the potential for increased defense cooperation. Between 2023 and 2024, Peruvian military delegations visited South Korea to witness demonstrations of the K808’s capabilities in scenarios simulating mountainous operations and counterterrorism missions. The K808, also known as 'Baekho' (White Tiger), was designed in 2003 and has proven its reliability in the South Korean Army, with over 500 units delivered. Capable of overcoming 40cm obstacles, crossing 1.5-meter trenches, and navigating waterways with its jet propulsion system, it is well-suited to Peru's challenging geography. Its central tire inflation system (CTIS) and advanced mobility make it a strategic asset for the Peruvian Armed Forces. This contract is part of a broader modernization program for Peru's armored fleet, which is still heavily reliant on outdated main battle tanks such as the T-55 and AMX-13 from the 1950s. With this initial order, the long-term outlook is promising. STX and Hyundai Rotem are already in discussions for additional orders and expanded technical collaboration with FAME S.A.C., the Peruvian state arms manufacturer. This partnership, which could span several years, enhances South Korea’s strategic presence in the Latin American defense market. A Hyundai Rotem representative reaffirmed the company’s commitment to leveraging its technological expertise to ensure the success of this collaboration and support Peru’s defense objectives in the years ahead. The partnership between Hyundai Rotem and FAME S.A.C. aims to establish a lasting collaboration, paving the way for future contracts and supporting Peru’s defense modernization efforts. This agreement also solidifies South Korea’s position as a competitive player in the Latin American defense market, aligning with its global strategy for growth in the defense sector.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/peru-modernizes-armored-fleet-with-south-korean-4x4-k808-ifvs-and-k2-tanks-to-replace-soviet-era-vehicles	2024-12-09T06:51:39-08:00	
Royal Malaysian Navy starts Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 construction in Türkiye	On December 4, 2024, the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) officially commenced the construction of its Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) at Istanbul Shipyard in Türkiye. Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. This corvette is already operational in the navies of Türkiye and Pakistan, with additional ships currently under construction for the Ukrainian Navy. The Ada-class design supports multi-role operations, including anti-surface warfare (ASuW), anti-air warfare (AAW), asymmetric warfare (ASYW), and electronic warfare (EW).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Under the LMSB2 project, three ships will be constructed based on the Ada-class corvette design, which was selected through an agreement between Malaysia and Türkiye in June 2024. (Picture source: STM) Other options, including South Korea's HDC-2000 design by Hyundai Heavy Industries and Italy's FCX15 design by Fincantieri, were considered for the LMSB2 program. However, the Turkish Ada-class corvette design was ultimately selected for its operational performance, compatibility with Malaysia’s requirements, and its ability to integrate future naval subsystems from over 50 Turkish defense companies. STM, the project's main contractor, is responsible for all phases, including design, project management, material procurement, assembly, testing, and integrated logistics support (ILS). This marks Malaysia's first defense acquisition through a government-to-government memorandum of understanding (G2G) with another country. STM’s previous experience with Ada-class corvettes for Türkiye, Pakistan, and Ukraine likely influenced this decision. The Ada-class corvette was originally developed under Türkiye’s MILGEM program to meet requirements for anti-submarine warfare, patrol, and maritime surveillance. It features stealth technology, a low radar cross-section, and distributed sensors and weapons systems. The LMSB2 configuration integrates these capabilities while incorporating modifications to meet RMN’s operational needs. The LMSB2 project is a significant component of RMN’s efforts to enhance maritime capabilities, providing flexible operational capacity and effective security for Malaysia’s extensive maritime domain. The ships will feature a lot of systems from Turkish defense companies. Aselsan will supply the 3D surveillance radar, fire control radar, electronic support measures (ESM), and chaff decoy systems. Havelsan will provide the combat management and gun fire control systems. Surface-to-surface missiles (SSMs) will include Roketsan’s Atmaca, while the ships will also be equipped with two quad-packed vertical launch systems (VLS) for 16 Haegung surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) from South Korea’s Lig NEX1. Armament will include a 76mm main gun, a 30mm secondary gun, and decoy launcher systems. Other equipment includes navigation systems, electronic plotting tables, and communication systems. Each Littoral Mission Ship Batch-2 (LMSB2) vessel will measure 99.56 meters in length, have a displacement of approximately 2,500 tons, and accommodate 111 personnel. They will use a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) propulsion system with four diesel engines, providing a top speed of 26 knots, a cruising speed of 14 knots, and an operational range exceeding 4,000 nautical miles. The vessels will have an endurance of 14 days and feature a helipad and hangar for a 10-ton helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicles. Construction and outfitting are expected to conclude by the end of 2027, with delivery to RMN anticipated shortly thereafter. This project aligns with Malaysia’s naval modernization program, guided by the '15 to 5' Transformation Programme, which aims to consolidate RMN’s fleet from 15 classes to five core classes for improved operational and cost efficiency. Key acquisitions include Maharaja Lela-class frigates, Kedah-class offshore patrol vessels, Littoral Mission Ships (LMS), Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS), and Scorpène-class submarines. The Maharaja Lela-class program advanced with the launch of KD Maharaja Lela in June 2024. RMN recently updated its transformation plan to address current maritime security challenges and regional threats. Malaysia's extensive maritime zones, including the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, and the Sulu Sea, are critical to its national security and economic prosperity. These waters, rich in natural resources, also serve as vital trade routes but face challenges such as territorial disputes, illegal fishing, smuggling, and piracy. RMN has identified a growing mismatch between its naval capabilities and the demands of effectively securing these areas. Many RMN vessels date back to the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in increased maintenance issues and reduced readiness. To address this, RMN plans to acquire 18 LMS to bolster patrol and surveillance across its maritime zones. These ships will support diverse missions, including anti-surface warfare, mine warfare, hydrography, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. In the South China Sea, Malaysia asserts its rights over its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and conducts oil and gas exploration through Petronas, despite objections from China. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has confirmed that these operations will continue alongside diplomatic discussions with China. RMN monitors the region and reports the situation as secure, according to Admiral Datuk Zulhelmy Ithnain. In the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia collaborates with regional partners through initiatives like the Malacca Straits Patrol to counter piracy and smuggling. In the Sulu Sea, Malaysia conducts joint patrols with Indonesia and the Philippines to combat transnational crimes such as piracy and kidnapping. These efforts combine diplomacy, security measures, and regional cooperation to manage Malaysia’s maritime zones effectively.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/royal-malaysian-navy-starts-littoral-mission-ship-batch-2-construction-in-tuerkiye	2024-12-09T05:44:59-08:00

Focus: US-made F-35 Stealth Fighter Demonstrates Unmatched Combat Capabilities in Israeli Strike Against Iran	Citing a report from the Simple Flying website, British Admiral Tony Radakin spoke at a Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) lecture in London about how Israel showcased the impressive performance and capabilities of the American-made stealth F-35 fighter jet during the recent airstrikes on Iran. This operation, which targeted over 20 key Iranian military sites, underscored the extraordinary combat capabilities of Israel's fleet of F-35I aircraft, confirming the jet’s role as an unparalleled asset in modern air combat. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Israeli Air Force F-35 stealth fighter jet demonstrates advanced capabilities in the recent strike on Iranian targets. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The raid, which took down missile-manufacturing facilities and critical air-defense systems, highlighted the F-35’s stealth, precision, and long-range strike abilities—key factors that allowed Israel to execute a high-stakes operation with minimal exposure to risk. Israel has now received around 40 of the 75 F-35I aircraft it ordered, and these advanced jets have proven pivotal in enhancing Israel's air superiority. The F-35I, an Israeli-specific variant of the F-35 Lightning II, has been customized with Israeli avionics, software, and systems, enabling the Israeli Air Force to carry out missions with exceptional precision and efficiency. With its combination of stealth technology, cutting-edge sensors, and advanced munitions, the F-35 has set a new standard for military airstrikes, as demonstrated in the operation that Radakin described. Israel’s F-35Is were central to the success of this high-stakes operation, showcasing the fighter’s advanced stealth features, which allowed Israeli jets to penetrate Iranian airspace without being detected by the country’s sophisticated air-defense systems. The F-35's low-observable design—featuring radar-absorbing coatings, advanced shaping, and internal weapons bays—made it virtually invisible to radar, even to Iran's advanced air-defense missile systems, such as the Russian-made S-300s. This allowed Israel to strike key targets deep inside Iranian territory without exposing their aircraft to the kind of risks that conventional fighter jets would face in a similarly contested environment. The F-35’s radar and sensor systems, particularly the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, also played a critical role in the operation. These sensors allowed Israeli pilots to detect and track targets from long distances, far beyond the range of many conventional radar systems. Combined with the Distributed Aperture System (DAS), which offers a 360-degree view of the battlefield, Israeli pilots could identify targets with remarkable accuracy and engage them from a safe distance. The precision of the airstrike was made possible by the F-35’s ability to carry out precision-guided strikes on a variety of targets. With its advanced weapon systems, such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and StormBreaker bombs, the F-35 can accurately strike even highly protected or deeply buried targets. These munitions are guided by GPS, infrared, and laser systems, ensuring they hit their targets with near-perfect accuracy. In this raid, Israel used fewer than 100 munitions to take out more than 20 military sites, emphasizing the high efficiency of the operation. This operational precision stood in stark contrast to other air campaigns, such as Russia’s strikes in Ukraine, where inefficiency and missed targets have been commonplace. The F-35’s stealth and precision capabilities were crucial in executing a mission where each strike needed to count. No aircraft got within 100 miles of the target in the first wave, yet nearly the entirety of Iran's air-defense system was dismantled. This highlights the F-35’s stand-off strike capability, where weapons can be deployed from a safe distance without compromising the safety of the aircraft or pilots. Beyond its combat and strike capabilities, the F-35’s advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems were pivotal in degrading Iran’s air-defense networks. These EW systems allow the F-35 to disrupt enemy radar, communication, and targeting systems, effectively blinding or misleading adversary defenses. As Admiral Radakin noted, the strike took down 'nearly the entirety of Iran’s air-defense system,' likely facilitated by the F-35’s ability to disrupt and neutralize these defenses before they could respond effectively. Iran’s acquisition of S-300 systems from Russia posed a significant threat to any aircraft attempting to strike Iranian targets. However, Israel’s F-35s used their superior electronic warfare capabilities to target and degrade these systems, making it possible to carry out the mission with minimal risk to the aircraft. The success of this operation also speaks to the multi-role versatility of the F-35. While primarily an air-to-air and air-to-ground combat aircraft, the F-35 also serves as a platform for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). During the strike on Iran, Israeli F-35s likely performed a variety of roles, from gathering intelligence to ensuring that each target was hit with precision and efficiency. The aircraft's ability to switch between strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare roles is a key reason for its operational effectiveness in high-stakes missions like this. The F-35’s ability to carry out surgical strikes on critical infrastructure while maintaining air superiority and disrupting enemy defenses makes it the ideal platform for modern military operations, especially in hostile environments where the enemy possesses advanced air-defense capabilities. The recent Israeli operation against Iranian targets has once again demonstrated the unparalleled combat capabilities of the F-35. With its combination of stealth, precision strike systems, advanced munitions, and superior electronic warfare capabilities, the F-35 has redefined the standards for modern air combat. Israel’s use of this advanced fighter jet highlights its significant technological edge and ability to project power with minimal risk and maximum precision. As Israel continues to expand its fleet of F-35Is, the aircraft will undoubtedly play a central role in future operations, setting a new benchmark in modern military aviation. The F-35’s performance in this operation serves as a clear demonstration of how advanced technologies—stealth, precision, and electronic warfare—are transforming military air operations and ensuring that air forces can meet the complex challenges of the modern battlefield with unprecedented effectiveness.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-us-made-f-35-stealth-fighter-demonstrates-unmatched-combat-capabilities-in-israeli-strike-against-iran	2024-12-06T08:51:48-08:00	
Exclusive: Ukraine Intel Reveals Russia Can Produce 25 Medium-Range Ballistic Missiles Annually	On December 4, 2024, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine provided an important update regarding Russia's missile production capabilities, particularly focusing on the RS-26 Rubezh, the country’s intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). According to Ukrainian intelligence, Russia can now produce up to 25 units of RS-26 Rubezh each year, including its new Oreshnik variant. This new development highlights the growing production capacity of Russia's missile forces and their focus on strengthening their medium-range missile arsenals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Test fire at Kapustin Yar: Russia's RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik variants undergo critical testing at the Astrakhan region missile launch site, enhancing Russia's strategic missile capabilities. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The RS-26 Rubezh, at the heart of Russia's modern missile capabilities, represents a strategic shift in Moscow's approach to missile warfare. Its production plays a significant role in Russia’s efforts to counter NATO's missile defense systems. The Oreshnik, a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh, has been shrouded in controversy, particularly following its use in an attack on Ukraine's Dnipro River on November 21, 2024. The RS-26 Rubezh is a crucial missile for Russia’s defense strategy. Classified as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the RS-26 is designed to carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and has a range of approximately 3,500 to 4,000 km (2,175 to 2,485 miles). This puts it within the category of medium to long-range missile systems capable of striking targets across Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Russia has invested heavily in producing the RS-26 Rubezh and its variants. The missile is manufactured at high output and can produce up to 25 units per year, a significant increase from earlier periods. This production surge follows the technical experience gained from Russia's previous RS-24 Yars ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile) program, which has informed the development of the RS-26’s advanced features, including hypersonic speed and maneuverability designed to defeat modern missile defense systems. The controversy surrounding Russia’s missile capabilities deepened after an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on November 21, 2024. During the attack, Russian forces used what they claimed to be a 'new medium-range system' that President Vladimir Putin referred to as the Oreshnik. At the time, Ukrainian officials initially identified the missile used in the strike as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), but Putin contradicted this, announcing that the missile was a new addition to Russia’s missile arsenal, designed specifically for medium-range strikes. In contrast, American officials labeled the missile as 'experimental,' suggesting that while it may have been deployed operationally, the Oreshnik was still in an advanced testing phase. According to U.S. officials, the missile appears to be a non-nuclear, hypersonic ballistic missile, a designation that aligns with previous reports of its high-speed and maneuvering capabilities. These features make the missile extremely difficult to intercept, as it travels at speeds greater than Mach 5 (over six times the speed of sound) and can follow unpredictable flight paths to bypass missile defense systems. Despite these claims of a new missile type, the Oreshnik is widely regarded as a variant of the RS-26 Rubezh—with enhancements aimed at improving its hypersonic capabilities and range. The missile's inclusion in Russia’s operational arsenal is seen as part of a broader strategy to bolster its missile forces, specifically in response to NATO’s missile defense systems in Europe. Both the RS-26 Rubezh and its Oreshnik variant undergo testing at Russia’s key missile testing sites. These include Kapustin Yar, located in the Astrakhan region, which has long been a central hub for developing and testing Russia’s missile systems, including the RS-26 and its variants. Additionally, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the Arkhangelsk region plays a critical role in missile testing. Though better known for space launches, Plesetsk is integral to Russia’s missile development and operational readiness. The international community has responded with heightened concern over the deployment of the Oreshnik missile. The United States, in particular, has expressed its reservations, labeling the missile 'experimental' and underscoring the potential escalation of tensions. The missile’s hypersonic nature and non-nuclear profile make it a versatile tool for Russia’s military, capable of striking with precision while circumventing most conventional missile defense systems, including THAAD and Aegis. The attack on Dnipro has further fueled worries that Russia may be advancing its missile technology with a focus on bypassing traditional defense mechanisms. With its ability to target high-value military and infrastructure assets over a long distance, the RS-26 Oreshnik represents a serious threat in a region already facing significant instability. For NATO and the West, the growing production of intermediate-range ballistic missiles like the RS-26 Rubezh, and the operational readiness of the Oreshnik, highlight the urgent need to adapt and modernize missile defense capabilities to respond to Russia's evolving missile threats. Russia’s ability to ramp up production of the RS-26 Rubezh, including its Oreshnik variant, signals a major shift in the strategic landscape. With up to 25 units of the RS-26 Rubezh and Oreshnik expected to roll out annually, Russia is significantly enhancing its missile arsenal, increasing its ability to project power over long distances. As the Oreshnik variant enters the operational phase, the growing concern about its hypersonic and maneuverability features will continue to shape global security dynamics. The missile’s potential to bypass missile defense systems, along with its strategic and tactical flexibility, makes it a formidable asset in Russia’s military planning. For the West, this development calls for reevaluating defense strategies and missile deterrence capabilities as Russia’s missile forces continue to evolve rapidly. The geopolitical implications of this missile advancement will likely influence future arms control talks and shape the future trajectory of global missile defense systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-ukraine-intel-reveals-russia-can-produce-25-medium-range-ballistic-missiles-annually	2024-12-06T08:12:52-08:00

Japan Increases Defense Ties with Coastal Radars and Patrol Vessels Supplies Under OSA Program	On December 2, 2024, a Japanese government source revealed that Japan would supply specific defense equipment to the Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Djibouti under its Official Security Assistance (OSA) program. This program, launched in April 2023, aims to strengthen the defense capacities of nations that share Tokyo's strategic values. For the 2024 fiscal year ending in March, the government allocated a budget of 5 billion yen ($33 million) to support these four priority countries. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Mitsubishi J/FPS-3 Coastal Surveillance Radar (Picture source: Mitsubishi) In 2024, Japan decided to allocate a significant portion of this aid to the Philippines, which faces escalating Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. Tokyo plans to provide advanced maritime surveillance radar systems to Manila to enhance detection and control capabilities in this strategic area. These systems will complement the J/FPS-3 coastal surveillance radar developed by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, delivered in 2023, which significantly improved the security of the Philippines' territorial waters. Amid recurring confrontations between Philippine and Chinese vessels, these new radars aim to ensure better preparedness and a swift response to incursions. Mongolia, due to its strategic location between China and Russia, is expected to receive systems including Primary Surveillance Radars (PSR) produced by NEC Corporation, capable of detecting aircraft without transponders, and Secondary Surveillance Radars (SSR), which identify equipped aircraft and provide precise data on their altitude and trajectory. These systems will enable Mongolia to enhance its airspace monitoring capabilities and guard against potential intrusions. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Djibouti could receive Shikishima-class patrol vessels, built by Japan Marine United Corporation (JMU), or equivalent models designed to ensure maritime security and protect strategic trade routes. These vessels aim to counter illegal maritime activities in Indonesian waters and strengthen security in Djibouti's vital maritime corridor. Since its launch in April 2023, the OSA program reflects a strategic shift in Japan's international security policy. This proactive initiative aims to bolster the defense capacities of its partners in the face of growing threats, particularly China's military expansion. Through this targeted assistance, Tokyo reaffirms its commitment to promoting a free and stable Indo-Pacific while consolidating regional alliances in an increasingly tense geopolitical context. Japan's arms policy, long defined by a strict pacifist stance, is rooted in Article 9 of its 1947 Constitution adopted after World War II. This article prohibits Japan from using war as a means of resolving international conflicts and restricts its military capabilities to strictly territorial defense. For decades, this approach translated into stringent restrictions on arms exports and an exclusively defensive role for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF). However, the evolving regional security environment has gradually pushed Tokyo to reassess this policy. Faced with China's growing military power, North Korea's nuclear threats, and the rising strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, several key changes have marked this transition. In 1967, the 'Three Principles on Arms Exports' established a strict ban on selling arms to communist countries, nations under UN embargo, or those involved in armed conflicts. These restrictions began to ease in 2014 when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe adopted the 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment,' allowing limited exports to countries sharing Japan's democratic values. A major turning point occurred in 2015 with the adoption of the collective security law, allowing the SDF to intervene to defend allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked. This change broadened the strictly defensive framework of Japan's military action. In 2023, Tokyo launched the OSA program, designed to provide non-lethal defense equipment to allied countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, or Mongolia. This program aims to strengthen the defense capacities of partner nations while stabilizing the region amid China's military expansion. In parallel, Japan significantly increased its military budget, reaching 2% of its GDP in 2024, in line with commitments outlined in its 2022 updated national defense strategy. This record budget marks a paradigm shift for a country that traditionally capped its military spending at around 1% of its GDP. These transformations reflect Japan's intention to play a more active role in regional and international security while asserting its commitment to ensuring a free and stable Indo-Pacific. This strategic shift marks a break from its historical pacifist stance while remaining aligned with contemporary geopolitical challenges. Outside the OSA framework, Japan has also supplied defense equipment to several countries through bilateral cooperation or specific loans. In 2016, the Philippines received TC-90 training aircraft, initially leased and later transferred permanently in 2018, to bolster maritime surveillance in the contested waters of the South China Sea. In 2020, Japan delivered patrol vessels to Vietnam via a low-interest loan, followed by a 2021 agreement to expand the export of maritime surveillance systems. In 2022, Japan concluded an agreement with Thailand for technology transfers in the defense sector, though specific systems have not been disclosed. Regarding Ukraine, while Japan has not supplied lethal military equipment, it delivered civilian drones, bulletproof vests, and other non-lethal support equipment in 2022 and 2023, underscoring its commitment to supporting Kyiv within the constraints of Japan's constitutional restrictions. These initiatives demonstrate Tokyo's intent to contribute to international security while adapting to the specific needs of its strategic partners.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/japan-increases-defense-ties-with-coastal-radars-and-patrol-vessels-supplies-under-osa-program	2024-12-06T05:44:38-08:00	
First capture of intact Podlet-K1 radar by Syrian rebels could threaten Russia's air defense effectiveness	As reported by Clash Report on December 4, 2024, Syrian rebels have achieved the first recorded capture of an intact Russian 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, taken during an offensive near Hama at the headquarters of the Assad regime's 25th Special Forces Division. The system, valued at approximately $5 million and integral to the S-300PMU-2 and S-400 air defense networks, could pose a significant threat to Russian air defense effectiveness if its technology is analyzed by adversaries.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. (Picture source: Clash Report) Similar systems lost in Ukraine, such as those destroyed in Kherson and Crimea, were not seized intact. While operational use by the rebels is unlikely due to technical complexity, the most effective way to exploit its capabilities would be through detailed analysis, which could reveal vulnerabilities in Russian air defense systems, an eventuality which raises concerns among Russian analysts about its potential transfer to entities like NATO or Ukraine. Examining its hardware and software might provide insights into Russian radar technology, including detection capabilities, signal processing methods, and electronic counter-countermeasure strategies. This information could advance the development of countermeasures, refine electronic warfare tactics, and highlight weaknesses in Russian air defense systems. The Podlet-K1's ability to detect low-altitude cruise missiles, such as the Storm Shadow and R-360 Neptune, underscores its strategic importance. The capture occurred during a broader offensive by opposition forces in Hama province, following their takeover of Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city. This offensive, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), marked the first opposition control of Aleppo since 2016. After capturing several military installations, including the 87th Brigade base and a tank school, HTS forces advanced toward Hama. Although they temporarily breached the city's defenses, counterattacks by pro-Assad forces, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias, forced the rebels to retreat. The offensive resulted in significant equipment losses for both sides. Rebels reportedly seized 31 Russian-made tanks, including T-72 and T-90 models, 20 BMP armored personnel carriers, and 12 122mm artillery pieces. Additionally, they captured a Pantsir-S1, a Strela-10, and an S-125 air defense system. These acquisitions have enabled expanded drone and missile attacks on regime targets. However, intense fighting led to the destruction of other equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery, though specific figures remain unverified. Among the abandoned systems was a ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures, left by the regime’s 4th Armored Division on the Khanasir-Ithrya road. This system, one of two upgraded in the Adra workshop, was filmed after its abandonment. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, rebels captured eight L-39 Albatros light training and attack jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The MiG-23, powered by a Tumansky R-29B turbojet engine, can reach speeds of up to 2,500 km/h and is designed for interception and air-to-ground missions. While these aircraft represent strategic assets, their operational potential is constrained by maintenance needs, a lack of skilled pilots, and vulnerability to airstrikes. Ground tests were attempted, but technical issues and attacks on captured bases hindered further use. The Podlet-K1 system can detect aerial targets at ranges of 10 to 300 kilometers and altitudes up to 10 kilometers, tracking up to 200 targets simultaneously. Its modular design comprises three components mounted on a KamAZ-6350 8x8 chassis: an antenna post, a mobile command post, and a power generator. It employs a phased-array S-band radar and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) technology, enabling operations against low-flying and high-speed targets. The system's deployment and pack-up can be completed within approximately 20 minutes. The capture of the Podlet-K1 radar system has drawn comparisons to a 2020 operation in Libya, where U.S. forces, in cooperation with Türkiye, extracted a Russian Pantsir-S1 system. Speculation suggests the radar could be transferred to Türkiye, given its use of Russian S-400 systems. Alternatively, Russian airstrikes might target the radar to prevent its analysis, similar to actions taken in Ukraine following the loss of a Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B UAV. Despite logistical challenges, the radar’s intact condition could facilitate technical study and aid in developing countermeasures against similar systems.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/first-capture-of-intact-podlet-k1-radar-by-syrian-rebels-could-threaten-russias-air-defense-effectiveness	2024-12-06T05:08:14-08:00

Breaking News: US Successfully Tests MACH-TB Hypersonic Flight to Accelerate Weapons Development	On December 5, 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announced the successful execution of a key flight test for the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed (MACH-TB), which took place in November 2024. The test, conducted by the Department of Defense’s Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, marks a significant milestone in the U.S. pursuit of hypersonic technologies. The MACH-TB is designed to advance the testing and development of hypersonic systems, providing crucial insights into the performance of cutting-edge weapons that could dramatically enhance U.S. military capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Testing the future of warfare: The MACH-TB hypersonic flight test accelerates the development of advanced weapons capabilities for the U.S. military. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The MACH-TB is a next-generation hypersonic flight test vehicle developed to accelerate the testing process for hypersonic systems across multiple branches of the U.S. military and other federal agencies. Its primary purpose is to provide a reliable, commercially launched platform capable of simulating and testing hypersonic conditions in real-world flight scenarios. By employing commercial launch services, the DoD aims to reduce the costs and time associated with testing hypersonic components while simultaneously increasing the testing frequency. Mr. George Rumford, Director of the TRMC, emphasized the value of this approach: 'Leveraging commercial launch services allows our Nation to test components early and frequently, accelerating hypersonic development affordably.' This approach not only helps expedite testing but also enables rapid feedback on the performance of hypersonic technologies, making it a critical enabler for developing advanced capabilities for U.S. forces. Hypersonic weapons are defined as those that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. These weapons are particularly notable because of their ability to maneuver while traveling at extreme speeds, making them highly difficult to track or intercept with current missile defense systems. This combination of speed and maneuverability creates significant strategic advantages for any military force capable of deploying them. The importance of hypersonic weapons in modern warfare is undeniable, as they offer a range of benefits. First, their speed and precision enable hypersonic weapons to strike targets at extreme distances in a fraction of the time compared to conventional missiles, potentially rendering existing defense systems obsolete. Second, unlike ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic weapons are capable of maneuvering in flight, further complicating interception efforts. Finally, their ability to penetrate heavily defended airspace provides a significant deterrent and strategic advantage during combat situations. The development of hypersonic technologies is, therefore, seen as a crucial part of the evolving global arms race, as nations seek to gain a technological edge on the battlefield. While the United States has made significant strides in hypersonic weapons development, it is far from alone in pursuing this advanced technology. China and Russia have emerged as key competitors, each heavily investing in hypersonic systems to bolster their own military capabilities. China has made rapid progress in developing hypersonic glide vehicles, such as the DF-17, which is capable of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads. The Chinese military has also been investing in advanced launch platforms and testing mechanisms, with a focus on increasing the speed and range of their hypersonic systems. Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has aggressively pursued hypersonic weapons as part of its military modernization program. The country has already deployed hypersonic missiles like the Avangard, which is reportedly capable of reaching speeds up to Mach 27. Additionally, Russia has developed the Zircon missile, a sea-launched hypersonic weapon intended to target both naval and land-based targets at extreme speeds. Both China and Russia have demonstrated their capabilities through successful test flights, creating a sense of urgency in the U.S. military to advance its own hypersonic development programs. In addition to China and Russia, countries such as India, France, and Australia are also pursuing hypersonic technologies, each working to integrate these systems into their defense strategies. For the U.S. military and its allies, hypersonic weapons represent a paradigm shift in the way warfare could be conducted. The strategic advantages they offer are clear. Hypersonic weapons allow for near-instantaneous strikes, significantly shortening the response time to emerging threats and providing a new tool for rapid deployment of military force. They also can penetrate traditional missile defense systems. Systems like the U.S.-developed Aegis or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) are optimized for intercepting slower ballistic missiles, but hypersonic weapons, due to their high speed and unpredictable flight paths, present a much more difficult challenge for these systems to defend against. Additionally, hypersonic systems can be adapted to various platforms, from ground-based launchers to submarines and aircraft, allowing military forces to deploy these weapons in a variety of operational scenarios. Given their speed and range, hypersonic weapons could be used in a variety of theaters, from deterring regional conflicts to countering more sophisticated threats posed by adversaries with advanced air-defense systems. Therefore, the U.S. military's focus on hypersonics is not just about keeping pace with China and Russia but also about ensuring that it retains a technological edge that will be decisive in future conflicts. The MACH-TB test represents one critical step in this ongoing race to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons, which will be a core element of the U.S. military’s arsenal in the years to come. The success of the MACH-TB flight test is a major achievement in the U.S. Department of Defense's quest to accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies. By leveraging commercial launch services, the DoD is setting the stage for more frequent and cost-effective testing, ultimately leading to faster deployment of these advanced weapons. With global competitors like China and Russia intensifying their own hypersonic development programs, the need for the U.S. to lead in this domain has never been more pressing. Hypersonic weapons are poised to revolutionize military strategies worldwide, and initiatives like MACH-TB are essential for ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-us-successfully-tests-mach-tb-hypersonic-flight-to-accelerate-weapons-development	2024-12-06T01:29:30-08:00

This recent launch underscores the Bastion-P’s role in enhancing Russia’s anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) strategy. The system integrates advanced radar and target acquisition technologies to detect, track, and engage enemy vessels effectively, solidifying its position as a cornerstone of Russia’s maritime defense network. The P-800 Onyx missile's supersonic speed and sophisticated guidance systems enable it to evade modern air defense systems, making it a significant deterrent against adversarial forces. For NATO and U.S. naval forces, systems like the Bastion-P, armed with the P-800 Onyx missile, present significant challenges. The high speed and low radar cross-section of the Onyx make it difficult for conventional shipborne air defense systems, such as the U.S. Navy’s Aegis Combat System or NATO’s Sea Ceptor, to intercept effectively. The missile’s ability to perform complex maneuvers in its terminal phase further reduces the likelihood of successful interception. Additionally, the system's long-range allows it to engage targets well beyond the immediate coastal area, threatening aircraft carriers, destroyers, amphibious assault ships, and logistics vessels critical to NATO’s power projection capabilities. In a broader strategic context, the Bastion-P system enhances Russia’s ability to enforce maritime exclusion zones, a concept central to its A2/AD doctrine. Such zones restrict the operational freedom of NATO and U.S. naval forces, complicating their ability to provide support in contested areas like the Eastern Mediterranean, the Black Sea, or the Arctic. This threat is particularly acute for carrier strike groups, which rely on secure operational areas to launch air missions. The presence of advanced coastal missile systems forces NATO forces to adopt costly and complex countermeasures, such as deploying electronic warfare systems, long-range standoff weapons, or preemptive strikes to neutralize threats. The deployment of the Bastion-P system in the Eastern Mediterranean aligns with Russia’s regional strategic goals. Given the area’s increased naval activity, including operations by NATO forces, this exercise demonstrates Russia’s ability to secure critical maritime zones and maintain a credible defensive posture. By emphasizing its advanced coastal defense systems, Russia reinforces its capability to protect vital sea lanes and safeguard national interests. This successful demonstration highlights the operational readiness of Russian forces and the importance of modern coastal defense systems in contemporary military strategies. As regional tensions and maritime competition continue, the Bastion-P system, armed with the formidable P-800 Onyx missile, remains a vital asset in Russia’s defense arsenal, posing a credible and evolving challenge to NATO and U.S. naval operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/focus-russian-navy-demonstrates-p-800-onyx-supersonic-cruise-missile-power-during-mediterranean-drills	2024-12-05T06:22:33-08:00

Italian Navy to commission Trieste helicopter carrier as new flagship for amphibious task group	As reported by Mer et Marine on December 5, 2024, the Italian Navy is set to commission its new Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) Trieste, the largest combat vessel constructed in Italy since World War II. The commissioning ceremony will take place on Saturday, December 7, 2024, in the port of Livorno, with the attendance of Italian President Sergio Mattarella. The Trieste will replace the aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi, decommissioned on October 1, 2024, and will become the flagship of the Italian Navy's amphibious task group.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link At 245 meters in length and 33,000 tons displacement, the Trieste, a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) built by Fincantieri, will be the largest Italian naval vessel since World War II. (Picture source: Twitter/Nicholas Drummond) The development of the Italian Navy's Trieste landing helicopter dock (LHD) began under the 2014–2015 naval program, with Fincantieri awarded the construction contract in July 2015. Steel cutting commenced in July 2017, followed by the keel laying at Castellammare di Stabia in February 2018. The hull was launched in May 2019 and subsequently outfitted at Fincantieri’s Muggiano shipyard, with maintenance conducted at the Palermo facility due to space constraints. Initial sea trials were conducted in August 2021, with additional dockyard work at Trieste in late 2023. The vessel’s construction involved three shipyards and over 1,000 personnel during the assembly and outfitting phases. Delivery, initially expected by 2022, was delayed to December 2024. Once commissioned, Trieste will replace the Giuseppe Garibaldi and serve as part of Italy's amphibious task group, supporting multiple operational roles. At 245 meters in length and 33,000 tons displacement, the Trieste, a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) built by Fincantieri, will be the largest Italian naval vessel since World War II. The ship is equipped with a CODLOG propulsion system, combining two Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines, two MAN diesel engines, and two electric motors. This system allows a maximum speed of 25 knots and a range of 7,000 nautical miles at 16 knots. Its dual-island design separates navigation and flight operations management. The ship is configured to support F-35B aircraft and various helicopters, with a 230-meter-long flight deck featuring nine landing spots and two elevators with a 42-ton capacity each.

Syrian Rebels capture Syrian Army's most modern T-90A tanks in major offensive	As reported by Tendar on December 4, 2024, Syrian opposition forces have captured several T-90 and T-90A tanks, among the most modern combat vehicles supplied by Russia to the Syrian Army. These tanks, equipped with sophisticated firepower, protection systems, and mobility features, could significantly enhance the rebels’ combat capabilities. Their acquisition occurs amid an escalating conflict, where the Syrian Army is increasingly abandoning intact, modern Russian-supplied equipment during retreats, particularly following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Of the 30 T-90 and T-90A main battle tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been abandoned by the Syrian Army and captured by opposition forces. (Picture source: Twitter/Tendar and T-90K) During a recent offensive in Syria, opposition forces, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), captured significant quantities of Russian military equipment left behind by retreating Syrian government forces. To date, this included between six and eight T-90 and T-90A tanks, a Russian-made 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, a Buk-M2 air defense system, and one of two ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' vehicles equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system was also seized. Additionally, older systems such as T-72M and T-55 tanks, BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher, two BREM recovery vehicles (BREM-1 or BREM-2), and a 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer were captured. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, opposition forces seized eight L-39 Albatros light jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The range of equipment captured highlights the extent of material losses suffered by the Syrian Army. Among the captured equipment, the T-90 and T-90A tanks are particularly significant. Of the 30 T-90 tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been captured during this new offensive. Earlier incidents also reveal a consistent pattern of equipment loss. In 2016, a T-90A was captured by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham during clashes near Aleppo, marking the first documented instance of this tank falling into opposition hands. That unit has since been observed in various operations. Another T-90 was captured in 2020 during a government retreat. These incidents underscore vulnerabilities in securing advanced equipment during Syrian Army withdrawals. The latest captures occurred amid an offensive following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. This marked the first time opposition forces had taken control of Aleppo since 2016. The offensive, led by HTS, progressed into Hama province after capturing key installations such as the 87th Brigade base and a tank school. Despite breaching Hama’s defenses, opposition forces were eventually pushed back by counterattacks from Syrian government troops, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias. The captured T-90A tank provides Syrian rebels with notable combat capabilities due to its modern design and equipment. It is armed with a 125mm 2A46M-5 smoothbore gun, capable of engaging targets at distances up to 5 kilometers with precision, including while the tank is in motion. The tank supports the use of guided missiles and various ammunition types, including armor-piercing and high-explosive shells. Its fire control system, equipped with ESSA TPV thermal imaging and night vision devices, enhances target detection and engagement in low-visibility conditions, offering operational utility in nighttime or urban environments. The T-90A's armor includes Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, which is designed to reduce the effectiveness of anti-tank projectiles and missiles. The Shtora-1 active protection system is integrated to counter guided missile threats. Its 1,000-horsepower V-92S2 diesel engine supports mobility and maneuverability across diverse terrains. The compact design facilitates repositioning during combat. These features collectively enhance the tank's functional value for the rebels in scenarios where older or less capable armor is commonly encountered. The Syrian Army continues to face challenges in safeguarding its equipment during strategic retreats. The rapid advance of HTS and allied forces, combined with logistical constraints, has resulted in the abandonment of high-value assets. The Syrian military’s reliance on Russian-supplied systems, which are not fully integrated into its operational framework, further complicates its ability to manage withdrawals. Additionally, Russia’s focus on its own military commitments, including operations in Ukraine, has limited its capacity to provide immediate support to Syrian forces. These factors have contributed to repeated equipment losses, significantly impacting the Syrian Army’s overall operational capability. On the other hand, Syrian opposition forces have shown mixed capacities in effectively using captured tanks, including advanced models like the T-90A, against the Syrian Army. These capabilities are influenced by various factors, such as technical expertise, availability of spare parts, and tactical integration. Groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) have historically captured tanks during engagements, including T-55, T-72, and more advanced T-90A models. The T-90A, equipped with advanced thermal imaging, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, and a powerful 125mm smoothbore gun, poses significant challenges for opposition forces to maintain and operate due to its sophisticated systems. Nevertheless, there have been instances where such tanks were employed effectively, including a confirmed case in 2017 where HTS militants used a captured T-90A against government forces. Recent offensives, particularly in northwestern Syria, have also resulted in the capture of additional tanks abandoned by retreating Syrian Army units near Aleppo and Idlib. However, opposition forces often struggle with sustaining these platforms due to limited access to skilled operators, logistical challenges, and an inability to repair complex damage. The integration of captured equipment is further hampered by fragmentation among opposition groups, varying levels of military training, and reliance on external support for anti-armor operations. Despite these limitations, the use of captured tanks provides a significant psychological and tactical boost, enabling rebels to counter Syrian Army advances when deployed strategically.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/syrian-opposition-captures-syrian-armys-most-modern-t-90a-tanks-in-major-offensive	2024-12-05T02:22:38-08:00

While less publicized than the Kinzhal, the GZUR is designed for tactical roles and can be deployed from multi-role fighter jets, expanding the operational flexibility of Russia’s hypersonic arsenal. Together, these two systems—the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and the GZUR—form the backbone of Russia’s air-launched hypersonic capabilities, ensuring both strategic and tactical coverage in modern warfare. Hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal and GZUR are revolutionizing modern warfare by challenging existing defense systems and reshaping strategic paradigms. The extreme speeds of hypersonic weapons drastically reduce the reaction time available to adversaries, making them difficult to intercept with conventional missile defense systems. Their ability to maneuver mid-flight further complicates defensive measures, effectively rendering many current systems obsolete. The proliferation of hypersonic weapons has also intensified the global arms race. As Russia advances its capabilities, other nations, including the United States and China, are accelerating the development of their own hypersonic systems. This technological race not only raises the stakes in global power competition but also introduces new risks, including the potential for miscalculation or unintended escalation in conflict zones. The deployment of hypersonic missiles in active theaters, such as the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, also poses emerging threats. The dual-use capability of hypersonic weapons, which can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, adds ambiguity to their deployment. This uncertainty increases the risk of misinterpretation, particularly in high-stakes confrontations, potentially triggering disproportionate responses. Furthermore, the spread of hypersonic technology raises concerns about its potential acquisition by non-state actors, amplifying the threat to global security. Russia’s demonstration of its hypersonic capabilities in the Mediterranean is a clear message to both regional and global adversaries. By integrating advanced weapon systems like the Kinzhal and GZUR into its strategic arsenal and pairing them with high-performance aircraft like the MiG-31I, Moscow is not only solidifying its position as a leader in hypersonic technology but also reshaping the future of warfare. As these weapons continue to evolve, their role in military strategy is poised to grow, heralding a new era where speed, precision, and unpredictability define the battlefield.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-russian-mig-31i-fighter-jet-with-hypersonic-missile-in-military-exercise-demonstrating-new-threats	2024-12-05T01:26:23-08:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) The Long Range Maneuvering Projectile (LRMP) is designed to achieve a range exceeding 120 kilometers, approximately four times greater than conventional 155mm artillery rounds. This extended range is achieved through a Reuleaux triangle shape and foldable wings that enable the projectile to glide without auxiliary propulsion. A Reuleaux triangle is a curved triangle with constant width, formed from the intersection of three circular disks, each having its center on the boundary of the other two. This unique shape provides aerodynamic stability and is simpler than a circle to manufacture. Upon launch, the projectile ascends to an altitude of 12 to 14 kilometers, where its wings deploy for the glide phase toward the target. This system is intended for use in GPS-denied environments and enables the engagement of both static and moving targets. The guidance system for the LRMP incorporates technologies derived from General Atomics’ previous work in hypersonics, railguns, and unmanned systems. It includes onboard cameras and machine learning algorithms, which allow the projectile to visually track and adjust its trajectory in real time. Elements of the guidance system are based on technologies from the MQ-9 Reaper drone and the Vintage Racer program, contributing to its ability to function across multiple operational scenarios. Showcased at AUSA 2024, the LRMP is compatible with existing artillery systems, including legacy launchers, autoloaders, and handling equipment. Its modular payload supports different mission types, such as kinetic strikes and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations. A naval version for 127mm guns is under development, with a reduced range of 75 kilometers to address maritime applications. Initial testing has focused on validating the LRMP’s survivability, aerodynamics, and performance characteristics. Glide tests are scheduled at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, with additional tests planned during the contract period to confirm its capabilities. A full-scale model of the LRMP was exhibited at the AUSA 2024 event, showcasing its operational features. The project has been under development by General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS) for the past three years, funded internally by the company. Anticipating demand for extended-range precision artillery, GA-EMS is preparing for low-rate production by 2025. The company has also outlined plans for high-volume manufacturing, targeting production rates of up to 100,000 rounds per month. The Long Range Maneuvering Projectile (LRMP) incorporates a discarding sabot, which protects its internal components and wings during launch. Its size allows for a kinetic payload equivalent to a 120mm shell. The payload itself is being developed by an external partner, and the modular design accommodates ISR capabilities. These specifications align with the goals of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps to enhance artillery technologies. Development of similar long-range maneuvering artillery projectiles is underway across the defense sector. BAE Systems is working on the XM1155-SC, a munition under the U.S. Army’s Extended Range Artillery Projectile program, which aims to double the range of current 155mm rounds to engage targets at distances exceeding 109 kilometers. Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense and BAE Systems Bofors have developed the M982 Excalibur, a GPS-guided round capable of achieving ranges up to 40 kilometers with a circular error probable of 4 meters. Other efforts include Boeing and Norway’s Nammo, which have collaborated on a ramjet-powered 155mm projectile tested with the Army’s Extended Range Cannon Artillery prototype. In India, Munitions India Limited and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras are working on a ramjet-propelled artillery shell with ranges beyond 60 kilometers, compatible with systems like the Haubits FH77 and K9 Vajra-T. Long-range maneuvering projectiles aim to enhance artillery capabilities by extending engagement distances and enabling precision targeting. These developments reflect ongoing efforts to integrate advanced systems into existing military arsenals and adapt artillery platforms to modern operational demands.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-to-extend-artillery-range-with-new-lrmp-155mm-precision-guided-munitions-for-enhanced-target-accuracy	2024-12-04T02:35:25-08:00

Together, these systems will give Ukraine a powerful toolkit to fortify its defenses and slow the advance of Russian forces.1. M692/M731 ADAM: 155mm Area Denial Munition The M692/M731 ADAM is a 155mm artillery shell designed to deploy anti-personnel mines quickly across a broad area. This system, part of the U.S. Army's 'Family of Scatterable Mines' (FASCAM), was developed during the 1980s to enhance battlefield control by creating instant minefields. Each artillery round fired from a Howitzer delivers 36 mines, which are equipped with self-destruct features to minimize long-term risks to civilians. These mines either deactivate or self-destruct after a pre-determined period—typically 4 to 48 hours—ensuring that they do not pose a persistent threat once hostilities have subsided. Tripwires activate the mines in the ADAM system and feature a spherical warhead designed to create deadly shrapnel patterns. Upon activation, the warhead is launched to a height of 1 to 2 meters and detonates, releasing approximately 600 fragments that can incapacitate or kill enemy personnel within a wide radius. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance, addressing ongoing humanitarian concerns related to land mines.

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) 2. M131 MOPMS: Modular Pack Mine System The M131 Modular Pack Mine System (MOPMS) is a portable and flexible mine-laying system designed for rapid deployment by infantry or engineer units. It is primarily used for creating both anti-personnel and anti-vehicle minefields in various tactical scenarios. The system consists of modular packs, each containing a set of mines and components necessary for deployment. These packs are lightweight, typically weighing between 13 to 18 kg (30 to 40 pounds), allowing soldiers to carry and place them in the desired locations easily. MOPMS can deploy multiple types of mines, including M14 anti-personnel mines and M16 anti-tank mines. The mines can be configured to detonate either upon impact or after a set delay, providing tactical flexibility. The impact-triggered mines are designed to activate when a vehicle or personnel come into contact with them, while the timed mines can be set to explode after a specified delay, allowing troops to control the exact timing of the detonation. This feature enables military forces to adapt the minefield to the specific needs of the battlefield, such as blocking enemy movement, securing routes, or defending key positions. One of the key features of the MOPMS is that the mines it deploys are self-neutralizing. This means they either self-destruct or deactivate after a set period, which reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance harming civilians or friendly forces after the conflict. This self-destruct feature is an essential part of the system, addressing humanitarian concerns related to landmines in post-conflict zones. The system’s modular design also allows for flexibility in how it is deployed. Infantry units can manually place the mine packs in various configurations depending on the operational needs of the moment. Whether laying a minefield in dense forests, urban environments, or along critical choke points like roads or bridges, the MOPMS offers versatility in minefield creation. Furthermore, the system is compatible with military vehicles, enabling quicker deployment during larger operations. A U.S. Army vehicle-mounted M136 Volcano mine dispenser rapidly deploys a wide-area minefield, creating an effective barrier to block enemy movement. The system ejects mine canisters containing anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, dispersing them across a large area to deny access to critical routes and infrastructure. (Picture source U.S. DoD) 3. M136 Volcano: Vehicle-Mounted Mine Dispenser The M136 Volcano is a highly effective, vehicle-mounted mine-laying system designed to rapidly deploy anti-personnel and anti-tank mines across large areas. It is commonly mounted on various military vehicles, such as armored personnel carriers, engineering vehicles, and trucks, providing flexibility in deployment across different operational environments. The Volcano system uses M87 mine canisters, which hold up to six mines each. Depending on the configuration of the vehicle, the system can carry up to 24 canisters, allowing it to deploy a significant number of mines in a very short time. Once activated, the Volcano system rapidly disperses the mines in a predetermined pattern over a wide area, usually between 30 to 60 meters from the vehicle. This wide dispersion helps create a dense minefield that can block or disrupt enemy movement. The mines deployed by the Volcano include M14 anti-personnel mines and M15 anti-tank mines, both of which are designed to deny access to key areas, such as roads, fields, and critical infrastructure like bridges or supply routes. A critical feature of the Volcano system is its ability to set self-destruct or self-neutralizing functions for the mines. Each mine is equipped with a timer, ensuring that it either self-deactivates or self-destructs after a certain period—typically ranging from a few hours to several days—minimizing the risk of unexploded ordnance. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces long-term hazards to civilians or friendly forces once the immediate military need has passed. The system can be deployed from both ground and air platforms. While most commonly mounted on vehicles, it can also be delivered via helicopters, giving military commanders the flexibility to deploy minefields in a variety of terrains and scenarios. The Volcano can lay a minefield in just a few minutes, making it a highly efficient tool for creating instant area denial during combat operations. Tactically, the Volcano system is particularly valuable for halting enemy advances, especially in high-traffic areas like roads or chokepoints. The dense minefields it creates can slow down or halt both enemy infantry and armored vehicles, allowing friendly forces to secure key positions or gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, its rapid deployment and large mine-laying capacity make it a force multiplier for armored or mechanized units operating in concert with engineers. The provision of these mine-laying systems provides Ukraine with a broad range of options to disrupt and delay Russian forces. The ability to deploy mines remotely—either via artillery, vehicle, or infantry—gives Ukrainian forces flexibility in controlling and denying key terrain. These mine systems will be especially valuable in slowing Russian advances, protecting key infrastructure such as bridges and supply routes, and securing defensive positions. The U.S. has also ensured that these systems are 'non-persistent,' meaning that the mines will self-neutralize or self-destruct after a short time, reducing the risks to civilians after the mines' operational use. For Ukrainian commanders, the new systems significantly enhance their battlefield capabilities. The ADAM system provides rapid mine deployment over a large area, while the MOPMS and Volcano systems allow for more tactical, localized minefields. Together, these tools will help Ukraine to delay, disrupt, and inflict casualties on Russian forces, providing a force-multiplying effect on the battlefield. The addition of the ADAM, MOPMS, and Volcano mine-laying systems to Ukraine’s arsenal represents a strategic enhancement to its defensive capabilities. By providing both rapid, artillery-based and manual mine-laying solutions, the United States is enabling Ukraine to create powerful, flexible minefields that will impede enemy movements and protect vital positions. With these systems, Ukraine gains an important advantage in the ongoing conflict, ensuring that it can better control its territory and slow the advance of Russian forces while minimizing long-term humanitarian risks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-what-are-the-three-us-land-mine-systems-adam-mopms-and-volcano-for-ukraine	2024-12-03T08:57:56-08:00	
Focus: What is Lockheed Martin’s Secret X-59 Experimental Supersonic Aircraft?	This article explains the Lockheed Martin X-59, an experimental supersonic aircraft developed with NASA to address the disruptive sonic boom. Designed to make commercial supersonic travel over land possible, the X-59’s innovative technologies could also revolutionize military aviation, offering advanced stealth and high-speed capabilities. We'll examine the aircraft’s aerodynamic design, challenges, and potential to transform civilian and military aviation.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On January 12, 2024, NASA and Lockheed Martin publicly unveiled the X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft at a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The key to the X-59’s success lies in its unique aerodynamic design. Built by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works® division, the X-59 features an elongated fuselage and a specially designed long, pointed nose, which are critical to reducing the shockwaves that produce the sonic boom. These shockwaves are often heard as a loud, disruptive boom when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, especially near the ground. The X-59, however, aims to reshape those shockwaves into a softer, less noticeable 'thump', making the noise barely perceptible to the human ear. At the core of the X-59’s quiet supersonic flight technology is its ability to minimize the intensity of shockwaves that occur during the aircraft's supersonic passage. The aircraft achieves this through its unique design that ensures smooth airflow and minimizes disruptions that create noise. Its long, slender fuselage and forward-swept wings ensure that the aircraft flies efficiently at high speeds while reducing the loudness of any sonic disturbances. This quieter supersonic flight could open the door to a new era of high-speed air travel, making it possible for travelers to fly from New York to London in about three hours, halving the time of current commercial flights. On January 12, 2024, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works® marked a significant milestone in the X-59 program with a rollout ceremony held in Palmdale, California. This event celebrated not only the completion of the aircraft but also the culmination of years of research, development, and collaboration between Lockheed Martin and NASA. During the ceremony, John Clark, Vice President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works®, expressed his excitement about the project, stating, 'We’re thrilled to take on this challenge alongside NASA, whose quiet supersonic technology mission will have lasting, transformational impacts for people around the world. This project is just one example of the broader ingenuity of our industry as we continually strive to push the envelope of what’s possible.' The X-59 is a unique technology demonstrator aircraft, designed to generate a quieter, less disruptive sonic boom that would make supersonic travel over land feasible once again. The data collected from X-59 flight tests will be pivotal in shaping new aviation regulations for supersonic noise, which have traditionally been a barrier to commercial supersonic flight over populated areas. This data is expected to influence FAA and international regulators, potentially leading to the lifting of the ban on commercial supersonic flights over land, a restriction that has been in place since the retirement of the Concorde in 2003. While the primary focus of the X-59 is on commercial supersonic travel, its cutting-edge technology and aerodynamic innovations could have significant future applications in both the military and combat aviation sectors. The aircraft’s quiet supersonic flight capabilities may serve as a foundation for developing stealthier high-speed military aircraft. The X-59's low-noise supersonic flight is achieved by minimizing the shockwaves that lead to sonic booms, an approach that could be adapted to enhance the stealth capabilities of future military aircraft. A quieter supersonic jet would be harder to detect by enemy sensors, especially in high-speed combat scenarios where detection and evasion are critical. The ability to fly at supersonic speeds with reduced acoustic signatures would provide military aircraft with a distinct advantage, particularly in strike missions or reconnaissance over adversary territory. Moreover, the X-59's aerodynamic design, including its advanced wing and fuselage configuration, could significantly influence the development of next-generation fighter jets and bomber aircraft, where speed, agility, and stealth are paramount. The X-59's design's maneuverability and high-speed performance could provide valuable insights into optimizing future military aircraft for rapid, high-speed missions. The X-59’s advanced flight control systems, which ensure stability during high-speed flight, may also offer enhancements for future unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), contributing to more precise and efficient drone strikes or surveillance operations in hostile environments. Despite its remarkable promise, the X-59 faces the challenge of establishing new global aviation regulations allowing supersonic flight to resume over land. The current regulatory framework, established in the 1970s and reinforced by the Concorde’s retirement, bans commercial supersonic flights over land due to the disruptive impact of sonic booms. By generating a quieter, less intrusive sonic thump, the X-59 could prove that commercial supersonic flight is no longer an environmental burden, potentially leading to new international standards for acceptable supersonic noise levels. If successful, the X-59 could help set the foundation for the development of commercial supersonic airliners capable of providing faster-than-sound travel without disturbing people on the ground. It would also be a critical step in revolutionizing air travel by enabling airlines to offer shorter flight times, drastically reducing travel times between distant cities. The X-59 is a groundbreaking initiative in the field of supersonic aviation, and its successful development could bring about profound changes in the aviation industry. By overcoming the sonic boom challenge, Lockheed Martin and NASA are opening up new possibilities for supersonic air travel — ones that are faster, quieter, and more efficient than ever before. Beyond its civilian applications, the X-59’s innovative technologies could have major implications for military aviation, offering stealth and high-speed capabilities that could redefine modern combat strategies. As the X-59 moves into its flight test phase, it stands as a symbol of the future — a future where supersonic flight is not only a reality but one that is quiet, efficient, and transformational for both commercial and military aviation alike. With the world eagerly awaiting the X-59's test flights, this aircraft is setting the stage for the next generation of high-speed air travel and combat aviation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-is-lockheed-martins-secret-x-59-experimental-supersonic-aircraft	2024-12-03T08:29:45-08:00	
Analysis: Next-Generation Russian Shtorm Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier Set to Challenge US Nimitz Class	Russia’s 'Shtorm' next-generation nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, currently under development by the Krylovsky State Research Center, is shaping up to be a formidable competitor to the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz-class carriers, which have long been a cornerstone of Western naval power. The 'Shtorm' is set to be a nuclear-powered, multi-purpose warship capable of carrying a large air group, with several advanced features designed to enhance Russia’s ability to project power across distant regions, particularly in the Arctic. Although specific technical specifications are still emerging, the 'Shtorm' is expected to rival the Nimitz-class in terms of size, capabilities, and versatility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Graphic Illustration of the Future Russian Shtorm Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier. (Picture source: Russian social network) In terms of size and displacement, the 'Shtorm' is projected to have a full displacement of 95,000 tons, putting it in the same class as the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz-class carriers, which displace between 90,000 and 100,000 tons. The Nimitz-class, which has been the backbone of U.S. naval air power for decades, measures 330 meters (1,083 feet) in length, almost identical to the projected length of the 'Shtorm' carrier. This scale will allow both ships to operate large air wings, with the Nimitz-class able to carry up to 90 aircraft, while the 'Shtorm' will be able to deploy up to 100 aircraft, offering a slight edge in air group capacity. The propulsion systems of both ships will feature nuclear reactors, with the 'Shtorm' using a RITM-200 or RITM-400 nuclear reactor, likely providing similar advantages in terms of endurance and range. The Nimitz-class uses a nuclear power system as well, with four reactors, offering it a top speed of 30 knots, similar to the 'Shtorm’s' projected speed of 30 knots (56 km/h). While both carriers share comparable maximum speeds, the 'Shtorm' may have the edge in maneuverability due to its hull design, which incorporates a 20% reduction in water resistance. Additionally, the Nimitz-class carries a more conventional fuel-powered propulsion system, while the 'Shtorm' will rely on a combination of nuclear and gas turbines, which may provide improved operational efficiency. Both aircraft carriers will feature state-of-the-art aircraft launch and recovery systems, though the 'Shtorm' is expected to incorporate two runways to ensure nearly continuous aircraft operations. In contrast, the Nimitz-class carriers feature an angled flight deck with four launching positions (two ski-jump ramps and two electromagnetic catapults). The Nimitz-class employs traditional arresting gear for aircraft landings, while the 'Shtorm' will likely include similar facilities designed for a range of aircraft, including MiG-29K fighters, Su-57 stealth jets, and Ka-27 helicopters. These aircraft types are designed for a variety of missions, from air defense to anti-submarine warfare and reconnaissance, similar to the diverse aircraft mix employed by the U.S. Navy. Regarding air defense, the 'Shtorm' is expected to be equipped with the advanced S-500 air defense missile system, capable of engaging multiple ballistic and supersonic targets simultaneously, further enhancing its protection against aerial threats. The Nimitz-class, on the other hand, is likely to have unspecified anti-aircraft systems, but there have been indications that it may include elements of the S-400 or newer air defense technologies in its arsenal. Both ships will be equipped with radar systems for surveillance, and the Nimitz-class is particularly notable for its multi-functional phased array radar that supports both defense and navigation capabilities. One of the unique features of the 'Shtorm' is its ice-class hull, which allows it to operate in Arctic conditions. This capability will give Russia a significant advantage in protecting its strategic interests in the increasingly contested Arctic region. In contrast, the Nimitz-class carriers do not feature an ice-strengthened hull, which limits their operational flexibility in polar environments. The service life of the 'Shtorm' is expected to span 50 years, comparable to that of the Nimitz-class, which has an expected operational lifespan of roughly 50 years as well. Both carriers are designed to serve for decades, with autonomy capabilities allowing them to operate without refueling for long periods, with the 'Shtorm' able to remain operational for up to 120 days at sea. In terms of weapons systems, the 'Shtorm' will carry cruise missiles and aerial bombs, alongside an anti-aircraft missile artillery system with four combat modules, likely offering a significant increase in offensive and defensive capabilities compared to the Nimitz-class, which relies on its aircraft and traditional air defense systems. The 'Shtorm' is set to be a symbol of Russia’s increasing focus on enhancing its blue-water navy capabilities, particularly in the face of rising geopolitical tensions. With its advanced technologies, including nuclear propulsion, air defense systems, and a more versatile air wing, the 'Shtorm' aims to compete head-to-head with the Nimitz-class, offering Russia a powerful tool to project military power globally, particularly in the Arctic and other strategic regions. As the development of the 'Shtorm' continues, it is clear that Russia is determined to challenge the U.S. Navy’s supremacy in the aircraft carrier domain. With comparable size, advanced capabilities, and a strategic focus on Arctic operations, the 'Shtorm' may well become a key asset in Russia’s naval strategy, reshaping the balance of power on the world’s oceans.

This makes them extremely difficult to intercept and enables strikes at ranges exceeding 1,000 kilometers. The LRHW’s high-speed characteristics make it an effective tool for counterstrikes against both fixed and mobile targets deep within enemy territory. U.S. Army Soldiers from Bravo Battery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery, Long Range Fires Battalion, 1st Multi-Domain Task Force, showcase the capabilities of a Long Range Hypersonic Weapon Transporter Erector Launcher during Exercise Bamboo Eagle 24-3 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on August 2, 2024. (Picture source: U.S. DoD The LRHW (Long Range Hypersonic Weapon) employs an advanced boost-glide system that allows the weapon to reach extreme speeds while maintaining maneuverability throughout its flight path. Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic weapons can change their flight path mid-course, making them far more challenging to detect and intercept by existing missile defense systems. This technology grants the U.S. Army the ability to launch precision strikes against high-value targets, such as air defense systems, missile silos, and command centers, while minimizing the risk of retaliation. The LRHW’s range and maneuverability make it an essential tool for penetrating sophisticated air defense systems. In future conflicts, adversaries might deploy advanced defense networks such as the Russian S-400 or the Chinese HQ-9, which are designed to deny access to certain regions of the battlefield. LRHW’s speed, reach, and ability to evade these systems will be crucial for maintaining U.S. military dominance. While the PrSM and LRHW represent monumental advancements in long-range firepower, they do not operate in isolation. The integration of these systems with existing platforms like HIMARS will be vital to ensuring future power projection and deterrence. The HIMARS has already demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world combat, such as in Ukraine, where it has been used to strike Russian artillery positions, command posts, and logistics hubs at extended ranges. This real-world application underscores HIMARS' value as a flexible, rapid-response platform for launching precision strikes. The synergy between HIMARS, PrSM, and LRHW provides the U.S. Army with unparalleled flexibility. Whether it's a rapid counterattack, precision strikes against high-value targets, or sustained campaigns against enemy infrastructure, these systems, when fully integrated, will offer a comprehensive capability to project power across vast theaters of conflict. The ability to strike deep into enemy territory, adjust targets in real-time, and defeat sophisticated defenses will be key to shaping the future of modern warfare. As the U.S. Army continues to develop and deploy these advanced technologies, long-range precision strikes will become an increasingly critical component of battlefield strategy. The PrSM and LRHW are not just tools for engaging targets in near-peer conflicts but also serve as powerful deterrents, signaling to potential adversaries that any aggressive action will be met with a swift, overwhelming response. The integration of these systems, combined with the continued development of autonomous systems and advanced sensors, represents the future of modern warfare. In this future, rapid, long-range precision strikes will replace traditional forms of combat, and the ability to project force quickly and decisively will be crucial for maintaining global security. As the U.S. Army progresses through various testing and deployment phases, these systems will redefine the U.S. military’s role in deterrence, power projection, and leadership in advanced warfare technologies. The growing sophistication of U.S. long-range fires will pose significant challenges to adversaries, complicating any efforts to counter American military dominance. In this evolving landscape, systems like the PrSM and LRHW will be indispensable for maintaining U.S. military superiority in future conflicts. By integrating these cutting-edge technologies into its arsenal, the U.S. Army is positioning itself for long-term dominance in precision strike capabilities, ensuring that it remains a formidable force on the global stage for years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-how-the-u-s-armys-next-gen-long-range-missiles-revolutionize-precision-strike-and-counterstrike-capabilities	2024-12-02T06:41:15-08:00

Development of the SMK-Eco began in January 2022, with a focus on reducing the environmental impact of smoke munitions. After the prototyping phase completed in the summer of 2023, the first laboratory tests were carried out in September 2023. In March 2024, Thales initiated dynamic field trials with partner military units. These tests, completed in July 2024, confirmed the performance and reliability of the SMK-Eco, particularly its ability to generate a dense and stable smoke screen. The SMK-Eco is a 120 mm rifled munition designed to be fired from the 2RM mortar system. It utilizes eco-friendly chemical compounds, reducing toxic emissions and post-use residues. The rifled design enhances in-flight stability, ensuring better accuracy and uniform smoke coverage. These features enable the SMK-Eco to provide effective coverage while minimizing its ecological footprint in operational areas. The SMK-Eco uses smoke agents based on environmentally friendly chemical mixtures. Unlike traditional smoke munitions that often rely on halogenated compounds or other toxic substances, the SMK-Eco incorporates non-toxic smoke agents such as glycol-based and biodegradable resin mixtures. These agents produce dense and persistent smoke while reducing the emission of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. This formulation allows for effective coverage without compromising the health of soldiers or damaging local ecosystems. Thales designed the SMK-Eco smoke munition not only to deliver optimal military performance but also to minimize its environmental impact. A key aspect of this approach is the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions generated during the combustion of propellants and smoke agents. Below is an overview of Thales’ efforts to limit the CO₂ weight emitted by the SMK-Eco and the technologies employed to achieve this. The SMK-Eco uses specially formulated chemical propellants designed to burn cleaner than traditional propellants. These low-emission propellants are based on advanced organic compounds that optimize combustion, thereby reducing the amount of CO₂ produced per munition. Although precise figures on the CO₂ weight emitted per shot are not publicly available, Thales claims that the SMK-Eco propellant formulation allows for a significant reduction in emissions compared to conventional smoke munitions. This reduction is achieved through more complete combustion and the use of less carbon-intensive chemical materials. Compatibility with the 2RM mortar system, introduced in September 2023, allows for seamless integration of the SMK-Eco into military operations. The 2RM, renowned for its versatility, facilitates the rapid deployment of the smoke munition across various terrains. The SMK-Eco is scheduled to enter service in the first quarter of 2025, providing armed forces with a reliable and sustainable coverage solution that complies with strict environmental standards. Thales emphasizes the importance of sustainability in the development of the SMK-Eco. By incorporating biodegradable materials and eco-friendly manufacturing processes, Thales meets international environmental protection standards. This initiative is part of the company’s overall strategy to balance military performance with environmental responsibility, thereby reinforcing its position as an innovative leader in the defense sector. As a reminder, the return to high-intensity warfare requires infantry to be equipped with armored combat vehicles possessing sufficient firepower to support future mechanized brigades and tactical groups. Thales’ 120 mm rifled mortar system (2R2M) perfectly meets this need by offering exceptional mobility and optimized firing and movement capabilities. Highly automated, the 2R2M allows for semi-automatic loading and firing of 10 rounds per minute, ensuring operational efficiency from the first salvo. Additionally, its advanced design guarantees a very high level of crew protection, enhancing safety in combat zones. The 2R2M stands out for its improved accuracy, being three times more precise than a traditional smoothbore mortar, and for its maximum range of 8 to 13 kilometers. This increased accuracy allows for effective neutralization of enemy targets while minimizing the risk of accidental fires. Tested in the field across various operational theaters, the 2R2M has already been adopted by six NATO member countries, with over 170 systems deployed as part of military operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/french-army-successfully-tests-thales-new-generation-smk-eco-120mm-rifled-smoke-munitions	2024-12-02T05:13:13-08:00

USS Zumwalt stealth destroyer to become first hypersonic missile warship in US Navy	As reported by the Associated Press on November 30, 2024, the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), the lead ship in the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers of the US Navy, is currently being modified at Huntington Ingalls Industries' shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The ship is undergoing an upgrade to integrate the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) missile system, which will make it the first US warship capable of deploying hypersonic weapons. This modification involves replacing its original Advanced Gun System (AGS) with four large-diameter missile tubes, each accommodating three hypersonic missiles, for a total capacity of 12 missiles per ship.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), the lead ship in the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers of the US Navy, is currently being modified to provide the United States with the ability to execute precision-guided conventional strikes globally within one hour. (Picture source: US DoD) Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII)’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division has played a significant role in the modernization of Zumwalt-class destroyers. On August 29, 2023, it was awarded a $154.8 million contract to upgrade the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000), including the integration of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system. This follows earlier contracts, including a $10.5 million award in January 2023 for the modernization planning of USS Zumwalt and USS Michael Monsoor (DDG 1001). HII has also been involved in outfitting Zumwalt-class destroyers with advanced Mk 57 vertical launch systems under a $74 million contract awarded in April 2024. Leveraging nearly $1 billion in infrastructure investments, HII continues to enhance the combat capabilities and technological sophistication of these stealth warships. The Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) program, initially referred to as Prompt Global Strike, is designed to provide the United States with the ability to execute precision-guided conventional strikes globally within one hour. CPS utilizes technologies such as hypersonic glide vehicles and surface-, air-, and submarine-launched missile platforms. Potential delivery systems include rockets akin to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic cruise missiles, and kinetic weapons launched from orbit. A key objective is to address rapid-response scenarios and expand options beyond nuclear strikes. Testing milestones include the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon's 2011 flight, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body tested in 2020, and integration plans for Zumwalt-class destroyers in 2024. Design measures aim to differentiate CPS from nuclear systems to mitigate risks of misinterpretation by adversaries. The CPS upgrade program involves multiple defense contractors. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor responsible for final missile assembly, which takes place in Courtland, Alabama, integrating components manufactured by Northrop Grumman and Dynetics. Northrop Grumman builds the missile boosters and payload module, while Dynetics constructs the hypersonic glide body. Funding and oversight for the program are managed by the DDG-1000 Program Office. However, the cost of these systems has raised concerns. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that producing and maintaining 300 hypersonic missiles over 20 years could cost nearly $18 billion, averaging $60 million per missile. Critics argue that the expense may exceed the value of many potential targets. Proponents counter that hypersonic weapons extend operational range and precision beyond the reach of conventional systems, providing an advantage in contested environments. The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a guided missile destroyer and the lead ship of its class, named after Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. It displaces 14,564 tons, measures 600 feet in length, and is powered by an Integrated Power System generating 78 MW, enabling speeds of 33.5 knots. Initially equipped with two 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems designed for Long Range Land Attack Projectiles, the cancellation of ammunition rendered the guns inoperable, leading to a shift from land attack to surface warfare. The vessel features 80 Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launch System cells for various missiles, a radar cross-section designed for reduced detection, and an automation-focused design for a smaller crew. Commissioned in 2016, the Zumwalt has undergone modifications, including the planned replacement of the Advanced Gun Systems with hypersonic missile launch systems during a modernization period that began in 2023. The Zumwalt-class destroyers were conceived during the DD-21 program, launched in the 1990s, as a 21st-century solution for naval fire support, a role previously filled by battleships. The program aimed to develop multi-mission warships with a focus on land attack, anti-surface warfare, and reduced radar detection, aligning with Congressional mandates for enhanced naval firepower. Due to rising costs and evolving military priorities, the program was restructured into the DD(X) initiative, and the number of planned ships was reduced from 32 to 3. At an estimated total program cost of $22.5 billion, the Zumwalt-class represents a shift toward smaller, more technologically integrated fleets, as well as an attempt to balance technological innovation with fiscal and operational challenges, amid a global race for the hypersonic superiority. In fact, hypersonic capabilities are now considered essential by the United States for maintaining strategic parity with competitors such as Russia and China, who have made significant advancements in this field. China tested its DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle between 2014 and 2016, reportedly entering service by 2019 along with other hypersonic weapons like the DF-27 and the YJ-21. Russia has pursued analogous technologies, including the Avangard hypersonic weapon system, which began series production in 2018, and the OPreshnik, recently used in Ukraine. Concerns about strategic stability and misidentification have been raised internationally, particularly by Russia, which has responded with upgraded missile defenses, precision weapons, and continued strategic nuclear modernization.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uss-zumwalt-stealth-destroyer-to-become-first-hypersonic-missile-warship-in-us-navy	2024-12-02T03:04:14-08:00

Analysis: Lessons from Ukraine War how small arms and advanced systems redefine drone defense	The Ukrainian war has provided invaluable lessons in countering aerial drones, FPV (First-Person View) drones, and loitering munitions. The conflict has forced both sides to innovate rapidly, particularly in the realm of air defense. Ukraine’s experience offers a blueprint for future warfare, emphasizing the need for layered defenses, cost-effective solutions, and adaptability in the face of evolving aerial threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ukrainian soldiers target and destroy a Russian Shahed-136 kamikaze drone at close range using a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun mounted on a truck, showcasing mobile air defense capabilities in action. (Picture source: MilitaryNewsUA X account) One of the most striking elements of the Ukrainian experience is the effectiveness of small-caliber weapons against drones. Mobile air defense teams equipped with ZU-23-2 automatic cannons, mounted on trucks for rapid deployment, have been instrumental in intercepting Russian Shahed-136 drones. These 23mm twin-barreled automatic cannons, initially designed for anti-aircraft use, have proven capable of destroying drones during their low-altitude, terminal approach phase. The combination of high mobility and a rapid rate of fire allows these units to adapt to the dynamic nature of drone warfare, particularly when drones are deployed in swarms. Shotguns have emerged as another practical solution for frontline soldiers to counter FPV drones. Ukrainian forces have adopted semi-automatic shotguns, such as the Safari HG-105M and Hatsan Escort BTS 12, using buckshot cartridges to take down low-flying drones. FPV drones, often used for reconnaissance or precision strikes, are fast and operate at very low altitudes, making them difficult targets for larger, more advanced systems. The shotguns provide an inexpensive, easy-to-deploy option for infantry, particularly in urban or trench warfare scenarios where FPV drones pose an immediate threat. The Gepard Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun (SPAAG), supplied by Germany, has been a game-changer for Ukraine’s drone defense strategy. Equipped with twin 35mm Oerlikon cannons and guided by advanced radar, the Gepard has proven especially effective against loitering munitions like the Shahed-136. Its programmable AHEAD ammunition, which disperses sub-projectiles in the target's path, ensures high lethality against small, fast-moving drones. Ukrainian forces have successfully used the Gepard to protect critical infrastructure and urban centers, particularly during large-scale swarm attacks. The mobility and precision of the Gepard make it an ideal middle layer in a multi-tiered air defense system, bridging the gap between smaller-caliber weapons and advanced missile systems. Despite the successes of small-caliber weapons and anti-aircraft guns, Ukraine has also relied on modern air defense missile systems, such as the IRIS-T SLM, NASAMS, and Patriot, to provide a robust defense against drones and other aerial threats. These systems have proven highly effective at long-range interception and protecting high-value targets. However, their use against low-cost drones like the Shahed-136 highlights a critical issue: cost inefficiency. Firing expensive, high-precision missiles at drones costing as little as $20,000 is unsustainable during prolonged conflicts, particularly when facing large numbers of drones. The war has also revealed the limitations of these advanced systems when faced with drone swarms. Loitering munitions often operate at low altitudes and have small radar cross-sections, making them challenging to detect and intercept using traditional missile systems. This has reinforced the need for a layered defense approach, where advanced systems handle high-altitude and long-range threats, while small-caliber weapons and systems like the Gepard address lower-altitude, close-range targets. A critical takeaway from the Ukrainian experience is the importance of mobility and flexibility. Both small-caliber systems like the ZU-23-2 and larger platforms like the Gepard have demonstrated the value of rapid deployment and repositioning in response to evolving threats. Static systems are vulnerable in dynamic combat environments, whereas mobile units can adapt to shifting drone flight paths and operational priorities.

(Picture source Ukraine MoD The conflict in Ukraine has also underscored the need for integrated technology and AI-driven solutions. Combining small-caliber weapons, radar, and AI-enhanced fire control systems can significantly improve detection and engagement success rates. For example, integrating drones and counter-drone systems into a unified command-and-control network ensures faster response times and more efficient resource allocation. AI can enhance threat prioritization, especially during swarm attacks, where human operators might struggle to manage multiple targets simultaneously. For future conflicts, the Ukrainian experience highlights the necessity of a comprehensive, multi-layered defense strategy against aerial drones, FPV systems, and loitering munitions. Small-caliber weapons provide a cost-effective frontline solution, anti-aircraft systems like the Gepard offer a critical middle layer, and modern missile systems serve as a high-capability shield for long-range and high-altitude threats. These layers must work in unison, supported by advanced sensor technology, AI integration, and mobile platforms. The war in Ukraine has also emphasized the importance of training and adaptability for counter-drone operations. Soldiers have rapidly adapted to using unconventional weapons like shotguns for drone defense, and mobile air defense teams have learned to respond quickly to drone incursions. This adaptability will be a crucial element of future conflicts, where technological advances and new drone tactics will continue to challenge traditional defense paradigms. Ultimately, Ukraine’s experience has reshaped the understanding of modern drone warfare. The combination of layered defenses, cost-effective countermeasures, and technological integration will be essential for any military preparing to face the growing threat of drones, loitering munitions, and other unmanned aerial systems in future conflicts.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-lessons-from-ukraine-war-how-small-arms-and-advanced-systems-redefine-drone-defense	2024-11-30T05:44:01-08:00

Germany Proposes Deployment of Patriot Systems in Poland to Protect Ukraine’s Military Supply Lines	Amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and intensified international efforts to support Kyiv, Germany has announced a major new initiative. On November 28, Berlin proposed deploying Patriot air defense systems to Poland, a measure aimed at securing a critical logistics hub used for transporting military supplies to Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Germany could supply these Patriot systems from its own inventory, which currently includes nine operational units (Picture source: Bundeswehr) The German Ministry of Defense stated in a communiqué that this initiative, submitted to NATO, seeks to enhance the security of vehicle, weapon, and ammunition supply chains that are essential to Ukraine’s war effort. This proposal comes as Ukraine continues to face a Russian offensive that began in February 2022. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasized the strategic significance of the project, describing the targeted logistics hub in Poland as a vital link in the supply chain to Kyiv. The Patriot MIM-104 is a versatile missile defense system designed to counter a wide range of airborne threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft. Originally developed by the United States and first deployed in the 1980s, the Patriot system has become a cornerstone of integrated defense systems for the U.S. military and its allies. It combines high-performance radar systems, advanced interceptors, and a modular, mobile architecture that allows for rapid field deployment. Featuring passive electronically scanned array radar technology, the system provides simultaneous detection, tracking, and engagement of multiple targets while maintaining resilience against electronic countermeasures. Its ability to integrate with other air defense units further strengthens its role within comprehensive air and missile defense networks. The Patriot system features several missile variants, including the PAC-2 and PAC-3, tailored to address modern threats. Notably, the PAC-3 missile employs hit-to-kill technology to neutralize warheads with exceptional precision. A standard Patriot battery includes launchers capable of carrying up to sixteen PAC-3 missiles or four PAC-2 missiles per launcher, as well as multifunction AN/MPQ-53 or -65 radars, AN/MSQ-104 control stations, and communication and power units. During operations, the radar detects and tracks threats, relays data to the control center, calculates the optimal trajectory, and guides the missile to the target. Deployed globally, the system provides robust, adaptable air defense against increasingly sophisticated threats. The proposed deployment to Poland would be temporary, lasting up to six months, with German soldiers accompanying the systems to manage their operation and maintenance. Exact details, including the placement of the units, are under discussion between Germany, Poland, NATO allies, and Brussels authorities. This move aligns with previous deployments, such as the 2023 stationing of Patriot systems in Zamosc, southeastern Poland, near the Ukrainian border, where they were tasked with protecting a key railway hub critical to military logistics. Germany could supply these Patriot systems from its inventory, which currently includes nine operational units. To address stock reductions, partly due to deliveries of Patriot systems to Ukraine since 2022, and to enhance its defense capabilities, Berlin signed a €1.4 billion contract in March 2024 for the procurement of four additional Patriot batteries. This new commitment reflects Germany’s broader military support for Ukraine. Since the start of the invasion, Berlin has become the European Union’s primary supplier of military aid to Kyiv, though this role has strained the capabilities of Germany’s armed forces. The Bundeswehr continues to face challenges stemming from years of underfunding, an issue the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz aims to address through an ambitious rearmament program. However, this effort is constrained by financial and logistical limitations. Nonetheless, Germany’s willingness to strengthen collective defense does not extend to all aspects of Ukraine’s requests. Berlin has refused to provide long-range missiles, unlike countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom, which have supplied these capabilities. The delivery of Patriot systems to Poland would significantly enhance the country’s air defense capabilities and, by extension, bolster NATO’s eastern flank. These systems, known for their ability to counter various threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft, would offer critical protection to strategic infrastructure, such as logistical hubs vital for supplying Ukraine. By deploying these systems on Polish soil, NATO would strengthen its deterrence against aerial threats while improving the security of member states near the conflict zone. This deployment would also reassure NATO partners, demonstrating the Alliance’s commitment to collective defense mechanisms.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-proposes-deployment-of-patriot-systems-in-poland-to-protect-ukraines-military-supply-lines	2024-11-29T02:40:22-08:00	
France to Modernize Infantry with Advanced Electronic Warfare to Counter Enemy Jamming	During the 2024 edition of the 'Présentation de l’armée de Terre' (PRAT), the French Army introduced the ISIS project, an initiative aimed at equipping infantry regiments with electronic warfare capabilities. This project, which responds to evolving operational needs observed in recent conflicts such as in Ukraine, marks an important step in expanding these capabilities beyond specialized units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Army VAB CATIZ Electronic Warfare Vehicle (Picture source: French MoD) Until now, electronic warfare has been primarily handled by specialized units such as the 44th and 54th Signal Regiments and the 785th Electronic Warfare Company. These units, now grouped under the Intelligence and Cyber-Electronics Brigade (BRCE), operate under the Command of Deep Actions and Intelligence (CAPR). They use advanced systems like LINX (Localization and Interception of Exotic Emissions), CATIZ (Ground Capability for Zone Interception), and VOBULE (Vehicle for Wideband Jamming Operations). LINX is designed to locate and intercept radio signals emitted by enemy devices, such as command posts or communication systems. On the battlefield, this system is used to identify and locate enemy radio transmissions, enabling the neutralization of a communication network or precise targeting of key infrastructure. For example, during an offensive, LINX can detect an enemy command post from several kilometers away, allowing for accurate strikes or coordinated actions. The ISIS project aims to extend these capabilities to infantry units, which face modern threats such as drones, remotely operated munitions, and electronic interference. It seeks to provide simplified tools for detecting, locating, and analyzing radio signals, thereby improving real-time tactical situational awareness. CATIZ is used to monitor a defined area and intercept all radio emissions within it. On the battlefield, this system can help secure an area before an operation by intercepting signals from enemy drones or identifying jamming devices. During reconnaissance missions, CATIZ can help detect enemy activities that are invisible to the naked eye, such as hidden sensor networks or emitters used to coordinate attacks. VOBULE is a vehicle dedicated to jamming radio frequencies over a wide range. On the battlefield, it is used to prevent the enemy from communicating effectively or controlling drones. For example, during an attack on a fortified position, VOBULE can neutralize the enemy’s radio communications, causing disruption and facilitating the advance of allied forces. For reference, ISIS is presented as a system capable of continuously analyzing the radio spectrum to identify used frequency bands, locate emission sources, and characterize intercepted signals. This system provides non-specialized units with the means to monitor the electromagnetic environment and represent tactical information in real-time. According to the Technical Section of the French Army (STAT), the system will enhance communication resilience in complex or degraded environments, contributing to better control of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is essential for modern operations. The development of ISIS is being carried out in collaboration with TRAAK, a company specializing in geolocation and biometric tracking solutions, and GeePs (Electrical and Electronic Engineering Laboratory of Paris). This collaboration between industry and academic research aims to design a performance-driven solution that meets the operational needs of the French Army. Special attention is given to the system's ergonomics to ensure it can be used by non-specialized soldiers and integrated into infantry regiments. The ISIS project will enable infantry regiments to strengthen their electronic warfare operational capabilities and better respond to current electronic threats. This initiative is part of a broader effort to equip front-line units with tools adapted to modern conflicts. Still in development, ISIS represents a technological advance that could play a key role in future operations for the French Army, ensuring a strategic advantage in increasingly contested environments.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-to-modernize-infantry-with-advanced-electronic-warfare-to-counter-enemy-jamming	2024-11-29T02:29:12-08:00

Japan’s Polar Exploration: Icebreaker Shirase Departs for Antarctic Expedition	According to information published by the Japanese MoD on November 28, 2024, the Japanese icebreaker Shirase departed from Yokosuka Port, marking the start of its 66th Antarctic Observation Mission.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Japanese icebreaker Shirase departs from Yokosuka Port on a 154-day, 21,600-nautical-mile journey for the 66th Antarctic Observation Mission. (Picture source: Japanese Navy) Antarctica presents a unique geopolitical theater, where Japan’s actions subtly intertwine science, diplomacy, and latent strategic interests. Bound by the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), which forbids militarization and emphasizes peaceful, scientific cooperation, Japan ostensibly operates within these parameters. However, the nation's engagement with Antarctica reveals a deeper strategic posture shaped by its broader security concerns and regional rivalries, particularly with China and Russia. Japan’s Antarctic operations, including its robust scientific programs and logistical support from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), are emblematic of a dual-purpose strategy. The icebreaker Shirase, a JMSDF vessel, exemplifies this balance, officially providing logistical support for research missions while implicitly signaling Japan’s capacity to project power—even in the world’s most remote regions. This dual use of military assets underscores Japan’s subtle assertion of presence in a region increasingly viewed through a strategic lens, despite its demilitarized status. In the context of Japan’s geopolitical reality, its Antarctic engagement cannot be disentangled from its Indo-Pacific strategy. China’s assertive expansion in both polar regions—characterized by the construction of research bases and resource mapping—casts a long shadow over Antarctic governance. For Japan, China's activities represent more than scientific competition; they echo the broader challenge of revisionist powers undermining established norms. This concern becomes even more pressing when coupled with Russia’s militarization of the Arctic, which Japan sees as a harbinger of potential shifts in Antarctic policy, should global tensions erode the ATS’s framework. Japan’s scientific endeavors in Antarctica also reflect a calculated effort to shape the continent’s future governance. Its leadership in research reinforces its role as a stakeholder in the ATS, ensuring that any renegotiation of the treaty or its protocols—particularly regarding resource exploitation—will include its voice. The issue of marine resources, such as krill fisheries, further highlights the tensions between conservation and economic interests. Japan’s controversial whaling programs in the Southern Ocean, often framed as 'scientific research,' illuminate how the country uses Antarctic science to navigate the fine line between compliance and competition. As climate change accelerates the melting of polar ice, exposing potential reserves of untapped resources, Antarctica’s strategic importance is poised to grow. Japan’s investment in Antarctic infrastructure and technology positions it as a prepared actor in this evolving landscape. While the ATS currently prohibits resource exploitation, Japan’s careful preparation signals its recognition of a future where these rules may be contested. Ultimately, Japan’s Antarctic strategy reflects a nuanced approach to global power dynamics. It adheres to the letter of the Antarctic Treaty while leveraging its participation to assert a strategic presence, counterbalance regional rivals, and prepare for an uncertain future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-polar-exploration-icebreaker-shirase-departs-for-antarctic-expedition	2024-11-29T00:54:43-08:00

While the incidents have not directly impacted base infrastructure or local residents, they pose a security risk. In response, fighter aircraft have been deployed to intercept the drones. Additionally, approximately 60 British troops, including specialists in counter-drone operations, have been stationed at the bases to strengthen security measures. Nick Timothy, a Member of Parliament representing the Lakenheath and Mildenhall areas, noted that nighttime interceptions have raised concerns among local residents, highlighting the challenges of safeguarding military installations situated near populated areas. The incidents underscore the limitations faced by military bases operating within a civilian framework. In the United Kingdom, airspace is managed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which enforces regulatory constraints on military actions. These restrictions limit the use of active countermeasures, such as radio jamming or kinetic weapons, complicating responses to drone incursions. Similar incidents have been recorded in the United States, notably in 2023 at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, home to F-22 Raptors. According to a senior defense official, the Pentagon records an average of two to three drone incursions weekly near U.S. military installations, although specific locations are not disclosed. The widespread availability of inexpensive commercial drones exacerbates security concerns. While often used for harmless purposes, drones can be adapted for surveillance or disruption of military activities. The conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated how commercial drones can be modified for reconnaissance or offensive missions, increasing their potential threat in military contexts. To address this growing risk, the U.S. Air Force is exploring cost-effective solutions to counter individual drones and drone swarms, avoiding the expense of traditional missile-based systems. Research is focused on technologies such as directed-energy weapons, electronic jamming systems, and advanced sensors to detect incursions in real time. The impacted bases, particularly RAF Lakenheath and RAF Fairford, are critical to U.S. military operations in Europe. RAF Lakenheath hosts squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle and F-35A Lightning II fighter jets, while RAF Fairford serves as a temporary base for B-52 bombers, which are essential for strategic deterrence and power projection missions. Although U.S. and British officials have stated that operational missions remain unaffected, these incursions highlight potential vulnerabilities. Enhanced bilateral cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States will be vital to identify those responsible for the incursions, understand their objectives, and strengthen defensive capabilities against this emerging threat. The repeated drone incursions near U.S. bases in the United Kingdom underscore the evolving challenges posed by modern threats in a global military environment. These incidents demand a coordinated strategic response and the implementation of advanced technologies to protect critical military infrastructure. Without rapid enhancement of defensive measures, such incursions could become a recurring issue, jeopardizing the security of bases and the stability of international military operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-bases-in-united-kingdom-under-surveillance-following-multiple-incursions-by-drones	2024-11-28T05:53:13-08:00	
France Revises Its Military Strategy by Shifting Forces from Africa to United Arab Emirates	In the framework of a strategic reassessment of its military presence abroad, France is set to significantly reduce its troop levels in Africa while increasing deployments in the United Arab Emirates. This reorientation, announced in an interview with L’Opinion by Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu, is driven by both political and operational considerations, marking a shift in France’s defense strategy aimed at balancing military effectiveness with local perceptions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers includes 16 Leclerc tanks, VBCI-equipped infantry, five CAESAr artillery systems, and a command and logistics squadron (Picture source: French MoD) A report presented to President Emmanuel Macron by Jean-Marie Bockel recommends a drastic reduction in French forces stationed in Africa, in line with guidelines set by the Élysée in February 2023. This repositioning aligns with a strategy of enhanced partnership with local armed forces and a restructuring of French military bases. Official figures indicate that troop levels will be scaled down from 2,300 to just 600 personnel, distributed among Chad, Gabon, Côte d’Ivoire, and Senegal. Djibouti, considered part of the Indo-Pacific strategy, remains unchanged. The Chief of Defense Staff, General Thierry Burkhard, defended this adjustment during a Senate hearing, stating that while France’s military presence in Africa had proven effective, negative perceptions were undermining its benefits. The revised approach will focus on temporary deployments driven by local requests, reducing the footprint of French forces and the visibility of their bases, often located in capital cities. This transition seeks to lessen the symbolic and operational impact of their presence. France has gradually reduced its military presence in Africa and West Africa in recent years. In August 2022, French troops withdrew from Mali following tensions with the ruling military junta. In December 2022, they also pulled out of the Central African Republic, where they had been deployed since 2013, due to deteriorating relations with the Central African government and the arrival of Russian forces, notably the Wagner Group. In February 2023, France announced the withdrawal of its forces from Burkina Faso after the expulsion of its ambassador by the military junta. More recently, in September 2023, France decided to withdraw its troops from Niger following the military coup on July 26, 2023, and at the request of the new Nigerien authorities. Meanwhile, Russian and Chinese influence in Africa has intensified. Russia, through the Wagner Group and later Africka Korps, has strengthened its presence in the Central African Republic, providing military and security assistance to the government in power. This presence has been accompanied by a disinformation campaign aimed at advancing Russian interests and undermining Western influence. China, for its part, has increased its investments in Africa, particularly in West Africa, by multiplying infrastructure projects and becoming one of the continent's main trading partners. These initiatives aim to strengthen economic and political ties between China and African countries, offering an alternative to traditional partnerships with Western powers.Simultaneously, to address broader strategic needs, France plans to strengthen its military presence in the UAE, where it already maintains a substantial deployment. Under a 2008 defense agreement, the French Forces in the United Arab Emirates (FFEAU) consist of 650 to 700 personnel stationed at a naval base, the Al Dhafra Air Base—home to six Rafale jets from the 1/7 Provence Fighter Squadron—and Zayed Military City, which hosts the 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers. The 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers is a versatile unit comprising a command and logistics squadron, 16 Leclerc tanks, an infantry section equipped with Infantry Fighting Vehicles (VBCI), and an artillery sub-unit operating five CAESAr self-propelled artillery systems. Minister Lecornu announced that starting in 2025, this regiment will be bolstered by the permanent deployment of an infantry company of approximately 100 soldiers. Additional engineering capabilities may also be deployed to enhance cooperation with Emirati forces. This strategic realignment is designed to operationalize the Franco-Emirati defense agreement while meeting specific operational requirements. The FFEAU fulfill three primary missions: supporting French operational deployments in the region, fostering military cooperation with the UAE, and hosting units from metropolitan France and foreign contingents for training in desert and urban environments typical of the Middle East.This rebalancing reflects France's determination to adapt its geopolitical priorities to a shifting international context while consolidating key partnerships in strategically important regions. By strengthening its presence in the United Arab Emirates, France seizes the opportunity to project its operational capabilities in the Middle East, a critical area for global energy security and international trade. This deployment also enables more effective participation in regional stabilization efforts and counterterrorism operations. Furthermore, close cooperation with Emirati forces provides benefits in terms of training, technological exchanges, and arms sales, thereby bolstering the French defense industry.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-revises-its-military-strategy-by-shifting-forces-from-africa-to-united-arab-emirates	2024-11-28T05:13:59-08:00

These operations are supported by drones, radars, and specialized vehicles, allowing the units to move discreetly while alternating between phases of movement and surveillance. Opposing them, a Red Force simulates an enemy, creating a realistic environment for the maneuvers. The ultimate goal is to provide the command with the necessary information to understand the enemy's intentions. The 'Yellow Guardian' exercise goes beyond refining tactical procedures and logistical capabilities. It also emphasizes knowledge-sharing with international partners. For this 2024 edition, several foreign units are joining the Horse Hunters Battalion, including the 'Delta' Reconnaissance Company from Luxembourg, the reconnaissance squadron of the Netherlands' 42nd Brigade, and multiple French regiments: the 1st Spahis Regiment, the 2nd Hussar Regiment, the 54th Transmission Regiment, and the 61st Artillery Regiment. On the Belgian side, support units such as the 23rd Medical Battalion, the 18th Logistic Battalion, the 11th Engineer Battalion, the 10th CIS Group, and the Artillery Battalion are also participating in the operation. 'We do not have the same methods of working, communication, or logistical procedures,' explains Lieutenant Colonel SBH Jean-François Verheust, commander of the Horse Hunters Battalion. 'These differences present challenges that push us to improve.' This approach aims not only to increase operational efficiency but also to strengthen cohesion among allied units. By bringing together troops from different countries, 'Yellow Guardian' enhances international cooperation and interoperability. Participating units share their expertise and improve their responsiveness in multilateral missions. 'Bringing together so many units specialized in reconnaissance and intelligence gathering from four countries is a first for Belgium,' notes Major Didier Brach, deputy commander of the Battalion. 'It’s a true international reconnaissance community that is forming at 'Yellow Guardian'.' This exercise represents an important step in developing reconnaissance and collaborative capabilities within European armed forces, while also solidifying ties between allies in a demanding operational context.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/a-first-in-belgium-to-strengthen-cooperation-in-military-reconnaissance-with-international-exercise-yellow-guardian	2024-11-28T02:27:44-08:00
