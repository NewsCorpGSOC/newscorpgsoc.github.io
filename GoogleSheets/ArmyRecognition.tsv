India’s Submarine Revolution: German-Indian Collaboration Brings AIP to Navy	According to information published by Reuters on January 23, 2025, the German-Indian joint venture led by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender for India's ambitious $5 billion Project-75(I) submarine program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link German built Type 214 submarine. (Picture source: TKMS) India’s Project-75(I) is one of the most ambitious and long-awaited defense acquisition programs, aimed at revitalizing the country’s submarine fleet to counter growing threats in the Indian Ocean region. With a budget of $5 billion, the program seeks to procure six next-generation diesel-electric attack submarines equipped with cutting-edge technologies, including air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. Following a rigorous evaluation process, the joint venture between German shipbuilder ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender, after the Spanish consortium of Navantia and Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) failed to meet critical requirements. The program was envisioned as an extension of the original Project-75, under which MDL collaborated with French company Naval Group to produce six Scorpène-class submarines. These submarines, while a significant leap forward at the time, lack AIP technology, which is now critical for modern naval operations. The objective of Project-75(I) is to develop a new class of conventional submarines that can stay submerged for extended periods, enhance stealth capabilities, and feature cutting-edge weapons and sensor systems. Despite its urgency, the project has faced delays spanning more than a decade due to procurement hurdles, technological complexities, and debates over the degree of technology transfer required under the 'Make in India' initiative. TKMS brings to the table its highly advanced Type 214 submarine, a proven platform that has been adopted by navies in Germany, Greece, South Korea, and Turkey. The Type 214 features an advanced hydrogen fuel cell-based AIP system, which enables the submarine to remain submerged for up to two weeks without surfacing. This system operates silently, significantly reducing the submarine’s acoustic signature, a critical factor in modern anti-submarine warfare. Navantia proposed a design based on its S-80 Plus submarine, which is still under development and has yet to achieve operational deployment. The S-80 Plus relies on a bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, which converts bio-ethanol into hydrogen for powering fuel cells. While innovative, this system has not been field-proven to the extent of TKMS's AIP technology. Moreover, Navantia’s design faced setbacks in the past, including issues with buoyancy calculations that delayed Spain’s own submarine program. These technical challenges may have undermined confidence in their ability to meet the Indian Navy’s rigorous specifications. In terms of industrial partnership, Larsen &amp; Toubro is a leading Indian defense company with significant expertise in shipbuilding and engineering. However, its collaboration with Navantia was relatively nascent compared to the established relationship between TKMS and MDL, which had successfully navigated previous submarine-building challenges under Project-75. The centerpiece of the competition was the AIP system, a transformative technology for diesel-electric submarines. Conventional submarines without AIP must surface or use a snorkel to recharge their batteries, making them vulnerable to detection. AIP systems, by contrast, allow prolonged underwater endurance and enhanced stealth. The hydrogen fuel cell system used by TKMS is regarded as one of the most mature and efficient AIP technologies available. It operates silently, generates no vibrations, and produces minimal heat, making detection by thermal and acoustic sensors difficult. Navantia’s bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, while innovative, introduces potential complexities in fuel management and system integration. Its unproven track record compared unfavorably to TKMS’s operationally validated system, which has seen years of deployment and performance refinement. Both contenders proposed submarines capable of carrying heavyweight torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, and land-attack cruise missiles. TKMS’s Type 214 is already compatible with a range of munitions, including the DM2A4 SeaHake torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The S-80 Plus, while theoretically offering similar versatility, is still undergoing integration testing for many of these systems. On the sensor front, both designs emphasized advanced sonar suites, electronic warfare capabilities, and integrated combat management systems. However, TKMS’s submarines benefit from operational feedback from multiple navies, whereas the S-80 Plus remains in developmental stages. With a rapidly aging fleet and increasing threats from China's expanding submarine force and Pakistan’s AIP-equipped Agosta-class submarines, the Indian Navy urgently requires these advanced platforms. Selecting a proven design like the Type 214 minimizes developmental risks and ensures timely delivery. If negotiations proceed as planned, the first submarine from Project-75(I) could enter service within three to five years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indias-submarine-revolution-german-indian-collaboration-brings-aip-to-navy	2025-01-24T07:02:18-08:00

These marks signify a successful defense against a diverse and complex array of threats, underscoring the ship's readiness and its crew's proficiency in operating naval systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS Spruance (DDG-111) returns to port bearing 13 mission marks after successfully intercepting ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs in a high-stakes engagement against Houthi forces in the Red Sea. (Picture source: US DoD) At the core of the USS Spruance’s defense is the Aegis Combat System, a fully integrated combat management system designed to process vast amounts of sensor data and coordinate the ship’s weapons to neutralize diverse threats. The Aegis system is centered around the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar and the ship’s command and control suite, which collectively provide rapid detection, tracking, and engagement across multiple domains. The AN/SPY-1D(V) radar is a high-power, multi-function phased-array radar that operates in the S-band frequency range. It is capable of detecting and tracking hundreds of targets simultaneously, including low-observable threats such as sea-skimming cruise missiles and high-altitude ballistic missiles. The radar’s phased-array technology eliminates the need for moving parts, allowing it to maintain constant surveillance over its area of coverage. During the engagement, this radar was responsible for detecting inbound threats at their maximum range, providing critical early-warning data. Once threats were detected, the Aegis Command and Decision Suite processed the data and classified the targets based on their threat level. The system’s real-time processing capability enables rapid assignment of weapons to targets, prioritizing engagements based on speed, proximity, and lethality. This ensures that the ship’s defenses are neither overwhelmed nor misallocated during a multi-vector attack. The interception of three anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) by the USS Spruance represents a significant technological achievement. Ballistic missiles follow a high-arcing trajectory and typically re-enter the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often exceeding Mach 5. These characteristics make them extremely challenging targets, requiring precise timing and advanced intercept technology. The Aegis BMD system, an upgraded component of the ship’s combat suite, provides the capability to track and intercept ballistic missiles during their midcourse or terminal phase. When the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar detected the inbound ASBMs, the Aegis system calculated their trajectory, speed, and re-entry path. This data was shared with regional and space-based sensors through the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), creating a unified threat picture. To neutralize the ASBMs, the Spruance likely launched Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors from its Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). The SM-3 is a hit-to-kill interceptor designed specifically for ballistic missile engagements. It uses a multi-stage booster to achieve high velocity and deploys a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) in the missile’s terminal phase. The KKV does not carry an explosive warhead; instead, it relies on sheer kinetic energy to destroy the target by colliding with it at high speed. For terminal-phase threats closer to the ship, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) could have been employed. The SM-6 is a dual-role missile capable of intercepting both ballistic and air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles, at extended ranges. Its active radar seeker and advanced guidance system make it particularly effective in dealing with maneuvering re-entry vehicles (RVs). The interception of three anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) further illustrates the Spruance’s layered defensive architecture. Cruise missiles, which fly at low altitudes and often use terrain-following radar to evade detection, are designed to overwhelm shipboard defenses with speed and maneuverability. The SPY-1D(V) radar played a pivotal role in detecting these missiles despite their low-altitude flight paths and potentially stealthy designs. Upon detection, the Aegis system assigned Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) interceptors for mid-range engagements. The SM-2 employs semi-active radar homing, guided by the ship’s radar, to track and intercept the target. Its dual-thrust rocket motor provides the necessary speed and range to engage cruise missiles before they reach their terminal phase. For threats that penetrated closer to the ship, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) likely came into play. The ESSM is designed for point defense and is capable of engaging highly maneuverable targets at short ranges. Its active radar seeker provides high accuracy, while its advanced control surfaces enable rapid course adjustments to counter evasive maneuvers. Additionally, the ship’s Mk 99 Fire Control System directed the engagement, ensuring precise guidance of each interceptor. This system uses radar illuminators to 'paint' the target, providing the SM-2 and ESSM with continuous updates on the target’s location and trajectory during flight. The successful interception of seven UAVs showcased the Spruance’s ability to counter the growing use of drones in asymmetric warfare. UAVs are often deployed in swarms to saturate defenses and are particularly challenging to detect due to their small radar cross-sections and erratic flight patterns. The ship’s Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) likely played a central role in UAV defense. The CIWS, commonly referred to as 'Phalanx,' is a 20mm Gatling gun mounted on a swiveling turret. It is radar-guided and designed for last-ditch defense against incoming threats. Operating at a rate of up to 4,500 rounds per minute, the CIWS can effectively destroy small, fast-moving targets like UAVs at ranges of 1-2 kilometers. Electronic warfare measures, such as the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), complemented kinetic defenses. SEWIP provides advanced electronic attack capabilities, allowing the ship to disrupt the command, control, and navigation systems of UAVs. By jamming communication links, SEWIP can render drones ineffective without expending munitions. The Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) on the USS Spruance provides the foundation for its multi-mission flexibility. With 96 launch cells, the ship can carry a mix of interceptors, land-attack missiles, and anti-submarine weapons, tailored to mission requirements. The VLS uses a 'hot launch' system, where missiles are ignited within the cell and expelled upward through a hatch. This system allows for rapid, sequential launches, ensuring the ship can respond to high-intensity engagements like the one in the Red Sea. The ability to switch seamlessly between different types of munitions—such as SM-2 for air defense, SM-3 for ballistic missile defense, and ESSM for point defense—gives the Spruance unmatched tactical flexibility.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-us-navy-arleigh-burke-destroyer-uss-spruance-scores-impressive-missiles-uavs-downs-in-red-sea-battle	2025-01-23T03:50:54-08:00

(Picture source: Finnish MoD) The Baltic Sentry operation is a direct response to mounting security concerns in the region, particularly the protection of critical undersea infrastructure, such as pipelines and communication cables, that underpin European economies. Finland’s participation represents a significant enhancement of NATO’s operational capabilities in the Baltic, a maritime domain where both conventional and hybrid threats are becoming more frequent. The Baltic Sea’s security dynamics have undergone profound changes since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The region has become a hotspot for military activity, economic pressure, and covert operations. Incidents such as the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2022 underscored the vulnerabilities of undersea infrastructure and highlighted the need for comprehensive security measures. The FNS Pori, one of four Hamina-class missile boats in the Finnish Navy, is particularly suited for operations in the Baltic Sea. Unlike larger NATO vessels designed for deep-ocean engagements, the Pori is built for effectiveness in the shallow, congested, and strategically constrained waters of the Baltic. Its design reflects Finland’s decades of experience in defending its own 1,100-kilometer Baltic coastline. The Pori’s stealth capabilities give it an operational edge. Its reduced radar and infrared signatures allow it to operate undetected in environments where surveillance is high and threats are often unconventional. This stealth, combined with its speed and maneuverability, makes the Pori highly effective for coastal patrol, interdiction, and rapid-response missions.

The upgrade, requiring software adjustments and minor hardware changes, is compatible with existing systems used by operators in the United States and Europe.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2017, the Trophy APS had accumulated 50,000 operational hours since its introduction in 2011, showcasing its effectiveness in both low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) During testing, the upgraded Trophy system, mounted on a 30 mm turret, successfully intercepted a jet-powered fixed-wing drone classified between classes 2 and 3. The drone approached in a near-vertical dive. Rafael emphasized that these enhancements were achieved without altering the system’s core hardware. In addition to drone interception, Trophy has been updated based on operational experience, including lessons learned from conflicts in Gaza and northern Israel. These improvements address the system’s performance against short-range threats in urban environments and long-range threats such as ATGMs in open terrain. A representative of EuroTrophy—a joint venture between Rafael, GDELS, and KNDS to market Trophy in Europe—stated that the system has achieved high interception rates during conflicts. The venture is working to integrate Trophy onto platforms like the MGCS and ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles, as well as three European 8x8 armored vehicles. The representative noted that Trophy contributes to operational effectiveness by providing consistent vehicle protection, which is critical for mission continuity. They also highlighted the operational challenges commanders face when vehicle losses threaten the success of an operation. The Trophy APS, also known as 'Windbreaker,' was developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems in collaboration with Elta Systems to counter modern anti-armor threats such as ATGMs, RPGs, and other anti-tank weapons. Development began in the 1980s to enhance the survivability of armored vehicles in urban and open battlefields, with the system becoming operational in 2009 and achieving its first recorded interception in 2011. Variants have been developed for different vehicle weight classes, including Trophy HV for heavy vehicles, Trophy MV for medium vehicles, and Trophy LV for light vehicles. Trophy's functionality is based on the Elta EL/M-2133 fire-control radar, which uses four flat-panel antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. When detecting an incoming projectile, it calculates the approach vector, threat type, time to impact, and angle. Rotating launchers deploy Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) in a precise pattern to neutralize threats at a safe distance. The system counters ATGMs, high-explosive anti-tank rounds, RPGs, and similar threats. It can engage multiple threats simultaneously on stationary and moving vehicles and integrates with C4I systems and remote-controlled weapons stations. Newer models feature automated reloading for consecutive engagements. By 2023, the production of the Trophy APS increased to 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month, as it has been deployed on tanks like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4, the American Abrams, the German Leopard 2A7A1 and 2A8, as well as the British Challenger 3. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) The Trophy APS has been operational since 2011, demonstrating success in low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. It has intercepted threats like Kornet ATGMs and RPG-29s. By 2017, Trophy accumulated 50,000 operational hours, and by 2023, production reached 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month. The radar system can share data with other vehicles, enabling improved threat coordination and targeting. It can identify whether a projectile will miss its target, withholding countermeasures and sharing data for tactical use. Reports suggest it offers protection against certain top-attack missiles and is used in Israel and the U.S. However, the Trophy APS has limitations. It cannot counter kinetic energy penetrators and is vulnerable to direct top-down attacks, as demonstrated in 2023 when drones dropped grenades on protected vehicles. Its weight, approximately 500 kilograms, may impact the performance of lighter vehicles. The use of EFPs poses risks to nearby infantry, complicating operations involving dismounted soldiers. Techniques such as rapid successive missile firings, ultra-close-range RPG attacks, and supersonic projectiles have exploited system weaknesses. Conflicts in 2023 and 2024 highlighted instances where the system was overwhelmed, with video evidence showing some failures. Rafael representatives emphasized that despite its new anti-drone capability, Trophy alone cannot provide comprehensive air defense against drones. They advocate a layered defense strategy incorporating mobility, lethality, and survivability, supported by technologies like lasers, electromagnetic spectrum control, and hard- and soft-kill systems. This approach aims to address the growing challenges posed by drones, including swarms and top-attack threats, which complicate operations for maneuver forces. Production of Trophy APS began in Israel in 2007 and in the U.S. in 2012, with a combined output of 40 systems and 500 countermeasures per month by 2023. Since 2010, it has been deployed on platforms like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4 tanks, Namer APCs, and U.S. M1A2 Abrams tanks. It has been tested on Stryker APCs and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The lighter Trophy MV/VPS version was developed for medium and light vehicles, while the Trophy LV is designed for vehicles under 8 tons. It has been integrated into Germany's Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and is included in orders for the Leopard 2A8. The UK has signed contracts to evaluate it for Challenger 3 tanks. Other potential operators include Croatia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/israels-rafael-upgrades-its-trophy-active-protection-system-to-counter-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-23T01:47:31-08:00

Royal Navy Confronts Russian Ship in Channel as UK Strengthens Undersea Security	According to information published by the UK MoD on January 22, 2025, the Royal Navy recently intercepted and tracked the Russian spy ship Yantar as it moved through the English Channel. This latest development reflects the UK’s intensified efforts to counter potential threats to undersea infrastructure, which is increasingly seen as a target of strategic importance. Yantar, known for its specialized surveillance capabilities, has been under scrutiny for its potential to interfere with critical assets such as undersea cables and pipelines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 22010-class intelligence ship and a Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset. (Picture source: UK MoD) This is not the first encounter between Yantar and British forces. Late last year, the vessel was observed lingering near key infrastructure in UK waters, prompting the Royal Navy to send a submarine to surface near Yantar and issue a pointed warning. Following that incident, the vessel left UK territory for the Mediterranean. Its return this week has reignited concerns over its intentions, leading to its close monitoring by the frigate HMS Somerset as it transited the Channel. The broader context for these developments is the rising tension over the security of offshore infrastructure across Europe. Undersea cables, which carry the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic, and pipelines, essential for energy supplies, have become focal points of geopolitical vulnerability. Recent damage to the Estlink2 undersea cable between Estonia and Finland has heightened these concerns, prompting NATO to launch new measures to protect these critical assets. The UK is playing a leading role in these efforts, deploying advanced capabilities to deter and monitor threats. As part of the NATO Baltic Sentry initiative, the UK is contributing advanced P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and Rivet Joint surveillance platforms. These assets are designed to bolster reconnaissance and response capabilities in regions where the risk to undersea infrastructure is particularly acute. At the heart of Britain’s response is a new AI-driven system known as Nordic Warden. This technology, recently activated, leverages real-time data from a variety of sources to track and analyze ship movements, assessing the potential risks posed by suspicious vessels. Nordic Warden has been specifically configured to monitor Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet,' a network of tankers used to evade sanctions by transporting oil and gas to international buyers. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy’s RFA Proteus, equipped with submersible drones, has been a critical component in safeguarding undersea assets. Proteus, which previously shadowed Yantar during its activities in UK waters, remains on the front lines of undersea surveillance and inspection, ensuring that cables and pipelines remain secure. These efforts also dovetail with international sanctions targeting Russia’s economic lifelines. The UK has taken a prominent role in sanctioning vessels involved in evading restrictions, including tankers used to fund Russia’s ongoing military operations in Ukraine.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/royal-navy-confronts-russian-ship-in-channel-as-uk-strengthens-undersea-security	2025-01-23T01:01:34-08:00

Pakistan Navy Takes Command of Task Force 151 Leading Global Counter-Piracy Efforts in Gulf of Aden	In a world where international maritime routes play a vital role in global trade, ensuring their security remains a top priority for the international community. On January 22, 2025, the Pakistan Navy officially assumed command of Combined Task Force 151 (CTF 151), a multinational unit dedicated to countering piracy in the strategic waters of the Gulf of Aden. During a ceremony held in Manama, Bahrain, Turkish Navy Rear Admiral Rustu Sezer handed over responsibilities to Pakistan Navy Commodore Sohail Azmie, marking another step in advancing international maritime cooperation. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since its establishment in 2009, CTF 151 has been a cornerstone of the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), a coalition of 46 nations committed to safeguarding international maritime routes (Picture source: US DoD) Under Sezer's leadership since July 2024, CTF 151 undertook numerous initiatives to improve interoperability among participating naval forces and to strengthen transnational relationships. These efforts included multinational exercises and regular patrols in the Gulf of Aden, a critical maritime region exposed to piracy threats. Working in close coordination with the European Union Naval Force (EUNAVFOR), CTF 151 effectively monitored activities in the region and responded promptly to emerging threats. This was Turkey's seventh tenure leading the task force, reflecting its continued commitment to maritime security. Taking over the command, the Pakistan Navy brings proven resources and capabilities to the mission. Among these, Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates like PNS Alamgir (F-260), often deployed for international operations, and Zulfiquar-class frigates such as PNS Aslat (F-254), are expected to play a key role. These vessels, equipped with advanced surveillance systems and versatile combat capabilities, are instrumental in supporting CTF 151’s efforts. Additionally, the Pakistan Navy deploys P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, which provide extensive reconnaissance and early threat detection, further enhancing the effectiveness of operations. Pakistan has also demonstrated its capacity for coordinated operations with other nations to secure international shipping routes. For instance, during Focused Operation TAHAFFUZ, the Pakistan Navy led joint efforts involving nine countries to protect global maritime trade. Furthermore, regular exercises with partners like the South Korean Navy highlight Pakistan's ongoing commitment to improving interoperability and strengthening professional ties within the framework of maritime security initiatives. Since its establishment in 2009, CTF 151 has been a cornerstone of the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), a coalition of 46 nations committed to safeguarding international maritime routes.

Headquartered in Bahrain, the CMF represents the largest multinational naval partnership in the world, covering more than 8.3 million square kilometers of maritime space. Despite progress in recent years, piracy remains a persistent threat in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding areas. Historically, this region has been a focal point for piracy activities, particularly off the Somali coast. While international measures such as the European Union's Operation Atalanta significantly reduced incidents in the early 2010s, a resurgence has been observed since 2023. In January 2024, the Indian Navy rescued an Iranian fishing vessel with 19 Pakistani crew members that had been hijacked by Somali pirates. This resurgence is attributed to factors such as regional instability aggravated by conflicts in Yemen, reduced international naval patrols, and socio-economic challenges in Somalia that drive individuals towards piracy. To address these growing threats, international initiatives have been strengthened. Operation Atalanta, for example, had its mandate extended in December 2024 for an additional two years to secure the Gulf of Aden and parts of the Red Sea. These efforts, combined with contributions from partner nations like Pakistan, aim to maintain a secure maritime environment and prevent disruptions to vital trade routes. This change of command underscores the ongoing importance of multinational cooperation in addressing global maritime security challenges. Under the leadership of Commodore Sohail Azmie, CTF 151 will continue its efforts to suppress piracy, enhance international coordination, and protect strategic maritime routes.

British Aerospace Industry at Stake with Choice Between Typhoon and F-35A Fighter Jets	As the British government prepares to announce its decision on the purchase of new combat aircraft for the Royal Air Force, the Unite union is urging the Ministry of Defence to prioritize national production by opting for additional Typhoon jets over F-35As. According to Unite, this decision is crucial for safeguarding the UK’s industrial expertise and preparing the country for the production of the future sixth-generation combat air program, known as Tempest or the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Typhoon would support industrial autonomy and preserve national expertise while remaining a proven, versatile tool for diverse missions. (Picture source: British MoD) As the British government prepares to announce its decision on the purchase of new combat aircraft for the Royal Air Force, the Unite union is urging the Ministry of Defence to prioritize Eurofighter Typhoon jets over the F-35A. This decision is deemed crucial for safeguarding national industrial expertise and preparing the UK for the production of the future sixth-generation fighter program, the Tempest, or the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). With large-scale production of Tempest expected in the 2030s, the gradual reduction of the UK Typhoon production line threatens the industrial base, including the 6,500 BAE Systems employees currently involved in the program. A recent report by the Defence Select Committee further underscores the strategic importance of preserving jobs and expertise in the aerospace sector. The Eurofighter Typhoon, developed by a European consortium comprising EADS, Alenia Aeronautica, and BAE Systems, is a highly versatile multirole aircraft. It excels in air superiority, ground strikes, reconnaissance, and maritime attack. With a maximum speed of 2,495 km/h, exceptional agility, and 13 hardpoints for various armaments such as AMRAAM missiles, Paveway guided bombs, and Storm Shadow anti-radar missiles, it is well-suited for a broad range of missions. Its CAPTOR-M radar, combined with a planned upgrade to AESA technology, enhances detection and targeting capabilities, while its lightweight composite structure ensures operational flexibility. In contrast, the F-35A Lightning II, developed by Lockheed Martin under the Joint Strike Fighter program, emphasizes stealth and advanced technology. Its AESA AN/APG-81 radar and Distributed Aperture System (DAS) provide unmatched situational awareness, supported by advanced electronic warfare capabilities. Designed to operate in heavily defended airspaces, the F-35A can carry a range of weapons, including AMRAAM missiles, JDAM bombs, and HARM missiles, all while maintaining a low radar signature through its internal weapons bay. While it has a lower top speed (1,930 km/h compared to 2,495 km/h) and slightly less agility, the F-35A’s ability to neutralize advanced air defense systems and its integration into coalition operations make it a strategically valuable asset. In terms of costs, the Typhoon presents significant advantages for the British economy. A purchase of 24 aircraft could sustain 26,000 jobs over two years across BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo, and the broader national supply chain. By comparison, a similar order for the F-35A would create only two to three months of work for approximately 2,000 workers in the UK. While the Typhoon directly supports local industry, the F-35A benefits from economies of scale due to its large-scale production, potentially offsetting its higher initial costs. However, the infrastructure required to maintain its stealth technology adds significant long-term expenses. The choice between the two aircraft depends on the UK’s strategic priorities. The Typhoon would support industrial autonomy and preserve national expertise while remaining a proven, versatile tool for diverse missions. Meanwhile, the F-35A, with its stealth and advanced capabilities, is better suited to modern conflicts involving contested environments. A hybrid solution combining both aircraft could offer a strategic balance, addressing immediate military needs while supporting the long-term viability of the national aerospace sector. Unite emphasizes the urgency of this decision. General Secretary Sharon Graham highlighted the importance of retaining the highly skilled engineers and technicians in the aerospace sector. She called on the government to invest in Typhoons to meet military and economic needs while ensuring continuity of expertise for future programs. Rhys McCarthy, Unite’s national defense officer, warned that neglecting the domestic defense industry in an increasingly unstable world would be irresponsible. He also stressed that the UK government cannot expect to sell Typhoons abroad if it does not demonstrate confidence in the product itself. The decision between the Typhoon and the F-35A represents a critical strategic choice for the UK. Beyond military considerations, it could redefine the future of the national aerospace industry while addressing global security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/british-aerospace-industry-at-stake-with-choice-between-typhoon-and-f-35a-fighter-jets	2025-01-22T06:11:32-08:00

South Korea develops a land-based CIWS-II 30mm system to counter future North Korean kamikaze drones	As reported by the Korea Bizwire on January 20, 2025, South Korea has begun developing a land-based adaptation of its Close-In Weapon System (CIWS-II) to address North Korean threats, including artillery, drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) manages the project, building on the naval CIWS-II equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun and Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. For the land-based version, design changes include replacing the four-sided fixed AESA radar with a single-faced rotating radar to prioritize monitoring northern threats and reducing costs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after several North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 incident when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. (Picture source: DAPA) A close-in weapon system (CIWS) is a point-defense weapon designed to detect and intercept short-range threats, such as incoming missiles and aircraft, that have penetrated outer defenses. Typically installed on naval ships, CIWS is standard on most large modern warships and has also been adapted for land-based applications. There are two main types: gun-based and missile-based. Gun-based CIWS, such as the American Phalanx, Dutch Goalkeeper, and Russian Kashtan systems, employ rotary or revolver cannons with radar and computer systems mounted on rotating turrets for automatic targeting. Missile-based CIWS, like the American RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile and Russian Pantsir system, use radar or infrared guidance to direct short-range missiles at close-range threats. The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 event when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. Existing ground-based systems, such as the K30 Biho, have struggled to detect and track small or low-flying threats. The new system aims to counter a range of threats, including long-range artillery, close-range ballistic missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, multiple rocket launchers, low-flying cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. It will use AESA radar and electro-optical tracking systems for improved detection and interception. Advanced Hit Efficiency And Destruction (AHEAD) ammunition, designed to release fragments upon detonation, will increase its effectiveness against drones and artillery shells. Cost-saving measures for the land-based adaptation include using a rotating AESA radar instead of the fixed version used on naval systems. The system is designed to counter specific threats such as kamikaze drones and missile swarms. Rep. Yoo Yong-won of the People Power Party emphasized the importance of deploying the system, citing North Korea’s advancements and their risks to Seoul and nearby areas. The US-made Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, serves as a notable example of a naval close-in weapon system modified for ground-based applications. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, offers a comparable example. Based on the Phalanx CIWS, the C-RAM uses a 20mm M61A1 Gatling gun and Ku-band radar to protect forward operating bases from rockets and mortars. It employs high-explosive incendiary tracer self-destructing (HEIT-SD) ammunition to minimize collateral damage and successfully intercepted 105 attacks during its initial deployment. The C-RAM influenced South Korea’s approach to the CIWS-II program. Expected to reach initial capability by 2027, the CIWS-II project addresses limitations in foreign systems, such as the Dutch SGE-30 Goalkeeper and U.S. Phalanx, which have faced issues related to cost, maintenance, and operational capability. Dissatisfaction with reliance on external suppliers led to the decision to develop a domestic solution. In 2021, LIG Nex1 and Hanwha Systems competed for the CIWS-II contract, presenting models with AESA radar and electro-optical systems at MADEX 2021. LIG Nex1 was chosen for its expertise in radar, fire control, and maintenance, including its work with the Goalkeeper system. The project has a budget of 895.7 billion KRW (approximately $626,990,000) and will continue through 2036. The naval CIWS-II, equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun capable of high rates of fire, integrates AESA radars for detection and tracking. Its configuration includes four detection radars and one tracking radar, whereas the land-based variant may use a simplified setup to reduce costs. Electro-optical targeting enhances interception of drones, supersonic missiles, and other aerial threats. Future upgrades aim to enhance the system’s effectiveness against swarming drone attacks using AHEAD ammunition. Initial deployment will occur on Chungnam-class frigates, potentially serving as test platforms. The land-based version is expected to defend urban and strategic areas, including Seoul, addressing South Korea’s security challenges. However, gun-based CIWS systems have limitations, particularly in range and effectiveness. These systems typically have a maximum range of 5,000 meters, with real-world interception often occurring closer to 500 meters, increasing the risk of fragments or damaged threats causing harm. Additionally, their kill probability is limited, as direct hits may not neutralize threats entirely, especially with kinetic-energy-only projectiles. Missile-based CIWS mitigates some of these challenges by offering extended range and improved interception capabilities. Systems like the dual-role Kashtan and Pantsir combine guns and missiles for greater tactical flexibility.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/south-korea-develops-a-land-based-ciws-ii-30mm-system-to-counter-future-north-korean-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-22T04:57:40-08:00

(Picture source: U.S. Army) The U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division is forging a new path in drone development, focusing on creating small UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) that are more versatile, durable, and cost-effective than previously fielded systems. The 3D printed drones are expected to provide tactical advantages, addressing the unique needs of air assault operations, and offer valuable lessons for future Army modernization efforts. As the U.S. Army accelerates its transformation into a more agile, tech-driven force, the 101st Airborne Division is at the forefront of experimenting with and deploying advanced technologies. The Division's efforts to 3D-print sUAS at EagleWerx represent a paradigm shift in how drones are produced and integrated into military operations. 'This is bigger than simply printing parts. We are reshaping the sUAS enterprise at the tactical level,' said Col. (Promotable) Travis McIntosh, Deputy Commanding Officer for Support of the 101st ABN Division. 'This initiative will affect how we do small UAS in the division, from airworthiness to parts ordering, to fielding and training.' The emphasis on 3D printing goes beyond just prototyping. It introduces a new approach to drone development and logistics, particularly in terms of reducing time and costs for manufacturing and deploying sUAS. The Division’s decision to make use of advanced manufacturing capabilities at EagleWerx is a direct response to feedback from soldiers who requested drones that are not only more efficient but also easily replaceable. The U.S. Army 101st's decision to develop these 3D-printed sUAS was made in collaboration with the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), which has been integral in pushing the requirements for these systems. Soldiers from both units requested drones that would be more versatile, durable, and, importantly, expendable—capabilities that existing systems often lacked. The new drones will be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, where the Division will field 100 custom-made sUAS units. 'We are able to print these systems at a fraction of the cost of traditional models, without sacrificing operational functionality,' said Capt. Andrew Blomquist, the 2nd Mobile Brigade Combat Team’s innovation officer. He emphasized the excitement within the Division to see these new, 3D-printed drones put to the test in the hands of soldiers during the exercise. Operation Lethal Eagle is a 21-day training exercise designed to push the limits of the Division's capabilities, particularly in large-scale, long-range air assault (L2A2) operations. The event aims to prototype and test emerging Army technologies, enhance the lethality of soldiers, and build proficiency in complex, multi-domain operations. During the exercise, soldiers will conduct a range of missions that integrate these new sUAS into tactical operations. This will provide invaluable data for refining drone usage and manufacturing at the tactical level. The training is expected to showcase the practical benefits of 3D-printed drones, such as their ease of replacement in the field and lower costs for procurement, maintenance, and training. The 3D manufacturing initiative is a reflection of the Army's broader strategy to modernize and improve its technological edge. As Col. McIntosh notes, the effort is part of an ongoing transformation that will make the Division’s drone systems more adaptable to ever-evolving mission requirements, from surveillance to electronic warfare. While the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division’s 3D-printed drones will first be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, they are expected to be a permanent fixture within the Division’s technological arsenal. The success of the program could serve as a blueprint for other units in the U.S. Army, offering a new model for rapid, cost-effective drone manufacturing that can be easily scaled across other operational theaters. As U.S. soldiers continue to experiment with and refine these new systems, the 101st’s venture into 3D printing is setting the stage for broader innovations in military drone development, offering a glimpse into the future of Army warfare—one where agility, speed, and innovation take center stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-army-101st-airborne-division-develops-3d-printed-small-drones-for-air-assault-operations	2025-01-22T03:24:22-08:00

B-1B Lancers Deployed to Guam a Strategic Reinforcement for Indo-Pacific	Four U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer strategic bombers landed at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam on January 15, 2025, marking the start of the year's first Bomber Task Force mission. These aircraft, from the 34th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron based at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, play a pivotal role in U.S. efforts to strengthen alliances and deter threats in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link the B-1 Lancer is a long-range, versatile strategic bomber that holds a central position in the U.S. Air Force's arsenal (Picture source: US Air Force) A key feature of this mission was an unprecedented trilateral flight conducted over airspace between Japan and South Korea. Two B-1Bs were escorted by two Mitsubishi F-2 fighters from Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force and two F-15K Slam Eagles from the South Korean Air Force. This operation underscores growing trilateral military cooperation, reflecting closer ties between these nations as they address security challenges in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and the Korean Peninsula. Originally developed by Rockwell (now part of Boeing), the B-1 Lancer is a long-range, versatile strategic bomber that holds a central position in the U.S. Air Force's arsenal. Its unique variable-geometry wing configuration enables the aircraft to adjust wing angles for optimal performance during various phases of flight. Powered by four General Electric F101-GE-102 turbofan engines, the B-1B can reach a top speed of 1,340 km/h and a range of 11,998 km with aerial refueling. Operated by a crew of four — a pilot, a co-pilot, and two systems operators — it is designed to execute complex, long-range missions. The B-1B is distinguished by its significant payload capacity. Its three internal weapon bays and eight external hardpoints allow it to carry up to 75,000 pounds of ordnance, including conventional bombs such as Mk 82 and Mk 84, AGM-86B, and AGM-69 cruise missiles, as well as nuclear payloads like the B-61 or B-83 bombs. This adaptability makes it a valuable asset for a wide range of high-intensity missions. To enhance survivability, the B-1B features advanced avionics and countermeasure systems. The AN/ALQ-161 electronic warfare suite enables radar jamming, while the APQ-164 multi-mode radar provides high-resolution terrain mapping, terrain-following capability, and weather detection. These systems, along with chaff and infrared decoy dispensers, ensure the bomber can penetrate contested airspace and avoid threats effectively. The B-1 B entered service in 1986 as a nuclear-capable platform and was later adapted in the 1990s for conventional bombing missions. Since then, it has played a critical role in major operations, including Desert Fox in 1998 and campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Its ability to adapt to evolving operational requirements has solidified its importance within U.S. strategic planning. The current deployment to Guam also highlights the evolution of U.S. military presence strategies in the region.

This approach provides operational flexibility while maintaining a credible deterrent. With its strategic location just 1,600 miles from Taiwan and 1,800 miles from South Korea, Guam serves as a vital hub for projecting power in a region marked by increasing tensions. These Bomber Task Force missions extend beyond deterrence. They also serve as a proving ground for crew endurance and readiness. With flight durations often exceeding 24 hours and sometimes approaching 30, such missions test operational capabilities and demonstrate the Air Force's ability to sustain operations across diverse and distant environments. In summary, the deployment of B-1B bombers to Guam is part of a broader strategy aimed at reinforcing alliances and addressing security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. More than a demonstration of military strength, this mission reflects a measured approach to projecting power, reassuring regional partners, and deterring potential adversaries. As the Task Force mission continues, it underscores the United States' commitment to upholding stability and the international rules-based order in this strategically significant region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/b-1b-lancers-deployed-to-guam-a-strategic-reinforcement-for-indo-pacific	2025-01-22T00:10:37-08:00	
Kalashnikov and Russia to Soon Present New KUB-2-E Loitering Munition	At the upcoming IDEX 2025 defense exhibition, scheduled from February 17 to 21 in Abu Dhabi, the Kalashnikov Group will unveil its latest innovation in loitering munition technology, the KUB-2-E, a joint development by the Kalashnikov Group and the Izhevsk Unmanned Systems Research and Production Association (NPO 'IzBS'). As always, Army Recognition will be on-site to cover the event, and more details will be available in the coming weeks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The small-class KUB-2-E system is designed to target enemy infantry, including individual soldiers, as well as unarmored military vehicles. (Picture source: Kalashnikov) This new generation of small and medium-sized loitering munitions is designed to enhance modern military capabilities, marking a significant milestone in Russian unmanned defense technology. The emergence of drones in the conflict in Ukraine has marked a major turning point in the conduct of modern military operations. From the outset of the Russian invasion in 2022, Ukraine quickly integrated reconnaissance and attack drones, such as the Turkish Bayraktar TB2, to carry out precision strikes against strategic Russian targets, including bridges, armored vehicles, and command facilities. The use of drones, including loitering munition systems, has helped overcome certain limitations related to manpower shortages or equipment while providing greater flexibility to conduct asymmetric attacks. On the other hand, Russia has also intensified the use of drones, particularly for kamikaze strikes or intelligence-gathering missions. These technologies have changed the nature of combat by making operations more fluid and responsive, but they have also redefined warfare strategies, where speed, precision, and the ability to strike from a distance have become key elements. The small-class KUB-2-E system is designed to target enemy infantry, including individual soldiers, as well as unarmored military vehicles. It is therefore ideal for precise strikes against lighter, more vulnerable targets on the battlefield. Meanwhile, the medium-class KUB-2-E broadens the scope by allowing strikes against a wider range of targets, such as enemy personnel, launch positions for unmanned aerial systems, helicopter landing zones, and both unarmored and lightly armored military vehicles. Both versions of the KUB-2-E loitering munitions are equipped with advanced electro-optical systems, allowing operators to guide the munitions with precision toward their targets, even if those targets change positions during the operation. Weighing over 10 kg, these munitions can operate in various challenging conditions, such as day and night operations, complex weather scenarios, smoke, and dust. They can also operate in wind speeds of up to 15 m/s and in temperature ranges from -40°C to +50°C. Moreover, these systems resist passive and active jamming tactics that may occur in a battlefield environment. Developed as an initiative by the Kalashnikov Group, the KUB-2-E complexes offer significant advancements in loitering munition technology, providing armed forces with the ability to conduct more flexible and effective strikes under diverse battlefield conditions. With IDEX 2025 fast approaching, the presentation of the KUB-2-E system at the event will highlight the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern warfare and their potential to redefine the dynamics of combat engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/kalashnikov-and-russia-to-soon-present-new-kub-2-e-loitering-munition	2025-01-21T23:59:01-08:00	
Flash News: China Develops Secret Hypersonic Air-to-Air Missile Posing New Threat to US B-21 Stealth Bomber	China has officially confirmed the development of a highly advanced hypersonic air-to-air missile, marking a significant milestone in aerospace and defense technologies. This announcement was made public on January 19, 2025, via the 'South China Morning Post', a newspaper based in Hong Kong, after extensive testing, including extreme heat resistance trials designed to meet the stringent requirements of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). The development of this missile poses a serious challenge to existing air defense systems. It could alter the dynamics of air superiority, particularly against high-tech aircraft like the U.S. B-21 Raider stealth bomber, which is currently undergoing flight testing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Conceptual image of a cutting-edge hypersonic air-to-air missile, revolutionizing long-range aerial combat. (Picture source: China CCTV) The confirmation of the missile's existence was made through a paper published by Chinese scientists, revealing the sophisticated testing procedures employed, including the use of arc-heated wind tunnels. These special tunnels are designed to simulate the extreme conditions encountered by hypersonic vehicles, with temperatures reaching thousands of degrees Celsius—well beyond what conventional missiles experience. The heat-resistant tests are part of China’s effort to overcome one of the primary challenges of hypersonic flight: aerodynamic heating. At speeds greater than Mach 5, hypersonic missiles encounter intense friction with the atmosphere, which can cause temperatures to soar and potentially damage the missile’s structural integrity or disrupt its internal electronics. To ensure the missile’s reliability, China has conducted extensive trials, including those in high-cost wind tunnels typically used for space missions like simulating Mars landings. Hypersonic air-to-air missiles are capable of traveling at speeds that exceed Mach 5, and as such, they present entirely new challenges and opportunities in air combat. Unlike traditional air-to-air missiles, which generally operate within a range of several hundred kilometers, hypersonic variants could strike targets as far as 1,000 km away or more, significantly extending the operational reach of platforms like China’s J-16 fighter. This increased range is not just a matter of distance, but also a matter of speed—hypersonic missiles can cover that ground much more quickly than their subsonic counterparts. With less time for an adversary to react, and an incredibly fast trajectory that evades interception, these missiles present a new type of threat for modern air forces. Conventional air-to-air missiles require complex guidance systems and long engagement times, while hypersonic missiles, due to their speed, can drastically shorten the time from launch to target impact, leaving little opportunity for escape. The introduction of this weapon has serious implications for global air combat strategies, especially for the U.S. military and its allies. The U.S. B-21 Raider new stealth bomber, with its stealth capabilities and long-range strike capabilities, represents the cutting edge of American air power, but the threat of hypersonic weapons could force a reconsideration of how such aircraft are deployed in contested airspace. The B-21 was designed with the assumption that adversaries would rely on traditional anti-air threats, such as surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets. The hypersonic missile, however, could engage even the most advanced stealth bombers at ranges far beyond the capabilities of conventional interception systems, making them vulnerable in ways previously unimagined. While China's hypersonic air-to-air missile represents a new phase in military aerospace development, it is not alone in this endeavor. Other nations have also made significant strides in hypersonic and supersonic missile technology, some of which include air-to-air capabilities. The United States, for example, is actively working on a range of hypersonic missile systems through its various programs such as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) and the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). These systems, while primarily intended for surface-to-air and air-to-ground applications, are indicative of the U.S.'s interest in keeping pace with China and Russia in the hypersonic race. In fact, the U.S. has been focusing efforts on deploying hypersonic missiles in various configurations, including for air-to-air engagements, albeit with a somewhat longer timeline for deployment than China. Russia, too, has demonstrated significant progress in hypersonic technology with its Kinzhal missile, which, while primarily designed for air-to-ground strikes, is expected to serve as the basis for further developments in air-to-air variants. The Kinzhal is launched from a MiG-31 fighter jet and has already been used in combat, highlighting its potential in real-world scenarios. However, the focus for both the U.S. and Russia has largely been on using hypersonic systems for long-range strike missions rather than air-to-air combat, which is a niche that China appears to be pioneering. The development of air-to-air supersonic and hypersonic missiles represents a new frontier in aerial warfare. These weapons offer far greater ranges and speeds than traditional air-to-air missiles, which are typically limited by their reliance on radar guidance and the necessity of in-flight updates from the launching platform. A hypersonic air-to-air missile, due to its sheer speed, could engage targets with little to no warning and without relying on extensive data links to ensure its accuracy. This dramatically changes the nature of air combat, as enemy aircraft—especially slower-moving tankers, bombers, and early warning platforms—will have limited options for evasion. The strategic implications of this technology are profound. Air forces must now rethink their defense strategies in the face of such advanced missile technology. Countries with significant air forces, particularly the United States, will have to develop countermeasures capable of defeating or mitigating the effects of hypersonic missiles. This could involve developing better detection systems, faster interception capabilities, and more advanced electronic warfare tactics to thwart these high-speed threats. The challenge is not only technological but also economic. Hypersonic systems, due to their complex engineering and high operating costs (such as the expense of running advanced wind tunnels), represent a significant investment. For now, only a handful of nations, including China, the U.S., and Russia, are investing heavily in this cutting-edge technology. However, as the missile race intensifies, other nations may also seek to develop their own variants, potentially changing the future balance of air superiority. In conclusion, the Chinese hypersonic air-to-air missile marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of modern warfare, setting a new standard for the speed, range, and lethality of air-launched weapons. While other nations, including the U.S. and Russia, are working on their own hypersonic and supersonic missile technologies, China’s advancements in this area could lead to a shift in the tactical and strategic dimensions of aerial combat. The development of such weapons challenges not only current defense systems but also long-held assumptions about the effectiveness of traditional air-to-air missile engagements. As the world watches this technological race unfold, the implications for future air combat are both revolutionary and uncertain.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-china-develops-secret-hypersonic-air-to-air-missile-posing-new-threat-to-us-b-21-stealth-bomber	2025-01-21T09:13:15-08:00

What Happened to Russia’s Destroyer Lider and Its S-500 Missile Defense Plan?	Russia’s ambitious Project 23560 destroyer Lider was envisioned as a next-generation warship that could replace multiple classes of vessels in the Russian Navy. This advanced platform was designed to carry a naval version of the S-500 Prometey air defense system, positioning it as a formidable counter to the U.S. Navy’s Aegis missile defense system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A model of the Russian Navy's Project 23560 destroyer. (Picture source: Navy Recognition) Military expert Sergey Marzhetsky highlighted that the destroyer Lider, with its full displacement of 19,000 tons, was uniquely suited to accommodate the massive S-500 interceptors, something smaller ships like the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates could not achieve without compromising their mission capabilities. The S-500 system offered unprecedented capabilities in air and missile defense, including the ability to engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 600 kilometers and detect threats at a distance of 800 kilometers. With a maximum engagement altitude of 200 kilometers and the capacity to neutralize targets traveling at speeds up to 7 kilometers per second, the S-500 promised to counter advanced threats such as the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, an early-warning aircraft capable of detecting cruise missiles from a distance of 258 kilometers. This system could have given the destroyer Lider a critical edge in naval warfare by extending its defensive reach far beyond that of the U.S. Navy’s Aegis system, which relies on SM-3 Block IB missiles with a range of 700 kilometers and a speed of 3 kilometers per second. The Aegis system, a cornerstone of U.S. naval defense, is an advanced, multi-layered combat system designed to detect, track, and intercept a wide array of threats, including ballistic missiles, aircraft, and surface targets. Central to its effectiveness is the AN/SPY-1 radar, a powerful, phased-array system that provides continuous 360-degree surveillance and fire control. This radar works in tandem with the Standard Missile family, particularly the SM-3 and SM-6 variants, to deliver precise and effective missile interceptions. Deployed across a fleet of over 70 ships worldwide, including U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, as well as allied vessels, the Aegis system is renowned for its integration capabilities, allowing ships to work as part of a larger missile defense network. Despite its promise, the Project Lider was halted due to a combination of financial, technical, and strategic challenges. Russia’s economic constraints made it difficult to allocate the significant funding required for such an advanced and massive destroyer. Technological hurdles in adapting the land-based S-500 system for naval use, particularly integrating the complex radar and launcher systems, further complicated the project. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy’s focus shifted toward smaller, more versatile ships like the Project 22350 frigates and Karakurt-class corvettes, which were more practical given budgetary limitations and immediate operational needs.

However, this collaboration raises sensitive questions, particularly concerning nuclear issues. While focused on conventional equipment, the partnership could be perceived as a strategic threat by international powers such as the United States and Israel, who closely monitor Iran’s nuclear activities. Pakistan, in turn, may face diplomatic or economic pressures if the cooperation conflicts with its international commitments or the expectations of its traditional allies. This alliance could also significantly impact regional dynamics, particularly with India, which may view the growing Iran-Pakistan partnership as a security challenge, especially in the context of Kashmir. Economically, the partnership has the potential to boost the defense industries of both countries but also risks exposing Pakistan to international sanctions. How this cooperation develops will be pivotal in shaping strategic balances in the Middle East and South Asia.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/iran-and-pakistan-consider-strategic-collaboration-in-military-equipment-production	2025-01-21T02:09:06-08:00	
Detailed List of US Military Equipment Trump Seeks to Recover from Afghanistan	According to information published by VOA on January 20, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reignited the debate over the consequences of the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal by calling for the return of military equipment left behind and now controlled by the Taliban. Speaking at a rally in Washington on January 19, Trump criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the withdrawal and vowed to make future financial assistance to Afghanistan contingent upon the retrieval of the lost arsenal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taliban fighters showcase captured U.S. military, highlighting the billions of dollars worth of advanced weaponry left behind after the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. (Picture source: Afghan MoD) A 2022 report by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) revealed the scale of military resources abandoned in Afghanistan. Approximately $7 billion worth of equipment—originally supplied to the now-defunct Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF)—was left behind during the withdrawal. Much of this advanced hardware was subsequently seized by the Taliban, who showcased the captured arsenal during 'victory parades' and in propaganda materials. The abandoned equipment included military aircraft, armored vehicles, light tactical vehicles, small arms, munitions, and specialized communications equipment. Critics have argued that this weaponry has bolstered the Taliban’s combat capabilities, while others worry that some of the technology may find its way to adversarial states or non-state actors. Key U.S. Military Equipment Seized by the Taliban The M1117 ASV is a four-wheeled armored vehicle designed for convoy protection, reconnaissance, and patrolling. It is equipped with advanced armor to resist small arms fire, grenades, and IED attacks. The vehicle’s speed and maneuverability in both urban and rural environments make it a versatile addition to any military force. The Taliban’s possession of this vehicle enhances their ability to conduct secure and mobile ground operations. The M113 APC is a tracked vehicle used for transporting troops and supplies while offering protection against small arms fire and artillery fragments. Its modular design allows it to be adapted for a variety of roles, including command posts and medical evacuation. In the hands of the Taliban, the M113 significantly boosts their ability to transport forces and supplies in safety. The UH-60A Black Hawk is a utility helicopter used for troop transport, medical evacuation, and close support missions. It is a cornerstone of modern military operations due to its reliability, survivability, and advanced avionics. The Taliban’s possession of these helicopters raises concerns about their ability to project power over greater distances, though their operational readiness remains questionable due to the need for trained pilots and maintenance crews. The MD 530F is a light, agile helicopter designed for reconnaissance and light attack roles. Its speed and maneuverability are particularly useful in urban or mountainous combat scenarios. The Taliban’s use of these helicopters could enhance their surveillance and ground support capabilities. The ScanEagle is a small, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Its capture gives the Taliban the potential to monitor enemy activity and plan operations with advanced situational awareness. There is also concern about the possibility of reverse-engineering this technology for use or sale to other groups. The M1151 and M1152 are variants of the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), or Humvee, known for their adaptability and durability. The M1151 is armored for troop transport, while the M1152 is designed for cargo. Thousands of these vehicles were left behind, providing the Taliban with substantial mobility and logistical support for operations. The MaxxPro MRAP is a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle designed to protect occupants from IED blasts and small-arms fire. Its advanced V-shaped hull deflects explosions, making it an invaluable asset for safe travel in hostile environments. The Taliban’s acquisition of these vehicles enhances their survivability in asymmetric warfare. Light and medium tactical vehicles such as the Ford Ranger and Navistar 7000 series were used extensively by U.S. and Afghan forces for logistical support. Their reliability and mobility enable the Taliban to efficiently transport troops, supplies, and equipment across Afghanistan’s challenging terrain. The Taliban’s possession of U.S. military equipment poses significant risks to both regional and global security. These assets have increased their operational capabilities, allowing them to solidify control over Afghanistan and project power more effectively. The advanced equipment could also be used to intimidate neighboring countries or be sold to adversarial nations, further destabilizing the region. Experts warn that some of the captured technology, including UAVs and communications equipment, may be shared with state actors like China or Russia, who could study and reverse-engineer the systems to counter U.S. military technology. There is also the concern that militant groups outside Afghanistan could gain access to this weaponry, potentially fueling terrorism worldwide. Trump’s remarks have added a new dimension to the debate about the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Critics of the Biden administration view the loss of military equipment as a blunder that undermines U.S. credibility and strengthens adversaries. Trump’s call to withhold financial aid until the equipment is returned highlights his 'America First' policy stance. The loss of $7 billion worth of U.S. military equipment to the Taliban remains a stark reminder of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/detailed-list-of-us-military-equipment-trump-seeks-to-recover-from-afghanistan	2025-01-21T01:50:00-08:00

(Picture source: Moog) The Supacat HMT and Dingo 3 have also been proposed for the British Army’s Land Mobility Programme (LMP). This program aims to streamline the fleet by reducing the number of vehicle chassis types to 15 by 2030. The program focuses on consolidating more than ten types of protected patrol and light utility vehicles into three 'Common Based Platforms,' replacing aging systems like the Land Rover and Pinzgauer. This modernization effort is intended to simplify the fleet while supporting multiple roles with fewer, more versatile platforms. The Supacat All Terrain Mobility Platform (ATMP) has been identified as a low-risk option for the LMP due to its existing service history, with nearly 1,000 units in operation since 1988. The ATMP supports 4x4 and 6x6 configurations, offers a payload capacity of 4,000 kg, and has a gross vehicle weight of 12,000 kg. It measures 7.1 meters in length, has a cruising range of 800 km, and can achieve a top speed of 120 km/h. The vehicle includes an armored cabin with ballistic and blast protection for four crew members and can be adapted for roles such as mobile fire support and logistics transport. The Dingo 3, developed by KNDS Deutschland, is based on a Unimog chassis with a V-hull design to improve resistance to mines and improvised explosive devices. It is available in 4x4 and 6x6 configurations, with the latter offering increased payload capacity and space for up to 12 crew members plus equipment. The vehicle is powered by a six-cylinder turbo diesel engine, paired with automatic transmission and a central tire inflation system. The Dingo 3’s modular structure allows for the integration of various weapon systems, including Starstreak missile canisters and the RIwP turret. Already used for the Stryker M-SHORAD, the Reconfigurable Integrated-Weapons Platform (RIwP) is a modular turret system designed to integrate various weapon systems and sensors to counter multiple threats, including drones and helicopters. It was demonstrated at the conference equipped with Thales’ High-Velocity Missile (HVM), also known as Starstreak, a Northrop Grumman M230 LF 30×113 mm Bushmaster cannon, and a 7.62 mm machine gun. Additional capabilities include the integration of Lightweight Multi-role Missiles (LMM) and an L3 MX-series electro-optical/infrared sight. Moog’s stabilization technology reduces the impact of shocks and vibrations during operations over rough terrain, and the turret’s modular design enables the integration of new weapons and sensors without requiring significant redesign. The Supacat HMT benefits from a proven service history with nearly 1,000 units in operation since 1988, establishing it as a reliable and low-risk choice to modernize the British Army's fleet of vehicles, thanks to its modular design. (Picture source: Moog) The Starstreak missile, a key feature of the RIwP's configuration showcased at the conference, has been effectively used in Ukraine for aerial and armored targets. It employs three tungsten dart submunitions guided by laser beams, with a range of 7 kilometers and speeds exceeding Mach 3. This missile system is designed to counter low-flying aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial systems. It is manufactured by Thales Air Defence and can be shoulder-fired or mounted on platforms for deployment. The addition of XM1211 proximity-fuzed ammunition for the M230 LF cannon could enhance the RIwP’s effectiveness against smaller and more maneuverable drone targets as part of the British Army’s Ground-Based Air Defence (GBAD) program. The British Army’s GBAD program is part of a broader modernization effort to address evolving aerial threats. Within this framework, the Land GBAD initiative focuses on SHORAD, Medium-Range Air Defence (MRAD), and Counter-Small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (C-sUAS), as well as partly replacing the Stormer HVMs send to Ukraine. The program includes the Sky Sabre system, which has replaced the Rapier system. Sky Sabre incorporates the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM), Saab's Giraffe Agile Multi-Beam radar, and Rafael's Modular Integrated C4I Air &amp; Missile Defense System (MIC4AD), enabling beyond-visual-range engagements. The program also prioritizes interoperability with NATO allies and a strong command and control architecture to counter diverse threats effectively. The Supacat HMT and the Dingo 3 each offer advantages for the Land Mobility Programme (LMP) and the Ground-Based Air Defence (GBAD) initiative when equipped with the RIwP turret, making them serious contenders in their respective categories. The Supacat HMT benefits from a proven service history with nearly 1,000 units in operation since 1988, establishing it as a reliable and low-risk choice to modernize the British Army's fleet of vehicles. Furthermore, its modular design allows for various configurations, including the use of the RIwP for Short-Range Air Defence (SHORAD) applications. The recent introduction of the Armoured Closed Cab (ACC) variant aligns with the LMP's objective to streamline the British Army's vehicle fleet by reducing the number of core platforms, thereby simplifying logistics and maintenance. The Dingo 3, on the other hand, offers exceptional crew protection and operational versatility, making it a strong contender for roles requiring high survivability under the LMP. Its V-hull design and Unimog chassis provide superior mine and IED resistance, critical for modern combat scenarios. The modular nature of the Dingo 3 supports various weapon systems, including the Starstreak missile and RIwP, making it highly adaptable for GBAD applications. The 6x6 variant’s larger payload capacity and ability to transport up to 12 crew members provide significant advantages for multi-role operations. While both platforms bring unique strengths, the Dingo 3’s heavier protection and the Supacat HMT’s established operational track record position them as complementary options, potentially serving different but critical needs within the British Army’s modernization initiatives. The Dingo 3, developed by KNDS Deutschland, is based on a Unimog chassis with a V-hull design to improve resistance to mines and is available in 4x4 and 6x6 configurations, with the latter offering increased payload capacity and space for up to 12 crew members plus equipment.

Inspired by the renowned Israeli missile defense system, this initiative, highlighted in the Republican Party's electoral platform, aims to create a 'force field' around the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launcher was placed and prepared to launch interceptors to counter ballistic missile threats at an undisclosed location in CENTCOM area of responsibility (Picture source: US DoD) Trump emphasized the project's national character, pledging that it would be developed and constructed within the United States. This plan raises critical questions regarding technical details, costs, and the technologies that might be incorporated. While the possibility of a system distinct from Israel's Iron Dome is not excluded, the proposal aligns with the goal of enhancing technological self-reliance and fostering innovation in the U.S. defense industry. The Israeli Iron Dome, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. financial support, is globally recognized for its short-range missile defense capabilities. The mobile, all-weather system intercepts and neutralizes enemy projectiles, including rockets, artillery shells, and mortars. Equipped with an EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptor missiles, it calculates threat trajectories in real time and engages only those likely to cause harm. With interception rates frequently exceeding 90%, the system has demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting civilian populations during multiple conflicts. However, the Israeli Iron Dome has limitations. While highly effective against short-range threats, it offers only partial protection against long-range missiles, advanced drones, or hypersonic weapons. As a result, it is often supplemented by other systems, such as David's Sling and Arrow, to provide layered defense. Trump’s proposed project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a system capable of addressing a broader range of threats, including emerging weapon technologies. This endeavor would require substantial investments to establish new production facilities and integrate advanced technologies. Additional challenges include ensuring compatibility with existing U.S. systems, such as the Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis, which form the backbone of the nation’s missile defense architecture. The future U.S. 'Iron Dome' could leverage existing defense systems to create a comprehensive, multi-layered network capable of countering diverse threats. The Patriot PAC-3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement) is a key component of U.S. air defense, designed to counter evolving threats like tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and low-orbit satellites. Equipped with an upgraded solid-fuel rocket motor, improved aerodynamic controls, and advanced guidance systems, this hit-to-kill missile ensures total target destruction. Operating at speeds of Mach 5, it has a range of 35 kilometers and an interception altitude of 15 kilometers. Each launcher, mounted on a mobile platform, carries up to 16 missiles, enabling rapid and effective responses to complex threats, including those employing electronic countermeasures. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system is specifically designed to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, both within (endoatmospheric) and outside (exoatmospheric) the atmosphere. Highly mobile and transportable, the system uses hit-to-kill technology, neutralizing threats with kinetic energy to minimize risks associated with weapons of mass destruction. A single THAAD battery includes up to nine mobile launchers, each carrying eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 X-band radar with a detection range of 1,000 kilometers, and command-and-control vehicles. THAAD operates seamlessly alongside systems like the Patriot and Aegis, ensuring robust protection for military forces, strategic infrastructure, and civilian populations. The Aegis combat system, at the core of Aegis-equipped destroyers, provides unparalleled air defense and ballistic missile interception capabilities. Paired with the AN/SPY-1D phased-array radar, it can detect and track multiple aerial threats over 300 kilometers. Aegis-equipped destroyers are armed with Standard Missiles (SM), including SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6, capable of intercepting threats ranging from aircraft to medium-range ballistic missiles. Incorporating the Aegis system into the proposed U.S. Iron Dome could offer a formidable shield for critical locations and infrastructure. The U.S. is also heavily investing in high-powered lasers and directed energy weapons to counter drones and missiles. These technologies could complement the system by providing cost-effective and rapid solutions for neutralizing specific threats. Advanced radars, such as the Sentinel A4, used for aerial threat detection and surveillance, could play an integral role in the proposed Iron Dome. These radars are critical for real-time detection, tracking, and engagement of threats, ensuring optimal system performance. Integrating the Iron Dome with the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) could further enhance coordination between different defense platforms. Through real-time data sharing, this would improve interception speed and accuracy. The proposed Iron Dome could serve as a catalyst for the U.S. defense industry, promoting strategic independence and reinforcing the country’s position on the global stage. However, its success will depend on the ability to develop a system that is efficient, adaptable, and economically sustainable.

Analysis: How Russia’s Innovative Submarine Coating Reduces Detection Risks	The Russian Ministry of Defense initiated a significant modernization program in 2022 to upgrade the hydroacoustic coatings of its nuclear-powered submarines. This effort aims to improve the stealth capabilities of these vessels, enabling them to evade detection more effectively. The new coating reduces the acoustic signature of the submarines by suppressing noises generated by the vessels and external sonar signals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of Project 677 Lada submarines Vologda and Yaroslavl. (Picture source: bmpd) The hydroacoustic coating is made up of specialized plates, each weighing up to 80 kilograms. These plates are composed of multiple pressed layers of advanced rubber materials and feature unique channels designed for acoustic performance. They are affixed to the submarine's lightweight hull using an adhesive with a classified composition. Once attached, the plates are coated with paint to ensure durability and optimal performance. Each nuclear-powered submarine requires approximately 10,000 of these plates, meticulously installed to create an effective barrier against enemy sonar detection. The stringent testing process for the new hydroacoustic coating was recently showcased on the Russian television program Voennaya Priyomka (Military Acceptance) aired on the Zvezda channel. The tests, conducted at the Sevmash shipyard—Russia’s premier submarine manufacturing facility—demonstrated the robustness of the adhesive bonding the plates to the hull. The testing procedure begins with a drill featuring a cup-shaped bit, which is lubricated with soapy water and used to bore into the rubber coating. A metal corkscrew is then inserted into the resulting hole and pulled out using a specialized device that measures the force required to dislodge it. Results show that the adhesive can withstand a force of over 4.5 kN (kilonewtons), confirming its exceptional strength. To ensure minimal impact on the coating’s acoustic properties, the hole is sealed with a fast-curing sealant, rendering it virtually undetectable. This rigorous process is applied to every tenth plate, meaning approximately 1,000 plates are tested before a submarine undergoes state trials. The upgraded hydroacoustic coating is expected to enhance the operational effectiveness of Russia’s nuclear submarine fleet. By reducing detectability, these submarines will have a greater edge in strategic missions, such as patrolling and covert operations, particularly in contested waters. In contrast, the United States has long utilized lightweight synthetic polymer tiles on its Virginia-class and Ohio-class submarines. These tiles are engineered to absorb sonar waves effectively while maintaining a reduced thickness to minimize weight and hydrodynamic drag. The U.S. approach integrates these coatings with other noise-reduction technologies, such as pump-jet propulsion systems, to create a multi-layered stealth system. However, issues with long-term adhesive durability have been reported, which may compromise performance over extended periods. China has focused its efforts on developing composite rubber and polymer coatings for its Type 093B Shang-class submarines. These coatings aim to absorb a broad range of sonar frequencies, enhancing stealth in the Indo-Pacific region. Recent reports suggest that China is transitioning to modular panels for easier maintenance, but the overall robustness and longevity of these systems appear to lag behind those of Russian and American technologies. Germany, representing NATO’s expertise in stealth coatings, employs advanced rubberized materials on its Type 212 and Type 214 diesel-electric submarines. These coatings are optimized for smaller, non-nuclear platforms and are used in conjunction with Air-Independent Propulsion systems to achieve near-silent operation. While highly effective for their intended platforms, these coatings are less scalable to the larger nuclear submarines operated by Russia and the U.S.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/analysis-how-russias-innovative-submarine-coating-reduces-detection-risks	2025-01-20T00:47:42-08:00

Sweden Deploys Mechanized Battalion in Latvia Near Russian Border in Historic First for NATO	For the first time since joining NATO, Sweden has deployed a mechanized battalion in Latvia, consisting of Strf 9040 infantry fighting vehicles and Strv 122 tanks. This deployment marks a step in Sweden's international military engagement and highlights its integration into NATO's collective defense framework. On Saturday, January 18, 2025, approximately 600 Swedish soldiers arrived in Riga, accompanied by their military equipment, as part of an operation to strengthen NATO's presence on its eastern flank, near the Russian border. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link These exercises also emphasize the capabilities of the Strf 9040 and Strv 122, equipped with advanced systems like the 40 mm Bofors cannon and the 120 mm Rheinmetall gun, respectively (Picture source: Saab) The deployment of this mechanized battalion, part of the South Scandinavian Armored Regiment, was a pivotal moment for the Swedish Army. This regiment, comprising the 71st and 72nd mechanized battalions, has a total strength of about 1,100 soldiers. For this mission, 48 Strf 9040 vehicles and 12 Strv 122 tanks were transported to the strategic Ādaži base, where units from 14 other NATO member nations are also stationed. Sweden's arsenal includes over 500 Strf 9040s and 120 Strv 122s, underscoring its substantial armored capabilities. This mission is part of NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence initiative, designed to deter any attempts to compromise the territorial integrity of member states. Regular exercises in the Baltic region enhance interoperability among allied forces and test their readiness to respond to potential crises. In Latvia, Swedish soldiers will train intensively alongside allied forces, preparing for complex scenarios and ensuring operational cohesion. These exercises also emphasize the capabilities of the Strf 9040 and Strv 122, equipped with advanced systems like the 40 mm Bofors cannon and the 120 mm Rheinmetall gun. The Strv 122, derived from the German Leopard 2A5, has been adapted to meet Sweden’s specific operational needs. In service since 1997, it features enhanced armor protection against modern threats and the ability to fire precision munitions developed domestically. Powered by a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine, it achieves a top speed of 68 km/h despite its 62-ton weight. The Strf 9040, operational since 1991, is the backbone of Sweden’s mechanized units.

The country’s previous European military engagements, such as its peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, primarily focused on stabilizing conflict zones. In contrast, this deployment in Latvia is a deterrence mission aimed at preventing conflict in a strategically critical yet currently peaceful region. According to Marcus Nilsson, the regiment's communications officer, this mission reflects a fundamental evolution in Sweden's defense approach. Unlike prior missions centered on restoring peace, this deployment emphasizes deterrence and protection. By establishing a credible military presence, Sweden contributes to collective security and ensures stability in a strategically significant region. Sweden's official accession to NATO in March 2024, after more than 200 years of neutrality, was a strategic decision influenced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since joining, Sweden has enhanced its military capabilities and increased its defense budget to meet NATO’s requirements. This deployment in Latvia underscores the growing importance of military cooperation among NATO members. NATO forces’ Baltic commander, Jette Albinus, commended the Swedish contribution, noting the professionalism and capability of its troops. While this mission begins under relatively stable conditions, NATO's future appears uncertain. The inauguration of Donald Trump, who has previously expressed skepticism about NATO's efficacy, may challenge the current balance within the alliance. His administration’s focus on increasing defense spending among NATO members could pose difficulties for some nations, although Sweden has already started boosting its military budget. In this context, operations like the one in Latvia carry significant strategic weight, demonstrating NATO’s relevance in maintaining European stability. By deploying its mechanized battalion, Sweden is not only protecting an allied nation's borders but also solidifying its role within NATO and affirming its military credibility. This first ground operation as a NATO member reflects Sweden’s commitment to addressing contemporary geopolitical challenges and its determination to play a key role in collective security efforts.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/sweden-deploys-mechanized-battalion-in-latvia-near-russian-border-in-historic-first-for-nato	2025-01-20T00:13:46-08:00	
Dutch Defense Budget 2025 Reaches 2% GDP Target as Trump May Demand 5%	The Netherlands achieved a significant milestone in 2024, reaching the NATO requirement of spending 2% of GDP on defense. This decision comes in a global context marked by rising tensions, particularly with the war in Ukraine and China's growing military presence. After several decades of military budget reductions, this increase marks a major shift, illustrating a growing awareness of global threats and the need to strengthen the Netherlands' military posture. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. (Picture source: Dutch MoD) Since the end of the Cold War, Dutch defense spending has been heavily influenced by the idea of the 'peace dividend.' In 2013, defense spending dropped to just 1% of GDP, a trend that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis when austerity measures led to significant cuts in the military budget. However, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and, more recently, the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, highlighted Europe's vulnerability to rising military threats. These events accelerated a realignment of priorities, progressively strengthening the Netherlands' defense capabilities to respond to new geopolitical realities. In response, the Dutch government decided to increase its military spending. In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. This increase is the result of adopting a more proactive defense policy aimed at modernizing the armed forces and strengthening the country's deterrence and defense capabilities. This effort is supported by the recent adoption of the Defense Financial Obligations Act, which ensures the long-term maintenance of this goal. The Netherlands' increase in defense spending aligns with a broader global trend. NATO as a whole has seen rising contributions from its members, with countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Eastern European members significantly increasing their military budgets. Notably, the United States remains by far the largest contributor to NATO, with an estimated defense budget of $28.791 trillion in 2024, representing around 66% of the Alliance's total defense spending. Globally, other major powers such as Russia and China have also increased their military expenditures. Russia's defense spending for 2025 is projected to reach $120 billion, while China's defense spending in 2024 is estimated at $231 billion. These figures illustrate the growing commitment of these nations to strengthen their military capabilities, particularly in cybersecurity, nuclear armaments, and advanced technologies. These developments highlight the growing military competition among major powers and emphasize the need for European countries, including the Netherlands, to maintain a modern and effective defense posture. In this unstable geopolitical context, the Dutch government has implemented a series of initiatives to modernize its armed forces. This includes investments in advanced military equipment, increased training for soldiers, and an increase in the number of military personnel to ensure that the Netherlands' armed forces are ready to respond to any threat. The strengthening of defense capabilities translates into investments in modern weapon systems, including missile defense, cybersecurity, and electronic warfare. These areas are seen as essential in the face of contemporary threats, such as cyberattacks and hybrid warfare. Additionally, the Netherlands is enhancing its cooperation within NATO, actively participating in joint exercises and increasing its contribution to Alliance missions. Despite achieving the 2% target, challenges remain. The Netherlands' defense budget will need to continue growing to meet future military threats. The ongoing increase in military spending, necessary to keep up with evolving threats, is likely to pose significant challenges for the national economy. In particular, balancing defense needs with other budgetary priorities such as healthcare, education, and social services will be crucial. Another challenge for the Netherlands, as for other NATO members, is the need to modernize the armed forces to address new military technologies continually. Adapting to new forms of warfare, such as cyber warfare and autonomous weaponry, will be a key area of investment for the coming years. The 2% of GDP allocated to defense is now considered not a ceiling, but a minimum. Several NATO officials, including the Secretary General of the Alliance, have emphasized that defense spending above this threshold will be necessary to make up for the accumulated gap and prepare for the future. Indeed, the pace of global threats and new geopolitical dynamics necessitate a constant reassessment of defense budgets. The Netherlands' position on this issue is clear: although the 2% target has been met, the government is ready to consider future increases to further strengthen national security and continue playing a significant role within NATO. Additionally, discussions are underway to incorporate this standard into more binding legislation, ensuring the continued increase in military spending in the years to come. The Netherlands has taken an important step by meeting the 2% defense spending target, but this increase is just the beginning. The growing global challenges, new geopolitical threats, and the need to modernize the armed forces mean that the country will need to continue investing heavily in its defense to respond to the evolving global situation effectively. In the face of these challenges, the Netherlands will continue to strengthen its military capabilities and support NATO in its collective missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/dutch-defense-budget-2025-reaches-2-gdp-target-as-trump-may-demand-5	2025-01-20T00:01:15-08:00

Breaking News: Iran's IRGC Navy Reveals Secret Underground Naval Base Housing Dozens of Missile Assault Boats	On January 18, 2025, Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveiled an underground naval missile base at an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf. The base, one of several underground facilities built to house vessels capable of launching long-range missiles and conducting distant warfare, was revealed by IRGC Chief Commander Hossein Salami. During ongoing war games, Salami visited the secret base and highlighted its strategic significance in enhancing Iran’s naval capabilities and deterrence in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from a video broadcast by IRGC-affiliated media showing the newly unveiled underground naval base in the Persian Gulf, housing several missile-equipped assault boats. (Picture source: Iranian state media video footage) This naval underground facility is part of a larger network of 'cities' specifically designed to house and deploy the IRGC (Iran Revolutionary Guard) Navy’s combat vessels. These subterranean complexes are central to Iran's naval defense strategy, allowing the IRGC to quickly mobilize its fleet of missile-equipped assault boats in the region. General Salami, in his speech at the unveiling, emphasized that the base is just one small component of a much larger system of subterranean installations. He asserted that the IRGC Navy operates numerous such bases, all designed to reinforce its operational resilience and readiness against external threats. By hiding these vessels in underground facilities, the IRGC significantly complicates efforts to locate and neutralize its fleet, providing a strategic advantage in the event of regional conflict. The underground base is specifically tailored to house fast-moving, missile-equipped boats, which are a core component of the IRGC Navy's asymmetric warfare strategy. These boats, capable of launching precision-guided missiles, allow the IRGC to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries, particularly the U.S. Navy, which operates in the region. The base also includes vessels equipped for mine-laying, further enhancing the IRGC’s ability to control key maritime chokepoints in the Strait of Hormuz and the broader Persian Gulf. The ability to lay naval mines is a critical element of Iran's strategy to deny access to critical shipping routes, complicating operations for foreign naval forces in the region. The choice to build such a base underground stems from several strategic considerations. First, it offers protection from airstrikes, which is increasingly important as satellite surveillance and precision-guided munitions become more advanced. With many foreign powers, particularly the United States, capable of targeting and destroying surface ships, housing assets in hidden underground facilities helps mitigate this risk. Furthermore, by dispersing its fleet across multiple hidden sites, the IRGC enhances the survivability of its naval forces. This network of subterranean bases ensures that if one or more facilities are attacked, others remain operational, allowing for continuity in defense operations. Another crucial reason behind this underground infrastructure is the IRGC's focus on asymmetric warfare. Unlike traditional naval forces, which rely on large surface ships, Iran uses small, fast-moving missile boats that can strike quickly and retreat before enemy forces can respond. This hit-and-run tactic is central to Iran's approach to naval defense, allowing them to challenge more powerful forces using low-cost, high-impact weapons. The underground bases also make it more difficult for enemies to predict the locations of these vessels, giving the IRGC the element of surprise. The unveiling of this base also underscores Iran’s growing emphasis on maritime defense, especially as tensions in the Persian Gulf continue to rise. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil passes, is a vital geopolitical chokepoint. By deploying missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels, Iran can create a constant threat to any foreign navy operating in the region, potentially disrupting global oil trade. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies persist, these developments serve as a reminder of Iran's commitment to maintaining control over this strategic waterway. Looking forward, General Salami's remarks suggest that the underground base is only a fraction of the IRGC’s broader defense infrastructure. Iran is continuing to build a network of such subterranean complexes, all designed to enhance its naval deterrence capabilities. These bases, hidden from view and designed to withstand airstrikes, play a key role in Iran’s defense strategy. As the IRGC expands its network of underground facilities, it is clear that the regime intends to continue fortifying its naval power while challenging foreign naval dominance in the region. The unveiling of this underground combat vessel base marks a significant milestone in Iran's ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen its IRGC Navy. With missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels strategically housed in these subterranean complexes, Iran is positioning itself to exert greater influence over the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This move further solidifies the IRGC’s asymmetric warfare capabilities, and as the region remains on edge, global powers will be closely watching Iran's growing naval infrastructure for its broader implications on regional security and maritime stability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-irans-irgc-navy-reveals-secret-underground-naval-base-housing-dozens-of-missile-assault-boats	2025-01-18T17:50:50-08:00	
Flash Info: US Navy MH-60R Seahawk Helicopter Shoot Down Aerial Drone in Flight for the First Time	On January 16, 2025, Admiral James Kilby, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, revealed an important milestone for U.S. Navy aviation. During his address at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium near Washington, D.C., Admiral Kilby confirmed that a U.S. Navy MH-60R 'Romeo' Seahawk helicopter deployed to the Red Sea had successfully shot down a drone operated by Houthi militants. This event, first reported by The War Zone, an online platform covering defense, military technology, and security-related topics, marks the first time a U.S. Navy helicopter has engaged and downed an enemy UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in flight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, a multi-role maritime helicopter, played a pivotal role in the first-ever shootdown of an aerial drone in flight over the Red Sea, marking a significant milestone in counter-drone operations. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The specific type of aerial drone targeted and the exact method used by the U.S. Navy Mh-60R Seahawk naval helicopter to neutralize the UAV remain undisclosed. However, Admiral Kilby mentioned that the helicopter crew had employed 'a little bit of an unconventional system' to carry out the operation. This statement hints at the use of non-traditional or advanced technologies to deal with the increasingly common threat posed by drones in maritime and conflict zones. The MH-60R Seahawk is a versatile and multi-role maritime helicopter used extensively by the U.S. Navy. Primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), and reconnaissance missions, the MH-60R is equipped with a suite of advanced sensors and armaments, making it well-suited for conventional and unconventional operations. Its core capabilities include detecting and tracking submarines, conducting surface strikes against maritime targets, and providing real-time intelligence and surveillance for fleet operations. The Seahawk is fitted with the state-of-the-art APS-153 radar system, a multi-mode radar capable of detecting both surface and airborne threats, which would have been crucial in identifying and tracking the Houthi drone. Additionally, the helicopter is equipped with advanced sonar and communications systems that allow for precise coordination with other naval assets. Regarding armament, the MH-60R is armed with a range of precision-guided weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Mk 50 torpedoes, and various machine guns.

The versatility of the MH-60R, coupled with its powerful sensors and armament, positions it as an essential tool in modern naval warfare, capable of addressing a broad range of threats from conventional naval targets to emerging asymmetrical threats like drones. In this case, it can be speculated that the U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, with its advanced radar and sensor systems, likely played a key role in detecting the Houthi drone. However, downing a drone in flight, especially in a maritime environment, is far from simple. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are often small, agile, and capable of flying at low altitudes, which makes them challenging to detect and track. Given the operational challenges in the Red Sea, including potential interference from variable weather conditions, electromagnetic noise from the sea, and the unpredictable flight patterns of drones, the engagement would have required precise coordination and possibly unconventional methods to overcome these obstacles. The success of this operation underscores the Seahawk's advanced detection and tracking capabilities, but the exact nature of how the drone was engaged remains speculative at this stage. The growing use of drones in the Red Sea region, particularly by Houthi rebels, has added another layer of complexity to maritime security operations. The Houthis have increasingly deployed drones in their ongoing conflict with Saudi-led coalition forces, targeting both military assets and civilian shipping. Drones are often used to strike critical infrastructure, including oil tankers and naval vessels, raising concerns over the safety of international shipping routes. In this context, the successful downing of a drone by a U.S. Navy Seahawk is more than just a tactical victory—it represents a significant step in the evolving counter-drone capabilities of naval forces. The Red Sea's importance as a vital global trade route means that ensuring its security is of paramount concern for international naval forces. With the proliferation of UAV technology, particularly in conflict zones, the ability to intercept and neutralize these threats is becoming an essential capability for modern naval operations. The engagement of the drone by the U.S. Navy's MH-60R Seahawk is a noteworthy achievement, signaling the increasing importance of counter-drone capabilities within naval forces. As Admiral Kilby’s comments highlight, the use of 'unconventional systems' to take out the UAV underscores the innovative approaches needed to address the growing threat of drones in maritime operations. This successful mission also reinforces the idea that the battlefield is evolving—naval forces are no longer just focused on traditional threats like surface combatants and submarines but must also contend with the growing menace of UAVs. As demonstrated in this historic operation, the U.S. Navy’s ability to adapt to these new challenges will be crucial for maintaining maritime security in the Red Sea and beyond. As drone technology continues to evolve, it is likely that naval forces will increasingly rely on both conventional and unconventional means to detect, track, and neutralize these threats. The integration of advanced sensors, electronic warfare, and other countermeasures will shape the future of naval operations in increasingly complex and contested environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-info-us-navy-mh-60r-seahawk-helicopter-shoot-down-aerial-drone-in-flight-for-the-first-time	2025-01-18T03:10:41-08:00

The Nag missile program began in 1988 under India’s Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). Designed to address the need for a domestically-produced anti-tank guided missile, the Nag was initially tested in 1990. Development was delayed due to challenges with the missile’s imaging infrared (IIR) guidance system, which struggled to distinguish targets under high-temperature conditions. These issues were resolved through modifications and further testing, culminating in the missile’s clearance for production in 2019. The Nag family includes several variants, each tailored to specific operational requirements. The Nag Mk 1, the original land-based variant of the system, features a fire-and-forget guidance system with a maximum range of 4 kilometers. It employs an IIR seeker and a tandem high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead, designed to engage modern armored threats, including those with explosive reactive armor (ERA). Mounted on the NAMICA platform, the Mk 1 was showcased during the 2023 Republic Day parade, signaling its readiness for deployment. The missile system has undergone numerous tests since its initial development to improve reliability and performance. The Nag Mk 2 builds upon the Mk 1 with several enhancements. It features retractable wings for improved compactness and increased range. Propulsion technology adapted from the Man-Portable Anti-Tank Guided Missile (MPATGM) has been incorporated to enhance performance. The Mk 2 retains the IIR seeker and tandem HEAT warhead of the Mk 1 but offers improved precision and operational capabilities. Its fire-and-forget technology allows for autonomous targeting and engagement, reducing operator involvement during missions. The NAMICA version-2, evaluated alongside the Nag Mk 2, serves as the launch platform for the missile. Based on the BMP-2 Sarath infantry fighting vehicle (which could be soon replaced by the American Stryker), NAMICA version-2 has been modified to include a missile storage system capable of carrying 12 missiles, with eight in a ready-to-fire configuration. The platform retains its amphibious capabilities and incorporates advanced electro-optical systems for target acquisition. These features, combined with its compact design, improve its battlefield deployment flexibility. The NAMICA version-2 is now prepared for operational use as part of the Nag Mk 2 weapon system.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/indian-army-to-receive-locally-made-nag-mk2-anti-tank-missile-to-improve-defense-against-armored-vehicles	2025-01-17T06:23:21-08:00

Could the Canadian Roshel Senator 4x4 replace Chile’s outdated fleet of Piranha 6x6 armored vehicles?	On January 15, 2025, Infodefensa reported that the Chilean Army is considering purchasing Senator 4x4 armored vehicles from the Canadian manufacturer Roshel Inc. as part of a revised approach to the Cromo project. Initiated in 2018 by the Army Projects and Research Directorate (Dipride), the Cromo project aimed to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Over 1,400 Roshel Senator 4x4 armored vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation, and Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility in Shelby Township, Michigan. (Picture source: Roshel) The original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles for the Mechanized Battalion of the 1st Buin Infantry Regiment, with a budget allocation of $111.8 million. Due to delays and complications, the tender process was declared void in April 2024, prompting an expansion of the project’s scope to include 4x4 and 6x6 platforms. The initial tender specified several requirements, including vehicles capable of carrying ten personnel, meeting NATO STANAG 4569 Level 3 standards for ballistic and mine protection, and integrating remote weapon stations for NATO-classified armaments. These vehicles were intended for use in non-war military operations, disaster response, and training in Peldehue, located north of Santiago. However, financial limitations and challenges integrating L3Harris telecommunications systems led to the rejection of all submitted bids. Following the cancellation of the tender, the Chilean Army issued a request for information (RFI) to manufacturers, expanding its interest to 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 configurations. Companies responding to the RFI include BMC and Otokar from Turkey, Excalibur Army from the Czech Republic, Iveco from Italy, Patria Group from Finland, and General Dynamics Land Systems. The RFI outlined specifications such as STANAG 4569 Level 2/2A/2B protection, operational functionality in extreme conditions at altitudes above 4,500 meters, and temperature ranges from -20°C to 45°C. The vehicles are also expected to demonstrate versatility across various terrains. Roshel’s Senator 4x4 is among the vehicles being evaluated. This Canadian-made Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle has been used in Ukraine, with more than 1,400 units delivered since 2022. Reports from Ukraine have described the vehicle’s reliability and off-road performance under frontline conditions. Therefore, the Chilean Army is reportedly considering direct procurement of the Senator through the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), bypassing a competitive bidding process. This method has been criticized for potentially limiting market competition and excluding alternatives, such as Colombia’s Hunter TR-12 or France’s Arquus Bastion. Chile's original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle. (Picture source: Chilean MoD) As part of the evaluation process, the Chilean Army is planning a visit to Roshel’s facilities in Canada to assess the Senator directly. This decision has raised concerns regarding the impartiality of the RFI process, as it may suggest a preference for the Senator despite the ongoing review of other vehicles. Additionally, legal constraints exist, as the Ministry of Defense has not amended the Supreme Decree that originally allocated funds specifically for 8x8 vehicles. Without such amendments, the use of these funds for 4x4 vehicles is not permitted. The Chilean Army’s interest in 4x4 platforms appears linked to priorities such as border surveillance in the Southern Macrozone and addressing irregular immigration and security issues in the Araucanía Region. However, this focus has been criticized for diverging from the original Cromo project’s aim of equipping mechanized infantry units with 8x8 or 6x6 vehicles, which are considered more aligned with global trends and offer greater versatility. Argentina and Peru, for example, have reportedly prioritized 8x8 platforms for their mechanized forces. Compared to 6x6 and 8x8 configurations, 4x4 vehicles have reduced payload capacities, less off-road mobility, and are less suited for integrating heavier weapon systems. Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility on December 13, 2024, in Shelby Township, Michigan. The facility consolidates manufacturing processes, accommodates U.S. federal and government clients, and includes a service center. The plant produces the Senator Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, which is built on the Ford F-550 chassis. This version features STANAG 4569 Level 2 certification, a V-shaped hull for blast mitigation, composite materials for reduced weight, and thermal and acoustic insulation. The MRAP is equipped with a 6.7L turbo diesel engine, an 800-kilometer range, a payload capacity of 2,000 kilograms, and space for ten occupants. It is compatible with various weapon systems, including remote-controlled weapon systems and anti-tank guided missiles. Roshel operates four facilities in Ontario, producing up to 140 vehicles per month. Over 1,400 Senator vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation. Ukrainian reports indicate the vehicle’s ability to withstand attacks, including those involving First-Person View drones. Roshel is planning to establish a factory in Germany to meet NATO and European demands and intends to localize part of its production in Ukraine. Beyond the Senator, Roshel manufactures the Captain, a light tactical armored vehicle based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 70 chassis, as well as other configurations of the Senator designed for emergency response. The company has delivered vehicles to Costa Rica, South Korea, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and continues efforts to expand its presence in Europe and the United States.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/could-the-canadian-roshel-senator-4x4-replace-chiles-outdated-fleet-of-piranha-6x6-armored-vehicles	2025-01-17T05:54:50-08:00

The collaboration aims to leverage Japan’s expertise in naval engineering and Indonesia’s growing defense industry. By sharing technological knowledge and manufacturing responsibilities, the project could serve as a cornerstone for long-term defense collaboration. Although the idea of joint ship development has been under consideration for several years, progress was hindered during the administration of former Indonesian President Joko Widodo. His government prioritized the relocation of Indonesia’s capital from Jakarta on Java to Nusantara in Borneo, diverting resources and attention away from defense-related initiatives. The renewed focus on maritime cooperation underscores Indonesia's recognition of its strategic vulnerabilities in the face of rising regional tensions. For Japan, this partnership aligns with its Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy, which emphasizes collaboration with Southeast Asian nations to maintain maritime stability. Japan’s stringent 'Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology' pose challenges for defense exports. However, these restrictions can be navigated through joint development agreements. Under this framework, Japan can engage in co-manufacturing with partner nations, enabling the transfer of advanced military technology while adhering to domestic legal constraints. The joint naval ship development signals a growing strategic partnership between Japan and Indonesia. Both nations face security challenges, including territorial disputes and the need to secure vital sea lanes for trade and energy supply. The initiative also reflects a broader trend of regional countries strengthening ties with Japan as a counterbalance to assertive maritime activities in the Indo-Pacific. For Indonesia, the partnership offers access to defense technology and training, potentially setting the stage for more collaborative projects in the future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-and-indonesia-explore-co-development-of-warship	2025-01-17T05:49:00-08:00	
Flash info: Russian S-400 System Targets a French Atlantique 2 Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	During the night of January 15-16, 2025, a French Navy Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, operating as part of a NATO mission, was illuminated by the targeting radar of a Russian S-400 air defense system. This action, described as aggressive and contrary to international norms, was condemned on X (formerly Twitter) by French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu. The incident occurred amidst heightened tensions in the Baltic Sea, a strategically critical region where Russian and Western interests frequently clash. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Atlantique 2 was inspecting Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning 200 ships without detecting threats when targeted by a Russian S-400 radar (Picture source: French MoD) NATO patrols in the Baltic Sea aim to ensure maritime security and protect critical infrastructure in the region. These operations have intensified in response to recent incidents, including damage to undersea telecommunications and power cables, which European leaders attribute to potential acts of sabotage by Russia. The Baltic Sentry operation mobilizes frigates, maritime patrol aircraft like the Atlantique 2, and naval drones to effectively monitor these strategic waters. On this occasion, the French Atlantique 2 was conducting inspections near Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning around 200 ships without identifying any suspicious vessels. Based on radar capabilities and operational ranges of the S-400 system, it is likely the responsible battery was located in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. Kaliningrad, a Russian territory situated between Poland and Lithuania, plays a pivotal role in Russia's air defense strategy. The region has hosted S-400 batteries since their initial deployment in April 2012, aimed at bolstering the Baltic Fleet’s air defense. Additional systems were installed at the Gvardeysk military base near Kaliningrad in March 2019 to further secure this strategically sensitive area. These deployments also serve as a deterrent to NATO forces operating in the region, where tensions continue to rise. The S-400 Triumf, developed by Almaz-Antey, is a sophisticated air defense system featuring an advanced radar architecture. At its core is the 92N6 Grave Stone fire control radar, capable of detecting targets up to 400 kilometers away and at altitudes exceeding 50 kilometers. Supporting this is the 96L6 Cheese Board radar, optimized for tracking targets at both low and high altitudes, and the 91N6E Big Bird radar, which can identify threats at ranges up to 600 kilometers in some configurations. This combination enables the S-400 to detect a wide range of threats, from ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft to drones and cruise missiles. The S-400 is further distinguished by its ability to deploy a variety of missiles tailored to specific threats. The 40N6E missile, with a range of 380 kilometers, can engage targets beyond the radar horizon, including those flying at low altitudes. The 48N6DM/48N6E3 missiles with ranges of 250 kilometers and 48N6E2 with 200 kilometers are designed to intercept high-altitude threats, while the 9M96E missiles with a range of 40 kilometers and 9M96E2 with 120 kilometers are optimized for maneuverable threats and those at low altitudes. These hypersonic missiles, capable of speeds up to Mach 15, ensure rapid and precise interception. In its maximum configuration, an S-400 battery can engage up to 80 targets simultaneously and direct 160 missiles within a 360-degree radius. While the S-400’s modular design and advanced capabilities make it a formidable defense system, they come with significant logistical demands, including maintenance and highly trained personnel. These factors underscore the importance of the S-400 systems stationed in Kaliningrad within Russia's broader anti-access and area denial strategy, effectively securing the region against unauthorized aerial incursions. This incident highlights the growing geopolitical tensions between NATO and Russia, particularly against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, specializes in anti-submarine warfare and surveillance missions. With a flight endurance of 14 hours and a range of 4,300 nautical miles, it is a critical asset for NATO operations in the Baltic Sea. Equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, including a magnetic anomaly detector and a 360-degree radar, the Atlantique 2 can efficiently monitor maritime activity in strategic zones. The use of a targeting radar against the Atlantique 2 represents a provocative act, often interpreted as a warning or show of force. While the situation did not escalate further, it underscores the risks of operating in a region where NATO and Russian forces frequently interact. NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, noted that such incidents, though serious, are relatively common and not confined to European theaters. This incident underscores the need for NATO to maintain heightened vigilance against destabilizing actions in the region. In conclusion, this event reflects the delicate balance of power in the Baltic Sea, a critical theater in the broader NATO-Russia rivalry. The advanced capabilities of the S-400 system, coupled with NATO’s strategic resilience, highlight the precarious nature of this region, where each action carries potential implications for international security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-russian-s-400-system-targets-a-french-atlantique-2-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T05:40:11-08:00	
Belgium Invests in Mine Countermeasures with New Ship Liege	According to information published by the Belgian MoD on January 16, 2025, a momentous occasion for the Belgian Navy and the city of Liege unfolded at the Giurgiu shipyard in Romania with the keel-laying ceremony for the Liege, a new mine countermeasures vessel (MCMV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of the Belgian City-class rMcM Liege. (Picture source: Belgian MoD) The keel-laying, a traditional naval ceremony symbolizing the beginning of a ship’s construction, was attended by Belgian Navy officials, local dignitaries, and representatives from Liège. The Liège is being constructed as part of the Belgian-Dutch Replacement Mine Countermeasures (rMCM) program, a joint initiative to replace the aging minehunting fleets of both nations. The ship’s construction follows a phased approach, beginning with the assembly of its hull in Romania. Once this stage is completed, the vessel will be transported to Concarneau, France, where advanced systems and equipment will be installed by Naval Group, a key partner in the project. After its completion, the Liège will undergo rigorous testing, including harbor and sea trials, before being equipped with its weapon systems in Lorient, France. The Liège is one of 12 vessels being built under the rMCM program, with six designated for the Belgian Navy and six for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Scheduled for full operational deployment by 2030, these ships will incorporate innovative minehunting technologies, including a fleet of approximately 100 unmanned drones. These systems, part of a modular toolbox, will enhance the fleet’s ability to detect and neutralize mines effectively. Context Historically, mine warfare in the North Sea has been a pivotal aspect of naval strategy due to the region's strategic importance as a maritime gateway. During the World Wars, the North Sea became a critical theater for deploying naval mines to control access, protect key shipping routes, and limit the movement of enemy fleets. In World War I, the North Sea saw the implementation of extensive minefields, such as the North Sea Mine Barrage. This Allied operation aimed to deter German U-boat activity by creating a massive minefield stretching between Scotland and Norway. Over 70,000 mines were laid in deep waters, marking one of the most ambitious mining operations of the time. The barrage was a logistical feat, demonstrating the role of mines in countering undersea threats, although its actual effectiveness remains debated. During World War II, the North Sea once again became a contested space. Both the Axis and Allied forces employed mines extensively, using them to blockade ports, disrupt shipping lanes, and deny access to critical areas. Mines proved to be a relatively inexpensive yet highly effective tool for naval dominance. The German Navy used magnetic mines, a technological innovation of the era, to great effect, challenging traditional mine-sweeping techniques and forcing the Allies to develop countermeasures. The aftermath of these conflicts left thousands of mines scattered across the seabed, posing long-term risks to navigation, fishing, and infrastructure development. The effort to clear these mines was a monumental task undertaken in the post-war years, and unexploded ordnance from these periods continues to be discovered and neutralized today.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/belgium-invests-in-mine-countermeasures-with-new-ship-liege	2025-01-17T04:49:25-08:00

Brazil’s procurement of the Centauro II tank destroyer is intended to replace the aging fleet of EE-9 Cascavel 6x6 reconnaissance vehicles, developed domestically in the 1970s and now inadequate for modern operational needs. (Picture source: 6ª Bda Inf Bld) This procurement is part of a broader initiative to modernize Brazil’s armed forces through the acquisition of advanced equipment and the development of domestic production capabilities. These efforts include purchasing 12 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, upgrading the A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft, and exploring options for a new fighter to complement the Gripen, with candidates such as the Indian Tejas and the Chinese J-10 under consideration. Domestically, the KC-390 Millennium, Brazil's largest military aircraft, the MSS 1.2 AC anti-tank missile, and the ASTROS multiple rocket launcher system represent several advancements in the country’s defense manufacturing. The primary goal of these initiatives is to enhance Brazil’s sovereignty and address regional security challenges. Brazil’s extensive borders with countries such as Paraguay and Bolivia are critical transit points for transnational crimes, including drug trafficking and smuggling. To combat these threats, the government has deployed armed forces to secure borders, ports, and airports, forming part of a broader strategy to ensure territorial integrity and internal stability. Brazil has also enhanced its military presence along the border with Venezuela, partly due to tensions stemming from the Venezuela-Guyana territorial dispute over the Essequibo region. In early 2024, additional troops and armored vehicles were deployed to Roraima state to enhance security and monitor developments. This effort is complemented by Brazil’s participation in joint military exercises with global powers such as the United States and China.

It features stealth technology, advanced guidance systems, and is available in variants such as the JASSM-ER, with a range of 925 km, and the LRASM, tailored for anti-ship missions. Its propulsion system, a choice of turbojet or turbofan engines, supports its operational range, while its 432 kg WDU-42/B warhead ensures effectiveness against hardened targets. The missile is compatible with various platforms, including the B-1B, F-15E, F-16, and F-35, offering operational flexibility. Since entering service in 2003, over 2,000 units have been produced, with deployments in strategic operations, such as strikes in Syria and against high-value terrorist targets. Development continues with the JASSM-XR, promising an extended range of 1,800 km to meet evolving operational needs. This contract is part of Japan's broader efforts to modernize its defense capabilities. In 2024, Tokyo acquired 50 JASSM-ER missiles through a Foreign Military Sale approved in 2023. These initiatives align with the country's updated 2022 defense guidelines, which introduced counterstrike capabilities, reflecting a shift in its defense posture within the constraints of its pacifist Constitution. The JASSM-ER's advanced GPS anti-jamming and infrared imaging systems deliver high precision, while its integration into Japan's forces is supported by training equipment, spare parts, and specialized software included in the deal. Discussions have also explored extending the missile’s use to non-traditional platforms like the Kawasaki C-2 transport aircraft, inspired by the U.S. Rapid Dragon program, further diversifying Japan's tactical options. Simultaneously, Japan continues to invest in indigenous projects, including hypersonic weapons and improvements to Type-12 SSM systems. These developments aim to maintain technological competitiveness and deter potential threats. Recent demonstrations of these systems underscore Japan’s commitment to advancing its defense capabilities. This sale also underscores the deepening U.S.-Japan defense partnership. In January 2025, the U.S. approved another significant sale to Japan, including 1,200 AIM-120D-3 and AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles for $3.64 billion. Such agreements highlight the strategic importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance amid regional instability driven by military developments in China and North Korea. The defense ties between the United States and Japan have a long-standing history and remain vital in addressing contemporary geopolitical challenges. Since the signing of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security in 1951, the two nations have worked closely to ensure stability in the Indo-Pacific region. This partnership saw further consolidation in April 2024 when U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the creation of an aerial missile network in collaboration with Australia, marking a significant step in defense cooperation since the Cold War. In parallel, Japan has revised its national security strategy to include counterstrike capabilities, addressing rising threats while balancing its pacifist Constitution. The alliance is further supported by the presence of approximately 54,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan, making it a cornerstone of peace and security in East Asia.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/strategic-alliance-between-us-and-japan-jassm-er-missiles-to-counter-china-and-north-korea	2025-01-17T01:42:47-08:00	
Rise of Submarine-Launched Unmanned Aerial Systems in Global Defense	The development of Submarine-Launched Unmanned Aerial Systems (SLUAS) marks a turning point in underwater warfare, merging two critical domains of military operations: the stealth of submarines and the intelligence-gathering capabilities of aerial drones. This innovation addresses longstanding challenges in naval operations by enabling submarines to perform reconnaissance, surveillance, and communication tasks without surfacing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of a Submarine-Launched Unmanned Aerial System. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The United States Navy has led efforts to bring SLUAS technology from concept to reality. A landmark demonstration was the successful deployment of the eXperimental Fuel Cell Unmanned Aerial System (XFC UAS) from the USS Providence, a Los Angeles-class submarine. This milestone showcased the ability to launch a UAV from a submerged vessel through a torpedo tube, using a special capsule that ascended to the surface and released the aerial system into operational flight. The drone provided real-time intelligence, significantly enhancing situational awareness while maintaining the submarine’s cover. Following this early success, the U.S. Navy introduced the Blackwing unmanned system, a more compact and operationally versatile platform. Designed specifically for submarine deployment, the Blackwing provides submarines with extended visual and electronic surveillance capabilities. By deploying these drones, commanders can monitor above-water activities, track potential threats, and share critical intelligence across fleet networks—all while avoiding the risks associated with surfacing. The implications of SLUAS technology are profound. Submarines have traditionally operated with limited situational awareness above the surface, often relying on external assets such as satellites or manned reconnaissance platforms. With SLUAS, submarines gain the ability to autonomously gather intelligence, assess their surroundings, and even serve as forward-operating nodes in integrated battle networks. This capability not only strengthens their role in modern naval warfare but also underscores the increasing emphasis on multi-domain operations, where platforms from different environments work seamlessly together. In peacetime, these systems can contribute to maritime security by monitoring illegal fishing, smuggling, and piracy activities. Their ability to operate covertly also makes them invaluable for intelligence-gathering missions in politically sensitive areas. Furthermore, their compact design and modular payload options allow for rapid adaptation to diverse mission requirements, whether focused on surveillance, electronic warfare, or payload delivery. Despite the promise of SLUAS, their development and deployment come with challenges. Ensuring reliable communication between a submerged platform and an aerial drone requires advanced encryption and signal processing to prevent detection or interception. Additionally, engineering drones capable of withstanding the pressures of underwater deployment and maintaining performance in harsh conditions demands significant innovation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/rise-of-submarine-launched-unmanned-aerial-systems-in-global-defense	2025-01-17T01:08:06-08:00

NATO Surveillance Mission French Aircraft Faces Russian Hostility in Baltic Sea	As reported by Le Figaro, a high-tension incident occurred on January 16, 2025, during an aerial surveillance mission over the Baltic Sea. A French Navy Atlantique 2 (ATL2) operating under NATO's framework was targeted by Russian forces while conducting a surveillance flight in response to recent undersea cable damage. The French Armed Forces General Staff confirmed this event, which an AFP journalist witnessed firsthand onboard the aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Atlantique 2 is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) The aircraft departed Brittany earlier that day and was tasked with inspecting approximately 200 vessels operating in international waters near Sweden and the Baltic states. During the mission, the plane encountered electronic jamming and was designated by a fire-control radar, a procedure known in military terms as ' illumination.' According to Colonel Guillaume Vernet, spokesperson for the General Staff, this act signals hostility, even though it is not uncommon in this strategically sensitive region. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions. It is an evolution of the Breguet Atlantic, featuring advanced operational capabilities, robust endurance, and notable maneuverability. Its bilobed fuselage houses a pressurized cabin and a large weapons bay, supporting its versatility. With a maximum flight endurance of 14 hours and a range of 4,300 nautical miles, the ATL2 operates effectively in allied or multi-branch contexts, addressing both surveillance and combat needs. Equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, the ATL2 features a magnetic anomaly detector, a 360° Iguane radar, and a FLIR infrared sensor, enabling day-and-night surface target identification.

Its armament includes AM39 missiles, MU90 torpedoes, and laser-guided bombs, supported by a 12-member crew handling systems, intelligence, and mission execution. The professionalism of the French crew was pivotal in preventing escalation despite the heightened tensions. Colonel Vernet emphasized that Russia’s radar illumination aimed to express restrained hostility, stopping short of direct military action. An attack on a NATO aircraft would have risked triggering a severe and uncontrollable escalation with the Alliance. This incident occurs amid growing suspicions of sabotage targeting critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Over recent months, several undersea communication and power cables have been damaged. On December 25, the EstLink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia, along with several telecommunication lines, were compromised shortly after similar events in Swedish waters. Finnish authorities suspect Russian involvement and have seized the Eagle S, a tanker under the Cook Islands flag, allegedly part of a Russian 'ghost fleet.' General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, described the event as 'serious,' noting that such provocations are not confined to Europe. Experts, including former military aviator Xavier Tytelman, highlighted the risks of miscalculation or immediate responses in such situations, which could inadvertently lead to significant escalation. Despite these provocations, the ATL2 completed its mission without identifying suspicious vessels. However, the incident underscores the persistent confrontations in the Baltic region, where hybrid warfare tactics and intimidation measures are prevalent. NATO continues to heighten its vigilance, reflecting the ongoing challenges to maritime security and regional stability posed by geopolitical rivalries. The Baltic Sea has long been a hotspot for tensions between Russia and NATO member states, characterized by frequent interceptions of military aircraft. Russian planes, such as Su-27 Flankers and Il-20s, often operate without flight plans or active transponders in international airspace, complicating their identification and endangering air safety. In response, NATO interceptors, including German and British Eurofighters, are routinely deployed to escort these aircraft out of the area. While these encounters are typically handled professionally, they exemplify the heightened geopolitical strains fueled by the Ukraine conflict and intensified military activities on both sides.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/nato-surveillance-mission-french-aircraft-faces-russian-hostility-in-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T00:09:01-08:00	
Breaking News: Iran Strengthens Anti-Ship Arsenal with New Mobile Abu Mahdi Missiles Launchers	On January 16, 2025, Iranian defense sources on X (Previously Twitter) confirmed the delivery of mobile launcher units for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship cruise missile, marking a significant step forward in Iran's naval capabilities. The missile, which has been in development for several years, is part of a broader strategy to enhance Iran's ability to deter and defend against maritime threats. These new launcher units will be integrated into both the Iranian Navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy, providing a new layer of operational flexibility and reach for the country’s defense forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new mobile launcher unit for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship missile, delivered to the Iranian Navy on January 16, 2025, enhances Iran's naval strike capabilities with increased mobility and operational flexibility (Picture source: X Account Hamid) First unveiled in August 2020, the Abu Mahdi cruise missile is a domestically developed long-range anti-ship weapon with a striking range of over 1,000 kilometers. Named after the influential Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the missile has been designed to deliver both anti-ship and land-attack capabilities, providing Iran with a versatile tool to challenge naval forces operating in its strategic waters. One of the most significant features of the Abu Mahdi missile is its long range, which at over 1,000 kilometers, is approximately three times the range of Iran's previous most capable anti-ship missiles, such as the 350 km Raad missile and the 300 km Qadir missile. This substantial increase in range allows Iran to project its power much further, complicating the ability of adversaries to operate near its coastline. The Abu Mahdi missile is equipped with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)-powered guidance, which allows it to perform advanced maneuvering in-flight, avoiding radar detection through low-altitude flight patterns and unpredictable course alterations. These features make the missile particularly effective against heavily defended targets such as aircraft carriers and naval vessels equipped with advanced air defense systems. This combination of long-range capabilities and high precision makes the Abu Mahdi a formidable tool in Iran's naval arsenal. The newly delivered mobile launcher units will allow the Abu Mahdi missiles to be deployed quickly and efficiently from various locations, enhancing their operational flexibility. These launchers can fire multiple missiles at short intervals and from diverse fixed and mobile platforms, enabling Iranian forces to strike multiple targets simultaneously and with a variety of attack trajectories. The dual-mode seekers on the Abu Mahdi, which combine both active and passive radar homing systems, are designed to ensure high precision even in the face of electronic warfare attempts. The integration of mobile launchers with the missile system further complicates adversaries' attempts to neutralize Iran's capabilities. The delivery of these launcher units significantly extends Iran's naval deterrence capabilities. With the Abu Mahdi missile, Iranian forces now possess a weapon that can strike enemy ships from a distance well beyond their shores, effectively forcing foreign military assets, such as aircraft carriers, to stay at least 1,000 kilometers from Iranian waters. This ability to deny access to large swathes of the Persian Gulf and beyond significantly alters the regional naval balance of power. As Iranian defense officials have emphasized, the Abu Mahdi missile is a crucial component of Iran's strategy to defend its maritime borders and exert influence over the Strait of Hormuz, through which a substantial portion of global oil shipments pass. The missile's advanced guidance systems and ability to operate from various platforms, including coastal installations and ships, further enhance its role in Iran's defense strategy. The importance of anti-ship missile capabilities for Iran cannot be overstated, especially in the context of its current strategic environment. Iran is located in a region where maritime security is a constant concern, with the strategic Strait of Hormuz being a chokepoint for global oil transport and a focal point for international tension. In recent years, Iran's adversarial relations with Israel have intensified, with both countries accusing each other of hostile actions and interventions. Israel's growing presence and alliances in the region, particularly in the Mediterranean and around the Gulf, have heightened Iran's concerns over its maritime sovereignty and the security of its critical oil exports. In this volatile context, the Abu Mahdi missile system represents a crucial component of Iran's broader military strategy to deter any foreign military intervention, particularly by Israel and its allies. With the ability to strike naval assets at ranges previously beyond Iran's reach, these missiles bolster Tehran’s strategic posture, allowing it to challenge the naval superiority of regional adversaries, including Israel, and create a formidable defense against any attempts to restrict its maritime access.

US Expresses Concern Over Pakistan's Development of Long-Range Ballistic Missiles	During a speech delivered on December 19 at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Jon Finer, U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor, described Pakistan’s ballistic missile program as an 'emerging threat' to the United States. He highlighted that Pakistan is developing advanced missile technologies, such as high-powered rocket engines, which could eventually enable Islamabad to strike targets well beyond its region, potentially including the U.S. territory. This statement underscores the growing strain in U.S.-Pakistan relations, already fraught with tensions exacerbated by the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and Washington's closer strategic alignment with India. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Shaheen-III long-range ballistic missile (Picture source: IISS) Pakistan’s ballistic missile arsenal, traditionally focused on regional deterrence against India, has undergone significant modernization in recent years. Among its systems, the Shaheen-III, still in development, is the longest-range missile in Pakistan’s inventory, with a range of 2,750 kilometers. Designed to target strategic areas such as India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this two-stage, solid-fueled missile can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads. Its mobility, provided by a Chinese transporter-erector-launcher, enhances its strategic flexibility. Speculation suggests it may eventually be equipped with multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs) to counter missile defenses. This modernization effort is bolstered by close technical cooperation with China and past collaborations with North Korea and Iran. Despite these advancements, U.S. officials assess that Pakistan’s ability to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of targeting the U.S. homeland remains years away. However, they express concern over the broader implications of Pakistan’s efforts for regional and global stability. On December 18, a day before Finer’s speech, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned National Development Complex, which plays a central role in missile development. Three additional entities were sanctioned for supplying critical materials for the program. These measures aim to curb the proliferation of missile technologies, although U.S. proposals for confidence-building measures, such as telemetry data sharing and test range limitations, were rejected by Islamabad. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in a statement issued on December 19, neither confirmed nor denied the development of long-range ballistic missiles but defended its strategic capabilities as essential for safeguarding sovereignty and maintaining peace in South Asia. The ministry also accused the U.S. of discriminatory practices undermining nonproliferation efforts and exacerbating regional military imbalances. This development signals a potential shift in Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence doctrine, historically focused on countering India. Such advancements may indicate ambitions to extend its strategic reach beyond the region, potentially complicating global nonproliferation efforts and contributing to a broader arms race. Meanwhile, India continues to develop its long-range missile systems, including the Agni-V with a range exceeding 5,200 kilometers, and is working on the Agni-VI to counter China’s capabilities. U.S. accusations regarding Pakistan’s missile program highlight a significant decline in bilateral relations once characterized by strategic cooperation. These revelations and subsequent sanctions intensify geopolitical tensions in South Asia, raising questions about Islamabad’s long-term strategic goals. As mutual distrust deepens, the prospect of a broader arms race threatens to reshape the regional and global strategic balance.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-expresses-concern-over-pakistans-development-of-long-range-ballistic-missiles	2025-01-15T06:59:41-08:00

Its armament includes a range of systems such as the Osa-MA air defense system, AK-630 and AK-176 artillery, torpedoes, and the RBU-6000 'Smerch-2' rocket launcher. These capabilities allow the ship to address modern challenges posed by unmanned systems, which are increasingly used in global naval operations. Drone threat The Russian Navy has encountered an unprecedented set of challenges stemming from Ukraine’s strategic and innovative use of drone technology in the ongoing conflict. Unmanned systems, particularly drones, have emerged as a key factor in naval warfare, reshaping the dynamics of power projection and maritime security. The Black Sea, long considered a strategic stronghold for Russia, has become a theater for showcasing the disruptive potential of drones. Ukraine has effectively weaponized unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and aerial drones to target Russian naval assets and infrastructure. These drones have been employed to great effect in precision strikes, surveillance, and as a psychological tool to unsettle Russian naval operations. One of the most notable incidents involved a Ukrainian sea drone destroying a Russian Mi-8 military helicopter near Crimea, underscoring the lethality and operational flexibility of unmanned platforms. Moreover, persistent drone attacks have compelled the Russian Navy to relocate many of its ships from Sevastopol in Crimea, a critical naval hub, to ports like Novorossiysk. This strategic withdrawal highlights the profound impact that drones have had on the operational calculus of one of the world’s most formidable naval forces.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-navys-grisha-class-corvette-neutralizes-naval-drones-in-pacific-fleet-exercises	2025-01-15T06:44:41-08:00

(Picture source: US DoD) Global defense industries have made substantial strides in scaling up the production of munitions. The United States has committed $5.5 billion to boost domestic manufacturing capabilities, resulting in dramatic increases in the production of essential munitions and platforms. For example, monthly output of 155mm projectiles has risen from 14,400 to 40,000 units, representing a 178% increase. Other key systems, such as HIMARS and PAC-3 MSE missiles, have also seen significant production expansions to meet both current and long-term demands. European nations have equally stepped up their contributions. France and Sweden have announced plans to double their capacity for ammunition and explosive loading by 2025, while Germany and other European countries are establishing new facilities to produce up to 700,000 artillery shells annually by 2025. In Romania, a new gunpowder factory funded through a European Commission project is set to enhance the continent's supply chain further. Collaborative efforts extend beyond Europe, with initiatives like the Czech-led €1.7 billion consortium to source 500,000 artillery rounds globally by the end of 2024. The European defense industry’s Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) aims to increase annual ammunition shell production to 2 million units by 2025, covering critical components such as explosives, powders, and testing. Ukraine’s domestic defense industry has also seen remarkable growth. The country has increased its annual production of mortar and artillery ammunition from 1 million to 2.5 million rounds in just one year. International partnerships, such as those between Ukraine and companies like Northrop Grumman, Rheinmetall, and the Colt CZ Group, are further driving co-production efforts. These collaborations include the establishment of ammunition factories, maintenance centers, and production lines for critical defense components. Scaling up munitions production for Ukraine has revealed several significant challenges, underscoring the complexities of rapidly increasing defense manufacturing capabilities in response to modern conflicts. Among the most pressing issues are bureaucratic delays. Many governments and defense firms face lengthy approval processes for contracts and export licenses, creating bottlenecks in the supply chain. Additionally, fragmented policies among European Union member states complicate coordinated efforts, further delaying critical deliveries. Supply chain disruptions remain another major hurdle. The global shortage of key raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and rare-earth elements, has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Countries relying on imported components, including explosives and propellants, find themselves vulnerable to international trade instability, which has driven up costs and limited access to necessary resources. The absence of long-term contracts between governments and defense manufacturers further undermines efforts to scale up production. Manufacturers need multi-year agreements to justify investments in new facilities or technologies, but uncertainty surrounding the conflict's duration has made governments hesitant to commit. This short-term focus hinders the development of sustainable production capabilities.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/how-nations-are-scaling-up-munitions-production-for-ukraine	2025-01-14T04:23:11-08:00

Their acquisition costs are lower than traditional weaponry, and their deployment does not require extensive operator training. This pragmatic approach optimizes military expenditures while enhancing operational effectiveness. The modernization effort extends beyond the GSDF. The Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces are also advancing their respective drone programs. These include advanced reconnaissance drones, larger offensive drones transportable by vehicles, and logistics drones capable of operating in isolated or contested areas. These systems diversify Japan’s military capabilities, enabling quicker and more effective responses to emerging threats. Japan’s acquisition of kamikaze drones carries significant geopolitical weight. By modernizing its military capabilities, Tokyo sends a clear message to both regional partners and rivals: it is committed to defending its interests and taking a more proactive role in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific region. This approach aims to deter potential aggression while supporting allies, particularly the United States, in ensuring regional stability. However, this decision may also be perceived as a military buildup, potentially drawing criticism from neighboring countries, particularly China. Such perceptions could lead to increased regional tensions and further accelerate military development programs among Japan’s neighbors, contributing to an arms race in the region. The introduction of kamikaze drones into Japan’s arsenal marks a significant step in the transformation of the Self-Defense Forces. These unmanned systems, both efficient and cost-effective, provide Japan with tools to address contemporary security challenges while optimizing its human and material resources. This initiative reflects a comprehensive strategy to modernize military capabilities while adapting to demographic and budgetary constraints. As regional tensions continue to escalate, these drones offer Japan a means to strengthen its defense and contribute actively to the security of the Asia-Pacific. How this move will impact the balance of power in the region and provoke responses from other nations remains to be seen.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/japan-plans-to-acquire-kamikaze-drones-to-strengthen-its-position-in-east-china-sea	2025-01-14T03:25:40-08:00

Flash Info: Denmark Plans Major Arctic Defense Boost with New Vessels Patrols and F-35 Fighter Jets in Greenland	On January 10, 2025, Denmark unveiled a comprehensive plan to significantly boost its military presence in Greenland, a strategically critical Arctic territory that has become the center of geopolitical attention due to growing interest from the United States. According to Danish TV channels DR and TV2, this expansion is primarily motivated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's continued focus on Greenland, underscoring its importance for U.S. security interests in the Arctic region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kangerlussuaq Airport in Greenland: A Strategic Hub for Military Operations and Future F-35 Deployments. (Picture source: Wikimedia) In response to U.S. ambitions, Denmark has proposed the purchase of two new Arctic inspection vessels to replace its aging fleet of four vessels currently operating in the region. These vessels are crucial for monitoring Greenland’s vast maritime borders, which span more than 2.1 million square kilometers, an area four times the size of France. The new ships will be better equipped to handle the demanding Arctic conditions, enhancing Denmark’s surveillance capabilities in a region that is increasingly becoming a hotspot for geopolitical rivalries. Alongside the new vessels, Denmark also plans to increase its dog sled patrols from the current 12, reinforcing its surveillance network across Greenland's rugged and ice-covered terrain. Dog sled patrols, although limited in reach, offer unmatched access to remote areas that are difficult to navigate with conventional vehicles. By expanding these patrols, Denmark aims to strengthen its monitoring and response capabilities in some of the most challenging environments on Earth. A key element of Denmark's military modernization involves the proposed upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport, a former U.S. military base in western Greenland. The plan includes making the airport capable of accommodating advanced F-35 fighter jets, a move that would significantly enhance Denmark’s air surveillance and rapid-response capabilities in the Arctic. Kangerlussuaq's strategic location near Greenland’s western coast, along the shortest route from North America to Europe, has long made it an attractive site for military operations. With the upgrades, Denmark would be able to deploy state-of-the-art aircraft for air patrols, surveillance, and deterrent operations, further bolstering its defense capabilities in the region. As part of its overall strategy to strengthen surveillance and intelligence in the Arctic, Denmark has committed $400 million to improve its long-range drone capabilities. These drones will be deployed to cover the vast, remote expanses of Greenland, providing critical real-time intelligence on military movements, environmental changes, and potential threats. This investment will help Denmark maintain a strategic edge in an increasingly contested region, especially as the Arctic's rapidly changing climate opens new shipping routes and access to natural resources. The ability to track and monitor these developments is essential to safeguarding Denmark's interests in the area. This strategic military buildup comes in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated remarks about Greenland's geopolitical importance. Trump has long expressed interest in Greenland, even suggesting in 2019 that the United States should purchase the island from Denmark. While this proposal was firmly rejected by both Denmark and Greenland’s leadership, Trump has continued to view Greenland as a critical asset to U.S. security. His recent statements in early January 2025 reaffirmed his belief that controlling Greenland is essential for U.S. national security. While not explicitly advocating for the island's purchase this time, Trump’s rhetoric signals an ongoing effort to assert U.S. influence in the Arctic, a region that is increasingly pivotal due to resource exploration, military competition, and climate change. Denmark, which holds responsibility for Greenland’s defense and security, has historically maintained limited military capabilities on the island. The existing forces include aging inspection vessels, a Challenger surveillance plane, and dog sled patrols, all tasked with monitoring a vast and inhospitable territory. These resources, though functional in the past, have proven insufficient to address the growing security concerns in the Arctic. The Danish government has acknowledged this limitation and, under increasing pressure, has begun to modernize its defense infrastructure to ensure Greenland’s protection in the face of rising external threats. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, is strategically located at the heart of Arctic geopolitics, a region where nations like Russia, Canada, and the United States are vying for influence. Denmark’s military investments reflect a concerted effort to secure Greenland’s sovereignty while preserving its semi-autonomous status. The island’s vast resources and strategic location make it a highly contested area, and as the U.S. seeks to bolster its military presence in the Arctic, Denmark faces the challenge of balancing its sovereignty over Greenland with maintaining strong defense ties to NATO, particularly with the U.S. In conclusion, Denmark's plan to invest in modernizing its military infrastructure in Greenland marks a crucial step in ensuring the island’s defense amidst growing geopolitical tensions. The proposed acquisitions of new Arctic inspection vessels, the expansion of dog sled patrols, and the upgrade of Kangerlussuaq Airport to accommodate F-35 jets demonstrate Denmark’s commitment to strengthening its Arctic defense. These measures not only respond to Donald Trump’s renewed interest in Greenland but also acknowledge the changing dynamics in the Arctic, ensuring Denmark remains a key player in the region's security as global powers vie for control over its resources and strategic assets.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-denmark-plans-major-arctic-defense-boost-with-new-vessels-patrols-and-f-35-fighter-jets-in-greenland	2025-01-14T02:39:35-08:00

Recently, the 3rd Combat Helicopter Regiment (3e RHC) conducted an initial experiment integrating an FPV drone aboard a Gazelle helicopter. The drone was remotely piloted from the helicopter, marking a significant step toward effective collaboration between manned and unmanned platforms. The experiment pursued two key objectives: enhancing reconnaissance and combat support capabilities while testing the concept of 'air-launched devices' (ELA). This concept involves deploying drones for kinetic or non-kinetic missions at distances of 20 to 50 kilometers from the host helicopter. These drones could eventually operate in synergy with future Guépard helicopters, developed under the HIL program, which will gradually replace the Gazelle fleet. The FPV drones tested stand out for their agility and their ability to provide real-time video feeds to the operator through a virtual reality (VR) headset. Although specific details about the drones used have not been disclosed, images show an operator aboard the Gazelle using typical commercial drone control equipment adapted for military applications. Tactical uses include urban reconnaissance, target identification, guiding precision strikes, as well as electronic jamming or laser designation for artillery. Another crucial aspect is the compatibility of these drones with existing artillery systems, such as the Nexter CAESAR self-propelled howitzer. Drones could enhance intelligence loops by offering target acquisition and destruction capabilities at long range, thereby shortening the time between detection and action. In parallel, in January 2025, the French Army presented the DT-46 drone, a versatile platform designed for reconnaissance and tactical support missions. This convertible drone, weighing less than 30 kilograms, can take off vertically with its four rotors before transitioning to horizontal flight, covering distances of up to 100 kilometers with an endurance of five hours. Its ability to be assembled in 15 minutes and operated by a small team of four highlights its adaptability. Equipped with a retractable electro-optical turret, it is designed to meet the demands of modern combat environments. General David Cruzille, commander of the French Army Light Aviation (ALAT), highlighted that this initiative aligns with a combined employment doctrine for helicopters and drones, conceived 15 years ago but only now feasible due to technological advancements. This approach aims to reduce risks for crews while enhancing operational capabilities in complex and hostile environments. However, General Pierre Schill, Chief of Defense Staff, emphasized the continued importance of manned platforms. According to him, manned helicopters remain essential, particularly in scenarios involving disrupted communications or operations requiring rapid and adaptive human decision-making. These experiments represent the beginning of a broader transformation. With the goal of full 'drone enablement' by 2040, the French Army aims to develop innovative solutions that will redefine aerial operations in Europe and beyond. The integration of drones with manned platforms promises to improve mission effectiveness while reducing costs and risks to personnel. The test involving Gazelle helicopters and FPV drones is a critical step toward this future. It demonstrates the potential of drones as tactical force multipliers while laying the groundwork for an operational doctrine suited to contemporary challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/france-relies-on-fpv-drones-to-redefine-role-of-its-gazelle-combat-helicopters	2025-01-14T02:22:34-08:00	
Will three new ships deployed by Sweden prevent attacks on underwater infrastructure?	According to information published by Associated Press on January 12, 2025, Sweden will contribute up to three warships to a NATO-led initiative aimed at enhancing the alliance's presence in the Baltic Sea. The move is part of an effort to guard against potential sabotage of vital underwater infrastructure, the Swedish government announce.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Swedish Navy submarine rescue ship HSwMS Belos. (Picture source: Finnish MoD) In addition to the warships, Sweden’s military will deploy an ASC 890 surveillance aircraft to enhance situational awareness in the region. The Swedish Coast Guard will also play a significant role, with four ships dedicated to monitoring the Baltic Sea and an additional seven vessels on standby for rapid response. This marks Sweden's first operational contribution to NATO’s defense and deterrence efforts as a member of the alliance. The country formally joined NATO in March, becoming its 32nd member. Sweden's accession followed that of neighboring Finland and was spurred by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which significantly altered the security landscape in Northern Europe. The decision to strengthen NATO's presence in the Baltic comes amid a series of incidents in the region, raising concerns about possible Russian activities. The Baltic Sea, a crucial economic and strategic corridor, is crisscrossed by undersea cables and pipelines that connect Nordic, Baltic, and Central European nations. These infrastructures facilitate trade, enhance energy security, and, in some cases, reduce reliance on Russian energy resources. Sweden’s participation in this NATO operation comes at a pivotal moment for the alliance, which has been focusing on fortifying its eastern flank in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The Baltic Sea has become a focal point for these efforts, given its strategic location and the vulnerabilities of its underwater infrastructure. Comments Monitoring undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is particularly challenging due to the region's unique characteristics and the nature of the threats involved. The Baltic is one of the busiest maritime zones globally, with over 2,000 ships navigating its waters daily, including commercial cargo vessels, oil tankers, and fishing trawlers. This high density of maritime activity creates significant obstacles for identifying vessels that might pose a deliberate or accidental risk to undersea cables. The sheer volume of traffic makes it difficult to discern routine activities from those potentially harmful. The technological limitations in the detection and surveillance of undersea infrastructure further compound the problem. Current systems struggle to provide real-time monitoring of extensive cable networks, which often span hundreds or thousands of kilometers. The deep-sea environment adds complexity, with cables often lying on the seabed in remote areas that are difficult to access and monitor. Damage to cables can be caused by natural phenomena, such as seabed shifts or underwater currents, but deliberate sabotage, such as anchor dragging or the use of specialized underwater drones, is increasingly suspected. The covert nature of these activities makes attribution particularly difficult, leaving authorities reliant on indirect evidence or post-incident investigations. Jurisdictional and legal challenges also play a major role. Undersea cables frequently traverse international waters, where no single nation has the authority to enforce protective measures. This limits the ability of individual countries to act decisively against potential threats. Even within territorial waters, enforcement can be difficult due to overlapping national interests and the need for coordination between multiple stakeholders. Moreover, laws governing undersea infrastructure security are often outdated or insufficiently comprehensive, leaving gaps in enforcement and response capabilities. Adding to these challenges, the Baltic Sea itself poses unique geographical difficulties. Its relatively shallow depths, brackish water, and numerous islands create a complex maritime environment that can obscure monitoring efforts.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/will-three-new-ships-deployed-by-sweden-prevent-attacks-on-underwater-infrastructure	2025-01-14T01:58:02-08:00

(Picture source: Danish MoD) According to the Danish Ministry of Defence, the arrival of these three fighters brings the total number of F-35As delivered to Denmark to 17. Of these 17 aircraft, 11 are now stationed on Danish soil, while the remaining 6 are still based at Luke to train Danish pilots and technicians. This 'dual-base' approach allows Denmark to gradually increase its operational availability while continuing to train its personnel on this fifth-generation fighter. Denmark’s F-35 program, designed to replace its end-of-life F-16s, calls for the delivery of a total of 27 aircraft. The first deliveries began in 2023, following the launch of Danish pilot training in the United States in 2020. The first Danish pilot took the controls of an F-35 in January 2021, flying a US Air Force aircraft—an example of the growing interoperability among the many nations operating the F-35. The Danish Air Force plans to reach Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for its first F-35 squadron this year. As the F-35s gradually take over from the F-16s, they will notably assume air policing duties, essential for protecting Danish airspace. The complete transition to the F-35 will span several years, with a period of parallel operation of both aircraft types until the F-16 fleet is definitively retired. The F-35A is a stealth multirole fighter designed to carry out conventional takeoff and landing missions. It is an American aircraft developed by Lockheed Martin, in partnership with Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Singapore, Finland, Canada, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Greece, and Germany, have chosen this model to enhance their air defense capabilities. The F-35A’s armament notably includes an internal 20 mm M61A2 Vulcan cannon and advanced air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder. It can also carry guided bombs like the GBU-31 JDAM and the GBU-39 SDB, as well as munitions intended to counter enemy radars like the AGM-88 HARM. In addition, the fighter has external hardpoints capable of accommodating up to six additional weapons or fuel tanks. Its electronic and detection capabilities rely on a powerful AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, a Distributed Aperture System (DAS) providing 360-degree situational awareness, an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), as well as a Helmet-Mounted Display System (HMDS). It is equipped with secure data links and an electronic warfare suite to jam enemy radars and protect against missiles. Weighing up to 31,800 kilograms at takeoff, the F-35A is powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney F135-PW-100 turbofan engine providing 28,000 pounds of thrust dry and 43,000 pounds with afterburner, enabling it to reach a maximum speed of Mach 1.6 (about 1,930 km/h). Its range depends on the mission, varying from a combat radius of about 2,220 kilometers to more than 3,600 kilometers with an appropriate configuration. The aircraft measures 15.7 meters in length, 4.4 meters in height, and has a wingspan of 10.7 meters—dimensions that provide the flexibility needed to operate from a variety of air bases. Globally, more than 1,100 F-35s have already been delivered by Lockheed Martin, underscoring the growing adoption of this fighter by numerous air forces. Denmark thus becomes the fifth European country to put the F-35 into service on its national territory, after Norway, the Netherlands, and others. Belgium and Poland have also received their first F-35s, currently stationed in the United States for pilot training.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/despite-tensions-over-greenland-united-states-delivers-three-new-f-35a-lightning-iis-to-denmark	2025-01-14T01:56:08-08:00

Exclusive: US Shield AI V-BAT VTOL Aerial Drone Demonstrates Resilience Against Electronic Warfare in Ukraine	At the close of December 2024, U.S.-based defense technology firm Shield AI made a groundbreaking announcement that could redefine the future of military drones. The company revealed that its V-BAT Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aerial drone had successfully completed a long-endurance, long-duration intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting mission in Ukraine—under extremely challenging conditions. Notably, the mission was carried out while GPS and communications signals were jammed, highlighting the drone’s advanced autonomous capabilities and its ability to operate effectively despite modern electronic warfare (EW) challenges.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ukrainian Soldiers Showcase US Shield AI V-BAT VTOL aerial Drone. (Picture source Shield AI) The significance of Shield AI's achievement cannot be overstated. In an era where electronic warfare and signal jamming are increasingly being used to disrupt military operations, the ability of the V-BAT to maintain operational integrity without GPS or communication support is a monumental leap forward. The ability to carry out ISR missions and target acquisition without reliance on traditional navigation and communications systems demonstrates the future of warfare, where autonomy and resilience are paramount. In the context of the Ukraine conflict, this demonstration of drone resilience against EW is particularly crucial. The ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has seen the widespread use of advanced drones by both sides, with drones playing a central role in intelligence gathering, surveillance, and targeting. Russia, in particular, has invested heavily in electronic warfare (EW) systems to jam communications and disrupt GPS signals, posing a significant challenge to Ukrainian forces. Shield AI’s V-BAT has proven itself as a potential game-changer in this domain, offering Ukrainian forces a tactical advantage by maintaining functionality even in a high-intensity EW environment. The V-BAT is a remarkable example of the next generation of drone technology, designed with a hybrid propulsion system that combines the best of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing technologies. This allows the drone to perform vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL) like a helicopter, while also achieving long-range, high-speed flight similar to traditional airplanes. This unique combination of capabilities gives the V-BAT a versatility that sets it apart from other drones, making it suitable for a wide range of missions, from ISR to precision strikes, without the need for traditional runways or landing zones. Its compact size and ability to carry payloads such as high-definition cameras, radar systems, and precision targeting equipment further enhance its mission flexibility. In contrast to traditional drones, which often struggle with endurance or the need for vast operational spaces, the V-BAT excels in long-endurance, long-duration flights. While most VTOL drones are limited by their battery life and operational time, the V-BAT can remain airborne for up to 12 hours, providing extended operational coverage without frequent recharging or refueling. Its hybrid propulsion system makes this extended endurance possible, which allows it to transition from vertical takeoff to efficient fixed-wing flight once airborne, significantly increasing its range and mission duration. This feature is especially important in contested environments like Ukraine, where long-range, persistent surveillance is essential for real-time intelligence gathering and operational planning. Another key differentiator of the V-BAT is its resilience to electronic warfare (EW). In modern conflicts, electronic warfare has become an increasingly vital tool for adversaries, with systems designed to disrupt communications, degrade GPS signals, and jam drones. Russia has employed sophisticated EW tactics in the ongoing war, seeking to neutralize Ukrainian drone capabilities.

Exclusive: Iran Unveils Underground Missile Facility Housing Advanced Ballistic Systems	On January 10, 2025, Iran unveiled a highly secretive underground missile facility, marking a significant milestone in its expanding ballistic missile capabilities. The unveiling, captured in a video released by Iranian media, featured a ceremony attended by key figures from the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), including Major General Hossein Salami, the IRGC Commander, and Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the IRGC Aerospace Force. While only about 10% of the facility was revealed to the public, the video highlighted its strategic importance, showcasing Iran's growing missile capabilities and its commitment to enhancing its defense posture.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from Iranian media showing the newly unveiled underground missile facility, housing advanced systems like the Emad, Qadr, and Qiam, showcasing Iran’s growing missile capabilities. Released on January 10, 2025. (Picture source: Iranian TV) In the video footage, the underground base is shown to house some of Iran's most advanced liquid-fueled ballistic missiles, including the Emad, Qadr, and Qiam ballistic missile systems. Each of these missiles plays a crucial role in Iran’s military strategy, acting as both a deterrent and an offensive tool in its arsenal The Emad missile is a long-range liquid-fueled missile developed by Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO). It is known for its advanced precision guidance system, which allows it to strike targets with remarkable accuracy—within a few hundred meters. With a range of approximately 1,700 kilometers, the Emad is capable of targeting strategic locations throughout the Middle East, including U.S. military bases and allied nations. This missile is capable of carrying both conventional and potentially nuclear payloads, though Iran insists its missile program remains focused on conventional defense. The Emad's high maneuverability and sophisticated guidance make it a formidable weapon, enhancing Iran's ability to launch precise strikes and complicating interception by missile defense systems. The Qadr is an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that extends Iran's strike capabilities to targets beyond its immediate borders. With a range of 1,800 to 2,000 kilometers, the Qadr missile is capable of striking regional targets, including military bases and key infrastructure across the Middle East. An evolution of the earlier Shahab-3, the Qadr offers enhanced accuracy, payload capacity, and range. This missile can be equipped with both conventional warheads—such as high-explosive or chemical payloads—and potentially nuclear warheads. Its liquid-fuel propulsion provides flexibility in payload capacity but requires more preparation time compared to solid-fueled missiles. Despite this, the Qadr's advanced guidance and control systems make it a highly reliable and potent weapon for long-range precision strikes. The Qiam is a short-to-medium range ballistic missile that distinguishes itself with its solid-fuel propulsion system and advanced inertial navigation. With a range of 800 to 1,000 kilometers, the Qiam is designed for precise, rapid strikes against regional targets. Unlike the Emad and Qadr, the Qiam missile’s compact design and solid fuel enable faster preparation and launch, providing operational flexibility. It is capable of carrying both conventional and potentially nuclear warheads, and its high accuracy—with a reported targeting error of less than 500 meters—makes it ideal for hitting critical infrastructure such as air defense systems and command centers. The Qiam’s mobility and quick-launch capability make it particularly effective in asymmetric warfare scenarios, where speed and unpredictability are crucial. The decision to house these advanced missile systems in an underground facility underscores the importance of ensuring the survivability of Iran’s strategic assets. The facility provides protection from potential airstrikes, which have long been a threat to Iran's missile and nuclear infrastructure, particularly from Israel and the United States. By storing missiles underground, Iran secures its missile capabilities, ensuring they remain operational even in the event of a large-scale conflict. The subterranean base also complicates any preemptive strike attempts, as the full scope of Iran’s missile network remains difficult to assess. Moreover, the underground facility enhances the strategic depth of Iran’s missile deterrence. In an era of advanced surveillance technologies, such as satellites and reconnaissance drones, underground storage ensures that Iran's missile assets remain hidden and protected. This, in turn, increases the survivability of its missiles, making them harder to detect and neutralize. The unveiling of this underground missile facility signals a growing sophistication in Iran’s missile capabilities and its commitment to a self-sufficient defense posture. These missiles—Emad, Qadr, and Qiam—represent key components of Iran’s broader strategy to project power and deter foreign intervention in the Middle East. With a combination of long-range, precision-guided systems and advanced propulsion technologies, Iran’s missile arsenal significantly strengthens its ability to strike critical targets across the region. For regional neighbors and global powers, particularly the U.S. and Israel, this development presents a renewed challenge to existing defense strategies. Iran’s growing missile capabilities, along with the protective measures taken to safeguard them, contribute to an increasingly complex security landscape. As tensions persist in the region, this new underground facility serves as both a message of strength and a reminder of the evolving balance of power in the Middle East. The underground missile facility housing Iran's Emad, Qadr, and Qiam systems is a key development in the country’s missile program. With their increased range, accuracy, and survivability, these missile systems contribute to Iran’s deterrence capabilities and bolster its position in the regional security environment. This development will undoubtedly have significant implications for the security dynamics of the Middle East, influencing defense policies and shaping the strategies of both regional and global powers.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-iran-unveils-underground-missile-facility-housing-advanced-ballistic-systems	2025-01-11T06:16:16-08:00
