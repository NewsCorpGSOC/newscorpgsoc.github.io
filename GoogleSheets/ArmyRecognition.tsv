At the same time, the Pentagon made a significant decision regarding the future of F-35 propulsion. It opted not to adopt the engines developed under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP) by Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE Aerospace. While these engines promised a 30% performance improvement over the F135 engine, they were not compatible with the F-35B variant used by the Marine Corps, which requires short take-off and vertical landing capabilities. Adapting them to the Navy's F-35C variant would have also posed technical challenges. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall expressed his regret last year that the service could not include the development and production of the AETP engines in the fiscal year 2025 budget request. However, the Pentagon insisted on maintaining compatibility among all F-35 variants for both U.S. and international users, leading to the choice of the Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) as the preferred solution. Despite the abandonment of the AETP program, Pratt &amp; Whitney claims that the ECU will incorporate many innovations developed under AETP. A company spokesperson emphasized that 'over 1,200 F135 engines have been produced, with over 900,000 flight hours logged.' These figures highlight the significance of this engine for the global F-35 fleet. The PTMU program and the decisions surrounding the future of the F-35’s energy and cooling management system will play a crucial role in optimizing the aircraft’s performance and reducing long-term maintenance costs. Fall 2024 will mark a pivotal moment with the contract award and the start of the next development phase for the F-35, one of the most costly and strategic armament programs in the United States.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/lockheed-martin-given-authority-to-choose-contractor-for-f-35-fighter-jets-power-and-thermal-management-system-program	2024-10-02T03:30:38-07:00	
India set to finalize deal for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets after major price cut	According to information published by Times of India on September 30, 2024, India is on the verge of sealing a deal with France for the acquisition of 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets, which are expected to enhance the Indian Navy's operational capabilities aboard its aircraft carriers.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Rafale-M fighter aircraft. (Picture source: Dassault) After a series of negotiations spanning over a year, a final price has been reached, marking a considerable reduction from initial estimates. The agreement, anticipated to be signed soon, is closely modeled on the 2016 contract that saw the Indian Air Force acquire 36 Rafale jets. Discussions around the deal have gained momentum ahead of National Security Advisor Ajit Doval's visit to Paris, where talks will likely cover both the fighter jets and a separate order for three additional Kalvari class submarines to be constructed in Mumbai. These discussions are set within the framework of India and France's robust defense partnership. The Rafale Marine jets are intended to operate from India's aircraft carriers, addressing a critical requirement for 26 carrier-borne fighters. Following extensive evaluations of both Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and Dassault's Rafale M, the Indian Navy opted for the Rafale on technical grounds. The aircraft is seen as a suitable complement to the Air Force's fleet, and will be equipped with advanced anti-ship weaponry and long-range fuel tanks optimized for maritime operations. Additionally, the Rafale Ms will come equipped with the Meteor beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles, one of the most advanced systems of its kind in the region. The acquisition is being conducted through the government-to-government route, similar to the previous deal for the Air Force. Recent amendments by the Defence Acquisition Council, led by Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, streamlined the process. This included the removal of plans to integrate Indian radar and weapon systems into the naval jets, a decision made due to the high costs and an estimated eight-year timeline for completion. While this purchase of Rafale Marine jets is seen as a temporary solution, it bridges the gap until India's Aeronautical Development Agency completes its indigenous twin-engine deck-based fighter project.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/india-set-to-finalize-deal-for-26-rafale-marine-fighter-jets-after-major-price-cut	2024-10-02T02:29:03-07:00	
Imminent Stationing of Nearly 100 Leopard 2 A8 Tanks in Lithuania: A New Force Against Russian Threat	On October 1, 2024, Lithuanian Minister of National Defense, Laurynas Kasčiūnas, reaffirmed in an interview with the television channel LRT the government's intention to order Leopard 2 main battle tanks by the end of the year. This statement marks a crucial step in a project that has been ongoing since the beginning of the year, initiated under the leadership of Arvydas Anušauskas, the previous Minister of Defense. Anušauskas had previously announced the formation of a Lithuanian tank battalion designed to be fully interoperable with German forces. During initial discussions, it was determined that the Leopard 2 A8 was the most efficient and suitable tank to meet the requirements of the Lithuanian Army.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces (Picture source: ArmyRecognition) The Leopard 2A8 is the latest evolution in the Leopard 2 family of main battle tanks, developed by German companies KMW and Rheinmetall. This modern tank is equipped with a 120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun, capable of firing a variety of munitions, including the programmable DM11 for precise strikes. The Leopard 2A8 also features an advanced protection system, integrating next-generation multi-layered armor and the Israeli Trophy Active Protection System (APS), providing an effective defense against anti-tank missiles and rockets. The tank boasts impressive mobility thanks to its 1,600-horsepower engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 70 km/h and overcome various obstacles, with an operational range of 450 kilometers. In terms of crew protection and safety, the Leopard 2A8 is equipped with reinforced armor, particularly around the turret and hull, to enhance its resistance to mines and other modern threats. Its advanced fire control system allows for exceptional precision, even while on the move, and its optical systems, such as third-generation thermal imaging, ensure increased visibility in adverse conditions. Additionally, this tank is equipped with an NBC protection system against nuclear, biological, and chemical threats, ensuring the survival of the crew in hostile environments. Lithuania aims to build a powerful land division capable of addressing the region's growing security needs. In July, Kasčiūnas spoke about strengthening the heavy combat capabilities of the Lithuanian army, mentioning the possible acquisition of a tracked infantry fighting vehicle in addition to the Leopard 2. However, he also noted that the number of combat vehicles to be ordered would depend directly on available financial resources, indicating that the extent of the project would be contingent on the budget. The Leopard 2 A8, the latest version of the renowned German battle tank, was first presented to the public during the Eurosatory 2024 exhibition. Minister Kasčiūnas confirmed that the platform selected for equipping Lithuanian forces would undoubtedly be the Leopard. At the same time, Lithuania seeks to enhance its military arsenal with the acquisition of other vehicles and systems, including Boxer armored personnel carriers (known as Vilkas in Lithuania) and air defense systems. However, the current priority remains the establishment of this tank battalion, in close cooperation with Germany. Negotiations on the contract for these tanks are progressing rapidly. Kasčiūnas indicated that the Lithuanian National Defense Council would meet by the end of October to finalize decisions related to this acquisition project. The minister also hinted that negotiations with the KNDS consortium, responsible for producing the Leopard, were already well advanced. If the Council gives the green light, the contract could be signed as early as November 2024. Protection features of the Leopard 2A8 include multi-layered armor combining steel, tungsten, composite filler, and ceramic components, along with the EuroTrophy Active Protection System (APS) for 360-degree coverage against projectiles. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Cooperation with Germany involves two major aspects. Firstly, the Lithuanian tank battalion will be structured similarly to that of the German army, with 44 tanks divided into three companies. With a small reserve added, Lithuania's order would amount to around 50 tanks, a number previously discussed during preliminary talks. Secondly, Lithuania will acquire the same modernized version of the Leopard 2 A8, identical to the one that will equip the German tank battalion. On the German side, the tank battalion of the combat forces brigade, which is expected to reach full operational capacity by 2027, will also be equipped with Leopard 2 A8 tanks, with deliveries starting in 2025. This battalion will be outfitted with 44 Leopard 2 A8 tanks, ensuring a formidable strike force. Thus, by 2030, at least 94 Leopard 2 A8 tanks are expected to be stationed in Lithuania, forming a significant defense capability in coordination with Lithuanian and German forces. This strategic deployment is particularly critical in a sensitive area: the Suwalki Corridor, a narrow strip of land linking the Baltic states to the rest of Europe and separating Belarus from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. This region represents a crucial point in NATO's defense against potential threats from Russia. By strengthening its military capabilities with state-of-the-art equipment such as the Leopard 2 A8, Lithuania aims to increase its defense autonomy while reinforcing its integration into NATO's military framework. This project reflects the country's commitment to adapting to new security realities and being ready to respond effectively to any potential escalation of regional tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/imminent-stationing-of-nearly-100-leopard-2-a8-tanks-in-lithuania-a-new-force-against-russian-threat	2024-10-02T02:06:36-07:00	
US Air Force retires last KC-10 Extender tanker aircraft after 44 years of service	On September 26, 2024, a ceremony at Travis Air Force Base in California marked the decommissioning of the last U.S. Air Force KC-10 Extender after 44 years of service. The event was attended by military personnel, veterans, local community leaders, and base members. The KC-10, used primarily for air refueling operations, was formally retired in a ceremony led by Col. Jay Johnson, commander of the 60th Air Mobility Wing.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The KC-10 Extender was developed during the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program following logistical challenges during the Vietnam War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which highlighted the need for long-range refueling and cargo support. (Picture source: US DoD) The KC-10, based on the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, entered service in 1981 and supported various missions, including combat and humanitarian operations, as well as fostering partnerships with allied forces. It played a role in enabling the U.S. Air Force to conduct long-range air refueling operations globally. In a video message, Gen. David W. Allvin, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, noted the KC-10's contribution to air refueling and its role in maintaining the U.S. military’s global reach. The aircraft served from its time in Strategic Air Command to its more recent operations. The U.S. Air Force began retiring the KC-10 fleet in 2020, with the last aircraft completing its final mission on September 26, 2024, marking the end of the KC-10’s service. Following retirement, the KC-10 will be sent to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. This facility is responsible for the storage, parts reclamation, and preservation of aircraft for the U.S. military, government agencies, and allied forces. The KC-10 will be replaced by the KC-46A Pegasus, with 88 of the new aircraft delivered by September 2024. The McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender, a tanker and cargo aircraft, served the U.S. Air Force for over four decades. Developed from the civilian DC-10 airliner, the KC-10 expanded the Air Force's refueling capabilities, supplementing the KC-135 Stratotanker fleet. The KC-10 was developed during the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program following logistical challenges during the Vietnam War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which highlighted the need for long-range refueling and cargo support. The US Air Force began retiring the KC-10 fleet in 2020, with the first KC-10 Extender ever produced arriving at Dover Air Force Base on April 26, 2022, for its retirement and display at the Air Mobility Command museum. (Picture source: US DoD) A total of 60 KC-10s were produced between 1979 and 1987, and the aircraft entered service in March 1981. The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) also operated two modified KDC-10s, converted from DC-10s. These tankers supported U.S. military operations worldwide, including missions such as the 1986 bombing of Libya, the Gulf War, and operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The KC-10’s fuel and cargo capacities made it suitable for both refueling and strategic airlift missions. The KC-10’s design included modifications for military use, such as additional fuel tanks that increased its capacity to 161,478 kilograms—nearly double that of the KC-135. The aircraft was equipped with both a boom-and-drogue refueling system, allowing it to refuel a range of aircraft, including those of the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and allied forces. The refueling boom, positioned at the rear, delivered fuel at a rate of 4,180 liters per minute. The KC-10 could carry up to 170,000 pounds (77,110 kilograms) of cargo, transporting 25 pallets and 16 passengers, or 17 pallets and 75 passengers over a range of 7,040 kilometers without needing to refuel. The Royal Netherlands Air Force used KDC-10s for both refueling and transport missions, including humanitarian, peacekeeping, and military operations. These aircraft were eventually replaced by Airbus A330 MRTT tankers, and the remaining KDC-10s were sold to Omega Aerial Refueling Services, a civilian contractor that continues to operate similar aircraft. As a reminder, the McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender is a three-engine aircraft with a length of 55.35 meters, a wingspan of 50.41 meters, and a height of 17.7 meters. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 267,619 kilograms. Powered by three General Electric F103 (GE CF6-50C2) turbofan engines, each providing 234 kilonewtons of thrust, the KC-10 reaches a top speed of 866 kilometers per hour (Mach 0.89) and has a range of 7,100 kilometers with passengers and cargo.

French Navy deploys frigate from Toulon amid Middle East conflict escalation	According to information published by Nicolas Cuoco in JDD on October 1, 2024, France has mobilized naval forces, including the departure of a frigate from Toulon, in response to the escalating conflict in the Middle East.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Navy's La Fayette-class frigate Guépratte. (Picture source: US DoD) France's recent deployment of a frigate from Toulon as tensions rise in the Middle East presents two possible vessel options: the FS Guépratte, a La Fayette-class frigate, or one of the advanced FREMM (Frégate Européenne Multi-Mission) frigates. The FS Guépratte, a vessel with a legacy rooted in French naval tradition, exemplifies a design optimized for specific operational scenarios. Typically, ships like the Guépratte are engineered with a focus on anti-submarine warfare and surface combat, reflecting the strategic priorities during the periods they were commissioned. Their technical specifications often include a balanced mix of armaments, such as torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, alongside sophisticated sonar systems tailored for detecting and neutralizing underwater threats. The propulsion systems in such frigates are designed to offer a combination of speed and endurance, enabling sustained operations in varied maritime environments. In contrast, the FREMM class represents a more contemporary approach to frigate design, embodying advancements in technology and multi-mission flexibility. These vessels are characterized by their modular design, which allows for rapid reconfiguration to suit different mission profiles, whether it be anti-aircraft, anti-surface, or humanitarian operations. The FREMM frigates are equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and weaponry, including vertical launch systems capable of deploying a range of missiles for air defense and land attack roles. Their propulsion systems are often more efficient, providing enhanced speed and range, which is crucial for global deployments and extended missions far from home bases. Adding another layer to France's maritime strategy, the deployment of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship underscores the multifaceted nature of the French Navy's current operations. The Mistral class, renowned for its ability to project power and provide humanitarian assistance, has been tasked with supporting the approximately 20,000 French nationals in Lebanon. This deployment highlights the French Navy's commitment not only to strategic military objectives but also to the protection and evacuation of its citizens in regions experiencing instability. The Mistral's capabilities in transporting troops, vehicles, and equipment, combined with its extensive medical facilities and helicopter operations, make it an indispensable asset in crisis scenarios	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navy-deploys-frigate-from-toulon-amid-middle-east-conflict-escalation	2024-10-02T01:36:38-07:00	
Israel Under Iranian Fire: How Air Defense Withstood Wave of Ballistic Missiles	On October 1, 2024, Israel was the target of a massive attack by Iran, which launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles in retaliation for the elimination of senior leaders from Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. This assault, considered one of the largest ballistic missile strikes against a nation-state, tested Israel's air defense system. Despite intercepting many missiles, videos circulating on social media show some reaching the ground, raising questions about the effectiveness and limitations of Israel's air defense capabilities.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Various screenshots from videos showing the multiple strikes carried out by Iran on Israel (Picture source: X Channel @ELINTNews) Functioning of Israel's Air Defense System Israel's air defense is a multilayered system that intercepts various aerial threats at different altitudes and ranges. This system primarily consists of three elements: Iron Dome: Deployed since 2011, this system is designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells (ranging between 4 and 70 kilometers). The Iron Dome uses radar to identify threats and assess if they are likely to hit populated areas. If a threat is confirmed, a Tamir interceptor is launched to neutralize it. The cost per interception is estimated between $40,000 and $50,000. IRON DOME, the most deployed air defense system, has intercepted 5000+ rockets with an over 90% success rate since 2011. (Picture source: Rafael) David’s Sling: This more advanced system covers medium to long ranges, intercepting short-range ballistic missiles and large-caliber rockets. Its Stunner interceptor can neutralize targets up to 300 kilometers away. Unlike the Iron Dome, the Stunner does not carry an explosive warhead but destroys its target through direct impact, increasing interception accuracy. However, the cost per interception is significantly higher, around $1 million per missile. Arrow 2 and Arrow 3: These systems are designed to intercept medium- to long-range ballistic missiles, including those reaching the exo-atmosphere. Arrow 3, in particular, can intercept missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere, neutralizing potential threats equipped with weapons of mass destruction. The cost of intercepting a missile with the Arrow 2 or Arrow 3 can reach up to $3.5 million per missile. Each layer of the system is designed to address specific types of threats, providing in-depth defense. Sophisticated radars and command and control centers coordinate efforts to ensure maximum coverage. David's Sling, developed by Israel in 2006 and operational since 2017, forms the middle layer of defense against cruise and lower-tier ballistic missiles, while the Arrow-3 interceptor, deployed the same year, protects against long-range ballistic missile threats (Picture source: MDA/IDF) Analysis of Effectiveness during the Iranian Attack During the attack on October 1, Israel successfully intercepted a significant portion of the Iranian missiles using its multilayered defense system. However, videos circulating show missiles hitting the ground, raising several questions: System Saturation: Iran launched nearly 200 missiles in a single wave over a few hours, potentially attempting to overwhelm Israel's defenses. Even with an advanced system, there is a limit to how many threats can be addressed simultaneously. Evolving Threats: Iran may have used hypersonic Fattah missiles, capable of maneuvering and traveling at speeds up to Mach 13-15, which present a significant challenge for current interception systems. These missiles are designed to be difficult to detect and intercept. While Arrow 3 is intended to counter such threats, hypersonic technology complicates early detection and interception efforts. Engagement Strategy: Israel’s defense systems prioritize threats based on their trajectory. If a missile is predicted to land in an unpopulated area, it may be left unintercepted to preserve costly interceptors for more critical threats. Operators may choose not to intercept certain missiles to conserve resources, especially if they do not directly threaten lives or critical infrastructure. However, reports of missiles hitting a military base in Nevatim may suggest otherwise. Video of the missile impacts in Israel pic.twitter.com/OZPLMe5zEn Cost and Logistics: Intercepting each missile carries a significant financial cost. In the context of a massive attack, decision-makers must balance the use of available resources with the need to protect the most sensitive areas. The presence of Iranian missiles that reached Israeli soil does not necessarily indicate a failure of the defense system. It may reflect the physical limitations of the system, which can only handle a certain number of missiles at a time due to reaction times and available interceptors. The Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, highlighted the challenges faced by Israel’s air defense system. While largely effective in intercepting the majority of the missiles, the system is not foolproof. The saturation effect from a large number of missiles, the introduction of new adversary technologies, and logistical and financial constraints are all factors that can allow certain threats to pass through the defense network. This situation underscores the importance for Israel to continue investing in research and development to improve its defense capabilities while adapting its strategies to evolving threats. Ongoing cooperation with international partners, such as the United States, also remains crucial to maintaining a technological and operational advantage, as well as participating in joint defense efforts during such events.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/israel-under-iranian-fire-how-air-defense-withstood-wave-of-ballistic-missiles	2024-10-02T01:36:10-07:00	
Philippines Strengthens Its Defense with Indian BrahMos Supersonic Missiles and Twin-Missile Launchers	On September 25, 2024, BrahMos Aerospace unveiled for the first time at the ADAS event a model of the mobile BrahMos launcher that will be operated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). This model, which displays missiles mounted on a Czechoslovakian Tatra 6x6 vehicle, highlighted the twin-missile launcher specifically chosen by the Philippines. This configuration contrasts with the three-missile launchers used by the Indian Armed Forces. The displayed model also featured jungle camouflage, adopted by the AFP for its tropical operations. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link BrahMos Supersonic Missile and its Twin-Missile Launcher (Picture source: Philippines MoD) According to the Twitter account Noise Alerts, the first batch of BrahMos supersonic missiles was delivered to the Philippines on April 19, 2024. Transported by an Indian Air Force IL-76TD aircraft, these missiles were delivered to the Philippine Marine Corps in Manila, accompanied by ground launch systems. This delivery, part of a $375 million agreement signed in 2022, marks the first time India has exported the BrahMos missile system. The Philippine Marine Corps confirmed that each BrahMos missile battery would consist of only two missile launchers. The BrahMos cruise missile, named after the Brahmaputra River in India and the Moscow River in Russia, is the result of a joint development between India and Russia. Based on the Russian SS-N-26 (3M55 Oniks/Yakhont/Bastion) missile, this supersonic missile is designed to engage land and sea targets with remarkable precision. BrahMos Aerospace, the company responsible for its development, was established in 1998 as a joint venture between India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyeniya. The BrahMos missiles will be operated by the Coastal Defense Regiment of the Philippine Marines. A BrahMos Aerospace representative stated to AMR that all deliveries are expected to be completed by next year. He also highlighted that India is considering replacing the imported Tatra vehicles with Indian-origin models for future deliveries. The BrahMos missile is equipped with a conventional warhead weighing between 200 and 300 kg, capable of delivering impact energy nine times greater than that of subsonic cruise missiles. The BrahMos missiles can be fitted with either a high-explosive semi-armor-piercing warhead or a submunition payload weighing between 200 and 300 kg. They can be launched from vertical or ramp launch systems, or in the case of the submarine version, from submerged vessels. In 2013, the missile was successfully tested from a submerged barge, demonstrating its capability to be deployed on missile-armed submarines. The Philippines announced the agreement with BrahMos Aerospace in January 2022 for the acquisition of three missile batteries. This contract, valued at $375 million, also includes operator and maintenance training as well as an Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package. The requirement for this advanced weapon system was formally conceptualized in 2017 and approved by the Office of the Philippine President for inclusion in the Horizon 2 Priority Projects in 2020. In India, BrahMos Aerospace was also selected to supply next-generation long-range mobile coastal maritime batteries to the Indian Navy under an agreement signed in March 2023, valued at $200 million. The BrahMos missile, also designated as PJ-10, is a joint military project between India and Russia, combining the expertise of DRDO and NPO Mashinostroyeniya. In service since 2001, it can be launched from various platforms, including submarines, ships, fighter jets, and land-based mobile launchers. It can reach supersonic speeds between Mach 2 and Mach 3. Since India's induction into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 2016, versions of the BrahMos missile have achieved increased ranges of up to 900 km, compared to 290 km for the export version. With its stealth capabilities, advanced guidance system, and fire-and-forget mode, the BrahMos represents a major asset in modern arsenals. This phase of BrahMos deliveries to the Philippines not only strengthens military cooperation between India and Southeast Asian countries but also boosts the Philippines' coastal defense capabilities in the face of growing regional threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/philippines-strengthens-its-defense-with-indian-brahmos-supersonic-missiles-and-twin-missile-launchers	2024-10-02T00:58:37-07:00	
What Missiles Were Used in Iran's Strike on Israel?	On October 1, 2024, a large-scale attack orchestrated by Iran hit Israeli soil, marking a significant turning point in the ongoing conflict between the two nations. As part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' Iranian forces deployed a vast arsenal, including 120 ballistic missiles (including Emads), 170 drones, and 30 hypersonic missiles, among them the Fatah-2.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Images of Emad MRBMs launched at Israel during Operation True Promise 2. (Picture source: Iranian Media) The 120 ballistic missiles used in this attack notably included the Emad, a medium-range missile capable of striking targets nearly 1,700 kilometers away with improved accuracy. Thanks to its terminal guidance system, these missiles can adjust their trajectory in the final phase of flight, thus increasing their effectiveness. This coordinated attack also saw the use of 170 drones, another crucial component of Iran’s military strategy. Drones have become indispensable weapons in modern warfare, and Iran’s attack on Israel featured a significant number of them. However, the most concerning aspect of this offensive lies in the deployment of 30 hypersonic missiles, a first in this conflict. Among them, the Fatah-2 was used for the first time in a conflict. This hypersonic missile, capable of flying at a speed of Mach 13, stands out due to its ability to evade conventional defense systems thanks to its high-speed maneuverability. With an estimated range of 1,400 kilometers, the Fatah-2 can not only reach its targets in record time but it is also designed to change course during flight, making interception extremely difficult. Its payload, tailored for precision strikes, makes it a formidable weapon for attacks on critical infrastructure. This coordinated offensive severely tested Israeli defense systems, notably the Iron Dome and Arrow anti-missile batteries. While these systems successfully intercepted part of the ballistic missiles and drones, the threat posed by hypersonic missiles like the Fatah-2 remains a significant concern. Current anti-missile defense systems struggle to keep up with these ultra-fast weapons, giving Iran a clear strategic advantage in its pursuit of deterrence against Israel. So far, no precise figures have demonstrated how effectively the Fatah-2 was intercepted, but Iranian officials have claimed that 90% of the means employed in the attack reached their targets. The October 1 attack thus marks an escalation in hostilities between Iran and Israel, not only due to the impressive quantity of weaponry deployed but also because of the advanced quality of these attack systems. Iran has demonstrated its ability to carry out a complex offensive, integrating drones, precision ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles, thereby pushing the limits of Israeli defenses. The drones disrupted detection systems and weakened rapid response capabilities, while Emad ballistic missiles and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles targeted infrastructure. The Emad-1, in particular, is a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) developed by Iran and used since 2015 by the Aerospace Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGCASF). It represents an important milestone in Iran’s ballistic capabilities, being one of the first weapons of its kind to incorporate an advanced guidance system, thus improving its accuracy compared to previous models. The Emad-1 missile is powered by liquid fuel, a technology that, while older than solid propellants, allows for greater flexibility in adjusting parameters before launch. With a diameter of 1.25 meters, the Emad is designed to carry a single warhead, enabling it to strike targets up to 1,700 kilometers away. This range allows it to hit targets across much of the Middle East, including Israel, with notable precision. Indeed, the missile boasts a circular error probable (CEP) of 50 meters, meaning its margin of error at impact is relatively small, a significant improvement over older ballistic systems. This makes the Emad a formidable weapon for targeted strikes on strategic infrastructure. The October 1, 2024, attack symbolizes a rise in tensions between Iran and Israel, with the use of a sophisticated and varied arsenal, including ballistic missiles, drones, and Fatah-2 hypersonic missiles. This offensive, carried out as part of 'Operation True Promise 2,' highlights the evolution of Iranian military capabilities and raises new questions about Israel’s defense systems' ability to cope with these threats. While the international community calls for calm, this escalation serves as a reminder of the fragility of the situation in the Middle East and the inherent risks of increasingly technological warfare.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/what-missiles-were-used-in-irans-strike-on-israel	2024-10-02T00:35:27-07:00	
Breaking News: US Navy aids Israel in missile defense amid major Iranian attack, Pentagon confirms	According to information published by the US DoD on October 1, 2024, the Pentagon has confirmed that the U.S. military coordinated closely with Israeli forces during a significant missile attack launched by Iran against Israel earlier. In a press briefing, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder detailed that Iran fired approximately 200 ballistic missiles, targeting various locations across Israel. In response, the U.S. provided critical defense assistance to its ally.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link US Navy's Arleigh-Burke class destroyer firing RIM-161 Standard Missile 3. (Picture source: Dvids) U.S. Navy destroyers deployed in the region, including the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, actively participated in the missile defense operation. These ships launched a dozen interceptors in an effort to neutralize the incoming threat, offering key support to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The specifics regarding the type of interceptor ordnance used were not disclosed, despite questions about whether the Navy utilized SM-3 missiles, a standard defense against ballistic missiles. Maj. Gen. Ryder emphasized the close coordination between the U.S. military and Israeli forces during the attack but refrained from providing further details on the defense measures. The attack underscores the ongoing tensions in the region and the U.S.'s commitment to defending its allies. Technical analysis The coordination between the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole during the recent missile defense operation highlights the sophisticated capabilities of modern naval platforms and their integration with advanced missile systems like the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3). Both vessels, being Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, are equipped with the Aegis Combat System, which serves as the cornerstone for their multi-mission versatility, particularly in ballistic missile defense (BMD). The Aegis system integrates powerful radar suites, such as the AN/SPY-1D multi-function radar, which provides the necessary detection, tracking, and discrimination of incoming ballistic threats. These destroyers leverage the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability, enabling them to engage and intercept ballistic missiles during various phases of their trajectory. The USS Bulkeley and USS Cole, outfitted with the Aegis BMD configuration, possess the requisite command and control infrastructure to process complex threat environments and coordinate defensive measures in real-time. The SM-3 is a key component of the Aegis BMD system, designed to engage short to intermediate-range ballistic missiles during their midcourse phase outside the Earth’s atmosphere. The missile employs a hit-to-kill kinetic warhead, relying on precise guidance and propulsion systems to achieve successful interception. Its flight trajectory allows it to engage targets at ranges extending beyond several hundred kilometers, providing a robust defensive envelope against diverse missile threats. The propulsion and guidance systems of the SM-3 are engineered for high maneuverability and accuracy, essential for countering agile ballistic missiles. The missile’s two-stage design comprises a solid rocket booster for initial propulsion and a second stage equipped with a thrust vector control system, enhancing its ability to adjust flight paths dynamically during interception. Additionally, the SM-3’s active radar seeker provides terminal guidance, allowing for precise targeting and minimizing the risk of collateral damage. The interoperability between the U.S. Navy destroyers and Israeli defense systems likely involved the sharing of real-time data and coordinated engagement strategies. Such collaboration enhances the overall defensive posture, enabling both forces to leverage their respective technological strengths and operational expertise.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/breaking-news-us-navy-aids-israel-in-missile-defense-amid-major-iranian-attack-pentagon-confirms	2024-10-02T00:25:14-07:00

US Army Orders Retired M60 Machine Guns: Mystery Surrounds Recipient	This week, the U.S. Army Contracting Command in Newark, New Jersey, awarded a $14.96 million contract to U.S. Ordnance, a company based in Sparks, Nevada, for an unspecified number of M60E4 and M60E6 machine guns. The contract also includes spare parts, accessories, conversion kits, and training services, raising many questions within the defense community. The U.S. Army largely phased out the M60 machine gun decades ago, prompting speculation about the recipient and the operational needs for these weapons.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A United States Navy SEAL pictured holding a M60E4 machine gun. (Picture source: US DoD) The M60 machine gun, chambered in 7.62x51 mm, was developed in the late 1940s and entered service in the 1950s. Inspired by the German MG-42 and FG-42 automatic rifles from World War II, the M60 was widely used during the Cold War and became iconic during the Vietnam War. Over the years, several variants were introduced, adapted for infantry, vehicles, aircraft, and naval platforms. However, the M60 was gradually replaced by the M240B in U.S. Army service. The M60E4 and M60E6, also known as the MK43, are modernized versions of the original machine gun. These newer variants are lighter, shorter, and feature improvements such as accessory rails and an upgraded gas system for better reliability. Despite these enhancements, they have not been widely adopted by the U.S. Army and are primarily used by foreign forces, such as the Danish Army, which became the first user of the M60E6 in 2014. Some U.S. special forces and training units still utilize these models. Danish Army soldier armed with M60E6 general-purpose machine gun (Picture source: Danish MoD) The contract awarded to U.S. Ordnance does not specify the exact number of machine guns or conversion kits to be delivered, and the Pentagon has remained tight-lipped about the details. This secrecy has led to speculation that these weapons could be intended for a foreign ally, such as Ukraine, as part of military aid. The U.S. has already mentioned the possibility of using the Excess Defense Articles (EDA) program to transfer surplus military equipment to partner countries, especially given the depletion of funds for new aid packages. It is also possible that the M60s are destined for other U.S. government entities or foreign allies. The origins of this contract remain unclear, but it reflects a renewed interest in a weapon that had largely been retired from active service in the United States. As the defense community speculates about the final destination of these machine guns, more details may emerge in the coming months, shedding light on the motivations behind this unexpected acquisition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-orders-retired-m60-machine-guns-mystery-surrounds-recipient	2024-10-01T04:49:52-07:00

These patrol boats come armed with two remotely operated Mk 38 Mod 2 25mm guns and can carry up to six M2 .50 caliber machine guns, along with M240 and M134 machine guns, and Mk 19 grenade launchers. Their aluminum hull allows them to reach speeds of 45 knots (over 80 km/h) with a range of up to 750 nautical miles (1,400 km) at cruising speeds of 25 knots. The vessels also have the capacity to carry small rubber boats and drones, such as the Switchblade 600, which Greece plans to acquire soon. Aegean Sea The Aegean Sea is dotted with over 2,000 islands and islets, many of which are located near Turkey’s coastline. This creates a challenging operational landscape for the Hellenic Armed Forces, particularly for patrolling, defense, and logistical support. The islands vary in size and infrastructure, complicating efforts to defend them and respond to emergencies or threats. The scattered nature of these islands also presents difficulties in maintaining a rapid and coordinated military presence, especially in remote areas. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes in the Aegean over territorial waters, airspace, and the continental shelf. Turkey's frequent military provocations, including airspace violations and naval exercises near Greek islands, continuously challenge Greece’s sovereignty. The need to defend Greek airspace and territorial waters from encroachments requires constant vigilance, with the Hellenic Air Force and Navy often engaging in intercept missions. The Aegean is a vital maritime corridor, not only for Greece but for Europe. The region faces threats from illegal activities such as smuggling, human trafficking, and illicit fishing operations. The Aegean has also been a key route for migrants and refugees, putting additional pressure on the Hellenic Coast Guard and Navy.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/greek-military-to-acquire-four-mark-vi-patrol-boats-for-special-operations-in-aegean	2024-10-01T04:44:30-07:00	
South Korea's new Hyunmoo-V monster missile promises nuclear-like destruction with nine-ton warhead	On October 1, 2024, South Korea unveiled its latest strategic missile, the Hyunmoo-V, during the Armed Forces Day parade commemorating the 76th anniversary of the military's founding. The event featured approximately 5,000 troops and nearly 100 pieces of heavy military equipment, marching through downtown Seoul. Streets were closed to accommodate tens of thousands of spectators, and a U.S. B-1B Lancer bomber made a rare flight over the capital, highlighting the close military ties between South Korea and the United States.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hyunmoo-V missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) Described by Seoul as a retaliatory weapon aimed at countering threats from North Korea, the Hyunmoo-V (nicknamed the 'monster missile' due to its capabilities) is capable of carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons. This substantial warhead is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. With a total weight of 36 tons and a thrust of 75 tons, the Hyunmoo-V follows a 'lofted trajectory,' flying through the exosphere to enhance its penetration capability before descending upon its target at speeds ten times faster than the speed of sound. Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, noted that the missile's transporter erector launcher can move all 18 wheels at roughly a 45-degree angle, allowing it to drive diagonally for enhanced mobility. The missile employs a unique cold-launch system, using compressed gas to propel it before ignition. This technique minimizes damage to the launcher and increases operational stability due to the missile's powerful solid propellant. Referred to as 'High Power Missiles' (HPM) by Seoul, both the Hyunmoo-IV-1 and Hyunmoo-V are designed to penetrate deeply buried command centers by detonating above underground facilities, effectively burying them. The exact maximum range of the Hyunmoo-V remains undisclosed, but experts speculate it could potentially reach distances of up to 3,000 kilometers or more, placing it in the category of intermediate-range missiles. Comparisons have been drawn to the U.S. Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile in terms of warhead weight and thrust, although the Hyunmoo-V is believed to be a two-stage missile. Carrying one of the world's largest conventional warheads, weighing up to nine tons, the Hyunmoo-V is designed to penetrate deeply buried tunnels and bunkers, potentially causing effects comparable to nuclear weapons without crossing the nuclear threshold. (Picture source: South Korean MoD) Hanwha Aerospace is the manufacturer of the Hyunmoo missiles, which are all equipped with evasion systems to counteract enemy air defense systems. The South Korean Strategic Command plans to have more than 200 Hyunmoo-V missiles alone. In addition to the V-series, new variants of the Hyunmoo-II, III, and IV missiles are being developed and mass-produced. South Korea refers to these missiles as 'Extreme Precision, High Power Missiles' or 'Ultra-powerful ballistic missiles,' rather than using conventional designations like Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile or intercontinental ballistic missile. There are also plans to mount the Hyunmoo-V missiles on the Joint Support Ship, which is described as the world's first arsenal ship. In early 2024, South Korea announced that it had successfully tested the Hyunmoo-V missile. Information about missile tests is often disclosed through Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), which are notifications issued to ensure airspace safety during missile-related activities. Analyses of NOTAMs suggest that the Hyunmoo-V tests likely took place on December 26 or 27, 2023, near Jeongjuk-Ri village on the west coast. The tests targeted a group of islands approximately 185 kilometers south of the launch point, a distance comparable to that between Seoul and Pyongyang. The public unveiling of these missiles aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. This system comprises three components: the 'Kill Chain,' the Korean Air and Missile Defense system (KAMD), and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan (KMPR). The public unveiling of both the Hyunmoo and L-SAM missile launchers aligns with South Korea's strategic investment in the '3K Defense System,' a multi-layered defense strategy designed to preempt and respond to North Korean missile threats. (Picture source: Korean Forces Network) The 'Kill Chain' component focuses on swift detection and engagement of North Korean missile threats, aiming to target nuclear and missile facilities before they can launch. It is said to have the capability to target mobile missile launchers within 30 minutes. The KAMD system is responsible for intercepting incoming missiles, providing a multi-layered defense for critical facilities and population centers. It employs the domestically produced Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missile (L-SAM) as an upper-tier interceptor capable of intercepting projectiles at altitudes up to 60 kilometers. The Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation Plan serves as a deterrent strategy, assuming that a North Korean attack has already been initiated. In such an event, South Korea would retaliate with a combination of precision missiles, advanced aircraft, and potentially special operations forces. The objectives would include countervalue and counterforce targets, as well as leadership decapitation strikes. These defense systems integrate capabilities across different branches of the South Korean military. The Army's Strategic Missile Command operates the Hyunmoo family of missiles in both the 'Kill Chain' and retaliation roles. The Air Force employs PAC-3 systems, F-35A jets, and Global Hawk surveillance aircraft. The Navy utilizes 3,000-ton submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles and KDX-III Aegis destroyers with SM-2 missiles. Future plans include integrating military surveillance satellites, cyber warfare units, space-focused forces, and special forces units into the defense network.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-koreas-new-hyunmoo-v-monster-missile-promises-nuclear-like-destruction-with-nine-ton-warhead	2024-10-01T04:30:57-07:00

Netherlands signs contract with Naval Group for four Barracuda-class submarines in major defense deal	According to a PR published by Naval Group on September 30, 2024, the Netherlands Ministry of Defense has signed a contract with Naval Group for the delivery of four Barracuda-class expeditionary submarines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Dutch Barracuda-class submarine. (Picture source: Naval Group) The agreement, formalized by Dutch State Secretary for Defence Gijs Tuinman and Naval Group CEO Pierre Eric Pommellet, took place at the Directie Materiële Instandhouding (DMI) in Den Helder, marking the official launch of the Orka-class program, which will replace the Royal Netherlands Navy’s aging Walrus-class submarines. The contract follows a rigorous evaluation and bidding process conducted by the Materiel and IT Command (COMMIT), which determined that Naval Group’s Orka-class submarines were the best solution for the Netherlands' future underwater capabilities. The program will enhance the Netherlands' strategic autonomy and deepen cooperation between the Dutch maritime industry and Naval Group, particularly in the development and maintenance of submarine systems over the next two decades. About the program Before Naval Group was selected, the Dutch government extensively evaluated the proposals from TKMS and Saab Kockums. TKMS, a German company, offered a design based on its Type 212/214 submarines, which are widely regarded for their advanced air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. These submarines are noted for their ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing, making them ideal for covert operations in shallow waters such as the Baltic Sea. Saab Kockums, on the other hand, presented a modified version of its A26 submarine, which is designed with modularity in mind and includes an AIP system. The A26’s strength lies in its versatility, allowing it to be configured for a wide range of missions, including intelligence gathering, anti-submarine warfare, and special forces operations. Saab Kockums also promised to heavily involve Dutch industry in its proposal, which was a crucial requirement for the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Both TKMS and Saab Kockums had strong offerings, and their submarines are well-regarded in the global market. However, Naval Group's proposal was ultimately deemed to offer superior capabilities for the Netherlands’ specific needs. One of the decisive factors was the ability of Naval Group to deliver a blue-water, ocean-going submarine capable of extended missions far from Dutch waters, while also ensuring long-term cooperation with Dutch industry. From a strategic standpoint, the Dutch government viewed the Naval Group’s Barracuda-class submarines as the best fit for NATO’s broader requirements. The Barracuda design is well-suited to both high-end warfare and intelligence operations in distant waters.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/netherlands-signs-contract-with-naval-group-for-four-barracuda-class-submarines-in-major-defense-deal	2024-10-01T00:04:14-07:00	
Taiwan warns of escalating Chinese military drills in Taiwan Strait	According to information published by Liberty Times Net September 30, 2024, the Chinese military has been conducting increasingly frequent exercises around Taiwan, with military aircraft and naval vessels regularly intruding near the island.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Tuo Chiang-class corvette Tuo Chiang. (Picture source: Taiwanese Ministry of Defense) In a recent report from Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense, officials warn that China aims to 'internalize' the Taiwan Strait by combining military actions with law enforcement operations, such as deploying Chinese coast guard vessels to patrol Taiwan's eastern waters. The report outlines four key tactics China has employed to pressure Taiwan. These include joint readiness patrols, gray zone tactics, large-scale targeted military drills, and coordinated training operations. Among these tactics, joint readiness patrols have been a recurring feature, with Chinese forces conducting combined air and naval operations three to four times a month. These actions, according to the Ministry of Defense, are intended to intensify the military threat against Taiwan. Following an incident in the waters near Kinmen and Xiamen earlier this year, Chinese coast guard patrols have also increased in the areas surrounding Taiwan's outlying islands, such as Kinmen and Matsu. Notably, during large-scale military drills held on May 23-24, China organized coast guard patrols in Taiwan’s eastern waters under the guise of law enforcement, furthering its goal of asserting control over the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese defense officials also foresee the integration of China's new 'Coast Guard Law,' which authorizes the use of force by Chinese coast guard units during maritime operations. They predict that China will increasingly resort to a combination of legal, cognitive, and gray zone warfare tactics to harass Taiwan. The report also highlights recent activities involving China's aircraft carrier Shandong, which completed its 36th training mission from June 22 to July 23, traversing the South China Sea and Western Pacific. The Shandong was accompanied by various warplanes, including the H-6K bomber, conducting joint training across the island chains stretching to Taiwan’s southwest and the Western Pacific. These activities are part of China’s effort to demonstrate its capabilities in anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategies through planned joint training. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense has concluded that China is testing its ability to both invade Taiwan and counter potential foreign intervention by combining conventional and unconventional tactics. In response, Taiwan's military remains on high alert, employing intelligence and surveillance systems to monitor Chinese military movements.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwan-warns-of-escalating-chinese-military-drills-in-taiwan-strait	2024-09-30T07:22:01-07:00	
South Korean Intelligence Warns North Korea Capable of Building Double-Digit Nuclear Arsenal	According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), North Korea has accumulated enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to build a 'double-digit' number of nuclear bombs, as reported by Reuters. This information, revealed during a closed-door parliamentary briefing, has heightened concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities. The briefing followed recent public statements by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un regarding the expansion of his nuclear arsenal, as well as the rare disclosure earlier this month of a secret uranium enrichment facility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States (Picture source: KCNA) The intelligence report estimates that North Korea possesses around 70 kilograms of plutonium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons, along with a significant, though unspecified, amount of weapons-grade uranium. Combined, these materials would be sufficient to produce at least ten nuclear bombs. These developments align with North Korea’s broader goal of 'exponentially' increasing its stockpile of nuclear weapons, as recently stated by Kim Jong-un. North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic programs continue to advance, with significant improvements in terms of accuracy and power. The South Korean intelligence agency also highlighted North Korea’s progress in missile technology, particularly in developing more precise and powerful systems capable of targeting South Korea. The NIS has not ruled out the possibility of a seventh nuclear test, speculating that such an event could take place after the U.S. presidential election in November. Kim Jong-un’s visit to the Nuclear Weapons Institute in September underscored North Korea’s ambitions to further expand its nuclear arsenal. This visit, which included an inspection of facilities producing military-grade nuclear materials, reinforced the regime’s commitment to strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities. These actions come despite long-standing international sanctions and diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. South Korea and its allies are closely monitoring these developments, concerned about the growing threat posed by North Korea’s expanding nuclear capabilities. This concern is heightened by Pyongyang’s continued missile testing and development, including those designed to carry nuclear warheads. In response to the increasing obsolescence of its conventional military capabilities, North Korea has focused for decades on developing asymmetric capabilities and weapons of mass destruction, including long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The country has a range of short- and medium-range missiles, such as the Scud and No-Dong missiles, along with more modern systems like the KN-23 and KN-25. Significant advancements include the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-14, with a range of 10,400 km, and the Hwasong-15, still in development, with an estimated range between 8,500 and 13,000 km. North Korea has also made progress in miniaturizing its nuclear weapons, allowing them to be integrated into its ballistic missiles. The country’s intercontinental missile program, including the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, poses a major strategic threat, capable of targeting distant territories, including the United States. Continued development of ballistic missile and nuclear technologies remains central to Pyongyang’s strategy to deter external intervention and ensure the regime’s survival. The latest intelligence assessments suggest that North Korea now has the capacity to produce a significant number of nuclear weapons, with further advancements expected in the near future. As the regime continues to progress in both nuclear and missile domains, regional security dynamics are likely to face increasing pressure. The possibility of further nuclear tests and the expansion of North Korea’s arsenal remain key concerns for South Korea and the international community.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/south-korean-intelligence-warns-north-korea-capable-of-building-double-digit-nuclear-arsenal	2024-09-30T06:56:03-07:00	
Taiwan adopts non-lethal ammunition to strengthen maritime law enforcement against gray zone tactics	According to information published by Liberty Times Net on September 28, 2024, Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) is adopting new measures to improve maritime law enforcement, in response to increasing gray zone tactics employed by Chinese forces, which include frequent incursions into Taiwan's air and maritime zones as well as the deployment of Chinese Coast Guard vessels.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Taiwanese Anping-class offshore patrol vessel. (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) Senior government officials have confirmed that the Executive Yuan has approved a three-year pilot program to procure non-lethal ammunition and equipment, aiming to boost enforcement capabilities. Starting in fiscal year 2025, the program will trial the use of non-lethal munitions, such as high-decibel shock rounds, which will be compatible with the Zhenhai rocket system aboard the CGA’s 600-ton vessels. These vessels are currently equipped with domestically produced 2.75-inch rockets capable of launching high-explosive, armor-piercing, and cluster munitions—powerful weapons deemed unsuitable for standard law enforcement operations in Taiwan's waters. The new non-lethal options, designed to deter rather than destroy, are intended to be safer alternatives during such operations. According to military sources, these shock rounds will emit a loud noise upon detonation, creating a psychological deterrent. Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology will work with the CGA to produce and supply these rounds according to the approved annual plan. The project has an allocated budget of NT$86.24 million (approximately USD 2.7 million) and is scheduled to be implemented over the next three years. Besides shock rounds, the procurement plan also includes 40mm flashbangs, single-shot 40mm grenade launchers, and other non-lethal firearms. Depending on the results of the trial, the program may be expanded in future years. The Zhenhai rocket system, developed by Taiwan’s National Chung-Shan Institute, is a remotely controlled weapon platform with six launchers capable of firing various 2.75-inch rockets with an effective range of up to 5 kilometers and a maximum range of 10 kilometers. Currently, the system is configured to launch high-explosive, armor-piercing, cluster munitions, and flares for search and rescue operations. About the Anping class The Anping-class offshore patrol vessels have a displacement of 750 tons and measure 65.4 meters in overall length, with a waterline length of 60.7 meters. The vessels have a beam of 14.8 meters and a draft of 2.1 meters.

New stage in US military support for Taiwan $567 million to counter Beijing	U.S. President Joe Biden has approved $567 million in new support to strengthen Taiwan's defense, the White House announced. This decision aligns with Washington's commitment to support the self-governed island in response to growing tensions with China. Although the United States does not officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, it remains its most important international ally and arms supplier, a point of frequent contention with Beijing. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly demanded that Washington stop selling arms to Taipei, accusing the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Taiwanese Army's Third, Fourth, and Fifth Operational Zones conducted heavy artillery firing exercises in August 2024 (Picture source: Taiwanese MoD) In a brief statement, the White House indicated that Biden had delegated authority to the Secretary of State 'to direct the provision of defense articles and services from the Department of Defense, as well as military education and training, for assistance of up to $567 million for Taiwan.' No further details were provided about the specific nature of this latest aid package. This initiative follows a previous military assistance package approved in April 2024, during a period when China intensified its political and military pressures on the island. That multi-billion-dollar aid aimed to bolster Taiwan’s defense capabilities amid increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing. Although U.S. support for Taiwan is informal diplomatically, it represents a major source of friction in U.S.-China relations. Taiwan has repeatedly expressed concerns over delays in the delivery of certain military equipment from the United States, including modernized F-16 fighter jets. Nevertheless, Washington continues to provide significant military aid to the island to enhance its ability to face a potential Chinese invasion. The approval of this new $567 million assistance reaffirms the U.S.’s commitment to supporting Taiwan's defense amid growing challenges posed by China. Before the approval of the $567 million aid package in September 2024, the United States had already sent several significant military deliveries to Taiwan. One of the most notable was a $345 million package approved in 2023, which included air defense systems such as Patriot PAC-3 missiles aimed at strengthening the island’s missile defense capabilities. In addition to these systems, Washington also provided munitions, including AGM-88 HARM missiles designed to target enemy radar, as well as long-range artillery munitions. The U.S. also delivered M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers, which offer enhanced mobility on the battlefield, allowing Taiwan to improve its response to ground attacks. These deliveries are part of the ongoing efforts to bolster Taiwan's defense capabilities amid increasing military threats from China.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/new-stage-in-us-military-support-for-taiwan-567-million-to-counter-beijing	2024-09-30T05:23:57-07:00

AUKUS advancing Indo-Pacific security with nuclear submarines and emerging tech, Austin reports	According to information published by the US DoD on September 26, 2024, the trilateral security alliance known as AUKUS, consisting of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, is rapidly advancing military capabilities and deterrence strategies in the Indo-Pacific region, according to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III. During a recent meeting in London with his counterparts, British Defense Secretary John Healey and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles, Austin emphasized the progress made under the partnership.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Australian Minister for Defence Richard Marles, the UK Ministry of Defence John Healey and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. (Picture source: US DoD) One of AUKUS's key objectives is to equip Australia with conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Austin highlighted that over the past year, efforts have been accelerated, with more Australian sailors receiving specialized training at U.S. and U.K. nuclear reactor schools. Additionally, a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine made a port visit to Australia, marking an early milestone toward establishing Australia's sovereign submarine capability. Austin also outlined plans for a rotational deployment of U.S. submarines to Australia, which could begin as early as 2027. He reiterated the United States’ commitment to assisting Australia in developing the skilled workforce needed to operate and maintain these advanced submarines. The AUKUS partnership is structured around two main pillars. The first aims to ensure that Australia acquires nuclear-powered submarine capability by the early 2030s. The second pillar focuses on accelerating cutting-edge military technologies such as uncrewed maritime systems, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and hypersonics. Japan has committed to contributing to the development of maritime autonomy, while discussions with Canada, South Korea, and New Zealand are ongoing regarding their potential involvement in these emerging technologies. In addition to these advancements, the AUKUS nations have committed to easing export controls to enhance secure trade within the partnership. This includes the sale of U.S. Virginia-class submarines to Australia. Recent legislative changes under the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act have amended export regulations, providing exemptions for Australia and the United Kingdom, further facilitating defense cooperation. Background From a geopolitical perspective, China has been vocal in its opposition, framing AUKUS as a destabilizing move that exacerbates regional tensions and threatens to spark an arms race. This has added fuel to the existing rivalry between China and the U.S. over influence in the Pacific, with Beijing accusing the pact of adopting a 'Cold War mentality' that undermines the nuclear non-proliferation regime. This sentiment resonates with some Pacific nations, many of which are wary of nuclear-powered submarines in their waters, especially given the region's history of nuclear testing and its commitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone. Countries like Fiji and the Solomon Islands have expressed concerns, suggesting that the presence of such vessels contradicts the ideals of peace in the Pacific, raising further diplomatic hurdles for Australia in maintaining regional relations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/aukus-advancing-indo-pacific-security-with-nuclear-submarines-and-emerging-tech-austin-reports	2024-09-30T02:14:00-07:00

Following the completion of these trials, the Auguste Techer will set sail for its home port in Port des Galets, located on the island of La Réunion.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Felix Eboue class (POM) offshore patrol vessel Auguste Techer. (Picture source: French MoD) France's naval strategy in the Indo-Pacific is anchored in its significant territorial presence, sovereignty interests, and its broader geopolitical goals. With 1.65 million French citizens living in the region and vast territories in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, France sees itself as an Indo-Pacific power. Its strategy focuses on several key areas: maintaining territorial integrity, ensuring freedom of navigation, and promoting regional stability through multilateralism and alliances. One of the primary objectives is to protect France's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the second largest in the world, from threats like illegal fishing and maritime crime. To do so, France has permanently deployed about 7,000 military personnel along with 20 naval vessels and 40 aircraft, spread across bases in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and La Réunion. These forces are tasked with defending France’s sovereignty, providing disaster relief, and supporting international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which ensures freedom of navigation across global waters. Given the rising tensions between major powers like the United States and China, France has increased its naval deployments, regularly sending frigates and surveillance ships through strategic waterways like the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. French forces also collaborate with key regional allies, including India, Japan, Australia, and the United States, participating in major maritime exercises such as RIMPAC and strengthening diplomatic and defense ties. The French Navy also plays a critical role in countering narcotics trafficking and illegal fishing, using advanced maritime domain awareness tools like satellite imagery and electronic surveillance to monitor its waters. Despite this, France faces challenges in sustaining its ambitions in the Indo-Pacific due to resource constraints. Its naval assets in the region are often stretched thin, and many of its vessels require modernization. Efforts are underway to address these issues, including the procurement of new patrol vessels and the upgrade of surveillance frigates, but there remains a gap between France’s strategic objectives and its current capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navys-offshore-patrol-vessel-auguste-techer-completes-first-sea-trials	2024-09-30T00:35:01-07:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Azerbaijan conducted a military operation on September 19, 2023, to gain control over the remaining parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, a territory mainly inhabited by Armenians but located within Azerbaijan’s borders. The operation raised concerns about potential broader violence and led to a significant displacement of Armenians fearing reprisals. Russian peacekeepers were killed during the fighting, but Russia did not intervene. Azerbaijan's economic position, partly influenced by the Ukraine war's effects on natural gas exports to the European Union, has allowed it to expand its military capabilities. The country has acquired military equipment from Turkiye, such as upgrading Su-25 combat aircraft, and from Israel, acquiring a remote-sensing satellite and additional Barak air defense systems. Azerbaijan plans to increase military spending by around 6% in 2024, reaching approximately USD 3.8 billion. Armenia has also increased its defense spending, with a budget of USD 1.28 billion in 2023, a 46% rise compared to the previous year, and plans to expand it to about USD 1.4 billion in 2024. Due to delays in Russian arms deliveries, affected by Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, Armenia has sought alternative suppliers, including India, signing contracts for 155mm ATAGS towed howitzers, Pinaka multiple-launch rocket systems, and Akash air defense systems. Additionally, Armenia is transitioning toward NATO-standard artillery, incorporating Western military education systems and command approaches. Armenia has distanced itself from Russia's security role, as Moscow did not intervene during the 2022 border conflict with Azerbaijan. This led Armenia to invite an EU monitoring mission, comprising 103 civilian members, while Armenia has effectively halted its participation in CSTO activities. Azerbaijan's armed forces, consisting of 64,050 active personnel (57,800 in the Army, 1,750 in the Navy, and 8,650 in the Air Force) and 300,000 reservists, focus mainly on territorial defense. Azerbaijan maintains a conscript-based system, with service terms of 18 months (12 for graduates). The country has shifted from reliance on Russian military support to establishing defense ties with Israel, Turkiye, and Pakistan, signing agreements such as the 2021 'Shusha Declaration' with Turkiye and engaging in joint exercises like the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk-2023 in October 2023. Additionally, Azerbaijan signed bilateral defense cooperation agreements with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 2023 and has developed limited but expanding domestic defense-industrial capabilities through its Ministry of Defence Industry. Azerbaijan has acquired various military equipment from Israel, including dozens of Plasan Sandcat armored vehicles, a remote-sensing satellite, and Barak air defense systems.

Heavy Air Transport: DARPA Seeks a Drone with Twice Lifting Power of CH-53K King Stallion	The U.S. Department of Defense, through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), has recently launched an ambitious project aimed at revolutionizing heavy air transport. This initiative, named 'Cost Efficient Cargo,' explores the design of an autonomous drone capable of carrying up to 31.75 tons of cargo, which is double the lifting capacity of the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter, currently in service with the U.S. Marine Corps. Unlike the King Stallion, this drone would not be designed for long-range missions but rather for moving heavy loads between ships and beaches or crossing rivers and other natural obstacles inland.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marines with Marine Operational Test and Evaluation Squadron (VMX) 1 transport a Light Armored Vehicle 25 with a CH-53K King Stallion helicopter over Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, April 27, 2022 (Picture source: US-DoD) DARPA recently issued a Request for Information (RFI), seeking innovative proposals for uncrewed heavy-lift systems capable of carrying a 70,000-pound payload (around 35 tons). This RFI specifies that the drone must utilize existing engine and transmission technologies while deviating from systems currently employed by traditional helicopters. The intended operational range for this drone would be 25 miles (40.23 km), flying at an altitude of 500 feet between the cargo pickup point and its destination, with a return trip to the base. This project is driven by the growing logistical needs of the U.S. military, particularly in high-intensity conflict scenarios against adversaries with significant anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, such as China. Amphibious and airborne operations, where troops and equipment must be rapidly moved from sea to land, increasingly face natural or artificial obstacles such as ravines, rivers, or destroyed bridges. Currently, these barriers are often overcome through engineering solutions like floating bridges or amphibious vehicles, but these methods are time-consuming and provide adversaries with the opportunity to mount counterattacks. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project aims to address the urgent need for faster and more efficient heavy-lift transport, particularly in scenarios where swift execution is critical to establishing a beachhead or crossing contested areas. Although the CH-53K can lift an impressive 36,000 pounds (16.33 tons), it remains costly, with a unit price of approximately $118 million. Additionally, current solutions, while effective, are limited in range, cost, and vulnerability to enemy defenses. The CH-53K King Stallion prepares for take-off during sea trials in June 2020 on the USS Wasp (LHD-1) (Picture source: US DoD) DARPA is considering a variety of configurations for this future heavy-lift drone, including hybrid propulsion systems powered by internal combustion engines, electric motors, or a combination of both. While autonomous capabilities are desired, they are not the immediate focus of this RFI. The main goal is to identify groundbreaking concepts and mitigate risks through scaled-down prototypes before investing in full-scale development. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the importance of overcoming obstacles and rapidly maneuvering forces, underscoring the vulnerabilities of static infrastructure like temporary bridges, which are often exposed to precision strikes and real-time surveillance. Similarly, in a potential conflict with adversaries like China, U.S. amphibious capabilities could be hampered by anti-ship missiles, limiting the proximity of landing ships to shore. The heavy-lift drone proposed by DARPA is designed to overcome these challenges by facilitating the rapid transfer of cargo from ships at sea to land or across obstacles such as rivers and canyons inland. The concept includes the possibility of transporting 40-foot ISO containers (12.19 meters) or even armored vehicles like the M2 Bradley. However, while the Bradley's combat weight is approximately 80,000 pounds (36.29 tons), which slightly exceeds the drone’s projected capacity, DARPA anticipates that these vehicles could be transported empty, without ammunition or fuel, reducing their weight. The logistical challenges facing the U.S. military, particularly in the rapid transport of heavy equipment in contested environments, have prompted the exploration of solutions such as this drone project. DARPA acknowledges that this program could significantly change how the U.S. military deploys its forces and equipment, especially in distributed operations at sea and on land, where flexibility and speed are essential. While questions remain about the actual efficiency of a fleet of high-lift drones, particularly in terms of cost and their ability to meet operational demand, this project reflects the growing need for innovative logistical solutions in the U.S. armed forces. In the long term, this drone could integrate into the future air mobility ecosystem of the U.S. military, addressing increasingly complex operational requirements. The 'Cost Efficient Cargo' project marks a significant step in the development of the U.S. military’s heavy-lift air transport capabilities. This drone, capable of lifting twice the load of the King Stallion, offers an opportunity to enhance military maneuvers by increasing the speed, flexibility, and resilience of U.S. ground and amphibious forces in the face of increasingly sophisticated adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/heavy-air-transport-darpa-seeks-a-drone-with-twice-lifting-power-of-ch-53k-king-stallion	2024-09-30T00:24:17-07:00

China Unveils Cutting-Edge ZTZ-99 Tank Upgrade with Advanced Active Protection System	The ZTZ-99 is the latest generation of Chinese main battle tanks, representing the most advanced armor technology produced domestically by China. It stands as a symbol of China's military modernization, equipped with cutting-edge systems for firepower, mobility, and protection. A recent development, as shared by 'David Wang' on X (formerly Twitter) on September 19, 2024, reveals that China is currently developing a variant of the ZTZ-99 outfitted with an advanced Active Protection System (APS). This APS includes two projectile launchers and four fire control radars, similar to the GL-6 system, first revealed in 2022.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New Chinese-made ZTZ-99 MBT Main Battle Tank fitted with APS Active Protection System. (Picture source: X account David Wang) The ZTZ-99 main battle tank, also named Type 99, was developed in the 1990s by China as part of its broader effort to modernize its armored forces. Its design was influenced by earlier Soviet tank models, particularly the T-72, but it incorporates advanced technologies, making it one of the most sophisticated tanks in China’s arsenal. Development of the ZTZ-99 began in the late 1980s, and the first prototype was completed by 1993. After rigorous testing and refinements, the ZTZ-99 officially entered service with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1999. It made its public debut during the National Day parade in 1999, signaling China’s commitment to fielding a modern, competitive armored force. Regarding combat capabilities, the ZTZ-99 is equipped with a 125mm smoothbore cannon, capable of firing APFSDS rounds, HEAT shells, and ATGMs, enabling it to engage heavily armored vehicles at various ranges. The tank is protected by advanced composite armor and explosive reactive armor (ERA), designed to defend against high-explosive and kinetic threats. Recent variants of the ZTZ-99 have integrated an Active Protection System (APS), like the GL-6, which offers hard-kill protection by intercepting incoming missiles or projectiles. The tank is powered by a 1,500-horsepower diesel engine, allowing it to reach speeds of up to 80 km/h, ensuring excellent mobility on diverse terrain. This combination of firepower, protection, and speed solidifies the ZTZ-99's role as a highly capable and modern main battle tank​. The GL-6 Active Protection System (APS) is a hard-kill defense system developed by China, primarily designed to protect armored vehicles from incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. It is similar in function to other APS like Israel's 'Iron Fist.' The GL-6 system is integrated into vehicles such as the VT-4A1 main battle tank and offers advanced interception capabilities. It uses radar to detect and neutralize threats by launching countermeasures that destroy or deflect incoming missiles before they can strike the vehicle. The GL-6 is a significant upgrade over earlier models like the GL-5, offering better performance and modular features that allow it to be adapted to various platforms. The system effectively counters anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and high-explosive projectiles, making it a valuable asset in modern armored warfare. In terms of performance, the GL-6 can intercept multiple types of threats from various angles, adding a layer of survivability for vehicles like the VT-4A1 and potentially the VN-22 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), although its functionality on the latter is still debated and may be limited to experimental or demonstration purposes Adding the APS to the ZTZ-99 tank is a game-changer for its defensive capabilities. An APS is designed to provide 'hard-kill' protection, which means it actively intercepts and destroys incoming anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and other high-velocity projectiles before they can hit the tank. The two APS projectile launchers and radar system work in tandem to detect and neutralize threats, providing 360-degree coverage. This level of protection enhances the tank's survivability in both offensive and defensive operations, especially in environments where advanced anti-tank weaponry is deployed. By adding this advanced APS, the ZTZ-99 becomes far more resistant to modern anti-armor threats, ensuring it can remain operational on the battlefield even when facing the latest missile and projectile systems. The GL-6 system, in particular, is known for its efficiency in intercepting multiple threats simultaneously, further increasing the tank's durability in combat. These improvements make the ZTZ-99 not only a powerful offensive machine, with its 125mm smoothbore gun capable of firing various munitions, but also a highly resilient vehicle, able to withstand a wide range of battlefield threats. This development aligns with China's strategic focus on enhancing the survivability and effectiveness of its armored forces, allowing the ZTZ-99 to maintain its cutting-edge position among global main battle tanks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-unveils-cutting-edge-ztz-99-tank-upgrade-with-advanced-active-protection-system	2024-09-27T10:18:47-07:00

Kachin Independence Army attacks Myanmar Navy vessel on Irrawaddy River	According to information published by Clash Report on September 26, 2024, a Myanmar Navy convoy traveling along the Irrawaddy River was ambushed by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Myanmar Navy vessel hit by recoilless rifles. (Picture source: Twitter account of Clash Report) KIA forces reportedly hit at least two naval vessels, halting them temporarily before they were towed to the nearby area of Tigyaing. The assault occurred as the convoy, consisting of several ships, was making its way upriver, likely to transport supplies and military equipment to junta-controlled territories further north. This recent attack is part of an ongoing pattern of guerrilla warfare tactics employed by the KIA, one of Myanmar’s largest ethnic armed groups, which has been engaged in an armed struggle against the military for decades. The KIA's involvement in the current conflict intensified following the February 2021 military coup, which led to widespread civil unrest and armed resistance across the country. Ethnic armed groups like the KIA, once focused primarily on local autonomy, have since aligned more closely with anti-junta forces, including the People’s Defense Forces (PDF), in opposition to the regime. The Irrawaddy River, Myanmar’s largest and most vital waterway, has become a key battleground in this struggle. Control of the river allows the military to transport troops, supplies, and weapons to remote areas, and in turn, it has become a target for anti-regime groups seeking to disrupt these movements.

Exclusive: Iran mediating talks for Russian missile transfer to Yemen's Houthis	According to information published by Reuters on September 24, 2024, Iran has facilitated secret negotiations between Russia and Yemen's Houthi rebels, aiming to transfer advanced anti-ship missiles to the militant group. The ongoing discussions, which have yet to result in a confirmed transfer, focus on supplying the Yakhont missile, also known as the P-800 Oniks. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian P-800 Oniks missile. (Picture source: Wikipedia/ Boevaya mashina) Seven sources have indicated that while Moscow has not finalized the decision, the Yakhont missile would significantly enhance the Houthis' ability to target vessels in the Red Sea. Experts warn that this could increase the threat to U.S. and European warships, as well as disrupt global maritime trade further. The Wall Street Journal had reported in July that Russia was considering this missile transfer, but Iran's involvement in brokering the talks had not been previously disclosed. The Houthis have intensified their drone and missile strikes on ships in the Red Sea since November, partly in solidarity with Palestinians during the ongoing Gaza conflict. Their actions have already caused significant disruptions, sinking two ships and seizing another, forcing shipping companies to reroute cargo and prompting rising insurance costs for vessels navigating the area. Despite retaliatory strikes by the U.S. and Britain on Houthi positions, the group’s attacks continue. Two regional officials revealed that Russian and Houthi representatives have met in Tehran at least twice this year, with further meetings expected soon. These talks reportedly include plans to supply the Houthis with dozens of Yakhont missiles, which have a range of approximately 300 kilometers. Russia has previously provided Yakhont missiles to Iran-backed Hezbollah, and the current discussions, which began under Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, reflect a growing alignment between Moscow and Tehran. Western intelligence sources emphasize that Iran is mediating the talks but seeks to avoid direct involvement in the transfer. Some sources suggest that Russia's willingness to arm the Houthis may be linked to Western military aid to Ukraine. The transfer of Yakhont missiles, regarded as highly advanced, would represent a significant shift in regional security dynamics. Experts believe that the Houthis could use these weapons not only against Western naval forces but also as land-attack missiles, potentially threatening Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials have raised the issue with Saudi Arabia, which shares concerns over the missile transfer. Russia's potential involvement has drawn alarm across the region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/exclusive-iran-mediating-talks-for-russian-missile-transfer-to-yemens-houthis	2024-09-26T05:11:06-07:00

Japan's first warship passage through Taiwan Strait signals growing regional tensions	According to information published by Al Jazeera on September 26, 2024, Japan has reportedly sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time, signaling increased naval activity in a region marked by growing tensions with China.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japanese Takanami-class destroyer JS Sazanami. (Picture source: JMSDF) The destroyer, Sazanami, made the passage through the 180-kilometer strait, sailing alongside vessels from Australia and New Zealand. This transit, reported by Japanese media, comes as China intensifies its military presence near Japan. The Sazanami entered the strait from the East China Sea, taking more than 10 hours to complete its southward journey. The operation, conducted ahead of joint drills in the contested South China Sea, saw participation from New Zealand’s HMNZS Aotearoa and Australia’s HMAS Sydney. This move follows a recent passage by China’s aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, between two Japanese islands near Taiwan. Japan, which described this activity as 'totally unacceptable,' remains on alert over China's expanding military footprint. Tokyo recently reported a Chinese spy plane violating its airspace near islands off its southwestern coast, heightening concerns over Beijing’s growing assertiveness. Japan’s government has refrained from confirming details of the warship's passage, but spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi voiced concern over the increasing frequency of military actions in the region, particularly airspace violations. Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reportedly ordered the Taiwan Strait transit in response to fears that Beijing’s actions could escalate if left unchecked. Taiwan Strait The Taiwan Strait is a strategically significant body of water that separates Taiwan from mainland China. It is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) wide at its narrowest point and connects the East China Sea to the north with the South China Sea to the south. This region has long been a focal point of geopolitical tension due to its critical location, historical claims, and military significance. One of the most pressing issues surrounding the Taiwan Strait is the status of Taiwan itself. Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China (ROC), operates as a self-governing democracy but is claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a breakaway province. The PRC views reunification with Taiwan as a core national objective and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal, especially in light of Taiwan's growing international partnerships and the evolving dynamics of global defense alignments. The Taiwan Strait is crucial to global shipping, as many of the world's largest container ships pass through it. This waterway is a major conduit for goods moving between Asia and the rest of the world, particularly energy supplies like oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-first-warship-passage-through-taiwan-strait-signals-growing-regional-tensions	2024-09-26T04:05:54-07:00	
Brazilian Air Force receives new Saab F-39 Gripen fighter jet from Sweden	On September 24, 2024, the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) announced the arrival of another Saab F-39 Gripen aircraft in Brazil, registered as 4108. This aircraft arrived on September 23, completing a journey of approximately 20 days. It was shipped from Norrköping, Sweden, to the port of Navegantes on the Catarinense coast. After its arrival, the aircraft was transferred to Navegantes International Airport, where the necessary technical procedures will be conducted to prepare it for its flight to Anápolis Air Base (BAAN).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link After its arrival, the Saab F-39 Gripen was transferred to Navegantes International Airport, where the necessary technical procedures will be conducted to prepare it for its flight to Anápolis Air Base. (Picture source: Força Aérea Brasileira) The F-39E Gripen’s arrival is part of the FAB’s modernization program, aimed at enhancing Brazil’s air combat capabilities. The transition comes after the prolonged use of older fighter jets, particularly the American-made Northrop F-5, which became the primary fighter jet following the retirement of the Mirage 2000 in late 2013. The Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) acquired a total of 79 F-5s over the years, with the initial purchase consisting of 42 new units in 1973 (including 6 two-seat B training units and 36 one-seat E units). In 1988, another 26 new units were acquired (comprising 4 B training units and 22 E units), followed by the acquisition of 11 used units from Jordan in 2000, as the production of F-5s had ended in the United States in 1987. Currently, approximately 50 of these jets remain in active service. To ensure the continued service of the F-5 fleet, a modernization program began in 2005 and was completed in October 2020. Embraer managed the modernization, upgrading the F-5s with new avionics systems, multifunctional displays, Italian Grifo F multimode radars, electronic countermeasures, and compatibility with modern missiles and laser-guided bombs. The modernization project, known as the FX project, resulted in the F-5s being designated as F-5EM/F-5FM variants, with contributions from Israeli companies ATL and Elbit Systems. The final modernized F-5M fighter was delivered to the FAB on October 14, 2020, concluding the 15-year program and resulting in a total of 49 fighters being upgraded. The shift towards the Gripen began in 2013 with the Brazilian Gripen Program, when Saab was selected for the F-X2 contract to replace the aging fleet. In October 2014, a contract was signed with the Brazilian government for the development and production of 36 Gripen NG aircraft, consisting of 28 single-seat F-39Es and eight dual-seat F-39Fs, along with two flight simulators, with a total value of SEK38.9 billion (USD4.25 billion). The shift towards the Gripen began in 2013 with the Brazilian Gripen Program, when Saab was selected for the F-X2 contract to replace the aging fleet of 79 American-made F-5s. (Picture source: Saab) As the Brazilian Air Force (Força Aérea Brasileira - FAB) operates both F-5 and Gripen-E fighters, Brazilian Air Force Commander, Lieutenant Brigadier Marcelo Kanitz Damasceno, emphasized that Brazilian regulations require the fleet to consist of at least two but not more than three fighter types, suggesting the Indian Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) could serve as the second or third type alongside the Gripen-E once the F-5 is phased out. This consideration was confirmed in a meeting with Indian defense officials, including Air Chief Marshal V.R. Chaudhari and Chief of Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi, on September 11, 2024. On November 24, 2021, the FAB formally received its first four series-production Saab F-39Es, Brazil's designation for the single-seat Gripen E variant. These jets were accepted at the Saab Aeronautics plant in Linköping, Sweden, and later shipped to Brazil to join the Jaguar Squadron at Wing 2 in Anápolis, Goiás. These fighters joined a single-seat F-39E Flight Test Instrumentation (FTI) aircraft that had been delivered to Brazil on September 11, 2019, for testing in both Sweden and Brazil. The entire delivery schedule for the Gripen fleet is structured in multiple phases, with the last two fighters expected to be delivered by 2026. The Gripen program includes Embraer as the main Brazilian partner, receiving about 60 to 70% of the technology transfer and offset packages. The FAB currently operates nine F-39Es and has another 27 Gripen E/Fs on order, scheduled for delivery from 2019 to 2026. This will create a total fleet of 36 F-39E/Fs, operated by the 'Jaguar' Squadron of the 1st Air Defense Group.

The Gripen, designed as a multirole fighter, had its first flight in 1988 and entered service in 1996. The Gripen E, also referred to as Gripen NG (Next Generation), represents a significant redesign, with deliveries starting in 2019. The Gripen E features a General Electric F414-GE-39E turbofan engine, producing a maximum thrust of 98 kN with an afterburner. The aircraft can achieve speeds of Mach 2 (approximately 2,100 km/h) at an altitude of 15,240 m and sustain supercruise at Mach 1.25 without an afterburner. It has a combat range of approximately 1,500 km in an air-to-ground configuration and a ferry range of up to 4,000 km with external fuel tanks, operating within a service ceiling of 16,000 m and a g-force range of +9/-3. Equipped with ten hardpoints, the Gripen E can carry a payload of up to 7,200 kg, including a variety of armaments such as a 27 mm Mauser BK-27 revolver cannon (120 rounds on single-seat models), air-to-air missiles (IRIS-T, AIM-9 Sidewinder, MBDA Meteor), and air-to-surface weapons (AGM-65 Maverick, RBS-15F anti-ship missile).

Russian spy ships suspected of espionage in Baltic and North Seas	According to information published by Suddeutsche Zeitung on September 24, 2024, alarming activity by Russian ships in the Baltic and North Seas has raised suspicions of espionage and sabotage of critical infrastructure.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 865 Hydrographic survey vessel Sibirykov. (Picture source: Сделано у нас) The investigation, which involved journalists from six countries, revealed that Russian research ships, often equipped with military technology, have been spying on gas pipelines, data cables, wind farms, and military infrastructure in the region. One incident from October 2023 highlights the concern. The containership Newnew Polar Bear abruptly slowed down while crossing the Balticconnector pipeline, causing severe damage to the pipeline with its anchor. This came just months after the Russian seabed survey ship Sibiryakov was observed performing suspicious maneuvers, at least once directly over the pipeline, sparking suspicions that it might have been preparing for sabotage. Ships like the Sibiryakov are part of a broader network of Russian vessels conducting surveillance missions in the area. These research ships are said to be under the control of the Russian Ministry of Defense and are fitted with sophisticated equipment, including military-grade radar systems. The investigation tracked 72 Russian research vessels, which have made 428 voyages since the start of the war in Ukraine. Analysis of over 1,000 Morse code transmissions and AIS (Automatic Identification System) data points indicate that these activities have increased in recent months. Ships have been detected entering the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of several EU countries at low speeds, often below 5 knots, a tactic experts associate with espionage missions. Many of these incursions were in close proximity to vital infrastructure like gas pipelines and offshore wind farms. In Germany alone, over 2,600 Russia-affiliated vessels have reportedly made 'area visits' in German territorial waters since the Ukraine conflict began, with 143 of them flying the Russian flag. This prompted German authorities to increase their surveillance efforts, with government figures confirming that since 2023, 107 escort missions by police and navy frigates have been conducted to monitor suspicious activity in the country’s EEZ. One notable case involved the Yevgeniy Gorigledzha, a Russian vessel that loitered for more than eight hours near Fehmarn Island, a known NATO submarine diving area. The ship’s erratic zigzag movements raised concerns of potential espionage, leading to intervention by both a German police ship and a navy vessel. NATO experts warn that these activities could be preparatory steps for sabotage. Many of these Russian ships are believed to carry advanced military equipment, such as mini-submarines and underwater drones, which could be used to disrupt or damage critical infrastructure in the event of heightened geopolitical tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-spy-ships-suspected-of-espionage-in-baltic-and-north-seas	2024-09-25T05:45:54-07:00

The first variant is equipped with a 125mm gun with a shortened barrel, the second carries missiles or a rocket-propelled infantry flamethrower with a thermobaric 'Shmel-M' warhead, the third is a robotic adaptation of the Terminator fire support vehicle fitted with two 30mm automatic cannons that launch thermobaric missiles instead of anti-tank missiles, and the fourth is an unmanned vehicle intended to operate alongside the TOS-1A 'Solntsepek' thermobaric rocket launcher system. The unmanned tanks feature sensors across ultrasonic, visible, and infrared spectrums that support automatic convoy movement, terrain assessment, and obstacle navigation. A comprehensive all-angle technical vision system, combined with AI based on trainable neural networks, allows these systems to evaluate situations and make operational decisions, ensuring the ability to navigate natural and engineered obstacles without direct human intervention. Military expert Yuri Knutov commented that deploying T-72-based unmanned tanks could change operational dynamics for the Russian Armed Forces, as these vehicles can be remotely controlled, thereby reducing risks to personnel under enemy fire. Knutov noted that integrating such robots might necessitate adjustments in the use of tanks and heavy armored vehicles, particularly considering the observed effectiveness of anti-tank guided missiles in recent conflicts. The use of unmanned tanks, including a captured Ukrainian T-72AMT now labeled 'Vasya' by Russian forces, may lead to adjustments in traditional armored tactics, emphasizing strategic deployment and reducing personnel risks. Knutov observed that despite the presence of numerous armored vehicles, anti-tank guided missiles have been notably effective in neutralizing them during the Ukraine conflict. For effective combat operations, it might be more efficient to deploy armored vehicles strategically, such as in a 'tank carousel' formation with three vehicles, rather than deploying larger numbers simultaneously. Introduced in 2011, the T-72B3 is an updated version of the T-72B tank, achieving performance levels comparable to more modern tanks like the T-90A.

They could make dynamic tactical decisions, such as choosing the best flight trajectories, avoiding threats, and optimizing the use of their weapons, thereby increasing the efficiency of military operations while reducing risks for human pilots. Another concrete application of the AIR program is the integration of AI-driven assistance systems in human-piloted fighter jets, such as the F-16. These systems could help pilots by providing real-time analyses of the combat space, anticipating enemy movements, and suggesting defensive or offensive maneuvers. They could also manage electronic warfare systems to counter hostile signals and protect the aircraft. This human-machine collaboration would improve decision-making, increase survival rates in combat, and alleviate the cognitive load on pilots during complex missions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/darpa-invests-4-million-in-bae-systems-for-advanced-ai-air-combat-solutions	2024-09-25T01:17:36-07:00	
Breaking News: Lebanese Hezbollah launches Qader 1 missile targeting Israeli intelligence headquarters	Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, launched a surface-to-surface Qader 1 ballistic missile from southern Lebanon targeting central Israel early this morning. Hezbollah has claimed the missile was aimed at the Mossad Israeli intelligence services headquarters near Herzliya, a city just north of Tel Aviv.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Archive image of a Qadr missile being launched from a truck-mounted launcher during the Velayat-90 Naval Exercise. (Picture source: FARS Iranian Media) The Qader 1 ballistic missile is a surface-to-surface missile developed by Iran and supplied to its regional allies, including Hezbollah. It is designed for medium-range attacks and is part of a family of Iranian missiles aimed at enhancing the military capabilities of non-state actors. The missile is known for its precision and ability to carry significant payloads, making it a potent weapon in regional conflicts. With an estimated range of 200 to 300 kilometers, the Qader 1 can strike deep into enemy territory, making it a strategic threat to areas such as Tel Aviv when deployed by groups like Hezbollah. The missile, launched from Hezbollah-controlled territory in southern Lebanon, was intercepted by Israel’s David’s Sling air defense missile system, which is designed to protect against medium-range missile threats. The system successfully neutralized the missile in mid-air, preventing any damage or casualties in the densely populated area of Tel Aviv. This marks one of the most brazen attacks by Hezbollah on Israeli territory in recent years, significantly raising the stakes in the already volatile Israel-Lebanon dynamic. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retaliated by targeting the Hezbollah missile launcher believed to be responsible for the attack. The launcher was located in Nafakhiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Lebanon. Israeli fighter jets carried out precision airstrikes on the site, destroying the launcher and reportedly crippling Hezbollah’s immediate missile-launch capabilities in the region. Israeli military officials have emphasized that this was a direct response to the attack and part of Israel’s broader strategy of deterrence against Hezbollah’s growing missile arsenal. Israel has long been concerned about Hezbollah’s increasingly sophisticated weaponry, much of which is believed to be supplied by Iran, and its ability to strike deep into Israeli territory. This attack from Hezbollah marks a dramatic escalation in the ongoing hostilities between Israel and the militant group, which operates with significant autonomy within Lebanon. The incident also puts Lebanon, a country grappling with severe economic and political crises, at the center of yet another potentially devastating conflict. Hezbollah’s decision to launch such a high-profile missile strike, targeting an intelligence installation in Israel’s heartland, signals a bold move by the group and could indicate increased Iranian influence on Hezbollah’s military strategy. Hezbollah, which wields considerable political and military power in Lebanon, has increasingly positioned itself as a key player in the region’s broader geopolitical struggles, particularly in the context of the Iran-Israel rivalry. In Lebanon, political leaders are facing increasing pressure as Hezbollah’s actions threaten to drag the country into a broader military conflict. With Lebanon already dealing with an economic collapse, the country may struggle to cope with the fallout from an extended military confrontation with Israel. As of now, both Israel and Hezbollah are closely watching the situation. The IDF continues to monitor Hezbollah's missile sites and its military infrastructure in Lebanon, and further retaliatory strikes could be launched depending on Hezbollah’s next moves. Today’s events mark a dangerous turning point in the longstanding conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. With both sides now directly engaging in military actions, the potential for a broader conflict looms large.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-lebanese-hezbollah-launches-qader-1-missile-targeting-israeli-intelligence-headquarters	2024-09-25T01:15:46-07:00	
China Conducts First Public Test of DF-41 Intercontinental Ballistic Missile in Pacific Ocean	On Wednesday, September 25, China publicly acknowledged the successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the Pacific Ocean, an unprecedented event that raises international concerns. The missile, carrying a dummy warhead and likely a DF-41, was launched by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force at 8:44 a.m. Beijing time. The Chinese Ministry of Defense emphasized that this test was part of routine annual exercises and was not directed against any particular country.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link DF-41 ICBM TELs on parade, 2019 (Picture source: PLA) The DF-41 (Dong Feng-41) is a Chinese ICBM known for its maximum range, estimated between 12,000 and 15,000 kilometers, making it China's longest-range missile. It is designed for mobile deployment on roads, railways, or from silos, offering significant flexibility. Powered by a three-stage solid-fuel engine, the missile can carry up to 10 independently targetable nuclear warheads (MIRVs), allowing it to strike multiple targets simultaneously. It uses an inertial guidance system with stellar or satellite updates and has an estimated circular error probable (CEP) of about 100 meters.Developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), the DF-41 began testing in 2012, demonstrating its ability to carry MIRVs. It entered limited production in 2019, and 16 launchers were unveiled during China's 70th-anniversary parade. This missile is part of China's ongoing modernization of its nuclear deterrent capabilities, aiming to counter advancements in missile defense systems and maintain a credible retaliatory strike capacity.Analysts point out that China usually conducts such tests within its own airspace, making this event particularly noteworthy. Ankit Panda, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, commented that this test could reflect China's nuclear modernization efforts, especially in response to improvements in U.S. missile defenses and enhanced surveillance systems.According to the Ministry of Defense's statement, the missile 'landed in predetermined maritime areas,' confirming that the test had achieved its objectives. The ministry also indicated that the concerned countries had been notified in advance. This exercise aimed to test the weapon's performance as well as the training level of the troops involved. The last time China launched a full-range ICBM was during the DF-5 missile launch in May 1980.In May 2023, a leak of U.S. intelligence revealed that China had successfully tested a new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), designated as the DF-27. This missile, according to a classified U.S. intelligence report published in 2023, was reportedly tested on February 25 and traveled 2,100 kilometers in 12 minutes. Although the U.S. Department of Defense has not confirmed the authenticity of this report, it suggests that the DF-27 could have a range between 5,000 and 8,000 kilometers, capable of reaching targets as distant as Guam, Alaska, or parts of Australia. China conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), likely the DF-41, capable of traveling approximately 12,000 kilometers (Picture source: Duan Dang) This test illustrates China's strategic military modernization, which includes the expansion of its nuclear arsenal. In 2023, the Pentagon reported that China possessed more than 500 operational nuclear warheads, a number expected to exceed 1,000 by 2030. Meanwhile, China is constructing hundreds of silos for ground-based ICBMs. This increase in Chinese nuclear capabilities contrasts with the arsenals of the United States and Russia, each of which has over 1,700 deployed warheads.Despite this buildup, China has reaffirmed its commitment to a 'no first use' policy regarding nuclear weapons, with its arsenal under the exclusive control of the Central Military Commission led by President Xi Jinping. However, tensions remain high, particularly with Taiwan, which has reported an increase in Chinese military activities around the island. Taiwan's Ministry of Defense confirmed detecting 23 Chinese military aircraft operating near its territory on the same day as the missile test.This test takes place in the context of intensified military activities in the Asia-Pacific region, where China and other regional actors like North Korea continue their missile tests. In September, North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan, further heightening regional tensions.The People's Republic of China is building and deploying a sophisticated and modern missile arsenal, although this process remains shrouded in mystery due to Beijing's intentional ambiguity and refusal to adhere to arms control or transparency agreements. Chinese missiles play a central role in emerging anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) doctrines, combining ballistic and cruise missiles launched from air, land, and sea to target U.S. and allied military assets in the Asia-Pacific region. China is also developing several advanced capabilities, such as maneuverable anti-ship ballistic missiles, multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), and hypersonic glide vehicles.These combined trends threaten the survival of key elements of U.S. power projection, such as aircraft carriers and forward air bases. Additionally, China possesses a relatively small but developing contingent of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking U.S. territory, as well as a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-conducts-first-public-test-of-df-41-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-in-pacific-ocean	2024-09-25T01:02:03-07:00

Spanish Army Confirms Acquisition of 4,500 Peugeot Landtrek for Non-Combat Missions	The Ejército de Tierra has officially confirmed the acquisition of 4,500 Peugeot Landtrek vehicles as part of its VMTT (Vehículo Militar Todoterreno Táctico) program. This contract, which will span over four years, marks a significant step in the renewal of the Spanish Army's fleet of military vehicles. These new vehicles are intended to replace the PS10 Anibal, purchased in 2004, which has never fully met the army's expectations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Peugeot Landtrek is a versatile mid-size pickup truck designed for a variety of terrains and tasks (Picture source: Peugeot) Two companies competed for this contract: Iturri, representing the Peugeot Landtrek, and TSD, which offered the Ford Ranger. In March 2024, the Army’s Logistics Support Command (MALE) had already expressed its preference for the Landtrek, a decision that was subsequently contested. TSD filed a legal appeal to challenge the procurement process. However, the Spanish court rejected TSD's appeal, allowing MALE to confirm the contract with Iturri, valued at 217 million euros.The choice of the Peugeot Landtrek may surprise some observers, as the vehicle is based on the Kaicene F70, a pick-up truck designed by Chinese manufacturer Chang’an Automobile. Despite this partially non-French origin, the vehicle convinced Spanish authorities with its performance and suitability for the army's specific needs. It is important to note that these vehicles will not be used for combat missions. The Spanish Ministry of Defense clarified that they will be employed for 'tactical tasks removed from combat-related activities,' such as liaison missions within the national territory.In addition to the Ejército de Tierra, other Spanish armed forces will benefit from this acquisition. Peugeot Landtreks will also be delivered to the Guardia Civil, the Ejército del Aire y del Espacio, and the Armada Española, as part of a broader modernization of unprotected military vehicles. The Peugeot Landtrek is a versatile mid-size pickup truck designed for a variety of terrains and tasks, offering both 4x2 and 4x4 drive options. It is available with two main engine types: a 1.9L turbodiesel engine delivering 150 hp and 350 Nm of torque, and a 2.4L turbocharged petrol engine with 210 hp and 320 Nm of torque. Depending on the model, these engines are paired with either a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission.The Landtrek is built for durability and can handle heavy-duty tasks, with a payload capacity exceeding 1 ton and a towing capacity up to 3 tons. Its off-road capabilities are supported by features such as Hill Descent Control and a rear differential lock, making it suitable for rough terrains. Depending on the version, the ground clearance ranges from 214 mm to 235 mm, providing the vehicle with excellent off-road performance.This type of procurement echoes similar situations in other countries, such as France, where the selection of military vehicles has sometimes sparked debate. For example, in 2015, the French Ministry of Defense faced criticism after announcing the acquisition of Ford Rangers to replace Peugeot P4s, instead of choosing vehicles offered by French brands such as Renault or Citroën. Similarly, the Gendarmerie faced controversy when it opted for the Seat Leon Cupra to replace the Megane RS within its rapid intervention teams. In both cases, the preference for non-French brands led to protests, with some officials arguing that the military and security forces should prioritize supporting the national industry.These instances demonstrate that decisions regarding military equipment can raise complex issues involving performance, cost, and political or industrial considerations. In Spain's case, the choice of the Peugeot Landtrek, despite its partial Chinese origins, appears to be driven by the need to quickly and efficiently modernize the army’s fleet of off-road vehicles while adhering to strict budgetary constraints.The acquisition of these 4,500 vehicles is part of a broader effort to modernize Spain’s military capabilities, addressing current operational needs while anticipating future challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/spanish-army-confirms-acquisition-of-4-500-peugeot-landtrek-for-non-combat-missions	2024-09-25T00:18:54-07:00

Hezbollah Uses Soviet Tu-143 Drones Converted into Cruise Missiles Amid Growing Conflict with Israel	The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has escalated significantly with Hezbollah’s use of Soviet-era Tu-143 drones, converted into cruise missiles. On September 23, 2024, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) released a video claiming to show an airstrike that occurred several weeks earlier, targeting a house in southern Lebanon containing what they referred to as a 'DR-3 cruise missile' ready for launch. The DR-3 is another designation for the Soviet Tu-143 Reys reconnaissance drone. This conversion marks the first known appearance of these modified drones in Hezbollah’s arsenal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link According to IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the missile was hidden inside a house, and Hezbollah had created a specific opening for its launch (Picture source: X Channel @manniefabian) For months, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been on the rise, driven by a series of border incidents and inflammatory rhetoric from both sides. Hezbollah, which already possesses a large stockpile of missiles and rockets, views the introduction of the converted Tu-143 as a new offensive capability. Originally designed for reconnaissance, this drone has been adapted for long-range strikes, a tactic also used by Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.The IDF used a photo of the Tu-143 to illustrate the missile they claimed to have destroyed before its launch. According to IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the missile was hidden inside a house, and Hezbollah had created a specific opening for its launch. 'The terrorists created a designated opening for the missile launch. Here, you can see how we identified the terrorists preparing the missile for launch,' Hagari explained. The IDF claimed that they precisely struck the missile and its infrastructure, eliminating the threat shortly before it could be fired.The Tu-143 is independent of runways, using rocket assistance for launch from a rail on a trailer or launch vehicle. In its cruise missile form, it has an estimated range of around 200 kilometers and is capable of carrying a 272-kilogram warhead, allowing Hezbollah to target cities as far away as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. However, the accuracy of these converted missiles remains uncertain unless substantial upgrades have been made to their guidance systems.Israel has voiced concerns about Hezbollah’s use of civilian structures to hide and launch weapons, complicating counter-strike efforts and raising humanitarian concerns. The IDF claims to have destroyed additional weapons hidden within civilian homes and buildings in Lebanon. Hezbollah, on the other hand, claims to have an extensive underground network for launching its weapons, including multiple rocket launch systems.The origin of these converted Tu-143 drones is not entirely clear. Russia had previously supplied some of these drones to the Assad regime in Syria, which is also supported by Hezbollah’s key ally, Iran. Additionally, Tehran has provided Moscow with ballistic missiles and drones as part of a growing military relationship between the two nations. It is possible that Hezbollah obtained these drones either via Syria or directly from Iran. In its cruise missile form, the Tu-143 has an estimated range of around 200 kilometers and is capable of carrying a 272-kilogram warhead, allowing Hezbollah to target cities as far away as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (Picture source: WikiCommun) This escalation comes in the context of increased tensions following the surprise attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hezbollah launched its most recent campaign of missile, rocket, and drone strikes against Israel the day after, and both sides have been trading fire almost daily since. Israel has conducted heavy bombardments of Lebanon for several days, with some analysts suggesting that a limited invasion might be considered to create a buffer zone, allowing thousands of residents in northern Israel to return to their homes.Recent coordinated explosions targeting thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon have also contributed to the growing tensions. Hezbollah has attributed these explosions to Israel and vowed retaliation. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, has threatened Israel with 'severe retribution and just punishment,' claiming that the retaliation will occur 'where it expects and where it does not.'In response to the escalating violence, the Pentagon announced on Monday that additional U.S. troops would be deployed to the region. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon’s spokesperson, did not provide specific details regarding the number of troops or their mission, citing operational security reasons. This drone was adapted for long-range strikes, a tactic also used in Ukraine by Russia, as shown by the debris found (Picture source: X Channel @COUPSURE ) The extent of Hezbollah’s converted jet drone arsenal remains unknown, as does whether these weapons have already been used. Unlike in Ukraine, no wreckage has yet been found confirming their use in Lebanon. This situation highlights the spread of improvised long-range strike tactics in current conflicts.According to the IDF, Hezbollah’s known arsenal includes the following:Hezbollah possesses the DR-3 missile (Tu-143), which has a range of several hundred kilometers, an explosive warhead weighing between 2 and 3 tons, and a missile weight of 300 kilograms. The group also has short-range attack drones, like the Model 107, which are used for surveillance and attack purposes. These drones have a range of 15-100 kilometers and carry a 1.5-kilogram warhead, capable of striking targets across Israel, particularly critical infrastructure, with the aid of advanced targeting systems.Regarding rockets, Hezbollah has a large stockpile of short-range rockets, with a range of up to 50 kilometers and the ability to carry warheads of up to 100 kilograms. The group also has heavy rockets with a range of up to 15 kilometers, carrying warheads of up to 1,000 kilograms.Finally, Hezbollah possesses long-range rockets capable of penetrating fortified targets, with a range of 50-200 kilometers and warheads weighing between 100 and 500 kilograms. This diverse arsenal represents a serious threat to Israel’s security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/hezbollah-uses-soviet-tu-143-drones-converted-into-cruise-missiles-amid-growing-conflict-with-israel	2024-09-24T06:52:40-07:00	
Escalation of Conflict Between Israel and Hezbollah: Northern Arrows Operation at Heart of Tensions	The conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has reached a new level with the launch of the 'Northern Arrows' operation by the Israeli army on September 23, 2024. As hostilities intensify, this major military operation aims to neutralize the threat posed by Hezbollah on Israel's northern border.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshots from video footage of the strikes conducted by Israel on Lebanon on September 23, 2024 (Picture source: X channel @0Informations) For several months, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been increasing, fueled by a series of border incidents and escalating rhetoric on both sides. Hezbollah, a Shiite political-military organization backed by Iran, has intensified its rocket attacks toward northern Israel in support of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. These actions prompted a strong response from the Israeli army, determined to ensure the security of its citizens and neutralize Hezbollah's offensive capabilities. In recent weeks, exchanges of fire have multiplied. Hezbollah has launched thousands of rockets and drones toward Israeli territory, targeting military installations and civilian areas. Israel, in turn, has conducted targeted airstrikes against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. The situation reached a critical point on September 23, 2024, when the Israeli army initiated the 'Northern Arrows' operation. This operation, announced by Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, aims to significantly weaken Hezbollah's military capabilities. 'The situation requires continuous and intense action on all fronts,' Halevi stated. The Israeli air forces have struck over 1,300 targets in Lebanon, including missile launchers, military buildings, and weapons depots. These strikes have affected southern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and, for the first time in years, regions further north such as Mount Lebanon. Image of a Hezbollah rocket allegedly located in a civilian house in Lebanon (Picture source: IDF) The primary objective of the 'Northern Arrows' operation is to destroy Hezbollah's offensive capabilities and secure Israel's northern border. According to Israeli military sources, Hezbollah was preparing a major offensive called 'Conquer the Galilee,' aiming to infiltrate Israeli territory and carry out attacks against civilians. The elimination of senior Hezbollah figures, including Ibrahim Aqil, the alleged architect of this plan, is a key component of this strategy. Israel asserts that it is acting based on precise intelligence to target Hezbollah's military infrastructure while minimizing civilian casualties. Warnings have been sent to civilian populations to evacuate certain areas before the strikes. However, reports indicate difficulties for civilians attempting to leave dangerous zones, with Hezbollah accused of preventing evacuations to use inhabitants as human shields. The operation also seeks to prevent Hezbollah from strengthening its positions by taking advantage of international attention focused on the conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Hezbollah, with its military experience and an arsenal estimated at 150,000 rockets and missiles, represents a threat to Israel's security. Israeli strikes aim to degrade its command and control capabilities and reduce its stockpiles of armaments. In response, Hezbollah has intensified its rocket fire, targeting Israeli northern cities such as Haifa and Kiryat Shmona. Alerts have sounded in several localities, and material damage has been reported. The current escalation raises concerns about a potential expansion of the conflict, with the risk of more direct involvement by Iran and other regional actors. Map showing the various strikes conducted by Israel on Lebanon since September 23, 2024 (Picture source: LiveuaMap) The international community is apprehensive about this volatile situation. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed concern over the escalation of violence and has called for restraint. The United States, an ally of Israel, has announced it is working on 'concrete ideas' to restore calm, while Russia has warned of the risk of regional destabilization. The 'Northern Arrows' operation marks a turning point in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. While Israel had previously favored targeted actions to contain the threat, this large-scale offensive demonstrates its determination to eliminate Hezbollah's offensive capabilities. The extent to which this escalation will continue remains uncertain. A ground invasion of Lebanon by Israel is not ruled out, although such an option carries the risk of a prolonged and costly engagement. Hezbollah faces a dilemma. Despite its arsenal and experience, it is suffering significant losses and sees its capabilities further reduced, especially following last week's explosion of beepers and walkie-talkies. In the short term, there is currently no indication that a de-escalation of the conflict is on the horizon, despite international pressure and the growing risks of destruction to Lebanese infrastructure.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/escalation-of-conflict-between-israel-and-hezbollah-northern-arrows-operation-at-heart-of-tensions	2024-09-24T05:50:52-07:00	
Norwegian shipyards compete for historic Navy frigate contract in 2029 modernization plan	According to information published by Aftenposten on September 23, 2024, for the first time in 60 years, Norway could once again see frigates built domestically. However, at least three foreign shipyards are vying for the opportunity.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Constellation class frigate. (Picture source: Fincantieri Marinette Marine) The Vard Group made their case to Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram (Sp), presenting a model of the Constellation-class frigate, highlighting why Norway should opt for this American design. Vard’s key argument lies in their connection to the American shipyard constructing the same frigates for the U.S. Navy. Both Vard and the U.S. yard share the same Italian parent company, Fincantieri. If Norway’s new frigates are to be built domestically, Vard’s Tomrefjord facility is seen as the most likely location. The defense minister expressed satisfaction with the presentation but offered no promises. The competition is heating up, with 11 countries initially invited to bid, a list that will be narrowed to three or four by winter. The frigate procurement is part of a broader modernization plan, with at least five new warships to be introduced starting in 2029. These vessels are projected to become one of Norway’s largest defense investments, potentially rivaling the F-35 fighter jet program. A single frigate could cost between 7 and 12 billion NOK, with total costs, including helicopters, weapons, and maintenance over several decades, approaching 100 billion NOK. One key requirement is that the new frigates must excel in anti-submarine warfare, equipped with advanced sonar, torpedoes, and space for helicopters. The consensus is clear: this time, Norway must buy an off-the-shelf design already in production to meet tight timelines. The strategic decision on which country to partner with for this project is critical. The new frigates will be procured, operated, and maintained in collaboration with a close ally, one whose strategic interests align with Norway's need to monitor the North Atlantic, home to Russia’s Northern Fleet bases. Among the most likely candidates are the U.S. and the U.K., although France and the Netherlands/Belgium are also in the running. The potential designs include the American Constellation-class, the British Type 26, the French FDI, and the Dutch ASWF.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/norwegian-shipyards-compete-for-historic-navy-frigate-contract-in-2029-modernization-plan	2024-09-24T05:44:18-07:00

US considers sending AGM-154 glide bombs to Ukraine to strike distant Russian positions	On September 20, 2024, information published by 'Politico' indicated that the United States is considering sending the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) called glide bomb to Ukraine as part of a new $375 million military aid package. This advanced precision-guided munition is expected to significantly enhance the operational effectiveness of Ukraine's new fleet of F-16 fighter jets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35 Lightning II Pax River Integrated Test Force from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 23 conducted the first weapons separation test of an AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) from an F-35C Lightning II carrier variant March 23. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The AGM-154 JSOW is a family of low-cost, air-to-ground glide bombs developed by Raytheon Technologies. Designed for standoff engagements, it allows aircraft to release the weapon from a considerable distance away from the target area, thereby minimizing the risk to pilots and aircraft from enemy air defenses. With a range of up to 130 km when launched from high altitude, the JSOW enables strikes without entering heavily defended airspace. Its GPS/INS navigation systems provide high accuracy against both stationary and moving targets. A Glide bomb is a type of precision-guided munition designed to glide towards its target after being released from an aircraft, allowing it to hit distant targets without requiring the plane to fly directly over them. Unlike traditional bombs that fall freely under gravity, Glide bombs are equipped with aerodynamic surfaces and control systems, enabling them to maneuver and extend their range. Some Glide bombs are equipped with GPS or laser guidance systems for enhanced accuracy, and they are often used to minimize risks to pilots by allowing attacks from standoff distances. This weapon can be configured with various warheads, including unitary blast-fragmentation and submunitions, making it effective against a wide range of targets such as armored vehicles, infrastructure, and air defense systems. Advanced versions of the JSOW are equipped with datalink capabilities, allowing for in-flight target updates and retargeting, which enhances mission flexibility. The introduction of the AGM-154 JSOW into Ukraine's arsenal is poised to significantly boost its combat capabilities. The standoff range of the JSOW allows Ukrainian forces to engage high-value targets deep within contested territories without exposing their aircraft to enemy air defenses. This capability is crucial for disrupting supply lines, command and control centers, and other strategic assets held by opposing forces. By enabling attacks from outside the reach of most surface-to-air missiles, the JSOW reduces the risk to pilots and aircraft—a critical factor given the advanced air defense systems deployed in the region. The weapon's advanced guidance systems ensure high accuracy, minimizing collateral damage and increasing the likelihood of mission success. This precision is vital for operations conducted in areas where avoiding civilian casualties is a priority. The JSOW's ability to be reprogrammed in-flight allows pilots to respond dynamically to changing battlefield conditions, making operations more adaptive and effective. Its compatibility with F-16 fighter jets means Ukraine can fully leverage the capabilities of its new aircraft fleet, thereby enhancing overall air combat effectiveness. The potential transfer of AGM-154 JSOWs signifies a deepening military collaboration between the United States and Ukraine. It reflects a strategic effort to equip Ukraine with advanced offensive systems that can serve as a deterrent against aggression. However, this move may also escalate regional tensions, as supplying such advanced weaponry could be perceived by opposing forces as a significant shift in the balance of power, potentially leading to heightened military responses. As of October 2023, the United States has continued to provide substantial military aid to Ukraine in response to Russia's ongoing invasion. This aid includes advanced weaponry such as High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), anti-aircraft systems, armored vehicles, and various types of drones. The U.S. has also supplied significant amounts of ammunition and provided training to Ukrainian forces to enhance their operational effectiveness. In addition to equipment and training, the U.S. government has allocated billions of dollars in financial assistance to support Ukraine's defense efforts. This support is part of a broader international coalition aimed at upholding Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The aid underscores the U.S. commitment to maintaining regional stability and deterring further aggression.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-considers-sending-agm-154-glide-bombs-to-ukraine-to-strike-distant-russian-positions	2024-09-24T03:10:22-07:00

Netherlands Plans to Supply Ukraine with Three Patriot Launchers Very Soon	The Netherlands is set to deliver three launchers of the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine soon. The Dutch government had already sent a radar system as part of this military support. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans announced this news in an interview with Delfi. 'We have delivered a radar system, and we will soon deliver three launchers. We are also looking to obtain other necessary components to complete the system,' said Brekelmans.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Patriot system is a long-range air defense system designed to operate at all altitudes and in all weather conditions. (Picture source: US DoD) This initiative is part of the project called the 'Patriot Puzzle,' launched by former Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren. According to this plan, the Netherlands, along with other partner countries, will provide different components of the Patriot system so that Ukraine can have a complete and operational air defense system. Brekelmans emphasized that several nations are ready to help Ukraine strengthen its air defense capabilities, though some are facing logistical or technical difficulties that are slowing the delivery of necessary equipment. 'These countries are encountering obstacles that make it difficult to assemble this system. It also depends on the willingness of other nations to disclose information about what they are providing. However, we are not always transparent about this because it is crucial not to inform Russia. Sharing too many operational details could enhance their knowledge, which we want to avoid,' Brekelmans added. At the end of the summer, former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba expressed his frustration with the delays in delivering the Patriot systems, calling on Ukraine's international partners to speed up the process. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the military estimates it needs 25 Patriot defense systems to effectively cover the entire Ukrainian territory. The Patriot system is a long-range air defense system designed to operate at all altitudes and in all weather conditions. Developed in the United States, it is currently used by many countries such as Germany, Israel, Japan, Poland, Qatar, Romania, and more recently, Ukraine. Its design relies on missiles capable of targeting and destroying various aerial threats, such as aircraft and ballistic missiles. The missile used by the Patriot system, the PAC-3, weighs around 700 kg and measures approximately 5.2 meters in length. Its range varies from 20 to 35 kilometers, offering extensive coverage against enemy threats. Unlike many other systems, the PAC-3 missile does not use an explosive warhead. Its destruction relies on a 'hit-to-kill' approach, meaning it destroys its targets through the kinetic energy generated by direct impact. This makes it particularly effective against ballistic missiles, where precision and impact force are crucial. The PAC-3 is equipped with a sophisticated guidance system, based on an active radar located in the nose of the missile. This radar allows the missile to autonomously track and engage its targets. Additionally, mid-course updates are provided by the ground-based radar, the AN/MPQ-65, complementing the missile's onboard inertial navigation system. With a maximum speed of Mach 5 (approximately 6,173 km/h), the PAC-3 is capable of responding rapidly to aerial threats. The AN/MPQ-65 radar, in turn, is a key component of the Patriot system, providing critical information on targets and enabling constant monitoring of airspace. In July, the United States announced a new military aid package that included a Patriot system, while President Zelensky confirmed the arrival of a Patriot system from Germany.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/netherlands-plans-to-supply-ukraine-with-three-patriot-launchers-very-soon	2024-09-24T01:27:50-07:00	
Rare Images of Launch of HJ-10 Anti-Tank Missile from a Chinese Armored Vehicle	Rare footage was recently broadcast on September 23 by Chinese television network CCTV-7, showing the launch of the HJ-10 anti-tank missile from a Chinese armored vehicle. These images provide insight into the capabilities of this weapon system, which represents one of the latest additions to China's advanced missile arsenal.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Designed with a standard aerodynamic layout, the missile features X-shaped wings that deploy after launch (Picture source: CCTV-7) The HJ-10, also known as 'Red Arrow 10,' is an anti-tank missile developed by China's NORINCO corporation. Equipped with a tandem high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead, it can penetrate up to 1,400 mm of conventional steel armor, even when protected by explosive reactive armor. Its maximum operational range is 10 km, and it has the ability to lock onto a target either before or after launch. The missile is characterized by its cylindrical body with a hemispherical nose cap. Designed with a standard aerodynamic layout, it features X-shaped wings that deploy after launch. Powered by solid propellant engines for both launch and cruise, it measures 1,850 mm in length, has a diameter of 165 mm, and weighs 43 kg at launch. Its cruising speed is 150 m/s, accelerating to 230 m/s during the final phase of its trajectory. A notable feature of the HJ-10 is its advanced guidance system, which combines television or infrared (IIR) imaging, an inertial system, and a two-way fiber-optic data transmission channel. The target image is transmitted to the operator's console, while control commands are sent back to the missile through the same channel. This system enables various applications, including 'fire-and-forget,' command guidance, post-launch course correction, and target reacquisition. Future upgrades aim to replace the fiber-optic channel with a radio channel. The HJ-10 can engage targets directly or from above, using different types of warheads. These options include a tandem HEAT warhead, capable of penetrating 1,200 to 1,400 mm of homogeneous armor, and a 'penetrating core' warhead designed to strike targets from above. When paired with the high mobility features of the MV3 launch vehicle, the system offers a combination of speed, agility, and firepower that can significantly impact the battlefield. The vehicle, based on an all-terrain chassis, is designed for rapid deployment and effective operation in various tactical environments, with the ability to engage both ground and aerial targets, including helicopters. China has developed a diverse range of anti-tank missiles over the years. In addition to the HJ-10, the 'Red Arrow' series includes the HJ-8, a second-generation missile, and the HJ-12, a third-generation portable missile with 'fire-and-forget' capability. These developments reflect China's continued efforts to modernize its armed forces and adopt advanced military technologies to enhance its ground forces' capabilities.

Russian Navy claims drone neutralized in Barents Sea drills using Poliment-Redut system	According to information published by Tass on September 24, 2024, during exercises in the Barents Sea, the frigate Admiral Golovko successfully engaged a strike drone using the ship-based Poliment-Redut air defense missile system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate Admiral Golovko. (Picture source: Russian MoD) The Admiral Golovko, a Northern Fleet frigate, was conducting a planned training exercise when it intercepted and destroyed an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) simulating a threat. The live-fire drill, part of the ship's air defense training, saw the vertical-launch Poliment-Redut system demonstrate its operational readiness. The target drone, launched from the Kola Peninsula, was part of a scenario designed to mimic a UAV on a course toward the ship. The missile firing took place within designated naval training zones, which had been closed to civilian shipping and air traffic to ensure safety. Comments The recent exercise involving Russia's Admiral Golovko frigate in the Barents Sea highlights significant trends in modern naval warfare, particularly the increasing role of unmanned systems and advanced air defense capabilities. The drill, which saw the frigate engage a drone using the Poliment-Redut surface-to-air missile system, reflects broader global trends in naval defense as modern warships are forced to contend with a range of airborne threats, from drones to advanced missile systems. Drones are becoming integral to modern naval strategies, serving roles in reconnaissance, targeting, and, increasingly, direct strikes. As demonstrated in this exercise, the threat posed by UAVs to naval assets has necessitated the development of robust anti-drone systems. Russia, like many other naval powers, recognizes the potential of drones to penetrate traditional air defense systems. UAVs are particularly effective because of their relatively low cost, expendability, and capacity for swarming tactics, which can overwhelm a ship's defenses. The Poliment-Redut system allows for rapid targeting and engagement, a necessity when dealing with smaller, faster, or more numerous targets. Its inclusion on Project 22350 frigates underscores Russia's emphasis on multi-layered defense, particularly as unmanned systems become more advanced and potentially more autonomous.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russian-navy-claims-drone-neutralized-in-barents-sea-drills-using-poliment-redut-system	2024-09-24T01:13:56-07:00

South Africa's new RG41 GT7 105mm self-propelled howitzer strengthens fire support for infantry units	Denel announced at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) 2024 event (the company's first public exhibition since its recent move to the South African Department of Defence) the integration of its RG41 eight-wheeled combat vehicle with a modified version of the G7 105 mm gun. This combination, which could be referred to as the RG41 GT7, is expected to offer fire support capabilities as a self-propelled artillery system for mechanized or motorized infantry units.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 105 mm gun mounted on this vehicle is based on the G7 105 mm LEO towed howitzer but required technical modifications for vehicle mounting, resulting in the Denel GT7 gun. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Business Development Manager Isaac Karelse explained that the RG41 platform originated from Project Hoefyster, where it was intended as Denel's alternative to the Finnish Patria eight-wheeled platform, which eventually became the South African Army's Badger 8x8. At that time, the Patria was among the few eight-wheeled infantry fighting vehicles available. The RG41 was designed, tested, and sent to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for summer trials, where it performed according to expectations. However, changes in the UAE's requirements led to the selection of the RG35 vehicle instead of the RG41. As delays arose in the manufacturing of the Patria/Badger system, Denel proposed the RG41 as a potential option for Project Hoefyster to complement the Badger across various vehicle types. Karelse described this situation as the RG41 becoming a 'future requirement.' The vehicle was advertised for Middle Eastern markets, but the process was paused due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the interim, Denel equipped the RG41 with remotely-operated turrets, specifically the Tactical Remote Turret (TRT), tested with both 20 mm and 30 mm cannon variants. During shooting trials at Armscor’s Alkantpan test range with the G6 155 mm self-propelled howitzer and the truck-mounted T5 system, Denel identified the potential to install a 105 mm gun on the RG41. The 105 mm gun is based on the G7 105 mm LEO towed howitzer but required technical modifications for vehicle mounting, resulting in the Denel GT7 gun. The RG41 originated from Project Hoefyster, where it was developed as Denel's alternative to the Finnish Patria eight-wheeled platform. This latter eventually became the South African Army's Badger 8x8, as depicted here in the Badger-MsIV missile carrier variant. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Denel then developed the T7 105 mm turret, which weighs 3,750 kg. Karelse noted that, while the turret is currently manned for testing and trials, plans are in place for it to be unmanned in the future. The RG41 GT7 can seat 11 personnel, including one driver, one vehicle commander, one gunner, one section commander, and seven section crew members. A standard infantry section usually comprises ten personnel, but in a mechanized environment, this number can be adjusted based on the vehicle's role. The vehicle is equipped with a safety belt system featuring a 4-point harness. The protection features of the RG41 include ballistic protection in accordance with STANAG 4569 Level 2, with an option to upgrade to Level 4 or 5. It also provides mine protection meeting STANAG 4569 Level 4A/3B standards, with the possibility of upgrading to Level 4B. The specific level of improvised explosive device (IED) protection has not been disclosed. Constructed with a V-shaped hull to offer landmine protection, the RG41 has a hardened armored 'shell' for the crew's safety. There is a gap between this shell and the external 'armor package,' ranging from 100 mm to 130 mm, which can be further reinforced with add-on armor. In counter-insurgency operations, wire mesh can be added with a gap to shield the armor from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and other projectiles. Karelse emphasized that the design prioritizes crew survivability, allowing the vehicle to protect its occupants even if damaged. Other variants of the RG41 were also developed in the past, such as an infantry fighting vehicle, a command vehicle, an ambulance, a recovery vehicle, and an engineering vehicle (Picture source: Army Recognition). The T7/G7 combination remains in the prototype stage and requires further development. It is projected to serve as a mobile self-propelled artillery system within mechanized battalion settings. The G7 gun has a maximum range of 30 km, and its ammunition is designed to offer effects comparable to standard 155 mm high-explosive shells, effectively delivering similar capabilities within a 105 mm framework. Rheinmetall Denel Munition (RDM) developed the ammunition types, which include high explosive, high explosive pre-formed fragmentation, smoke, illuminating, and other variants. The standard projectile range is 24 km with a boat tail and 30 km with base bleed, while the direct fire range extends from 500 to 2,000 meters. The G7/RG41 system is equipped with an Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) that interfaces with the Gun Control Unit (GCU), allowing for automatic gun laying through hydraulic elevation and traverse drives for rapid target engagement. The ammunition handling system utilizes a positive chain-type rammer controlled from the integrated Loader Control Panel, supporting fully automatic ramming of both the projectile and charge. Manual loading is also possible to ensure redundancy. In terms of specifications, the RG41 GT7 has a length of 7,780 mm, a hull width of 2,800 mm, and a hull height of 2,380 mm. The wheelbase dimensions are 1,693 mm between the first and second axles, 2,257 mm between the second and third axles, and 1,550 mm between the third and fourth axles. Ground clearance is measured at 440 mm, featuring an angle of approach of 64 degrees and an angle of departure of 54 degrees. The vehicle has a curb weight of 18,200 kg and a payload capacity of 9,800 kg to support the new turret, resulting in a total Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) of 28,000 kg. Like many South African-designed vehicles, the RG41 GT7 self-propelled howitzer benefits from a V-shaped armored hull to enhance mine protection. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The vehicle is powered by a Deutz engine, specifically the Model 2015TCD V6, with a displacement of 12.1 liters. The engine's maximum power output is 390 kW at 2,100 rpm, and it generates a maximum torque of 2,130 Nm at 1,300 rpm. The RG41 uses a ZF5HP902 transmission system, featuring a 5-speed configuration with an integral 2-speed drop-down capability. In terms of performance, the RG41 reaches a maximum speed of 100 km/h and can handle a gradeability of up to 70%. The transfer box is manufactured by Denel, with the gear ratio categorized under the Type 17,000 series. The steering system is a twin-steer, power-assisted, fully-integral model. The wheel heads are made by AxleTech, and the suspension system is independent, using hydro-pneumatic struts with hydraulic shock absorbers. The vehicle's braking system includes pneumatic disc brakes with ABS for the main brakes, while the parking brake is activated with air release disc brakes on all four rear wheels. The RG41 uses road wheels and tires with a 10.00R20 aluminum rim type, equipped with 16.00R20 Michelin XZL tires. Additionally, the vehicle is fitted with an RFI system, offering a 100 km range when traveling at a speed of 50 km/h. The standard projectile range for the G7 105mm gun is 24 km with a boat tail and 30 km with base bleed, while the direct fire range extends from 500 to 2,000 meters.

Russia gains Atlantic Port access through military deal with São Tomé and Príncipe	According to information published by Russian sources on September 23, 2024, Russia has moved to expand its military cooperation with São Tomé and Príncipe, opening potential new access points for the Russian Navy in the Atlantic.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Slava-class cruiser Marshal Ustinov in South Africa. (Picture source: Tass) The Russian government submitted an agreement for ratification by the State Duma that establishes military cooperation between Russia and the island nation. This agreement, which was signed in April 2024, has already been approved by the legal commission. The cooperation framework includes intelligence sharing and collaboration in the military sphere, as well as granting Russian naval vessels access to São Tomé and Príncipe’s ports for resupply and rest. This development is seen as strategically valuable given the limited number of ports currently available to Russian vessels globally. Comments Russia’s defense relationships with African nations have expanded significantly in recent years, reflecting a mix of security cooperation, economic interests, and geopolitical strategy. These ties are often cemented through arms deals, military training, and the provision of security forces, notably through private military contractors (PMCs) like Wagner Group. Russia has signed military cooperation agreements with 43 African countries, offering a broad range of services from personnel training to the supply of military equipment. This cooperation has increased notably in countries facing instability, coups, or Western disengagement, such as Mali, Central African Republic (CAR), and Sudan. One key feature of Russia’s approach has been its avoidance of imposing political conditions, making it an appealing partner for African regimes that prioritize regime security over democratic reforms. This is in contrast to Western powers that often tie military support to governance and human rights conditions. For example, Russia has established a strong presence in CAR, where Wagner Group supports the government in exchange for access to lucrative natural resources, including gold and diamonds. Similarly, in Mali and Niger, recent coups have led to a shift away from France and the West, with these nations now leaning toward Russian military support. Russia’s strategy in Africa also seeks to challenge Western influence by establishing strategic footholds, including potential naval bases and expanding its reach in critical maritime regions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/russia-gains-atlantic-port-access-through-military-deal-with-sao-tome-and-principe	2024-09-24T00:38:01-07:00	
Brazilian Air Force Acquires New Hermes RQ-900 Surveillance Drone after Crash	On September 24, 2024, the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) announced the purchase of a new Elbit Hermes 900 (RQ-900) drone to replace the one lost in May during a rescue mission in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. This acquisition, made official in the Official Gazette of the Union on September 10 through Contract Extract No. 50/2024, amounts to 50 million reais, approximately 9 million US dollars.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ebit System Hermes RQ-900 Surveillance Drone (Picture source: Wikimedia) The agreement was signed between the São Paulo Aeronautical Material Park (PAMA-SP), responsible for maintaining various military aircraft, and AEL Sistemas, the Brazilian subsidiary of Israeli manufacturer Elbit Systems. The purchase was made without a public tender, in accordance with Brazilian public procurement law, to ensure logistical standardization of the armed forces' equipment. The drone lost in May 2024 belonged to the First Squadron of the Twelfth Aviation Group (1º/12º GAv) of the FAB, based at Santa Maria Air Base (BASM). The aircraft was on an aerial surveillance mission to support rescue operations for flood victims in southern Brazil when it suffered a technical failure and crashed. The drone, an Hermes RQ-900 model, is known for its medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) flight capabilities, allowing it to monitor large areas for extended periods. The acquisition of the new drone was justified by the need to maintain uniformity in the Brazilian armed forces' equipment. The Elbit Hermes 900 drone, already widely used by the FAB, is a crucial component of Brazil’s aerial surveillance and rapid response strategy, as demonstrated by its use during recent natural disasters. The FAB is not the only branch of the Brazilian military using drones in its operations. The Brazilian Army and Navy also operate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for various strategic purposes. These initiatives include the Army Aviation Program, the Integrated Border Monitoring System (SISFRON), and the Full Operational Capability Acquisition Program (OCOP), which foresee increased use of drones for surveillance, reconnaissance, and border security.

The E-7 Wedgetail is designed for advanced detection and surveillance missions, capable of simultaneously tracking multiple airborne and maritime threats thanks to its MESA radar, which provides 360-degree coverage. This aircraft is essential for multi-domain situational awareness, significantly enhancing command and control decision-making capabilities. According to Maria Laine, president of Boeing UK, Ireland, and Nordics, establishing the E-7 modification line in the UK is a source of pride: 'We are committed to delivering this vital capability to support the UK's national security and contribute to regional stability.' The future RAF squadron of E-7s will be based at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, where necessary infrastructure is nearing completion. Additionally, the RAF is part of a trilateral agreement with the Australian and US Air Forces, aimed at enhancing interoperability and joint capability development. The E-7 program is also gaining significance on the international stage. In addition to the RAF, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Republic of Korea Air Force, and the Turkish Air Force already operate this advanced system. In 2023, NATO also selected the Wedgetail for its Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control (AEW&amp;C) mission, further solidifying this aircraft's role as a key element of collective defense. Following a series of flight tests scheduled for this fall, the aircraft will be sent to receive its official RAF livery, marking another step towards its full integration into the British armed forces. The E-7 Wedgetail's MESA radar, developed by Northrop Grumman, is a major improvement over the E-3 Sentry's rotating radar. The MESA radar uses electronic scanning technology, allowing it to track targets simultaneously over 360 degrees without moving parts, improving reliability and reducing maintenance. It also offers superior detection range and enhanced ability to track high-speed targets, providing more comprehensive and accurate situational awareness. Unlike older radar systems, operators can redirect the power from 'unused' sensors (such as those oriented towards friendly lines) to enhance the energy supply to other sensors. This increases their range and identification capabilities. The E-7 features modernized communication systems that enhance interoperability with other military forces, including ground, naval, and air units. These systems enable secure, interference-resistant data links, ensuring that critical information is reliably transmitted even in contested environments. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry's older communication systems are less robust against modern cyber threats. The E-7 is based on the Boeing 737-700 platform, offering better fuel efficiency and a longer range compared to the E-3 Sentry, which is based on the Boeing 707 platform. This allows the E-7 to cover larger areas without frequent refueling, increasing mission endurance and operational flexibility. With ten mission consoles, the E-7 allows the crew to process and analyze data in real time, optimizing battlespace management. These consoles are connected by a high-speed internal network, facilitating the handling of complex information and operation coordination. In contrast, the E-3 Sentry has older, less integrated mission systems with lower real-time processing capabilities. The E-7 benefits from integrated logistical support and advanced maintenance infrastructure, including software and hardware updates facilitated by ground support systems. This optimizes the aircraft's operational availability. The older E-3 Sentry requires more maintenance and its systems are less easily updated.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/boeing-announces-successful-first-flight-of-uks-advanced-e-7-wedgetail-aewc-aircraft	2024-09-23T02:38:06-07:00

Kongsberg is also responsible for supplying the combat systems for the upcoming 212CD submarines, which will be delivered to both Norway and Germany in the future. Technical comparison The Type 212CD and Ula-class submarines represent distinct phases in diesel-electric submarine technology. The Ula-class, commissioned between 1989 and 1992, was designed for coastal defense, leveraging its small size for stealth in shallow waters. However, it lacks some modern features found in newer submarines, such as air-independent propulsion (AIP), which limits its ability to remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing to recharge. In contrast, the Type 212CD, developed jointly by Germany and Norway, integrates AIP, allowing it to stay submerged for significantly longer, enhancing its stealth by avoiding the need to 'snort' at periscope depth. Its larger size and enhanced hydrodynamics further increase its range and versatility, allowing for operations in both coastal and deep-water environments. While the Ula-class submarines remain effective due to regular upgrades, such as new sonar and navigation systems, they lack the strike capabilities of the Type 212CD. The newer design can deploy advanced weapons like the Naval Strike Missile, enabling engagements with both surface ships and land targets, a feature absent in the Ula-class. The Type 212CD also benefits from significant improvements in signature management, with the use of non-magnetic steel and advanced acoustic quieting technologies, making it harder to detect compared to the Ula-class.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/kongsberg-secures-contract-to-upgrade-norways-ula-class-submarines	2024-09-23T01:25:29-07:00

(Picture source: Prime Minister GR) The decision, revealed by Greek Defense Minister Nikos Dendias during a ceremony at the Lorian shipyards in France, follows a previous agreement made in 2021 to acquire three of the advanced frigates for a total of 3.0 billion euros ($3.34 billion). This new move seeks to enhance Greece’s naval capabilities as the country continues to recover from a decade-long financial crisis. Speaking at the launch of Greece’s second French-built frigate, Dendias underscored the strategic importance of the Belharra vessels, noting that three of the four ships will be equipped to carry 'Scalp Naval' cruise missiles with a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). This missile capability would provide Greece with a potent tool for long-range precision strikes. This latest development is part of a broader Greek defense initiative, which includes a comprehensive 10-year, multi-billion-euro acquisition plan. Alongside the frigates, Greece aims to purchase up to 40 F-35 fighter jets from the United States, in addition to French-made Rafale jets. Greece-Turkey relations Greek-Turkish relations have experienced significant fluctuations over the years, marked by both historical rivalries and modern diplomatic efforts. Key disputes between the two countries revolve around territorial issues in the Aegean Sea, including the delimitation of maritime boundaries, airspace control, and the exploitation of energy resources in contested waters. The long-standing debate over Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and continental shelf rights, especially after discoveries of gas reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean, has further intensified tensions. Additionally, Turkey’s declaration of casus belli (cause for war) if Greece extends its territorial waters beyond six nautical miles remains a critical sticking point. Despite these challenges, 2023 saw notable improvements in their relations. Greece’s rapid humanitarian response to Turkey’s devastating earthquakes fostered goodwill between the nations. This was followed by high-level meetings, culminating in the 'Athens Declaration' in December, where both leaders pledged to reduce tensions and enhance bilateral cooperation. However, underlying tensions remain. Disputes over demilitarization of islands and territorial sovereignty in the Aegean persist, with Turkey frequently challenging Greek exercises and sovereignty in the region. Both nations have also indicated a desire to address these disputes through diplomatic channels, but progress on substantial issues, such as maritime boundaries, has been slow.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/greece-to-buy-fourth-belharra-class-frigate-and-cruise-missiles-from-france	2024-09-23T00:49:12-07:00

After Acquiring M1A2 SEPv3, Australia Could Transfer Its M1A1 Abrams Tanks to Ukraine	According to information reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, in collaboration with the Biden administration, the Australian government is working on a plan to send 59 M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine. As the war in Ukraine continues, where Ukrainian forces struggle to compensate for material losses against a Russian army capable of quickly replacing its tanks through a robust defense industry, the question of tank supply has become critical. With losses of Ukrainian M1A1 Abrams Situational Awareness (SA) tanks, provided by the United States in September 2023, mounting, the possibility of reinforcements from other countries may soon materialize.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Australian Army M1A1 Abrams tank firing during Exercise Gauntlet Strike in Puckapunyal. (Picture source: Australian Army) The Russian army, supported by its defense industry, has recently received an additional batch of T-90M Proryv tanks, further strengthening its ability to maintain a steady flow of heavy equipment to the front lines. Conversely, Ukraine, dependent on military aid from its Western partners, has seen its number of M1A1 Abrams tanks decrease by half, with no additional deliveries from the U.S. scheduled in the near term.The M1A1 Abrams is an improved version of the U.S.-designed M1 Abrams main battle tank. First produced in 1985, this tank features several upgrades over the initial version, including a new suspension system, transmission modifications, and enhanced armor protection. Its main armament is a 120mm M256 smoothbore cannon, capable of firing kinetic energy penetrator rounds with an effective range of over 3,500 meters. The tank is also equipped with two 7.62mm coaxial machine guns and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun, providing significant firepower.The M1A1 uses Chobham composite armor, supplemented with depleted uranium plates, offering effective protection against kinetic and chemical energy rounds.

As of late September 2024, Ukraine has received all 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks that were promised by the United States earlier in the year. (Picture source: Ukrainian Army) Another country that could help offset Ukraine's losses is Australia. In January 2022, Canberra confirmed the acquisition of 75 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams tanks for approximately $2.5 billion to replace the 59 M1A1 Abrams tanks in service with the Australian Army. These tanks, which had not seen extensive use, were retired in July 2024 and placed in reserve as the first M1A2 SEPv3 deliveries were imminent. As of late September 2024, Ukraine has received all 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks that were promised by the United States earlier in the year. These deliveries were part of a U.S. pledge made in January 2023 to supply Ukraine with modern tanks to strengthen its defense against Russian forces. However, reports suggest that Ukraine has already lost at least half of these tanks in the ongoing conflict.Kiev's interest in these decommissioned tanks is not new, but the Australian government had previously declined the request, citing the high cost of such a transfer. This same argument was used to justify the refusal to send a fleet of MRH-90 'Taipan' helicopters, also retired from Australian service to Ukraine.However, Australia's Defense Minister, Richard Marles, appears to have reconsidered the issue and is now considering supplying the tanks to Kyiv, subject to U.S. defense export regulations.If this transaction goes through, it could provide significant support to the Ukrainian military, which is struggling against Russia's material strength. Ongoing discussions between Canberra and Washington underscore the strategic importance of Ukraine in maintaining the balance of power in Eastern Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/after-acquiring-m1a2-sepv3-australia-could-transfer-its-m1a1-abrams-tanks-to-ukraine	2024-09-23T00:30:22-07:00

Exclusive: Rheinmetall Demonstrates Challenger 3 Tank's Firepower Against Russian T-72B3 in Live-Fire Test	In a stunning demonstration of firepower, German Company Rheinmetall has showcased the destructive capabilities of the new L55 caliber 120 mm smoothbore gun mounted on the Challenger 3 main battle tank, designed for the British Army. According to military expert Nicholas Drummond, who shared the news on his X (formerly Twitter) account, the test involved using a real Russian T-72B3 tank as the target, simulating a real-world battlefield scenario.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link New Challenger 3 main battle tank prototype at DVD 2024, defense exhibition in Millbrook, United Kingdom. (Picture source: Army Recognition Group) The L55 smoothbore gun, known for its enhanced range and accuracy, fired a DM63 APFSDS (Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) round against the Russian T-72B3 tank. The results were devastating. The round penetrated the tank’s glacis plate—its heavily armored front slope—punched through the crew compartment, tore through the engine block, and exited the rear of the vehicle. This level of penetration demonstrates the lethality of the Challenger 3’s armament against modern armor, especially against Russian tanks, which are frequently encountered in conflict zones. The L55 gun is a 120mm smoothbore cannon developed by German Company Rheinmetall as an upgraded version of the L44, designed primarily for main battle tanks like the Leopard 2A6. It features a longer barrel compared to its predecessor, which improves muzzle velocity and enhances the gun's overall accuracy, range, and armor-piercing capability. This increased length allows the L55 to fire more advanced and powerful kinetic energy rounds, making it more effective against modern armored threats. Initially introduced to equip the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent variants, the L55 has been adopted by several NATO countries. Its improved performance allows tanks to engage targets at greater distances with higher precision and increased penetration power, making it a crucial advancement in tank armament, particularly against heavily armored opponents.The DM63 APFSDS (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) is a modern kinetic energy tank round developed by Rheinmetall for 120mm smoothbore guns, such as those found on the Leopard 2 and other NATO tanks. It is designed to penetrate advanced armor by using a long, dense tungsten penetrator that discards its outer sabot upon firing, allowing the dart-like core to maintain speed and accuracy. The DM63 features a temperature-independent propellant, ensuring consistent performance in varying climates, and is optimized for use with both the L44 and L55 guns, offering enhanced penetration power against modern armored threats. The T-72B3 tank is a modernized version of the Soviet-era T-72 MBT (Main Battle Tank), designed to enhance its capabilities and keep it relevant on the modern battlefield. The tank has seen extensive use in Ukraine, where it is one of the most common armored vehicles employed by Russian forces. Its durability, ease of production, and various upgrades have made it a staple in Russia's armored fleet. The armor on the T-72B3 is a combination of composite and reactive technologies, intended to provide protection against a wide range of modern anti-tank weapons. The base armor of the T-72B3 is composed of composite materials, which combine layers of steel with non-metallic substances, such as ceramics. This setup improves the tank’s resistance to kinetic energy penetrators, such as armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, as well as high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads, which rely on explosive force to punch through armor. In addition to the composite armor, the T-72B3 is equipped with explosive reactive armor (ERA) blocks, typically the Kontakt-5 system. These ERA blocks are placed on the tank's turret and hull and work by detonating upon impact, disrupting the penetrating jet or projectile from a HEAT round or significantly reducing the effectiveness of kinetic energy rounds. The combination of ERA and composite armor gives the T-72B3 considerable protection against the most common threats on the battlefield, although it is still vulnerable to modern anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and advanced APFSDS rounds. Despite these upgrades, the T-72B3's armor is not on par with the latest Western tanks, such as the Challenger 3 or the M1A2 Abrams, which feature more advanced composite armor arrays and reactive systems. In tests like the one conducted by Rheinmetall, the Challenger 3's 120 mm L55 cannon with the DM63 APFSDS round was able to penetrate the T-72B3's highlighting the vulnerabilities of the T-72B3 when facing cutting-edge Western armor-piercing technology. German Company Rheinmetall’s demonstration underscores the strategic advantage the Challenger 3 will bring to the British Army, offering enhanced firepower, mobility, and survivability. The tank is part of the UK's broader effort to modernize its armored forces, ensuring they remain a formidable force on the battlefield.

India Seeks to Export Modernized Russian T-72 Tanks to African and Asian Markets	India has decided to modernize its fleet of Russian-origin T-72 tanks with the intention of exporting the upgraded models to international markets, particularly targeting potential buyers in Africa, the Middle East, and East Asia. This decision represents a strategic collaboration between the Indian and Russian defense industries, aimed at extending the lifespan of the T-72 tanks by refurbishing them for prospective clients.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Heavy Vehicles Factory in Avadi, which has since produced upgraded T-90 tanks, will now be used as the base for modernizing the T-72 tanks destined for export (Picture source: Flickr Channel Cell105) According to a senior defense official involved in the partnership between the two nations, the modernization process will take place in India before the tanks are exported to countries interested in acquiring these combat vehicles. The Indian Army currently operates approximately 2,500 T-72 tanks, which have served as its main battle tanks since their introduction in the 1970s. Demand for these tanks remains strong, particularly from countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Many nations have expressed interest in acquiring the T-72 as India prepares to gradually replace them with more advanced models. Production of the T-72 tanks in India began in the 1980s at the Heavy Vehicles Factory in Avadi, near Chennai. Before that, India had purchased 500 units directly from the Soviet Union. This same facility, which has since produced upgraded T-90 tanks, will now be used as the base for modernizing the T-72 tanks destined for export. Indian and Russian technical experts are working closely to ensure the success of this modernization process. The T-72 has been a reliable and durable combat vehicle in the Indian Army’s inventory, equipped with a 125 mm main gun, an anti-aircraft gun, and a machine gun. It can reach speeds of 60 km/h on roads and 35 km/h off-road, and it is capable of fording rivers up to 1.2 meters deep. During the 2020 tensions with China, India deployed these tanks to the high-altitude region of Ladakh, marking the first time the T-72 was stationed in such challenging terrain. In addition to the T-72, the Indian Army operates around 1,000 T-90 tanks and approximately 100 indigenous Arjun tanks. Despite the modernization efforts, the T-72 remains the most numerous tank in the Indian Army’s arsenal. If the initiative proves successful, India may explore the possibility of exporting other Russian-origin military vehicles, such as BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, which are also scheduled for upgrades. The modernization of the T-72 for export could represent a new opportunity for India to expand its presence in the global defense market, offering cost-effective solutions to countries in need of reliable armored vehicles. As India looks to the future, this modernization effort is part of a broader strategy to revamp its military capabilities by gradually phasing out older equipment while potentially boosting the export of surplus hardware. The collaboration between the Indian and Russian defense sectors will be crucial in achieving these goals.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/india-seeks-to-export-modernized-russian-t-72-tanks-to-african-and-asian-markets	2024-09-20T05:40:49-07:00

US raises alarm over increased Russian military activity near undersea cables	According to information published by CNN on September 18, 2024, the United States has reported a rise in Russian military operations around key undersea cables, heightening fears of potential sabotage against critical global communication infrastructure.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Nord Stream gas leak in the Baltic Sea. (Picture source: Danish MoD) According to U.S. officials, the secretive Russian military unit is believed to be focusing its efforts on disrupting undersea internet cables, raising alarms about the security of vital communications networks. This revelation underscores growing concerns about Russia’s ability to target global infrastructure. The unit in question, known by its Russian acronym GUGI (General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research), is reportedly enhancing its capabilities for undersea sabotage. U.S. intelligence highlights that GUGI deploys various vessels, submarines, and marine drones in its operations. The specialized deepwater submarines under GUGI's command are capable of reaching depths of 2,500 meters, and the Russian research vessel Yantar—spotted near sensitive cables off the coast of the U.K. in 2019—has been linked to this effort. The Kremlin appears to be placing significant emphasis on the activities of GUGI, with the unit continuing to receive robust financial backing. U.S. officials have pointed to recent statements by Dmitri Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, who in June hinted that Russia could target undersea communication networks if provoked. Further concerns were raised by reports of Russian vessels regularly patrolling near critical maritime infrastructure, often far from Russia’s own coastline. Undersea cables form the backbone of global internet and telecommunications traffic, stretching thousands of kilometers along the ocean floor, particularly between Europe and North America. Any coordinated sabotage could result in widespread economic and social disruption, especially in Europe. A well-executed attack on these cables could severely impact civilian communications, governmental operations, and military readiness. Additionally, industries reliant on these networks, such as the financial and energy sectors, would face significant challenges. Western nations, already focused on securing vital infrastructure as they develop green energy initiatives in the North Sea, are increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of these undersea assets. Around 95 percent of global internet traffic travels through these cables, which operate at speeds of approximately 200 terabytes per second. Of the 400 undersea cables, NATO considers 200 as critical infrastructure. These cables facilitate an estimated $10 trillion in financial transactions daily, highlighting their economic significance. David Cattler, former head of NATO intelligence, previously noted Russia’s increased activity in mapping out critical allied infrastructure, both on land and at sea. The threat posed by Russia’s focus on undersea cables has not gone unnoticed. NATO sources have confirmed a growing concern over Moscow’s intentions. Data released in June revealed that over the past decade, more than 160 non-military Russian ships have carried out 945 suspicious activities near key infrastructure in the North Sea. Of these incidents, 749 occurred within a one-kilometer radius of essential pipelines. Repairing any damage to such pipelines is both costly and time-consuming. Additionally, 72 suspicious movements involved power cables, and 124 were near telecommunications cables.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-raises-alarm-over-increased-russian-military-activity-near-undersea-cables	2024-09-20T02:43:10-07:00

U.S. Coast Guard monitors Russian naval vessels near Alaska's maritime border	According to information published by the US Armed Forces on September 16, 2024, the U.S. Coast Guard encountered four Russian Federation Navy (RFN) vessels approximately 57 miles northwest of Point Hope, Alaska. The vessels were identified during a routine patrol by the crew of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Stratton (WMSL 752) in the Chukchi Sea.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Navy's Severodvinsk-class submarine and Steregushchiy-class frigate. (Picture source: US Coast Guard) The Russian ships were initially seen transiting along the Russian side of the Maritime Boundary Line (MBL) before crossing into U.S. waters, approximately 30 miles into the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Their movements appeared to be in response to sea ice on the Russian side, and they operated in compliance with international maritime law during their transit. Coast Guard Cutter Stratton’s patrol was part of Operation Frontier Sentinel, a mission designed to ensure the U.S. presence is maintained in areas where strategic competitors operate. The Russian naval group consisted of a Severodvinsk-class submarine, Dolgorukiy-class submarine, Steregushchiy-class frigate, and a Seliva-class tug. US Coast Guard The interactions between enemy navies and the U.S. Coast Guard are shaped by the Coast Guard's dual role as both a law enforcement entity and a military service under the Department of Homeland Security. This unique position allows it to engage in a variety of operations that overlap with traditional naval missions, including maritime security, border enforcement, and support for U.S. Navy activities. In regions like the South China Sea, where tensions run high due to territorial disputes and freedom of navigation issues, the Coast Guard has been increasingly involved alongside the Navy. For instance, U.S. Coast Guard cutters have been deployed to participate in freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs), challenging excessive maritime claims, such as those asserted by China. These deployments allow the Coast Guard to take on missions that complement the Navy’s focus on power projection and deterrence, while also potentially de-escalating military confrontations by presenting a non-military, law enforcement-oriented presence. The Coast Guard also plays a critical role in countering 'gray zone' tactics, where adversarial forces use civilian or paramilitary assets to challenge territorial waters without direct military confrontation. In these cases, the Coast Guard’s authority in law enforcement helps manage confrontations that might not warrant a full military response but still threaten maritime sovereignty and security. This approach has been particularly useful in places like East Asia, where coast guard-to-coast guard cooperation can help manage incidents involving fishing vessels or coast guard ships from adversarial nations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/u-s-coast-guard-monitors-russian-naval-vessels-near-alaskas-maritime-border	2024-09-19T06:09:13-07:00

Taiwan's first indigenous submarine Haikun to begin sea trials in 2025 plans for 8-submarine fleet	According to information published by CNA on September 19, 2024, the prototype of Taiwan's first domestically produced submarine, the Narwhal (Haikun), is currently undergoing harbor acceptance tests (HAT), with plans to begin sea acceptance tests (SAT) by late March or early April 2025. The Haikun, launched in September 2023, is the first step in Taiwan's submarine production program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Launching ceremony of the Taiwanese Hai-Kun class submarine Hai Kun. (Picture source: Taiwan presidency) The Ministry of National Defense has outlined a phased production plan, starting with two additional submarines based on the Haikun design, followed by three enhanced models. A total of eight submarines are planned for Taiwan's fleet. The timeline for the Haikun project has been extended, with final project completion now expected by 2029. This extension is due to phased deliveries of the critical MK-48 Mod 6 AT torpedoes, affected by global supply chain challenges. To support this initiative, Taiwan's Executive Yuan has approved a budget of NT$284 billion, covering construction costs, training facilities, crew accommodations, weapons systems, and related infrastructure. The budget includes allocations for anti-ship missiles and torpedoes, ensuring the full combat capability of the submarine fleet once operational. In addition, Admiral Chiu Chun-jung, Chief of Staff of the Navy, revealed that Taiwan has signed mutual rescue agreements with allied nations to enhance submarine rescue capabilities. These agreements ensure reliable support for underwater operations, though specific countries involved have not been disclosed. Plans for a dedicated submarine rescue vessel are also in development, with a detailed proposal expected by 2027. Comments Taiwan's pursuit of a modern submarine fleet is a critical element in its broader defense strategy to counterbalance the growing capabilities of China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The island currently operates an outdated submarine force, consisting of just four submarines, two of which are World War II-era vessels. Recognizing the urgent need for modernization, Taiwan has embarked on the Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS) program. The main goal of Taiwan's submarine fleet expansion is to enhance its asymmetric defense capabilities. Submarines, difficult to detect and highly effective in disrupting naval operations, are viewed as essential for protecting Taiwan against blockades or potential invasion attempts. In a blockade scenario, Taiwan’s submarines would play a crucial role in keeping critical supply routes open. Moreover, their ability to operate stealthily could impose significant risks to Chinese surface vessels, including larger assets like aircraft carriers, as demonstrated by past naval conflicts where submarines had an outsized impact. Despite these advantages, Taiwan faces challenges in its submarine program. The IDS relies heavily on foreign technology, with contributions from countries like the U.S., U.K., and others. This has complicated procurement efforts, given China’s diplomatic pressure on potential suppliers. Additionally, some critics argue that Taiwan’s focus on expensive submarines may divert resources from more cost-effective, asymmetric systems better suited for defense in the Taiwan Strait, where shallow waters could limit submarine operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/taiwans-first-indigenous-submarine-haikun-to-begin-sea-trials-in-2025-plans-for-8-submarine-fleet	2024-09-19T03:24:14-07:00

Boeing Develops New Land-Based Version of MQ-25 Autonomous Aerial Refueling System for US Air Force	On September 16, 2024, at the Air &amp; Space Forces Association’s Air Space &amp; Cyber Conference, Boeing unveiled a new land-based version of its unmanned MQ-25 tanker, specifically adapted to meet the future refueling needs of the U.S. Air Force (USAF). This new design significantly expands the capabilities of the device, aiming in particular to refuel Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) in contested airspace.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Boeing MQ-25 Autonomous Aerial Refueling System (Picture source: Wikimedia) According to Boeing officials, this new land-based model of the MQ-25, named the MQ-25 Land-Based Variant (LBV), features a wingspan extended to 92 feet from the 75 feet of the Navy's Stingray version. This modification eliminates the need for folding wings, a requirement for the carrier-based version, and increases the fuel capacity in the wings by 40%. Although this project is developed internally at Boeing, it is designed in consultation with the Air Force. It aligns with the Air Force’s ongoing analysis of the Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System (NGAS), whose conclusions are expected this fall. This analysis anticipates an integrated approach involving multiple systems, including a smaller autonomous tanker for operations in high-risk areas. John Scudi, interim director of the MQ-25 advanced capabilities program and senior manager of business development at Boeing, emphasized that the land-based adaptation of the MQ-25 could also serve intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, airborne early warning, and electronic warfare missions. The LBV was presented at the conference with an image showing the device receiving fuel from a KC-46’s wing refueling pods. Notably, the LBV uses a hose-and-drogue system instead of a refueling boom, initially focusing on aircraft equipped with a receiver probe. Scudi also mentioned that the use of the LBV could be extended to refuel CCAs, anticipating possible adaptations to meet the more complex needs of future CCA increments. Additionally, the LBV could be used to refuel U.S. Navy fighters already equipped with receiving receptacles. The innovative design of the LBV seeks to maximize the investment already made by the U.S. Navy in the MQ-25 program, with the main change being the widened wings. After thousands of hours of modeling and simulation, Boeing settled on the 92-foot wingspan, which not only increases fuel capacity but also adds two additional 3,000-pound pylons that could carry refueling equipment or other systems, including weapons. As a reminder, the MQ-25 Stingray, intended for the Navy, is an unmanned aerial refueling aircraft developed by Boeing for the U.S. Navy. Designed primarily to extend the combat range of carrier-based aircraft such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet and the F-35C Lightning II, the MQ-25 increases operational flexibility and endurance. It represents the first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft in U.S. naval aviation, marking a significant advancement. The aircraft is equipped with sophisticated avionics and an aerial refueling system capable of delivering approximately 15,000 pounds of fuel 500 nautical miles from the carrier, fundamentally transforming the role and capability of carrier air wings. Currently, six MQ-25s are under production at Boeing's facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Of these, one is intended for static tests while the other five are development, engineering, and manufacturing (EMD) models. These EMD models are essential as they serve as aerial test vehicles, laying the groundwork for the eventual Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP). The first flight of an MQ-25 EMD is scheduled for December 2025. Additionally, Boeing plans to relocate MQ-25 production to MidAmerica St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, by the end of 2025. This move is part of a broader strategy to transition the MQ-25 program from development to full-scale production. In a significant development effort, Boeing's team is also focusing on internally funded software improvements. This new software would enable a USN F/A-18 Super Hornet or E-2D Hawkeye to remotely control MQ-25s. The main function of this capability is to allow aircraft requiring refueling to directly command the Stingray in its flight path and refueling operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/boeing-develops-new-land-based-version-of-mq-25-autonomous-aerial-refueling-system-for-us-air-force	2024-09-19T01:25:32-07:00	
German-Norwegian Type 212CD submarine program reaches major design milestone	According to a PR published by TKMS on September 18 , 2024, the design phase for the Type 212CD submarines, a collaboration between Germany and Norway, has been successfully completed. thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), responsible for the development, announced the conclusion of the 'Critical Design Review' (CDR).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future Type 212CD submarine. (Picture source: TKMS) The CDR involved an extensive review of over 100,000 pages of documentation over three years in cooperation with the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency and the German procurement authority BAAINBw. With the design phase complete, production is set to accelerate, and initial tests are expected by 2027. Delivery of the first submarine to the Norwegian Navy is scheduled for 2029. Both Germany and Norway are reportedly considering increasing the number of submarines beyond the initial six. TKMS expressed readiness to meet this potential demand, with political decisions expected in the coming months. About the program The Type 212CD submarine is an advanced diesel-electric class developed jointly by Germany and Norway to modernize their naval capabilities. A key feature of the Type 212CD is its increased size and enhanced stealth capabilities compared to its predecessor, the Type 212A. The new design boasts a 65% increase in surface displacement, now reaching around 2,500 tons, and a length extended to 73 meters. These submarines are optimized for reduced sonar detection, using faceted hull designs and advanced anechoic coatings to minimize acoustic and active sonar signatures, making them more difficult to detect. This stealth shaping is a major advancement in submarine design, drawing on principles similar to stealth aircraft technology. Another major improvement is the integration of an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using hydrogen fuel cells, which allows for extended submerged operations without surfacing. The Type 212CD may also include vertical launch systems for the Norwegian submarines, capable of deploying advanced missiles like the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), although this remains speculative. Norway-Germany relations The partnership is strongly anchored in NATO's framework, with Norwegian and German troops regularly participating in NATO-led operations, particularly in Eastern Europe. Both countries contribute to NATO's presence in Lithuania, where Germany leads a battle group that includes Norwegian forces. This cooperation has been instrumental in securing NATO’s eastern flank. Energy security has also emerged as a crucial area of military focus, particularly after the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Norway has increased its defense posture around critical subsea infrastructure, with German support, underscoring the connection between national security and energy stability in the region. In addition to military projects, Norway and Germany collaborate within EU defense initiatives, despite Norway not being an EU member.
