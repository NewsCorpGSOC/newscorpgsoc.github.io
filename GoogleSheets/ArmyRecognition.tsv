This deployment takes place during Pacific Stellar 2025, a major naval exercise running until February 18 in the Philippine Sea, where Kaga is operating alongside the U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (VINCSG) and the French Carrier Strike Group (CSG). The event marks a turning point for Japan’s naval capabilities, demonstrating its growing ability to project air power at sea and operate in joint carrier operations with key allies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link JS Kaga (DDH-184) of the Japanese Navy sails at the center of a multinational carrier formation alongside the U.S. Navy's USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) and the French Navy's FS Charles de Gaulle (R91) during the Pacific Stellar 2025 naval exercise in the Philippine Sea, showcasing Japan's new carrier capabilities. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) Initially commissioned in 2017 as a helicopter-carrying destroyer, JS Kaga of the JMSDF (Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force- Japanese Navy) has undergone extensive modifications to support fixed-wing short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, primarily the F-35B Lightning II. These modifications include reinforcing the flight deck to withstand the extreme heat and pressure of vertical landings, improving deck markings to accommodate STOVL aircraft operations, upgrading the hangar and ammunition storage to fit modern fighter jets, and integrating advanced aviation control systems for seamless air operations. These changes have transformed Kaga from a helicopter carrier into a fully functional light aircraft carrier, significantly enhancing JMSDF's force projection capabilities. A key moment in this transformation occurred on October 20, 2024, when, according to information published by the U.S. Department of Defense, an F-35B Lightning II fighter jet from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) successfully landed on JS Kaga’s deck off the coast of southern California. This marked the first time an F-35B operated from a Japanese vessel, validating the modifications made to the ship. The sea trials confirmed Kaga’s ability to operate the F-35B and paved the way for its integration into Japan’s naval doctrine. JS Kaga can now carry up to 12 F-35B fighter jets, significantly enhancing Japan’s air combat capabilities at sea. Japan has committed to acquiring 42 F-35B aircraft, with an initial purchase of eight aircraft in 2019 as part of a broader plan to modernize its defense forces. The F-35B is the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II, designed for operations from amphibious assault ships and light aircraft carriers. It features stealth capabilities, advanced avionics, and the ability to conduct strike missions, electronic warfare, and intelligence gathering. As part of the Pacific Stellar 2025 naval exercise—running until February 18—JS Kaga is operating alongside the U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group (VINCSG) and the French Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in a multi-national carrier task force. This exercise underscores Japan’s increasing role in regional security and power projection in the Indo-Pacific, especially amidst rising geopolitical tensions. The U.S. Navy Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group includes the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Princeton (CG 59), and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Sterett (DDG 104) and USS William P. Lawrence (DDG 110). The French Carrier Strike Group is led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier FS Charles De Gaulle (R 91), escorted by air-defense destroyers and multi-mission frigates. The JMSDF contingent includes JS Kaga and the Akizuki-class destroyer JS Akizuki (DD 115). Logistics support is provided by the Henry J. Kaiser-class fleet replenishment oiler USNS Tippecanoe (T-AO 199) and the Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo and ammunition ship USNS Charles Drew (T-AKE 10). JS Kaga’s first operational mission as a light aircraft carrier signals a major shift in Japan’s defense posture. Previously, Japan maintained a self-imposed restriction on operating 'offensive' military assets in line with its post-World War II pacifist constitution. However, growing regional threats, including China’s expanding naval influence and North Korea’s missile advancements, have prompted Japan to reinterpret its defense strategy. The integration of JS Kaga with the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group enhances interoperability between JMSDF and U.S. Navy carrier operations, improving Japan’s ability to respond to regional threats. By fielding F-35B-capable carriers, Japan extends its power projection beyond its home islands, reinforcing regional stability in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, Japan’s participation alongside the French Carrier Strike Group highlights its growing role in international maritime security and its deepening defense partnerships with NATO allies. The successful deployment of JS Kaga as a light aircraft carrier in Pacific Stellar 2025 marks a transformational moment for JMSDF and Japan’s broader security policy. This development strengthens Japan’s deterrence posture, improves interoperability with allied naval forces, and enhances regional maritime security in the face of emerging challenges. As JS Kaga continues its carrier-based operations, its role in future multinational exercises and real-world contingencies will be closely watched by both allies and adversaries.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-navys-js-kaga-conducts-first-operational-mission-as-light-aircraft-carrier-in-philippine-sea	2025-02-16T02:51:01-08:00

Its ability to operate with minimal emissions makes it less detectable by enemy forces, ensuring survivability on the battlefield. The Gravehawk Air Defense System is optimized for engaging low and medium-altitude threats in short-range engagements. Its primary function is to provide local air defense coverage, protecting military units, infrastructure, and urban centers from enemy missiles, drones, and aircraft. It specializes in short-range engagements, primarily targeting drones, cruise missiles, and helicopters at ranges of up to 30 km. Utilizing R-73 missiles, which are capable of reaching speeds of Mach 2.5, the system ensures fast interception of threats. Guided by passive infrared homing, it operates stealthily, unlike radar-based systems, which emit signals that can be detected and jammed by enemy forces. Its high mobility, thanks to the 8x8 military truck, allows for rapid repositioning based on evolving battlefield threats, while the ability to launch missiles remotely ensures that the operating crew remains at a safe distance from enemy fire. The Gravehawk system is housed within a standard ISO-sized shipping container, making it easy to transport and deploy. The launcher contains two R-73 missiles, stored and fired from inside the container, with integrated power systems providing electrical support for targeting and tracking operations. For mobility, the container is mounted on an 8x8 heavy military truck chassis, commonly referred to as a Drops vehicle. This configuration enables the system to traverse rough terrain, relocate quickly, and reposition as needed. Inside the Gravehawk Air Defense System's container are two R-73 (AA-11 Archer) missiles, originally designed as Soviet air-to-air weapons for fighter jets like the MiG-29. Now repurposed for ground-based defense, these missiles are operated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. (Picture source: UK MoD) A high-resolution electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera is mounted on top of the container, which allows for real-time tracking of incoming threats. The system automatically detects and locks onto enemy drones or missiles, then relays precise targeting data to the missile guidance system. This passive tracking capability ensures that the system remains undetectable by enemy radar detection methods. The Gravehawk system repurposes R-73 air-to-air missiles, originally designed by the Soviet Union in the 1980s and given the NATO reporting name AA-11 Archer, for ground-based launch operations. The Vympel R-73 is a short-range air-to-air missile developed by the Russian company Vympel NPO, which entered service in 1984. It was designed to equip Soviet fighter jets, replacing older infrared-guided missiles such as the R-60 (AA-8 Aphid). The missile became the primary close-combat missile for Soviet and later Russian fighter aircraft, including the MiG-29, Su-27, and their derivatives. The missile features high agility and an advanced infrared seeker, making it capable of 'off-boresight' targeting, where it can lock onto targets even outside the aircraft’s direct line of sight. The missile measures 2.93 meters in length, with a diameter of 165 mm and a wingspan of 510 mm. It weighs 105 kg and carries a 7.4 kg high-explosive fragmentation warhead, guided by passive infrared homing. Its range extends up to 30 km, making it suitable for intercepting short-range threats at high speeds. The missile can reach Mach 2.5, enabling it to engage and destroy fast-moving enemy targets. The Gravehawk Mobile Air Defense System's targeting and tracking system features a high-resolution camera mounted on top of the container. It detects and identifies threats, then relays precise targeting data to the missile for engagement. (Picture source UK MoD) The Gravehawk system is operated remotely, with a five-person crew controlling the system from a portable unit located up to 50 meters away. This remote operation enhances survivability, allowing personnel to launch interceptors while remaining in a secure location. The deployment of the Gravehawk system significantly enhances Ukraine’s air defense network. While not a replacement for high-end SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) systems like NASAMS or Patriot, it serves as an effective complementary layer in Ukraine’s multi-tiered air defense strategy, focusing on short-range interceptions against drones and cruise missiles. Its ability to reuse existing missile stockpiles reduces costs and ensures an efficient use of Ukraine’s military resources. By repurposing air-to-air missiles for ground-based launches, the Gravehawk system offers a cost-effective solution that does not require developing new interceptors. Unlike Western high-tech systems, which rely on expensive and complex missile platforms, Gravehawk can use Ukraine’s stockpiles of Soviet-era R-73 missiles, allowing for sustained operations without the need for continuous resupply. The containerized nature of the system allows rapid deployment, camouflage, and easy relocation after engagements, making it highly survivable and adaptable. Unlike traditional radar-guided SAM batteries, Gravehawk does not emit active radar signals, making it harder to detect and destroy by enemy electronic warfare systems. Russia has intensified its use of Shahed-136 drones and cruise missiles to target Ukraine’s infrastructure and military positions. The Gravehawk system provides a cost-effective and efficient solution to counter these threats, significantly reducing damage to cities, power plants, and military assets. Its rapid mobility and ability to neutralize incoming threats at short notice make it a crucial addition to Ukraine’s defense strategy. The Gravehawk Mobile Air Defense System represents a crucial advancement in Ukraine’s air defense capabilities, offering mobility, stealth, and cost-effectiveness. By adapting R-73 (AA-11 Archer) air-to-air missiles into a ground-based system, Ukraine is able to maximize its existing missile stockpiles while strengthening its defense against enemy drone and missile attacks.

Greece's new Sarisa II rocket-armed drone confirms combat readiness after three days of live-fire testing	The Greek company SAS Technology completed a three-day live-fire testing campaign for its Sarisa II (also known as SRS-2A) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) at the Litochoro Firing Range from February 10 to 12, 2025. The tests were part of the certification process for the SRS-2A, confirming its capability to deploy both unguided and laser-guided 70mm (2.75-inch) rockets from Thales Belgium. The trials were conducted under the supervision of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense, in collaboration with Thales Belgium and Hellenic Defense Systems (HDS), whose technical support contributed to the program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The tests, which spread out over three days, were part of the certification process for the SRS-2A, confirming its capability to deploy both unguided and laser-guided 70mm (2.75-inch) rockets from Thales Belgium. (Picture source: SAS) On February 10, testing focused on the SRS-2A’s ability to launch unguided rockets while maintaining flight stability. The unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) fired a 70mm unguided rocket (UGR) while hovering, demonstrating control under the effects of rocket jet blast. The rocket followed a predictable trajectory, confirming the functionality of optical sighting methods. On February 11, the Sarisa II/SRS-2A was tested with the FZ275 laser-guided rocket (LGR) from Thales. The UCAV launched the rocket at a 5×5-meter target with a central 2×2-meter section. The impact was recorded with a deviation of 0.2 meters, confirming a circular error probable (CEP) of less than one meter. Due to range constraints and Weapon Danger Area (WDA) limitations, the test was conducted at 1,700 meters, close to the weapon’s minimum operational range. The FZ275 LGR is designed for engagement distances between 3 and 5 kilometers, with a maximum reach of 7 kilometers. The test conditions required launching the rocket at close range, where it reached supersonic speeds and deployed its guidance fins after 400 meters. The SRS-2A’s autonomous flight control system executed the firing sequence without manual operator input. On February 12, a live demonstration was held in the presence of military officials and personnel from the Hellenic Army, Navy, Air Force, and Special Forces, as well as international delegations. The SRS-2A launched a laser-guided FZ275 LGR rocket from an altitude of 450 meters above sea level, maintaining stability and achieving a CEP of less than one meter. Additionally, the Hellenic Special Forces' UCAV Empusa EMPX6T performed precision grenade drops using both training and live grenades in sequential and simultaneous release modes. The planned release of the AIHMI loitering munition from the SRS-2A was canceled due to low cloud cover. The FZ275 LGR, developed by Thales Belgium, is a semi-active laser (SAL) guided rocket designed to bridge the gap between unguided rockets and long-range missiles. It offers targeting precision while reducing collateral damage. The rocket has a range of 1,500 to 7,000 meters, with a CEP of less than one meter at 6 kilometers. It can engage ground vehicles, air defense installations, radar sites, communication infrastructure, aircraft on the ground, small ships and patrol boats, soft bunkers, and snipers. The FZ275 LGR is compatible with standard 2.75-inch rocket launchers and requires minimal integration work. It has various warhead configurations, including a high-explosive variant with a lethal radius of 9 meters and penetration capability against 6mm steel plates. The FZ275 LGR features semi-active laser guidance technology with Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) and Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capabilities. It can receive laser targeting data from sources such as ground-based designators, airborne platforms, and remote operators. The rocket can be fired from any standard FZ rocket launcher, and Thales Belgium has developed smart rocket launchers, including the FZ606 for helicopters and the FZ800 for aircraft, which enable bidirectional communication and in-flight laser code implementation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/greeces-new-sarisa-ii-rocket-armed-drone-confirms-combat-readiness-after-three-days-of-live-fire-testing	2025-02-15T23:06:30-08:00	
US Army starts to test the M10 Booker fire support vehicle for future deployment in the Arctic	As reported by Peter George, the Booker Combat Vehicle Product Manager, on February 15, 2025, the U.S. Army is conducting extreme cold weather testing on the M10 Booker combat vehicle at Fort Greely, Alaska. This testing could be seen as part of the US Department of Defense’s Arctic Strategy to assess operational effectiveness in sub-zero conditions. The results will inform decisions on full-rate production and deployment, ensuring the vehicle's performance in harsh environments where temperatures can drop below -50°C.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The M10 Booker is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE23 diesel engine producing 800 horsepower, marking the first use of an English MTU serial production engine in a U.S. Army land system in over four decades. (Picture source: Peter George) The U.S. Army is expanding Arctic operations to improve readiness in extreme environments. As part of this effort, training exercises such as Arctic Forge 25 are increasing, with additional forces deployed to key locations. Arctic Forge 25 will involve 330 U.S. Soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division and the 10th Mountain Division, 40 Canadian troops, and 500 Finnish personnel. Additionally, 110 Soldiers from the 41st Field Artillery Brigade will deploy to Norway to test long-range precision fires in Arctic conditions. The U.S. Army's efforts align with the broader goal of ensuring force interoperability and operational effectiveness in joint military exercises with NATO partners. The Arctic region is strategically significant due to geopolitical competition and environmental changes. Russia has expanded its military presence by reopening Soviet-era bases, while China has declared itself a 'near-Arctic state' and increased activities in the region. Melting ice is opening new maritime routes, increasing the necessity for military presence. The region’s extreme temperatures, low precipitation, and widespread permafrost create operational challenges requiring specialized equipment and training. The U.S. military's emphasis on Arctic operations also supports homeland defense by reinforcing early warning systems and rapid response capabilities against potential threats in the northern hemisphere. The M10 Booker provides direct fire support for Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs) against fortified positions and light armored threats. Despite a weight of 38 to 42 tonnes, it is classified by the US Army as an armored infantry support vehicle or an assault gun, not as a light tank, because it lacks the armor and firepower necessary for direct engagement with enemy main battle tanks. However, the M10 Booker is not designed to be airdropped due to its weight and structural configuration, requiring transport by aircraft such as the C-17 Globemaster III. The Army plans to field 14 M10 Bookers per IBCT, with the 82nd Airborne Division receiving the first units by late FY2025. The vehicle's integration into IBCTs aims to improve combined arms maneuver capabilities, allowing infantry units to operate with increased lethality and survivability. The U.S. Army has lacked a modern, lightweight, heavily armed vehicle since the retirement of the M551 Sheridan in 1997. Attempts to address this gap, such as the Stryker Mobile Gun System, faced technical challenges and were eventually phased out. The M10 Booker was selected in June 2022 under the Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) program. The first production units were delivered in February 2024, with plans to acquire up to 504 units under a contract valued at up to $1.14 billion, and to date, each M10 Booker is estimated to cost approximately $13.95 million. The Army envisions the M10 Booker and its crew of four as a key component in its shift from brigade-centric to division-centric operations, where armored firepower will play a more significant role in large-scale combat operations. The M10 Booker is powered by an MTU 8V199 TE23 diesel engine producing 800 horsepower. This marks the first use of an MTU serial production engine in a U.S. Army land system in over four decades. The engine is integrated into the PowerPack system, which includes transmission, cooling, and filtration components, supporting performance in diverse terrains, including Arctic conditions. Rolls-Royce's efforts to enhance the power output of this engine align with broader modernization initiatives to improve the performance of tracked combat vehicles within the Army's fleet. The M10 Booker is equipped with a 105mm M35 tank gun, a 12.7mm M2HB heavy machine gun, and a 7.62mm M240B machine gun. Compared to the M2 Bradley, the M10 Booker is optimized for infantry support thanks to a greater direct-fire capability, but the Bradley is better suited for mechanized infantry operations due to its troop-carrying capacity and missile armament. The Booker has a maximum speed of 64 km/h, an operational range of up to 560 km, and modular armor for protection. The vehicle features an advanced fire control system derived from the M1A2 Abrams for targeting accuracy. It also incorporates a hydropneumatic suspension system and advanced optics, including Safran Optics 1's PASEO Commander's Independent Tactical Viewer (CITV), to enhance situational awareness and targeting in varied combat environments. Additionally, the M10 Booker’s design leverages lessons learned from past vehicle development programs, ensuring it meets current operational requirements while maintaining future upgrade potential.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-starts-to-test-the-m10-booker-fire-support-vehicle-for-future-deployment-in-the-arctic	2025-02-15T07:36:59-08:00	
US Army confirms Precision Strike Missile's capability to engage enemy ballistic missiles	On February 12, 2025, the U.S. Army conducted a flight test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, involving two Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) Increment 1 engagements. Fired from an M142 HIMARS, both missiles followed their intended trajectories and engaged multiple targets, including a surrogate Scud ballistic missile, radar installations, and rotary-wing platforms. Lockheed Martin stated that this was a step toward full-rate production, following previous test flights in November and the first soldier-led test in December 2024.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Measuring approximately 4 meters in length and 430 millimeters in diameter, the PrSM's design enables two missiles per launch pod, doubling the payload of M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS. (Picture source: US Army) Initially developed under the Long Range Precision Fires (LRPF) program, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is the U.S. Army's next-generation, surface-to-surface missile, replacing the older MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). Measuring approximately 4 meters in length and 430 millimeters in diameter, the PrSM's design enables two missiles per launch pod, doubling the payload of M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and M142 HIMARS launchers when compared to the single-missile ATACMS pods. Featuring a solid-propellant rocket motor, this new short-range ballistic missile employs an inertial navigation system (INS) with GPS guidance. Its pre-formed tungsten fragmentation warhead is suited for a variety of high-value targets, including air defense systems, missile launchers, command and control centers, and troop assembly areas. Additionally, the PrSM features an open-systems architecture, allowing for modular upgrades and future modifications. Development of the PrSM began in March 2016, with Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon competing for the contract. By early 2020, Boeing and Raytheon had withdrawn from the competition, leaving Lockheed Martin as the sole developer. The US Army received the first batch of PrSM missiles on December 8, 2023. Subsequent tests in June 2024 included the sinking of the decommissioned Austin-class amphibious transport dock USS Cleveland in the North Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Island Range Complex, marking the first recorded use of the PrSM against a moving target. Moreover, a recently awarded contract, valued at up to $120 million, will support tooling efforts to increase production capacity to 400 missiles per year. The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) was originally constrained by the 500 km range limitation imposed by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. However, the U.S. withdrawal from the treaty in 2019 enabled the development of extended-range variants. The PrSM Increment 1, for instance, has an official range exceeding 500 km, while future increments are expected to enhance target acquisition and engagement with a new multi-mode seeker. This technology, expected to be integrated into PrSM Increment 2, will enable the missile to track and strike moving targets on both land and sea. Increment 2, also referred to as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM), is being developed in collaboration with Australia, which signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Army in July 2021. Australia has committed to acquiring PrSM Increments 3 and 4, expanding its long-range strike capabilities. Increment 3 is expected to introduce enhanced warhead configurations for increased effectiveness against hardened targets, while Increment 4 will focus on propulsion and aerodynamic refinements to extend the missile’s range beyond 1,000 km, doubling the range of existing systems. Additionally, the US Army is considering a fifth iteration of the PrSM that could be compatible with autonomous launch platforms such as the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML), an unmanned variant of the M142 HIMARS. Brigadier General Rory Crooks, leading the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team, has stated that this effort remains in the science and technology phase, exploring potential designs for integration with unmanned ground vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-confirms-precision-strike-missiles-capability-to-engage-enemy-ballistic-missiles	2025-02-15T05:41:09-08:00

This allows it to perform underwater missions with high efficiency. The endurance of the HMS Halland is also remarkable, allowing it to remain submerged for more than 14 days without needing to surface to refresh the air. Its maximum diving depth is 300 meters, giving it the capability to operate in difficult-to-reach and monitor underwater areas. Regarding its armament, the submarine is equipped with four 533 mm torpedo tubes and two 400 mm tubes, allowing it to carry 12 torpedoes and six additional torpedoes. Additionally, it can deploy up to 48 external mines, further increasing its ability to interfere with enemy maritime navigation. These technical characteristics give the HMS Halland a unique ability to operate discreetly in the complex waters of the Baltic Sea, where its low acoustic signature and endurance are major assets. Thanks to these upgrades and its cutting-edge technologies, the submarine plays a vital strategic role in defending critical underwater infrastructure and sea lanes, thereby contributing to Sweden's national security and enhancing NATO's capabilities in the region. Submarines like the HMS Halland play a key role in modern defense, providing strategic flexibility across a wide range of conflict scenarios, from peacekeeping operations to total war. The submarine's ability to operate covertly with great endurance makes it a valuable asset in the complex and challenging environment of the Baltic Sea, where its secret operations are particularly difficult to detect. During the upgrade, more than twenty key systems aboard the HMS Halland were replaced, including sensors and command systems. These new systems are identical to those that will be used on the future Blekinge-class submarines, ensuring that the Swedish Navy continues to operate cutting-edge technology in its submarine fleet. With this modernization, the HMS Halland significantly strengthens Sweden's naval capabilities and supports its strategic position in the Baltic Sea region, while also providing enhanced defense capabilities for NATO.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/saab-strengthens-swedens-submarine-fleet-with-unveiling-of-upgraded-hms-halland	2025-02-14T05:28:47-08:00	
Could the future Leclerc Evolution tank succeed without financial support from France?	As reported by Opex360 on February 13, 2025, KNDS France is requesting support from the French Ministry of the Armed Forces for the development and potential export of the Leclerc Evolution main battle tank. This request follows Germany’s initiation of studies for the Leopard 3, an interim solution before the introduction of the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS). KNDS France presented the Leclerc Evolution at Eurosatory 2024, highlighting its modular turret and armament configurations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Leclerc Evolution is armed with the Ascalon system, initially configured with a 120mm gun but designed for retrofitting with a 140mm caliber. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program, initiated in 2017, is a Franco-German project designed to replace the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks by 2040 with an integrated network of crewed and uncrewed platforms. The program is developed by KNDS, a consortium of France’s Nexter and Germany’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, and focuses on modularity, firepower, protection, and AI-assisted battlefield management. Disagreements remain on key technical aspects, particularly regarding the main armament, with France supporting the Ascalon gun, available in 120mm and 140mm calibers, and Germany favoring a 130mm alternative from Rheinmetall. Belgium, along with Italy and Spain, has shown interest in joining the program. Germany is financing the Leopard 3 as an interim solution while awaiting the MGCS, with the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology, and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) assigning research tasks to KNDS Deutschland, Rheinmetall, and Hensoldt. The Leopard 3 is expected to be introduced within five years, allowing Germany to maintain its main battle tank fleet. In contrast, France has not adopted a similar strategy and will continue operating 200 Leclerc XLR tanks with limited modernization until the more modern MGCS is introduced. However, as the Leopard 3 is expected to fire 130mm ammunition, some people think that it could influence future MGCS armament decisions. During a hearing at the French National Assembly on February 12, Alexandre Dupuy, Director of Systems at KNDS France, stated that the Leopard 3 does not conflict with MGCS, as MGCS is designed as a 'system of systems' integrating multiple platforms. He described the Leopard 3 as another standard within the Leopard series rather than a new platform. Dupuy estimated that MGCS deliveries will take place over an extended period and that the full fleet will not be immediately available, meaning that new tank acquisitions by European countries today do not preclude their participation in MGCS through the 2050s. He also stated that continued investment in French armored vehicle technology is necessary. Additionally, in this same hearing, he also announced that Belgium has received its first Griffon armored vehicle under the CaMo (Capacité Motorisée) program, as well as the Irish interest in armored vehicles from the Scorpion program. Therefore, KNDS France is seeking collaboration with the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) to advance the Leclerc Evolution, which was presented at Eurosatory 2024 as a next-generation main battle tank. The company is positioning the tank for potential export, citing restrictions in certain regions on German-manufactured defense equipment as a possible market opportunity. However, Dupuy noted that securing an order from the French Army would be critical to establishing the Leclerc Evolution in the international market. He added that financial backing is necessary to complete the tank’s development. The Leclerc Evolution is armed with the Ascalon system, initially configured with a 120mm gun but designed for retrofitting with a 140mm caliber. The modular turret can switch calibers in under an hour. The Ascalon system includes an autoloader with a 22-round capacity and a recoil management system to support stability. The gun is designed for extended barrel lifespan and reduced maintenance requirements. KNDS France has tested the Ascalon system in 120mm and 140mm configurations, with further evaluations planned in a fully integrated turret. The Leclerc Evolution is configured for a four-person crew, with a deputy commander in the chassis responsible for managing sensor and effector systems. It is equipped with the ARX 30 remote-controlled weapon station for counter-UAV operations and a loitering ammunition launcher with three intermediate-range munitions. The tank’s survivability is supported by a modular armor system, the Galix close protection system, an Active Protection System (APS), and a CBRN filtration system. The vehicle is powered by a 1,500 hp engine, reaching speeds of up to 68 km/h with an operational range of 470 kilometers.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/could-the-future-leclerc-evolution-tank-succeed-without-financial-support-from-france	2025-02-14T03:46:42-08:00	
French Army Shows Growing Interest in Locally Produced MALE Drone Aarok	The French Army is closely following the development of the Aarok MALE drone, designed by Turgis &amp; Gaillard, a project that attracted attention when it was unveiled at the 2023 edition of the Paris Air and Space Show at Le Bourget. Initially, this drone piqued the interest of the French Air and Space Force, particularly General Stéphane Mille, then Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, who expressed curiosity about its ability to transition from the design phase to the first flight tests. He even mentioned being willing to fund the trials if the resources were available. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since its unveiling, the Aarok has been the subject of a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov, aimed at developing a lighter and more 'consumable' version of the drone. (Picture source: Aarok) Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu also highlighted the 'very interesting' nature of the project. He mentioned the possibility of including the Aarok in the 2024-2030 military programming, specifying that the work done with Turgis &amp; Gaillard was of good quality and conducted in collaboration with the ministry's services. The Military Programming Law (LPM), which provides 5 billion euros for drone research, allowed Lecornu to indicate that this budget would enable the exploration of various concepts, including that of the Aarok drone. Since its unveiling, the Aarok has been the subject of a memorandum of understanding with the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov, aimed at developing a lighter and more 'consumable' version of the drone. It has also begun ground tests and was selected by the Directorate of Aeronautical Maintenance (DMAé) to test the concept of a 'certifiable but non-certified' drone, which aims to reduce the normative requirements for the certification of an aircraft. While the MALE drone segment primarily falls under the French Air and Space Force's responsibility, the French Army has not hidden its interest in this system, especially due to its features suited for surveillance and intervention missions. General Bruno Baratz, head of the Future Combat Command (CCF) of the French Army, expressed interest in the Aarok following a visit to Turgis &amp; Gaillard’s facilities. According to him, the Aarok could provide a 'simple, rugged, and affordable' means of surveillance and intervention, particularly suitable for the Army’s needs. Additionally, its 'decidedly multi-domain' design makes it a potential asset for land forces. General Baratz added that the French Army would closely monitor the development of this project, emphasizing the importance of a close collaboration between industry and the military, and highlighting the strength of the French defense industry in this field. The Aarok, which weighs 5.5 tons, is designed to have an endurance of over 24 hours, thanks to a 1,200-horsepower turboprop engine. It is equipped with a large optronic sensor, an electromagnetic payload, and a multimode radar. The drone can carry up to 1.5 tons of munitions and can be deployed on rough terrain, a feature of particular interest to the French Army. Additionally, its cost is estimated between 5 and 10 million euros, and it is designed without any American-origin components, making it 'ITAR Free' (free from U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations constraints). The possibility of the French Army purchasing the Aarok remains open. During debates on the 2025 finance bill, Minister Lecornu mentioned the possibility of using budget savings related to delays in the European MALE drone project, Eurodrone, to finance the acquisition of drones that could accelerate the 'droneification' of the French military. Therefore, although the acquisition of the Aarok drone has not yet been confirmed, it is not excluded that the French Army may consider acquiring it in the near future.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/french-army-shows-growing-interest-in-locally-produced-male-drone-aarok	2025-02-14T03:11:41-08:00	
Lithuanian Army Conscripts Boost Artillery Firepower with First PzH 2000 Howitzer Training	On February 11, 2025, the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense announced a significant milestone: conscripts of the Lithuanian Army conducted live-fire exercises with the PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers for the first time. This development marks a pivotal step in strengthening Lithuania's defense capabilities and preparing the next generation of artillery crews. The training of conscripts on these advanced artillery systems is part of a broader effort to modernize Lithuania’s armed forces, ensuring that the country remains prepared for any emerging threats in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lithuanian Army conscripts stand in front of a PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer during training exercises, marking their first live-fire drills with the advanced artillery system. (Picture source: Lithuania MoD) Lithuania's acquisition of the German-made PzH 2000 155mm tracked self-propelled howitzers dates back to September 2015, when the Ministry of National Defense signed a contract with the German Armed Forces to procure 21 of these advanced 155mm self-propelled howitzers. Of these, 16 were designated for combat purposes, two for training in firing and driving, and three were allocated for spare parts. The contract also included 26 M577 V2 armored command vehicles and six BPZ2 recovery tanks, all previously utilized by the German military. As part of Lithuania's artillery modernization efforts, the first upgraded PzH 2000 units were delivered to the General Romualdas Giedraitis Artillery Battalion in December 2018. These enhancements improved the fire control software, battlefield management systems, and increased the howitzers' overall efficiency. The PzH 2000 is renowned for its advanced artillery capabilities, boasting a firing range of up to 40 kilometers with standard ammunition, and even greater distances with specialized rounds. Its rapid-fire capability and precision make it a formidable asset on the modern battlefield. The system can fire multiple rounds in quick succession, enabling coordinated strikes on enemy positions, which is a key advantage in counter-artillery warfare. Lithuania's continued investment in these systems ensures that its military remains equipped with cutting-edge technology. Integrating the PzH 2000 howitzers into Lithuania's military arsenal significantly enhances the nation's artillery capabilities, which is particularly important given the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The war has underscored the critical role of advanced artillery systems in modern warfare, with artillery being central to Russia's military strategy. This has highlighted the need for Western forces, including NATO allies, to understand and counter such capabilities properly. Recognizing this, Lithuania has taken decisive steps to strengthen its firepower, particularly in long-range precision strikes. Beyond the PzH 2000, Lithuania has further expanded its artillery strength by joining the French CAESAR Mark II program. In December 2022, Lithuania signed a contract for 18 CAESAR NG self-propelled howitzers, with deliveries expected by 2027. These highly mobile systems will complement the PzH 2000 fleet, providing Lithuania with increased operational flexibility. The addition of the CAESAR NG demonstrates Lithuania’s long-term commitment to improving its indirect fire capabilities and modernizing its artillery forces. Lithuania's commitment to defense modernization extends beyond its artillery forces. In 2024, the country increased its defense budget to €2.3 billion, representing approximately 3.03% of its GDP, one of the highest defense expenditures among NATO allies. This financial commitment reflects the growing emphasis on military readiness, procurement of modern equipment, and strengthening Lithuania’s overall defense infrastructure. The funds are being allocated toward acquiring advanced weapon systems, enhancing troop training programs, and reinforcing Lithuania’s border security in response to heightened regional tensions. By equipping its forces with the PzH 2000 howitzers and ensuring that conscripts are proficient in its operation, Lithuania is bolstering its defense posture. This initiative not only strengthens national security but also contributes to the broader stability of the Baltic region, serving as a deterrent against potential aggressors. The training of new artillery crews with the PzH 2000 reinforces the preparedness of Lithuania’s armed forces, ensuring that they can effectively operate and maintain these systems in a conflict scenario. The recent live-fire exercises represent a culmination of years of strategic planning and investment in defense infrastructure. As regional tensions persist, Lithuania's commitment to enhancing its military capabilities underscores its dedication to national defense and its role within the NATO alliance. By strengthening its artillery, increasing its defense budget, and investing in long-term modernization programs, Lithuania continues to demonstrate its resolve to safeguard its sovereignty and contribute to the region's collective security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/lithuanian-army-conscripts-boost-artillery-firepower-with-pzh-2000-howitzer-training	2025-02-14T03:02:15-08:00	
Russian Navy to deploy more Admiral Gorshkov frigates as Severnaya Verf shipyard confirms new orders	As reported by La souris on February 13, 2025, Russian shipbuilder Severnaya Verf recently released its annual financial report, confirming plans to secure contracts for additional frigates. The report details the construction of four new Project 22350 frigates, known as the Admiral Gorshkov class, with hull numbers 929 to 932, along with the continuation of the Project 22350M program, referred to as Super Gorshkov.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Admiral Gorshkov was laid down in 2006 and commissioned in 2018 after delays caused by disruptions in the supply of propulsion systems, primarily due to the termination of deliveries from Ukraine. (Picture source: Russian social media) In recent years, Severnaya Verf has expanded its slipway capacity and modernized its assembly processes to accommodate larger hulls and increase production efficiency for both the Project 22350 and the larger Project 22350M frigates. These enhancements include constructing a new slipway to assemble multiple ships simultaneously and upgrading welding and outfitting facilities to accelerate completion times. The Project 22350, known as the Admiral Gorshkov-class, is a series of guided missile frigates developed by the Severnoye Design Bureau and constructed at Severnaya Verf. The program was initiated in the early 2000s as part of Russia’s naval modernization strategy. The lead ship, Admiral Gorshkov, was laid down in 2006 and commissioned in 2018 after delays caused by disruptions in the supply of propulsion systems, primarily due to the termination of deliveries from Ukraine's Zorya-Mashproekt following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. This led to the necessity of developing domestic alternatives, which resulted in prolonged testing and integration challenges. The program has continued with seven hulls currently under construction and four additional units planned, bringing the total number of planned ships in the class to 12. Compared to Soviet-era frigates, this class features a reduced radar cross-section due to a redesigned superstructure and composite materials, along with an integrated combat system that enhances target acquisition, tracking, and fire control across multiple domains. Currently, three ships (Admiral Gorshkov, Admiral Kasatonov, and Admiral Golovko) are in service, and the four newly announced frigates (hulls 929 to 932) may be named after notable Russian naval figures, following existing class naming conventions. Potential names include Admiral Vysotsky, Admiral Kuroyedov, Admiral Komoyedov, and Admiral Evtukhin. The frigates from the Admiral Gorshkov-class have a full displacement of 5,400 tons and a length of 135 meters. They are powered by a combined diesel and gas (CODAG) propulsion system with two M90FR gas turbines and two 10D49 diesel engines, producing a combined output of 65,400 shp. This allows a top speed of 29.5 knots and an operational endurance of 30 days. The frigates are fitted with the Poliment-Redut air defense system, featuring 32 vertical launch system (VLS) cells capable of deploying 9M96, 9M96M, 9M96D/9M96DM(M2), and 9M100 surface-to-air missiles. Their offensive systems include either 16 or 32 (depending on variant) 3S14 VLS cells for Kalibr, Oniks, Zircon, or Otvet anti-submarine missiles. Additional weaponry includes a 130mm A-192M naval gun, Paket-NK anti-submarine torpedo launchers, and the Otvet anti-submarine missile system. Electronic warfare and radar systems comprise the 5P-27 Furke-4 air search radar, the 5P-20K Poliment AESA radar, and the Zarya-M sonar system for submarine detection. The ships are also equipped with Prosvet-M and Filin electro-optical suppression devices. Finally, a Kamov Ka-27 helicopter supports anti-submarine warfare operations. Nicknamed 'Super Gorshkov', the Project 22350M frigate brings three key improvements over its predecessor: increased firepower, extended operational range, and enhanced survivability. (Picture source: Russian social media) Nicknamed 'Super Gorshkov', the Project 22350M frigate is an upgraded variant of the Admiral Gorshkov-class, bringing three key improvements over its predecessor: increased firepower, extended operational range, and enhanced survivability. The Severnoye Design Bureau completed the outline design in 2019, and a final proposal was submitted for approval in 2023. The updated design includes an increased displacement of approximately 7,600 tons and expanded weapons capacity. Production of the first unit is planned to begin in 2025 following the completion of a new slipway at Severnaya Verf. The Project 22350M frigates will feature an upgraded propulsion system, replacing the CODAG configuration with a more powerful combined gas turbine and gas turbine (COGAG) setup using four M90FR gas turbines to achieve higher sustained speeds. The ships will integrate the Sigma-22350M combat management system, improving real-time target processing and coordination of multi-domain operations. Their electronic warfare suite will include Prosvet-M and additional countermeasure systems to enhance survivability against advanced threats. Their air defense systems will be enhanced with 64 Poliment-Redut VLS cells, enabling them to deploy 9M96 and 40N6E missiles with ranges of up to 400 kilometers. The offensive missile capacity will also be increased, with up to 64 3S14 VLS cells for Kalibr, Oniks, or Zircon cruise missiles. The Project 22350M frigates will feature an upgraded sonar suite, including the Minotavr-M sonar system for improved submarine detection and tracking. The anti-submarine warfare capability will be enhanced with additional Paket-NK torpedo launchers and the integration of advanced Otvet anti-submarine missile systems, increasing effectiveness against underwater threats at greater ranges. With a range exceeding 7,000 nautical miles, the Project 22350M frigates will support extended operations without frequent resupply. The class will accommodate up to two Ka-27 helicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to improve reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, and targeting capabilities. The sensor suite will include an upgraded AESA radar, potentially the Poliment-Redut system with improved long-range target detection, along with advanced electronic warfare capabilities, further reinforcing Russia’s ability to conduct sustained blue-water operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/russian-navy-to-deploy-more-admiral-gorshkov-frigates-as-severnaya-verf-shipyard-confirms-new-orders	2025-02-14T02:05:30-08:00	
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth Prioritizes China’s Indo-Pacific Threat and America’s Response	During the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting held in Brussels on February 12, 2025, U.S. Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, delivered a stark assessment of global security dynamics, underlining the emerging and consequential threats facing the United States. As the world navigates the complexities of military conflicts, particularly in Europe, Hegseth highlighted that the U.S. must not lose sight of the growing challenge posed by China. His remarks underscored the centrality of the Indo-Pacific region, where China’s military rise has become an existential concern for the United States and its allies.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The guided-missile submarine USS Ohio has arrived at Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, for a routine port visit, marking the start of a one-year deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet. Homeported at Naval Base Kitsap, Bangor, Washington, USS Ohio operates under Commander Submarine Group 7, reinforcing U.S. naval presence and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Indo-Pacific has become a primary theater of military competition between the U.S. and China, with Beijing rapidly enhancing its military capabilities. China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea, coupled with its modernization of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), pose direct challenges to regional stability. The Chinese military has become increasingly adept in the domains of anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD), cyber warfare, and space operations, all of which are crucial to Beijing’s strategy of preventing U.S. intervention in the region. China’s growing naval power, particularly its fleet of advanced warships and submarines, is seen as a direct counter to U.S. military supremacy in the Pacific. The recent commissioning of aircraft carriers such as the Shandong and Fujian signifies China's intent to establish a more robust and capable naval force capable of contesting U.S. forces in critical waters like the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Moreover, China’s missile forces, including advanced hypersonic weapons and long-range precision-guided missiles, are designed to hold U.S. assets at risk, complicating efforts to project power in the region. China’s anti-ship missile systems, such as the DF-21D and DF-26, are specifically tailored to target U.S. aircraft carriers and other large surface vessels, which remain cornerstone platforms for American naval power projection. These capabilities are complemented by China’s cyberwarfare and information operations designed to disrupt communications, targeting, and command-and-control functions, further eroding the U.S. military’s technological advantages. Secretary Hegseth’s remarks signal that the U.S. is pivoting towards a more focused strategy in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing deterrence to prevent conflict with China while maintaining a credible military presence in the region. The concept of strategic deterrence has evolved as the U.S. recognizes the need for a balance between preventing Chinese aggression and avoiding direct military confrontation. As of 2025, the U.S. military maintains a robust and forward-deployed presence in the Indo-Pacific, managed by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) headquartered in Hawaii. The U.S. has positioned over 300,000 military personnel across key locations to ensure deterrence and rapid response capabilities. In Japan, around 54,000 U.S. troops are stationed, including the 7th Fleet at Yokosuka Naval Base, Marine units in Okinawa, and air assets at Kadena Air Base. South Korea hosts approximately 28,500 U.S. troops, primarily at Camp Humphreys, which remains the largest U.S. overseas military base, ensuring regional security while countering Chinese influence. Guam continues to serve as a strategic hub, with Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam playing critical roles in power projection and bomber deployments. In response to China's growing assertiveness, the U.S. has strengthened its military cooperation with the Philippines under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), granting access to additional bases and bolstering joint military exercises. In Australia, the rotational presence of U.S. Marines in Darwin has expanded, with joint exercises becoming more frequent under the AUKUS security pact. Additionally, the U.S., Australia, and Japan have announced annual joint military exercises aimed at countering regional threats and reinforcing deterrence. Recent developments have further reinforced the U.S. commitment to military preparedness in the region. In April 2024, the U.S. Army deployed the Typhon missile system to the Philippines as part of joint military exercises, enhancing long-range strike capabilities against potential adversaries in the South China Sea. The U.S. Air Force is also set to conduct the REFORPAC exercise in mid-2025, involving nearly 300 aircraft across 25 locations, enhancing readiness and interoperability among allied forces. Despite its clear prioritization of the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. military faces significant resourcing challenges. As Hegseth noted, the reality of resource scarcity means the U.S. must make strategic tradeoffs in its defense planning. This involves balancing commitments to ongoing military operations in Ukraine and Europe with the imperative of preparing for potential conflicts in the Pacific. The integration of advanced technologies such as autonomous systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing is becoming increasingly critical to countering China’s military advancements and maintaining a technological edge. The U.S. is increasingly turning to multi-domain operations, where forces are trained to operate across land, sea, air, cyber, and space to ensure a credible deterrence. One key area of focus is the development and deployment of long-range strike capabilities that could target Chinese missile sites and critical infrastructure if necessary, minimizing the need for direct military engagement while maintaining a strong deterrent posture. The B-21 Raider, the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation stealth bomber, is one such platform that will enhance U.S. deterrence by allowing for long-range, precision strikes deep within contested areas. Furthermore, the U.S. is emphasizing the integration of partner nations’ forces into deterrence and response plans. The presence of U.S. forces in countries such as the Philippines, Japan, and Australia serves as a tripwire against Chinese aggression, and the strengthening of regional security alliances will be pivotal in maintaining peace through strength. China’s military ambitions extend beyond simply securing regional supremacy in the Indo-Pacific. Beijing’s global aspirations, particularly its efforts to build a network of strategic partnerships through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its push for military bases in regions such as Africa and the South Pacific, reflect its desire for global influence. The United States views these ambitions with concern, as they could potentially extend China's reach and threaten U.S. interests worldwide. Tensions remain high over Taiwan, where China has consistently signaled its intent to reclaim the island, either through coercion or military action. The U.S. has long adhered to a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding Taiwan, maintaining a commitment to defend Taiwan while stopping short of promising direct military intervention. However, this balance is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as China's military modernization progresses, with Beijing developing the capability to launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. Such a development would not only destabilize the region but would also test the U.S. commitment to its Taiwan Relations Act. The United States' military strategy in the Indo-Pacific is focused on ensuring that China’s ambitions are contained and deterred. While the U.S. must balance multiple threats globally, Hegseth’s statements emphasize that the Indo-Pacific will remain the central focus of U.S. defense priorities in the coming years. Strengthening military alliances, modernizing defense capabilities, and investing in advanced technologies are key to maintaining a credible deterrent against China’s increasingly capable military forces. China's growing military might poses a direct threat to regional stability and global security, but the U.S. remains committed to securing peace in the Indo-Pacific by leveraging its technological, military, and diplomatic advantages. The next decade will be critical in determining whether the U.S. can effectively deter China’s ambitions while preventing a broader regional conflict.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-secretary-of-defense-pete-hegseth-prioritizes-chinas-indo-pacific-threat-and-americas-response	2025-02-14T01:58:13-08:00	
US proposes the F-35 fighter jet to India despite current restrictions on Türkiye	As reported by Reuters on February 14, 2025, the United States has announced plans to increase military sales to India, with newly re-elected President Donald Trump stating that the deal could eventually include F-35 fighter jets. Indian officials clarified that no formal procurement process has begun, and the U.S. offer is still under discussion. The announcement follows India’s ongoing efforts to expand its defense procurement from multiple sources while maintaining its long-standing relationship with Russia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The proposal is surprising given that Türkiye remains blocked from purchasing the US-made F-35 fighter jet due to its acquisition of Russia’s S-400 air defense system, which India has also procured. (Picture source: US Air Force) Following Trump’s statement, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that no acquisition process has been initiated. Misri emphasized that India follows a structured procurement process, requiring proposals from manufacturers and evaluations before any decision is made. Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35, confirmed that any sale would take place at a government-to-government level, with the Pentagon acting as an intermediary. Since 2008, India has purchased over $20 billion in U.S. defense equipment, including a recent acquisition of 31 MQ-9B SeaGuardian and SkyGuardian drones after negotiations lasting over six years. The U.S. Congressional Research Service estimates that India is projected to spend more than $200 billion on military modernization over the next decade. The proposal is surprising given that Türkiye remains blocked from purchasing the F-35 due to its acquisition of Russia’s S-400 air defense system, which India has also procured. Türkiye was removed from the F-35 program in 2019 after purchasing the S-400, as the U.S. raised concerns that the system could expose sensitive technological data on the aircraft’s stealth capabilities. Despite India also acquiring the S-400, the U.S. has not imposed similar restrictions on New Delhi, likely due to broader geopolitical considerations. Additionally, Russia has recently proposed manufacturing the Sukhoi Su-57 stealth fighter in India in the hope of reinforcing its longstanding defense ties with New Delhi. Under President Trump's renewed administration, the United States is focusing on recalibrating its relationship with India, which is viewed as a key strategic partner to counter China's military presence in the Indo-Pacific. Recent discussions between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have led to an agreement to initiate trade negotiations aimed at resolving tariff disputes and doubling bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. The U.S. has expressed concerns over India's high tariffs on American goods, with President Trump emphasizing the need for 'fairness and reciprocity' in trade practices. In response, India has shown willingness to reduce certain tariffs and increase imports of U.S. products, including oil, gas, and military equipment. Additionally, both nations are exploring avenues to strengthen defense cooperation and reinforce their commitment to the Quad alliance to counterbalance China's influence. Despite these collaborative efforts, challenges will likely persist, particularly regarding trade deficits, the Make-In-India defense program, and immigration policies, as the U.S. continues to advocate for balanced trade and the repatriation of undocumented Indian nationals. As of February 2025, the Indian Air Force (IAF) operates a fleet of combat aircraft from multiple origins, including France, India, Russia, and the former Soviet Union. The multirole fighter fleet includes 36 Dassault Rafales, 31 HAL Tejas Mk.1s, and 259 Sukhoi Su-30MKIs, with 12 additional Su-30MKIs on order. The IAF also fields 52 Mikoyan MiG-29s, including 12 MiG-29UPGs, and 47 Dassault Mirage 2000s. The SEPECAT Jaguar fleet consists of 115 aircraft, including variants used for training and maritime strike. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Bison fleet, currently at 40 units, is being phased out. To modernize its fleet, the IAF has ordered 73 HAL Tejas Mk.1A aircraft, with an additional 97 approved for future acquisition. The IAF’s combat aircraft strength stands at 31 squadrons, below the sanctioned 42 squadrons, reaching its lowest level since 1965 due to the retirement of older aircraft without immediate replacements. Therefore, it is not surprising that India has had previous discussions regarding the F-35. In 2010, Lockheed Martin provided a briefing on the aircraft to the Indian Navy. In 2018, reports indicated that the Indian Air Force had shown interest in procuring 126 F-35A variants and requested a classified briefing. However, the Indian Air Force Chief of Staff at the time denied any formal request had been made. Although discussions have taken place, India has not formally begun the process of acquiring the F-35, and its current focus remains on upgrading its domestic fighter fleet. The U.S. Congressional Research Service estimates that India is expected to spend over $200 billion in the next decade on military modernization, further shaping potential discussions around the F-35. Additionally, as reported by Army Recognition on January 6, 2025, the United States recently approved India's participation in the co-production of Stryker armored fighting vehicles, making it the first foreign country authorized to manufacture this armored vehicle. The agreement follows months of negotiations, with India considering the acquisition of 530 Stryker vehicles for ten mechanized infantry battalions. This initiative is part of the broader U.S.-India defense collaboration under the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which focuses on joint development, supply chain diversification, and regional security in the Indo-Pacific. The proposed rollout involves an initial off-the-shelf purchase through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales framework, followed by co-production in India and potential development of new variants, including the Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) system.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-proposes-the-f-35-fighter-jet-to-india-despite-current-restrictions-on-tuerkiye	2025-02-14T00:04:48-08:00	
US Air Force Begins Initial Operational Tests and Evaluations of MH-139A Grey Wolf Helicopter	The 550th Helicopter Squadron at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana has reached a crucial milestone in integrating the MH-139A Grey Wolf into the U.S. Air Force's nuclear security operations. The squadron's recent participation in the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) phase marks a significant achievement for both the aircraft and the operational requirements of the 341st Missile Squadron. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The IOT&amp;E phase, which began with test flights on January 28, 2025, is designed to rigorously assess the MH-139A's ability to operate effectively in real-world, high-stakes environments. (Picture source: US DoD) The IOT&amp;E phase, which began with test flights on January 28, 2025, is designed to rigorously assess the MH-139A's ability to operate effectively in real-world, high-stakes environments. This process is mandated by Congress to confirm the operational suitability of the aircraft and its ability to replace the aging UH-1N Huey helicopters. The ultimate goal of these tests is to ensure that the Grey Wolf can accomplish a wide range of missions, including those related to U.S. Air Force nuclear security, without any degradation in its capabilities. Three key flight tests were conducted during the week of January 27, 2025. One test focused on the MH-139A's ability to support a convoy, a critical mission to ensure safe transport and operations in potentially hostile environments. The aircraft's communication systems were tested, as well as its support capabilities in coordination with the convoy's ground operations. The other two tests were aimed at evaluating emergency response capabilities, particularly for launch facility recapture and recovery missions. These scenarios required the MH-139A to react quickly to a simulated threat, mimicking the rapid escalation of a nuclear security incident. The aircraft was assessed on its response times, its ability to get airborne quickly, and its capability to carry a full tactical response loadout, complete with its own weapons. The MH-139A's performance during these tests is being analyzed to determine whether it can seamlessly take over the UH-1N Huey’s nuclear security mission. This transition is crucial, as the Huey, which has served for decades in various missions, is reaching the end of its lifecycle. The IOT&amp;E phase ensures that the MH-139A meets the mission's performance requirements, including its ability to survive and perform effectively in demanding conditions. Once the IOT&amp;E phase is complete, the results will be compiled into a report that will be shared with the 550th Helicopter Squadron and the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). These results will serve as the basis for the formal transition of the nuclear security mission to the MH-139A, allowing the retirement of the UH-1N Huey from Malmstrom Air Force Base. This transition to the MH-139A Grey Wolf is a crucial step in modernizing the U.S. Air Force's nuclear security fleet. The enhanced capabilities of this aircraft are expected to significantly improve operational readiness, ensuring that the U.S. Air Force is equipped to protect its nuclear deterrence infrastructure for many years to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-air-force-begins-initial-operational-tests-and-evaluations-of-mh-139a-grey-wolf-helicopter	2025-02-14T00:01:47-08:00	
Analysis | Could China’s future Type 004 replace the USS Gerald R. Ford as the world’s most powerful aircraft carrier?	As reported by Rupprecht Deino on February 13, 2025, China is likely progressing with the development of its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the Type 004, as multiple reports and satellite imagery suggest early-stage construction activity at the Dalian shipyard. In early 2024, test sections of the C3 and C4 catapults were observed near the Dalian No. 2 Factory Dock, where the aircraft carrier Shandong was built. These structures are identical to the test section of the Hudong 076 catapult, first identified at the end of 2022. A J-15 mock-up was also reported at the site, reinforcing the possibility that these are the first verified Type 004 modules.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Type 004 nuclear aircraft carrier is expected to carry between 70 and 100 aircraft, including fixed-wing fighters, airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). (CG picture source: 大包CG/Weibo) More precisely, satellite imagery suggests a potential carrier module for the Type 004 has been seen at the Xianglujiao drydock in Dalian, a site used for maintaining the Liaoning and Shandong carriers. Some analysts identify the observed module as a port foredeck segment featuring grooves for catapults, noting that while the twin catapults on the starboard side are parallel, these grooves are crossed. Others suggest it is a test module rather than an indication of full-scale construction. Imagery from May 2024 has led to assessments that work on the Type 004 is progressing, though the exact stage remains uncertain. China’s Type 004 is projected to be the country’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and potentially the heaviest warship ever made. The vessel is estimated to have a displacement between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes, making it the world's largest aircraft carrier and the largest warship ever constructed, surpassing the USS Gerald R. Ford, which has a full-load displacement of approximately 100,000 tonnes. The Type 004, estimated at 330+ meters in length and 83 meters in width, would be similar in length but slightly wider than the USS Gerald R. Ford, which measures 333 meters in length and 78 meters in width. The Type 004 is also expected to utilize nuclear marine propulsion, developed under Project Longwei at the Nuclear Power Institute of China (NPIC), providing an extended operational range limited only by crew supplies and maintenance requirements, while the Ford-class requires mid-life refueling after approximately 25 years. The expected speed exceeds 30 knots, comparable to the Gerald R. Ford but surpassing the French Charles de Gaulle. The nuclear reactor for the Type 004 is reportedly being developed under Project Longwei at NPIC in Mucheng. Reports indicate that a land-based prototype reactor has been constructed, with satellite imagery confirming its location at NPIC’s Site No. 1, also referred to as Base 909. Procurement documents from China’s 701 Institute, responsible for aircraft carrier development, identify the reactor as designed for installation on a large surface warship. While technical specifications remain undisclosed, the reactor is expected to support integrated electric propulsion, enabling electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) and other high-energy systems, such as advanced radar and electronic warfare equipment. The reactor’s development aligns with China’s broader efforts to establish independent nuclear propulsion capabilities, with potential applications for future nuclear-powered surface vessels. Reports also indicate China has developed a land-based prototype nuclear reactor intended for naval propulsion. Analysis by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, based on satellite imagery and Chinese government documents, confirms the presence of this reactor at NPIC in Mucheng. The project, referred to as Project Longwei, includes procurement documents from China’s 701 Institute stating that reactor equipment was acquired for installation on a large surface warship. These findings suggest China is working toward nuclear propulsion for aircraft carriers, with the Type 004 program potentially providing technical experience for future nuclear-powered surface combatants, including cruisers and destroyers. The carrier’s design is reported to incorporate an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), enabling the launch of heavier aircraft with greater efficiency compared to steam catapults. In comparison, the USS Ford-class has four EMALS catapults with a maximum sortie rate of 270 per day. The Type 004's arresting wire system will support Catapult-Assisted Take-Off, Barrier-Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) operations. Observations from satellite imagery suggest the vessel’s deck configuration includes twin catapults on the starboard side, while an angled deck layout will facilitate simultaneous aircraft launch and recovery. The internal hangar deck is expected to accommodate a larger number of aircraft for storage and maintenance. China’s Type 004 is estimated to have a displacement between 110,000 and 120,000 tonnes, surpassing the USS Gerald R. Ford, which has a full-load displacement of approximately 100,000 tonnes. (Picture source: US Navy) The Type 004 is anticipated to surpass the Ford-class, which carries approximately 75 aircraft, as the Chinese carrier is expected to carry between 70 and 100 aircraft, including fixed-wing fighters, airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The J-15T, a catapult-capable version of the J-15, is expected to operate alongside the J-35, a stealth aircraft under development. Some reports suggest the carrier could also host a new aircraft model, possibly designated as the J-50. The Xian KJ-600 is expected to provide AEW&amp;C capabilities similar to the U.S. E-2 Hawkeye. ASW operations will likely be supported by Z-20F (or newer Z-20J) and Z-18F helicopters, while UAVs may be included for reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and refueling missions, potentially similar to the U.S. MQ-25 Stingray. The Type 004’s expected defensive systems include close-in weapon systems (CIWS), such as the Type 1130, for countering incoming threats. It may also be equipped with surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, potentially including the HQ-10 short-range air defense system. Electronic warfare suites and decoy launchers could be integrated to improve survivability. Reports suggest the possible inclusion of directed-energy weapons such as railguns or laser-based systems, though no confirmation of these systems has been provided. The construction of Type 004 is reportedly taking place at the Dalian Shipyard, with carrier modules observed at the Xianglujiao drydock. Reports indicate that prototype testing of the nuclear propulsion system has been underway at NPIC, with estimates suggesting the reactor could be prepared for integration with the Type 004 carrier before its projected launch. The construction timeline remains unconfirmed, but estimates suggest module assembly and hull construction could occur between 2024 and 2025, followed by launch and fitting-out from 2026 to 2028. Commissioning into service could take place between 2030 and 2032. China’s aircraft carrier program has progressed from acquiring and studying foreign carriers to developing its own designs. In 1985, China purchased the decommissioned HMAS Melbourne from Australia, using its steam catapult and landing system for research. During the 1990s and early 2000s, China acquired former Soviet carriers, including the Minsk, Kiev, and Varyag, with the latter undergoing modifications before being commissioned as the Liaoning (Type 001) in 2012, becoming China’s first operational carrier. The Shandong (Type 002), launched in 2017 and commissioned in 2019, was the first domestically built carrier, featuring a ski-jump launch system similar to Liaoning. The Fujian (Type 003), launched in 2022, introduced electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) but remained conventionally powered, requiring refueling for extended operations. The Type 004’s nuclear propulsion would allow for longer operational endurance without the need for such refueling stops. The development of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier would significantly enhance the Chinese Navy's ability to maintain naval operations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Nuclear propulsion offers virtually unlimited range and endurance, allowing the carrier to operate far from Chinese shores without frequent refueling. This capability enables sustained power projection, extended deployments at greater distances, and rapid response to emerging situations worldwide. Additionally, nuclear-powered carriers generate substantial electrical power, supporting advanced systems such as electromagnetic catapults, which increase sortie rates and allow for the deployment of heavier and more diverse aircraft. This advancement would place China among the few nations—currently only the United States and France—possessing such high-end naval assets. However, the U.S. Navy, which operates 11 nuclear-powered carriers, maintains a significant operational advantage due to its global logistics network and decades of carrier operations experience. If successfully developed, Type 004 would represent China’s first attempt to integrate this capability into its fleet.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/analysis-could-chinas-future-type-004-replace-the-uss-gerald-r-ford-as-the-worlds-most-powerful-aircraft-carrier	2025-02-13T12:14:16-08:00

These upgrades suggest a broader operational role, potentially improving anti-air, anti-submarine, and surface warfare capabilities. Sea trials mark a crucial stage in the ship’s development, allowing engineers and naval experts to test the vessel in real-world conditions. The performance of propulsion systems, weapons integration, and electronic warfare systems are assessed to ensure the ship meets operational standards before being commissioned into service. The sighting of the second Type 054B undergoing sea trials indicates that China is accelerating the production and deployment of these new frigates, likely aiming to bolster its fleet amid rising regional tensions and maritime security concerns. China’s naval expansion has been nothing short of transformative in recent years, particularly when compared to other global naval powers such as the United States. The commissioning of the Type 054B frigates is part of a broader naval modernization effort that has seen China surpass the U.S. in the number of combat-ready vessels. As of 2024, the PLAN had already exceeded 370 warships, a number projected to reach 400 by the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy has struggled to maintain a fleet size above 290 ships, largely due to budgetary constraints, shipbuilding delays, and workforce shortages. Despite this numerical advantage, the U.S. Navy still retains a technological edge. The American fleet possesses superior aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, and advanced integrated warfare systems. The U.S. has also been investing heavily in next-generation naval capabilities, including unmanned surface vessels, hypersonic weapons, and electronic warfare systems. However, China is rapidly closing the gap. The development of the Type 054B, alongside larger projects like the Fujian aircraft carrier, demonstrates Beijing’s ambitions to secure regional dominance and expand its blue-water capabilities. Beyond the U.S., other global navies are also modernizing, but at a much slower pace. Economic sanctions and industrial limitations have hindered Russia’s naval development, preventing large-scale shipbuilding projects. India has been steadily expanding its fleet with a focus on aircraft carriers and destroyers, but its shipbuilding capacity remains far behind China’s. Meanwhile, European navies, such as those of the UK, France, and Germany, have prioritized high-end but limited naval programs, focusing on advanced technology rather than fleet size. One of China’s greatest advantages in naval expansion is its industrial base. The country’s shipbuilding industry dominates the global market, accounting for the vast majority of commercial and military ship orders. Backed by state-led initiatives, China’s shipyards operate at an unmatched pace, enabling the mass production of warships with high efficiency. In contrast, the U.S. faces significant challenges in shipbuilding due to logistical constraints, labor shortages, and rising costs. The few American shipyards capable of building major warships operate at a much slower pace compared to China’s extensive infrastructure. As a result, while China can rapidly commission new vessels like the Type 054B, the U.S. Navy struggles with delays in programs such as the DDG(X) next-generation destroyer and the Virginia-class submarines. The increasing demand for warships, along with rising production costs, has also led to a reported increase in prices, reflecting the high strategic value and technological advancements of these new-generation vessels. However, with a state-controlled defense industry and lower production costs, China can afford to maintain its shipbuilding momentum far more efficiently than its Western counterparts. The deployment of the Type 054B frigates highlights a key shift in China’s naval strategy. These ships will likely play a vital role in fleet defense, escorting aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships while also being capable of independent operations. Their advanced capabilities make them a formidable addition to the PLAN, particularly in contested waters such as the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. With the Type 054B and other warships rapidly joining the PLAN’s ranks, China is positioning itself to challenge traditional maritime powers and project naval strength beyond the Indo-Pacific. The increasing number of modernized Chinese warships raises concerns for U.S. and allied forces in the region as the balance of power at sea continues to shift. If current trends persist, the PLAN will not only dominate the regional seas but could also rival the U.S. Navy on a global scale by the 2030s. This rapid naval expansion, combined with advancements in missile technology, electronic warfare, and naval aviation, ensures that China will remain a central player in shaping the future of maritime security worldwide.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-chinas-second-type-054b-frigate-conducts-sea-trials-signaling-the-rapid-expansion-of-chinese-navy	2025-02-12T01:40:53-08:00

JDAM kits convert unguided bombs such as the MK 82, MK 84, and BLU-109 into GPS-guided munitions, enhancing accuracy under varying weather conditions. The FMU-152A/B and FMU-139 fuzes provide programmable detonation options, including airburst, impact, and delayed explosion, depending on operational requirements. These fuzes offer adaptability for engaging different target types, such as hardened structures or open-area threats. Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been a strategic U.S. partner. Its location in the Middle East provides the U.S. with a strategic presence in a region critical for global energy security and geopolitical stability. Militarily, Israel possesses advanced defense capabilities, supported by U.S. military aid and joint technology development, including missile defense systems. Intelligence-sharing agreements between the two nations have bolstered counterterrorism efforts and regional security initiatives. The U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement (1985) has further strengthened economic ties, particularly in the defense and high-tech sectors. Since the October 2023 conflict with Hamas, U.S.-Israel defense cooperation has intensified, with the United States providing substantial military aid and arms sales, including hundreds of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), designated locally as 'Para.' At least $12.5 billion in direct military assistance has been allocated through legislative measures, including $3.8 billion from a March 2024 bill and $8.7 billion from an April 2024 supplemental appropriations act. Significant arms deals have also been executed, including a $660 million sale of Hellfire missiles, reinforcing Israel’s defense capabilities amid sustained regional tensions. This approval comes amid a broader surge in U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS). In Fiscal Year 2023, FMS transactions hit a record $80.9 billion, with Fiscal Year 2024 surpassing this, as U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments rose 29%, reaching $318.7 billion. This growth is driven largely by global efforts to replenish defense stocks depleted by aid to Ukraine and prepare for potential conflicts. Major U.S. defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman, have played a pivotal role in fulfilling these contracts. However, in January 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14169, titled 'Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid.' This order imposed a 90-day pause on all U.S. foreign development assistance programs to review their alignment with American interests and values. The suspension affected various aid initiatives, including health services, education, and emergency projects, with exceptions limited to emergency food assistance and military aid for key allies, including Israel.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/us-to-significantly-increase-israels-strike-capabilities-with-6-75-billion-worth-of-gps-guided-bombs	2025-02-10T02:40:43-08:00	
DGA Launches DROIDE Program to Accelerate Deployment of Ground Robots in French Army	On February 7, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) announced a new phase in the development of military robotics in France by awarding, on December 30, 2024, a seven-year framework agreement to KNDS France and Safran Electronics &amp; Defense. This program, named DROIDE, is part of a broader effort to modernize France’s military capabilities in autonomous systems, to strengthen the use of ground robotic platforms by 2030-2035. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The DROIDE agreement serves as a key instrument for structuring research and development efforts around essential technologies for military ground robots (Picture source: DGA) This initiative represents a significant step in the strategy for integrating robotics into ground combat, a priority that has been under exploration by the DGA for several years. The French Army has been assessing the potential of robotic systems to support military operations in logistics, reconnaissance, and combat roles. The DROIDE framework agreement aims to advance the technological maturity of robotic platforms while considering the specific challenges posed by terrain and operational conditions. The program will lead to the development of a multi-mission ground robotic demonstrator designed to assist combat units and reduce soldier exposure to risk.The recent history of military robotics in France demonstrates a progressive expansion of capabilities in this domain. In 2018, the DGA commissioned a study from a consortium formed by Safran Electronics &amp; Defense and the SME Effidence to anticipate the integration of robots into combat units under the FURIOUS program (FUturs systèmes Robotiques Innovants en tant qu’OUtilS au profit du combattant embarqué et débarqué). This project led to the development of three demonstrators of varying sizes, designed for zone reconnaissance, building exploration, and equipment transport. These systems underwent testing at the Urban Operations Training Center (CENZUB) in Sissonne.Following the progress made under the FURIOUS program, a new contractual phase was awarded to Safran Electronics &amp; Defense in 2022, after successful trials conducted in 2021 at the Urban Combat Training Center. This phase focused on optimizing the modular architecture of the systems, both in hardware and software, to enhance their level of autonomy.Concurrently, the French Army has increased field experimentation efforts, conducting trials with a robotic mule in the Sahel, launching the CoHoMa challenge, and establishing the Vulcain section to explore the integration of robotics in military operations. The Military Programming Law (LPM) 2024-2030 has reinforced this approach by emphasizing the necessity of developing ground robots capable of interacting with soldiers and their environment under human control, reducing the risks faced by deployed forces.During a Senate hearing in November 2024, the French Army Chief of Staff, General Pierre Schill, detailed expectations regarding ground robotics. He highlighted the importance of preliminary research and demonstrator development, noting that while this field remains less mature than aerial drones, it requires sustained investment, particularly in software development. He also outlined concrete applications for these systems, such as engineering operations involving demining robots and logistical support using robotic carriers capable of following armored vehicles to transport supplies forward.However, deploying armed robotic systems presents complex technical and operational challenges. General Schill emphasized the difficulties associated with autonomous movement and fire control, despite proposals from defense manufacturers such as KNDS France, which developed the Optio X20 armed with a 20mm cannon, and MBDA, which has also introduced relevant solutions. The LPM aims for an initial integration of these robotic systems by 2030, while continuing the necessary testing to ensure their effectiveness and safety in operational environments.Within this framework, the DROIDE agreement serves as a key instrument for structuring research and development efforts around essential technologies for military ground robots. It is designed to include third-party partners offering innovative solutions, thereby strengthening France’s industrial and technological ecosystem in this field.Safran Electronics &amp; Defense is expected to leverage its experience from the FURIOUS program, particularly with its Nerva mini-robots and Ultro 600 robotic mule. Meanwhile, KNDS France will build on its collaboration with SERA Ingénierie, a subsidiary of the SOGECLAIR group, which contributed to the development of the Centurio ground robot. The Centurio has already undergone operational testing at the Canjuers military camp, demonstrating advancements in ground robotics.The awarding of the DROIDE framework agreement to KNDS France and Safran Electronics &amp; Defense confirms the DGA and the French Army’s commitment to accelerating the integration of autonomous systems into ground forces. By structuring research and development around a multi-mission demonstrator, the program aims to identify the most suitable technological solutions for future operational requirements while maintaining industrial and technological sovereignty in the strategic field of military robotics.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/dga-launches-droide-program-to-accelerate-deployment-of-ground-robots-in-french-army	2025-02-10T02:06:56-08:00	
Flash News: Türkiye to Strengthen ESSI’s European Air Defense with Locally-Made Missile Systems	According to information published by the Turkish daily newspaper Daily Sabah on February 10, 2025, Türkiye, which joined the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) in February 2024, is now an official participant in the German-led project aimed at creating a unified and effective missile defense system across Europe and can offer its locally-made air defense missile systems to enhance the capabilities of the ESSI project. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Turkish SIPER long-range air defense missile system, developed by Roketsan and Aselsan, is designed to provide advanced protection against airborne threats, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles (Picture source: SSB) The European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI) is a collaborative missile defense program spearheaded by Germany, aimed at strengthening Europe’s air and missile defense architecture through the integration of various air defense systems from participating nations. Designed to counter a wide range of aerial threats, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones, ESSI seeks to enhance NATO’s overall deterrence and response capabilities. The initiative promotes interoperability among European defense systems by incorporating a mix of existing and new technologies, such as the IRIS-T SLM, Patriot, and Arrow-3 air defense systems. By uniting multiple European nations under a single defensive umbrella, ESSI not only fortifies Europe’s protection against aerial threats but also streamlines defense procurement, reducing costs and enhancing coordination among allied forces. In October 2022, fifteen European nations, including Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, and the United Kingdom, signed a declaration to join the European Sky Shield Initiative (ESSI). The initiative, led by Germany, focuses on the joint procurement of air defense systems to enhance Europe’s missile defense capabilities. All founding states are NATO members, with Finland formally joining the alliance in 2023, further strengthening the collective defense framework. ESSI is closely aligned with NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense System (NATINAMDS), reinforcing the alliance’s ability to counter aerial threats through a unified and multi-layered air defense network. In February 2024, the German government announced the addition of Greece and Türkiye to the initiative, marking a significant expansion of ESSI’s geographical coverage and operational capabilities. Türkiye’s participation, in particular, adds a new dimension to the initiative, leveraging its strategic location and advanced indigenous air defense systems. With these new members, ESSI continues to evolve as a critical pillar of European security, fostering greater defense cooperation among NATO allies and enhancing deterrence against potential threats. Türkiye’s inclusion in ESSI is particularly noteworthy given its critical geographic position at the intersection of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. As NATO’s southeastern flank, Türkiye provides essential early warning and rapid-response capabilities against missile threats emerging from volatile regions, including the Middle East and the Caucasus. While the initiative is primarily focused on countering Russian threats, Türkiye’s regional coverage enhances its strategic relevance, reinforcing NATO’s collective security posture. Furthermore, Ankara’s participation could signal a recalibration of its relationships with NATO, the European Union, and the United States, potentially easing tensions in defense cooperation. Beyond strategic positioning, Türkiye brings valuable technological contributions to ESSI. Over the past decade, the Turkish defense industry has made significant advancements in the development of indigenous air defense systems, strengthening its ability to support Europe’s missile defense architecture. Led by major defense companies such as Roketsan and Aselsan, Türkiye has successfully developed and deployed a range of modern air defense systems tailored to counter evolving threats.

With geopolitical tensions at a high, the expansion of ESSI highlights the growing importance of multinational defense collaboration in addressing modern security challenges.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-tuerkiye-to-strengthen-essis-european-air-defense-with-locally-made-missile-systems	2025-02-10T01:32:10-08:00	
China to expand its nuclear submarine fleet as the production of Type 093B increases	On February 7, 2025, Tom Shugart shared an image taken on February 4, 2025, showing the Huludao nuclear submarine shipyard, where a Type 093B nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN/SSGN) was observed with its vertical launch system (VLS) hatches open, revealing what appears to be 12 tubes, indicating a considerable increase in firepower for this class of attack submarine. Another image showed a separate Type 093B on the transfer dock, which is typically used for newly built submarines. At least four Type 093 submarines were observed at the shipyard, though it is unclear whether all are newly constructed or undergoing maintenance.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link At the Huludao shipyard, a Type 093B nuclear-powered attack submarine was observed with its vertical launch system (VLS) hatches open, revealing what appears to be 12 tubes, indicating a considerable increase in firepower for this class of attack submarine. (Picture source: Chinese social media and Twitter/Tom Shugart) China seems to have ordered a rapid expansion of the People's Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) submarine fleet, particularly the Type 093B series. According to several analysts, between seven and eight Type 093B submarines have been built in just the past three years, a production rate that exceeds the number of attack submarines China has constructed over the past three decades. When including conventional submarines, such as the new Type 039C, the total number of submarines launched by China in the past three years surpasses 15. Experts now believe that China is steadily increasing its fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, possibly as a precursor to the introduction of the next-generation Type 095 SSN. Until then, the Type 093B is likely to replace aging vessels while achieving a significant qualitative leap in underwater capabilities. The adoption of pump-jet propulsion in the Type 093B suggests an effort to reduce acoustic signatures and improve underwater performance. Pump-jet propulsors are generally associated with submarines designed for higher speeds and reduced detectability. While initial estimates suggested an initial batch of six units, current reports indicate that Type 093B production is ongoing, replacing older submarines and increasing the total SSN fleet size. China’s nuclear-powered submarine development began in the 1970s with the Type 091 (Han-class) SSN, which was later replaced by the Type 093 (Shang-class) nuclear-powered attack submarine to enhance the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) underwater capabilities. Designed with assistance from Russia, its development aimed to address the limitations of the Type 091, particularly in noise reduction and combat effectiveness. The first Type 093 entered service in the early 2000s, featuring improved hydrodynamics, quieter operation, and greater endurance. Later variants, such as the Type 093A and 093B, incorporated vertical launch systems (VLS) for several types of cruise missiles, marking the first time that a Chinese attack submarine has incorporated such a capability. The Type 093B, reportedly featuring an elongated hull and advanced sensors, is believed to serve as a transition toward the next-generation Type 095 submarine, also designated as 09-V. The Type 093B incorporates a streamlined hull designed to reduce acoustic signatures. It uses a pump-jet propulsion system rather than a conventional propeller, a change consistent with recent trends in SSN design. This propulsion system is generally associated with improvements in efficiency and noise reduction at higher speeds. A key feature of the Type 093B is the integration of a vertical launch system (VLS), marking the first known instance of a Chinese SSN being equipped with VLS, allowing it to launch a range of missile types. The observed configuration, which appears to include between 12 and 24 VLS cells, suggests the submarine can be armed with anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs), land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs), and potentially submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Satellite imagery from early 2023 showed that China had launched its eighth Type 093-class submarine at Huludao, with at least two confirmed as Type 093B variants. The rate of production suggests a degree of standardization in manufacturing. During the 70th anniversary of the PLAN’s Submarine Force in June 2024, Chinese state media outlined the increasing role of nuclear-powered attack submarines in naval operations. Reports suggest that the Type 093B may be capable of carrying a submarine-launched variant of the YJ-21 hypersonic missile, which has been observed on Type 055 destroyers. If deployed from submarines, this missile would expand China’s strike capabilities. The increased production rate of the Type 093B also raises questions about the future composition of China’s underwater fleet, particularly regarding the ratio of SSNs to conventionally powered submarines (SSKs) such as the Type 039C. The increased adoption of pump-jet propulsion indicates that these new SSNs may be deployed more aggressively than their predecessors. Additionally, beyond the Type 093B, China is continuing to develop its submarine fleet. The Type 094 SSBNs have been used for strategic deterrence patrols, though some analysts suggest that China's nuclear triad is not yet fully operational. There are reports that China may modify some Type 094 SSBNs into SSGNs, potentially increasing their missile capabilities. This will increase the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)’s capability for blue-water operations, extend its operational range, and strengthen its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities. SSKs will likely remain part of the fleet for regional defense and littoral operations, while the growing SSN fleet is positioned to conduct long-range patrols, escort carrier groups, and contribute to strategic deterrence in the Pacific and surrounding waters. In parallel, China is actively enhancing the missile capabilities of its main vessels. The Type 055 destroyer, for instance, is equipped with 112 vertical launch system (VLS) cells, capable of deploying various missiles, including the YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missile and the CJ-10 land-attack cruise missile. The YJ-18 features a subsonic cruise mode and a supersonic terminal attack, with an estimated range of 220 to 540 kilometers, while the CJ-10 is a land-attack cruise missile with a range exceeding 1,500 kilometers. Additionally, China has introduced the YJ-21, a hypersonic anti-ship ballistic missile with an estimated range of approximately 1,500 kilometers and speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 10. The recently commissioned Type 054B frigate also features modern missile systems, contributing to China's growing naval firepower, with reports from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) indicating that by 2024, the Chinese Navy had achieved more than 50% of the U.S. Navy's firepower in VLS missile cells.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/china-to-expand-its-nuclear-submarine-fleet-as-the-production-of-type-093b-increases	2025-02-10T01:28:24-08:00

PT PAL Indonesia, the country’s leading shipbuilder, has already proposed helicopter carrier and amphibious assault ship concepts, making it a possible candidate for a domestic construction project, potentially in collaboration with a foreign partner.Italy could also play a key role, particularly through Fincantieri, which already has ties with the Indonesian Navy for the supply of frigates. Additionally, rumors have circulated about the possible acquisition of the Giuseppe Garibaldi aircraft carrier, which could indicate a potential agreement with the Italian naval industry for modernization or licensed construction.Another possibility is a partnership with South Korea, a country with which Indonesia already collaborates in the naval sector, particularly through Hyundai Heavy Industries or DSME, which could offer a suitable platform. The option of purchasing a second-hand vessel also remains on the table, with potential modernization by the original builder according to the Indonesian Navy’s specific requirements. The final decision will depend on the country’s strategic priorities, budget, and ongoing negotiations with its industrial and military partners.Although the Indonesian Navy is considered one of the most powerful in Southeast Asia, it still lacks sufficient capabilities and ships to safeguard the country’s vast territory and exclusive economic zones. The aging fleet remains a recurring challenge. As part of its armed forces modernization plan, known as the Minimum Essential Force (MEF), the Indonesian Navy plans to operate at least four amphibious helicopter carrier vessels.Beyond the aircraft carrier project, the Indonesian Navy is also pursuing other strategic acquisitions. It has submitted an official request for the purchase of two frigates built in Italy to enhance its fleet’s operational presence and capabilities. Meanwhile, two domestically produced frigates have been prepared for service, reinforcing the country’s goal of increasing industrial and operational self-sufficiency. Additionally, multiple fast missile-equipped patrol boats from Turkey will further strengthen the fleet.Indonesia has also received a grant proposal from Japan, offering two patrol vessels to be stationed at the Balikpapan naval base in East Kalimantan. This location is strategically important as it will bolster the military presence near Indonesia’s future capital, Nusantara, situated close to Balikpapan. Admiral Muhammad Ali stated that these patrol vessels are well suited to the region’s geography, particularly due to their ability to navigate the numerous waterways in the future capital. Measuring 18 meters in length, these ships will enhance riverine security and surveillance.The Indonesian Parliament (DPR) has approved the Ministry of Defense and the armed forces’ request to accept this Japanese grant, reflecting the country’s commitment to strengthening its maritime security. These acquisitions and modernization efforts represent a clear strategy aimed at improving Indonesia’s power projection and maritime security within an evolving regional landscape.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indonesia-weighs-aircraft-carrier-acquisition-to-strengthen-maritime-operations-and-security	2025-02-10T00:49:41-08:00

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The P-8A Poseidon is a multi-role maritime patrol aircraft derived from the Boeing 737NG, designed for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions (Picture source: Boeing) Germany began acquiring the P-8A Poseidon in June 2021 with an initial order of five aircraft under the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, later adding three more units in November 2023. This program, allowing Germany to procure U.S. military equipment through an intergovernmental agreement, has progressed at an unusually fast pace, with only four years between the contract signing and the completion of the first unit. Following the application of its livery, the aircraft was transferred to Boeing Defense, where it will be equipped with its mission systems and undergo a series of tests before being handed over to the German Navy’s air squadron based in Nordholz, Lower Saxony.The P-8A Poseidon is a multi-role maritime patrol aircraft derived from the Boeing 737NG, designed for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Powered by two CFM-56-7BE turbofan engines, it reaches a maximum speed of 490 knots, an operational ceiling of 41,000 feet, and extended endurance due to its in-flight refueling capability. Its Link 11 and Link 16 data links, combined with advanced satellite connectivity, enable near real-time intelligence transmission to command centers, optimizing coordination in joint and multinational operations. Its adaptable architecture allows for long-duration missions both in deep-sea environments and near coastal areas, with enhanced command and control capabilities on the battlefield.The aircraft’s weaponry includes Mark 54 torpedoes, AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and depth charges, distributed between an internal weapons bay and external hardpoints under the wings. It is also equipped with 129 sonobuoys for detecting, localizing, and tracking submarines. For surveillance and targeting, it features an inverse synthetic aperture radar and a synthetic aperture radar, enabling precise identification of surface and underwater threats. In terms of self-protection, the Poseidon is fitted with the AN/AAQ-24(V) DIRCM system, designed to detect and neutralize infrared-guided missiles, enhancing its survivability against aerial and naval threats.The acquisition of the P-8A Poseidon by the German Navy comes at a time when the renewal of maritime patrol capabilities is becoming increasingly urgent. Initially, Germany considered this procurement as an interim solution while awaiting the development of the Franco-German Maritime Airborne Warfare System, scheduled for 2035. However, with the shifting industrial priorities in France and Berlin’s decision to expand its P-8A fleet, the long-term integration of the aircraft into German forces appears increasingly likely.By acquiring the P-8A Poseidon, Germany joins the ranks of operators that include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Norway, New Zealand, South Korea, and India, while Canada is also preparing to introduce the platform. Currently, over 130 P-8A aircraft are in service worldwide, accumulating more than 600,000 flight hours. Production begins at Boeing’s commercial aircraft facility in Renton, where the fuselage is manufactured according to 737 specifications before being transferred to Boeing’s defense facilities for military equipment and mission system integration.The German P-8A fleet will incorporate the latest configurations, including an advanced self-protection system capable of countering infrared-guided missiles, similar to those used on German government aircraft. For anti-submarine warfare, the aircraft will be equipped with acoustic buoy launchers, Mark 54 torpedoes, and Mark 84 depth charges. However, unlike the P-3C Orion, it will not feature a magnetic anomaly detector, reducing its ability to directly detect submarines based on their magnetic signature. For reconnaissance and counter-surface warfare missions, the Poseidon will be armed with Harpoon missiles and will feature a retractable electro-optical turret, as well as the AN/ALQ-240(V)1 electronic support measures system, providing electronic warfare and signal intelligence capabilities.One of the P-8A’s key advantages is its ability to transmit real-time intelligence to German command centers, strengthening Germany’s maritime surveillance in an evolving strategic environment. With its next-generation communication systems, it will play a central role in networked warfare operations, improving interoperability with NATO allies. Frigate Captain Björn M., project lead for the P-8A program within the BAAINBw, emphasized that this aircraft represents a significant enhancement in joint-force coordination and marks a new era for maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare.The entry of the P-8A Poseidon into the German Navy marks a critical step for the Bundeswehr in accelerating the modernization of its maritime patrol capabilities. This program, executed at an accelerated pace for a project of this scale, reflects Germany’s intent to quickly address operational gaps left by the retirement of the Orion fleet.

Meanwhile, investments in AI-driven autonomous systems, cyber warfare, and space-based defense capabilities reflect the Pentagon’s recognition that future conflicts will extend beyond traditional battlefields. Looking further ahead, the 2025 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) outlines long-term acquisition costs for each military department. According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections, acquisition costs for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and defense-wide activities will continue to rise over the next decade. The U.S. Army’s acquisition costs are expected to grow significantly, with a 17 percent increase in the three years after the FYDP period, rising from $38 billion in 2029 to $45 billion in 2032. The primary drivers of this increase will be the procurement of the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft and new ground combat vehicles, including a replacement for the Bradley fighting vehicle. Aircraft procurement costs are projected to more than double by 2039, while spending on ground combat vehicles is set to increase by approximately 50 percent. For the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, annual acquisition costs between 2030 and 2039 will fluctuate between $101 billion and $111 billion, averaging $107 billion per year—only slightly above the FYDP period’s $106 billion average. Shipbuilding will remain a priority, with an annual average of $40 billion dedicated to ship construction and support. This funding will support ongoing upgrades to guided-missile destroyers, the expansion of the fleet with a new class of guided-missile frigates, and the replacement of aircraft carriers and ballistic missile submarines. Meanwhile, aircraft procurement costs will average $19 billion annually, supporting replacements for the E-6B Mercury nuclear communications aircraft, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and the T-45C Goshawk trainers, while finalizing acquisitions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the CH-53K King Stallion helicopter. The U.S. Air Force and Space Force will see a steady rise in acquisition costs after the FYDP period, increasing from $96 billion in 2029 to $109 billion in 2039, an average annual increase of 1.3 percent. This growth is driven by the modernization of key platforms, including the F-35A, the Next-Generation Air Dominance fighter, the B-21 bomber, and the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile. Space-based capabilities will receive even greater investment, with acquisition costs for space systems projected to grow from $21 billion in 2029 to $30 billion in 2039, increasing at an average rate of 3.4 percent per year. This funding will enable the deployment of large constellations of low- and medium-orbit satellites, enhancing space-based communications, missile warning systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Defense-wide acquisition costs, covering programs such as missile defense and special operations, are projected to increase by 1 percent annually between 2030 and 2039, rising from $36 billion to $40 billion. Missile defense spending will remain steady at an average of $9 billion per year, while other defense-wide expenditures will grow by approximately 1.4 percent annually. Hegseth’s vision for rebuilding the U.S. military signals a shift toward a leaner, more effective, and strategically focused defense posture. As geopolitical threats evolve, the United States is reinforcing its global presence through expanded military exercises, strengthened alliances, and forward-deployed forces. His leadership will be closely watched as he works to implement these ambitious reforms, ensuring that the U.S. military remains the most formidable force in the world while also holding the Pentagon accountable for how it spends taxpayer dollars.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-defense-secretary-pete-hegseth-vows-to-rebuild-us-military-for-a-new-era-of-global-challenges	2025-02-09T10:35:45-08:00

Breaking News: Morocco Chooses Israeli ATMOS 2000 Howitzers Over French CAESAR Amid Growing Defense Ties	According to information published on February 8, 2025, by the French financial weekly La Tribune, defense journalist Michel Cabirol reported that Israeli defense company Elbit Systems had secured a contract to supply 36 ATMOS 2000 155mm wheeled self-propelled howitzers to Morocco. These artillery systems will be mounted on Czech Tatra trucks, marking a significant shift in Morocco’s artillery procurement strategy. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ATMOS 2000 is a 155mm/52-caliber truck-mounted self-propelled howitzer developed by Israeli defense company Elbit Systems. (Picture source: Elbit Systems) This decision follows operational challenges faced with the French-made CAESAR howitzers, which were delivered in 2022 by KNDS France. Citing Cabirol, the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces (FAR) experienced recurring technical issues with the CAESAR systems, prompting them to seek a more reliable and efficient alternative. France had been anticipating a new order for additional CAESAR howitzers, but instead, Rabat selected the Israeli ATMOS 2000, signaling a growing preference for Israeli military technology over traditional European suppliers. The ATMOS 2000 (Autonomous Truck Mounted Howitzer System) is a 155mm/52-caliber truck-mounted artillery system designed for rapid deployment and superior mobility. One of its key advantages is its adaptability to various high-mobility truck platforms, including 6x6 and 8x8 configurations, providing flexibility based on operational needs. The system is capable of firing extended-range projectiles exceeding 40 kilometers, with a rate of fire between 4 to 9 rounds per minute, depending on the mode of operation. The advanced automatic laying and navigation system ensures high precision, and the system is fully compatible with modern C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Intelligence) networks for enhanced battlefield awareness. The ATMOS 2000 is designed for quick relocation, moving within 30 seconds after firing to avoid counter-battery threats. Additionally, its semi-automatic loading system allows it to be operated efficiently by a crew of 2 to 6 personnel, making it a more automated and efficient alternative to traditional towed and self-propelled howitzers. According to Elbit Systems, the ATMOS 2000 outperforms the French CAESAR in multiple aspects, particularly in mobility, automation, firepower, and crew efficiency. Unlike the CAESAR, which is primarily available on French Arquus or Mercedes-Benz trucks, the ATMOS 2000 is adaptable to a variety of truck chassis, including Czech Tatra trucks, allowing Morocco to integrate it into its existing logistics infrastructure. The automation level of the ATMOS 2000 is another key advantage, as it incorporates a semi-automatic loading system, reducing crew workload and enhancing rate of fire. In contrast, the CAESAR uses a manual loading system, requiring a larger crew of 4 to 5 personnel, which increases operational complexity and slows down the artillery system’s response time in combat scenarios. When comparing firepower and rate of fire, the ATMOS 2000 is capable of firing between 4 to 9 rounds per minute, depending on the mission profile and crew efficiency, and supports MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact) capabilities, allowing multiple shells to hit a target simultaneously. While the CAESAR has a comparable rate of fire of 6 rounds per minute, operational reports from Morocco suggest that ATMOS provides a more reliable and efficient artillery platform in sustained combat operations. Elbit Systems has also integrated advanced fire control and C4I capabilities into the ATMOS 2000, enabling real-time target sharing, automated fire correction, and enhanced digital battlefield awareness. While the CAESAR also features a modern fire control system, Morocco has reported integration challenges with foreign C4I networks, making it less adaptable for their specific operational needs. In terms of mobility and deployment speed, the ATMOS 2000 has a significant advantage, as it can relocate in under 30 seconds after firing, reducing vulnerability to enemy counter-battery fire. The CAESAR, in comparison, requires approximately one minute to complete its firing sequence and reposition, making it slightly slower in high-intensity combat scenarios. Both systems are compatible with NATO-standard 155mm ammunition, with the ATMOS achieving a range of over 40 km using ERFB-BB (Extended Range Full Bore - Base Bleed) projectiles, while the CAESAR can reach 42 km with the same ammunition and up to 50 km with VLAP (Very Long-Range Artillery Projectile). Since establishing formal diplomatic relations in 2020, Morocco and Israel have significantly expanded their defense cooperation. In 2021, the two countries signed a Defense Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), opening the door for defense contracts, intelligence sharing, and joint military projects. Among the most notable agreements was Morocco's $500 million deal in 2023 to acquire the Israeli Barak MX air and missile defense system, significantly strengthening its air defense network. Additionally, Morocco has integrated 20 Israeli EL/M-2032 radar systems into its F-5E fighter jets, enhancing their air-to-air combat capabilities. The Royal Moroccan Armed Forces have also bolstered their air defense with the acquisition of 75 Barak-LRAD long-range air defense systems, which are part of the Barak-MX missile defense package. The growing presence of Israeli military equipment on the global defense market is becoming increasingly evident, often competing directly with European defense manufacturers, including France. Over the past decade, Israel has expanded its defense exports through strategic agreements, offering modern, combat-proven technology that appeals to nations seeking reliable alternatives to European and American systems. In contrast, France has struggled to maintain its influence, facing delays in deliveries, complex political conditions, and customer dissatisfaction with some of its defense products. The Moroccan shift from the French CAESAR to the Israeli ATMOS 2000 is a prime example of this trend, highlighting the increasing preference for Israeli artillery systems in regions like Africa and Asia. While France had been expecting to secure an additional order for more CAESAR howitzers from Morocco, the selection of the ATMOS 2000 underscores Israel’s growing role as a major global arms supplier, offering combat-proven, cost-effective, and adaptable solutions that appeal to modern militaries. As a result, Israel’s defense industry is steadily increasing its market share, posing a significant challenge to traditional European suppliers like France in the highly competitive global arms market.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-morocco-chooses-israeli-atmos-2000-howitzers-over-french-caesar-amid-growing-defense-ties	2025-02-09T05:28:22-08:00	
Exclusive: Aero India 2025 Russian Su-57 and US F-35 Compete for Indian Air Force Next Fighter Jet	On Monday, February 10, 2025, Aero India 2025 officially begins at Yelahanka Air Force Station, marking one of the most anticipated defense exhibitions in recent history. This year’s event will feature a historic showdown between two of the world’s most advanced fifth-generation stealth fighters: Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57 and the U.S. Air Force’s F-35 Lightning II. The Su-57 is confirmed to make its debut appearance in India, while the F-35 is expected to be part of the static display, presenting a rare convergence of these advanced aircraft.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russia's Su-57 (left) and US F-35 (right) Face Off at Aero India 2025 as Both Jets Compete for India's Next Fighter Acquisition. (Picture source: Open source Intel X account) This event occurs as geopolitical competition intensifies between the U.S. and Russia over defense ties with India. In January 2025, the U.S. President Trump administration urged India to significantly increase its purchase of U.S. military technology, emphasizing Washington’s commitment to countering Russia’s long-standing dominance in India’s defense market, which has seen the delivery of large quantities of Russian military equipment over the years. This event holds strategic significance as India evaluates options for its planned acquisition of 114 multi-role fighter aircraft, a deal that has drawn intense global competition. Russia’s participation underscores its commitment to strengthening defense ties with India, while the U.S.’s continued presence aims to deepen its defense cooperation with the country. Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57 Felon was developed under the PAK FA (Perspektivny Aviatsionny Kompleks Frontovoy Aviatsii) program and made its first flight in 2010, entering service in 2020. Unlike most stealth fighters, the Su-57 integrates thrust-vectoring engines, allowing for exceptional maneuverability in air combat. This design philosophy reflects Russia’s emphasis on close-range dogfighting and air superiority, where agility and speed take precedence over pure stealth capabilities. The F-35 Lightning II, on the other hand, was designed by Lockheed Martin under the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program and first flew in 2006, entering service in 2015. Unlike the Su-57, the F-35 prioritizes stealth, network-centric warfare, and data fusion, enabling it to detect and eliminate threats before being detected itself. A direct comparison between the two aircraft highlights key differences in their design approach. The Su-57 measures 19.8 meters in length with a wingspan of 14.1 meters, while the more compact F-35 measures 15.7 meters in length with a wingspan of 10.7 meters. The Su-57 boasts a top speed exceeding Mach 2.0 (2,450 km/h), outpacing the F-35’s Mach 1.6 (1,930 km/h), and features twin Saturn izdeliye 30 engines, compared to the F-35’s single Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine. The Su-57 also integrates a 3D thrust-vectoring system, making it highly maneuverable, whereas the F-35 lacks thrust vectoring but compensates with superior sensor fusion and electronic warfare capabilities. Stealth is a defining feature of both aircraft, but the F-35 is considered significantly stealthier due to its low radar cross-section (RCS), embedded sensors, and radar-absorbing materials. The Su-57 incorporates stealth features but retains partially exposed engine nozzles, increasing its radar signature. In terms of combat range, the Su-57 has an advantage with a range of approximately 3,500 km, whereas the F-35A’s range is around 2,200 km. Both aircraft feature internal and external hardpoints for carrying weapons, with the Su-57 equipped with a 30mm cannon and advanced hypersonic missiles, while the F-35 carries a 25mm GAU-22/A cannon and precision-guided bombs, including nuclear-capable weapons. The presence of both these advanced aircraft at Aero India 2025 provides India with a rare opportunity to assess their capabilities firsthand, as the country moves forward with its plans to acquire 114 multirole fighters. This competition also plays into broader geopolitical and strategic defense collaborations. The U.S. government’s push for India to increase purchases of American military technology is part of a larger strategic effort to challenge Russia’s influence in India’s defense sector. As part of this effort, Washington has promoted co-production deals for fighter jet engines and combat vehicles, including the approval for India to produce the Stryker armored fighting vehicle under the Critical and Emerging Technologies initiative (iCET). As India seeks to modernize its air force, the showcasing of both the Russian Su-57 and U.S. F-35 at Aero India 2025 will play a crucial role in shaping future defense partnerships. This event not only highlights India’s growing significance in the global defense market but also underscores the strategic competition between Russia and the U.S. in supplying advanced military technology to India. Whether India prioritizes the stealth and networked warfare capabilities of the F-35 or the maneuverability and combat dominance of the Su-57, the decision will significantly impact India’s air combat capabilities for decades to come.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/at-aero-india-2025-russian-su-57-and-us-f-35-compete-for-indian-air-force-next-fighter-jet	2025-02-09T03:03:48-08:00

Russian Navy to soon deploy the modernized Admiral Nakhimov nuclear battlecruiser against the US Navy’s most powerful warships	As reported by TASS on February 4, 2025, the Russian nuclear battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov has entered a new phase in its modernization, with both of its nuclear reactors now operational. The first reactor was activated in December 2024, followed by the second on February 2, 2025, confirming the operational readiness of the ship’s nuclear propulsion system. Currently docked at Sevmash, the cruiser is scheduled to begin sea trials in the summer of 2025, with state trials planned before commissioning in 2026, as the Admiral Nakhimov now has a higher missile capacity than the US Zumwalt and Arleigh Burke classes.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Upon successful completion of the sea trials, the Admiral Nakhimov nuclear battlecruiser will be reintroduced into the Russian Northern Fleet as one of its most powerful surface ships, with a service life projected to extend at least for 30 years. (Picture source: Russian social media) The ship’s extensive overhaul has faced multiple delays, with earlier estimates suggesting a return to service in 2022. However, modifications to the upgrade program and financial constraints have further extended the timeline. The cost of the refurbishment has reportedly exceeded 200 billion rubles, making it one of the most expensive warship modernizations in Russian naval history. According to earlier statements from Russian sources, the goal was to achieve the physical launch of both reactors and initiate undocking procedures by the fall of 2024. However, the first reactor was only activated in December 2024, coinciding with the completion of the ship’s demagnetization process. Originally designated Kalinin, the Admiral Nakhimov was constructed at the Baltic Shipyard in Leningrad as the third nuclear-powered battlecruiser of the Kirov class. It was laid down on May 17, 1983, launched on April 25, 1986, and commissioned into the Russian Northern Fleet on December 30, 1988, before being renamed on April 22, 1992. The ship was placed into long-term maintenance in 1999, with major modernization efforts beginning in 2013. Before this full-scale upgrade, it carried 20 P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles, 96 S-300F Fort-M air defense missiles, six 30mm Kashtan close-in weapon systems, as well as torpedo and anti-submarine systems. The modernization has significantly enhanced the ship’s combat capabilities. Ten 3S14 universal vertical launch systems, each containing eight Kalibr-NK or Oniks cruise missiles, have replaced the previous missile setup, allowing for a total of 80 missiles. The ship has also been equipped to launch the 3M22 Tsirkon hypersonic missile, extending its strike capability. Additionally, the air defense systems have been upgraded, replacing the older S-300F with a navalized S-400 system containing 96 launch cells. Shorter-range defenses now include the Pantsir-ME and a naval adaptation of the S-350 Vityaz, replacing the older Osa-M system. In comparison, China’s Type 055 destroyers feature 112 VLS cells, accommodating YJ-18 anti-ship missiles, CJ-10 land-attack cruise missiles, and HHQ-9 long-range air defense missiles. The Type 055 is equipped with a dual-band radar system and electronic warfare capabilities. The U.S. Arleigh Burke Flight III destroyers are fitted with 96 Mk 41 VLS cells, supporting Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, SM-6 air defense missiles, and ESSM interceptors. The Zumwalt-class destroyers, with 80 VLS cells, are designed for low-observable operations and multi-mission strike capabilities, including hypersonic missile integration. While the Admiral Nakhimov has a higher missile capacity than the Zumwalt and Arleigh Burke classes, it lacks the integrated stealth features of modern Chinese and U.S. designs, which may affect its survivability. Spanning for over a decade, the Admiral Nakhimov’s extensive modernization has faced multiple delays, with earlier estimates suggesting a return to service in 2022. (Picture source: Russian social media) Compared to the Moskva cruiser, which carried 16 P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missiles and S-300F Fort air defense missiles, the Admiral Nakhimov has a significantly larger missile arsenal, more modern air defense systems, and enhanced electronic warfare capabilities. The Moskva, commissioned in 1983, used older radar and fire control systems, limiting its adaptability to newer threats. While the Moskva was optimized for fleet air defense with limited multi-role capabilities, the Admiral Nakhimov is configured for a broader range of missions, including long-range precision strikes, air defense, and anti-submarine warfare. Beyond missile armaments, the ship's nuclear propulsion system has been fully restored, with two KN-3 nuclear reactors producing 2×150 MW, supported by two auxiliary boilers and two turbines generating a combined 140,000 hp (103 MW) on shafts. The propulsion system also includes four power plants with a capacity of 18 MW, four steam turbine generators producing 3 MW each, and four gas turbine generators rated at 1.5 MW each, ensuring speeds of up to 32 knots. All electronic warfare and radar systems have been upgraded to modern standards, with improved target tracking and threat detection capabilities. Additional enhancements include the installation of the Redut naval air defense system and the Paket-NK anti-submarine system, increasing layered defense capabilities against aerial, surface, and underwater threats. The final modernization phase will involve extensive testing of the 28,000-ton vessel, with factory sea trials expected in mid-2025, followed by state trials assessing all systems under operational conditions. Upon successful completion, the Admiral Nakhimov will be reintroduced into the Russian Northern Fleet as one of its most powerful surface ships. The vessel's service life is projected to extend at least 30 years, enabling it to engage naval and land-based targets at long range while offering enhanced air defense for fleet operations. The fate of the Admiral Nakhimov’s sister ship, the Pyotr Velikiy, remains under review. In mid-2023, reports suggested it could be decommissioned after the Admiral Nakhimov’s return to service, but the Northern Fleet later denied this. The Pyotr Velikiy remains in operational duty as the only currently active Kirov-class cruiser until the Admiral Nakhimov is recommissioned, though its long-term future within the Russian Navy remains unclear. The Kirov-class nuclear-powered missile cruisers were developed during the Soviet era as the largest non-aircraft carrier surface combatants. Displacing 28,000 tons, they surpass most modern naval combatants, including U.S. Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. The class was designed for multi-role operations, with anti-ship, anti-air, and anti-submarine capabilities. However, their high maintenance costs and reliance on nuclear propulsion have limited their long-term viability, with only two of the original four ships remaining in service, as the Admiral Ushakov and Admiral Lazarev were decommissioned due to their aging systems and expensive maintenance. Originally designated Kalinin, the Admiral Nakhimov was constructed at the Baltic Shipyard in Leningrad as the third nuclear-powered battlecruiser of the Kirov class, and was launched in 1986.

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Arctic Region is emerging as a key arena for military power projection, driven by a combination of strategic, environmental, and economic factors. Melting ice is opening up new maritime routes, and significant natural resources such as oil, gas, and minerals lie beneath its icy surface. Control of these resources, as well as the ability to secure vital shipping lanes, has made the region a strategic hotspot. The thawing of Arctic waters has also made it easier for military forces to maneuver through previously inaccessible areas, making it imperative for armed forces to be prepared for operations in these harsh conditions. The region’s remoteness and environmental challenges mean that conventional military tactics and equipment must be adapted to operate in extreme cold, high-altitude, and unpredictable weather conditions. These factors emphasize the necessity for specialized training and the development of interoperable forces that can respond to any crisis or conflict in this sensitive region. The U.S. Army’s Arctic Forge 25 exercise serves as a critical training ground for U.S. forces to refine their cold-weather capabilities. Over 330 soldiers from the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division and 10th Mountain Division will join approximately 500 Finnish personnel and 40 Canadian troops to enhance their interoperability and survival skills in freezing conditions. The multinational exercise focuses on command and control of a combined battalion while honing cold-weather survival techniques essential for Arctic operations. The 10th Mountain Division is a specialized U.S. Army unit renowned for its expertise in cold-weather and mountain warfare. Trained to operate in extreme conditions, the division is equipped with specialized gear and undergoes rigorous training in winter survival, cross-country skiing, and mountaineering. Its soldiers are capable of performing combat operations in harsh environments, from snow-covered mountains to high-altitude terrains. With a legacy dating back to World War II, the division has proven its adaptability in diverse regions, including Afghanistan, and remains a vital asset for both cold-weather and mountainous combat, often participating in joint multinational exercises to enhance interoperability in such conditions. The exercise is not just about survival, however. It also plays a vital role in NATO’s defense posture, particularly in the High North. 'Operating in the high-north allows NATO forces to train our warfighting tasks to be prepared to respond in conflict or crisis,' said Gen. Christopher Donahue, Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The training helps ensure that NATO forces can operate together seamlessly, reinforcing the Alliance’s defense commitments made during the 2024 NATO summit in Washington, D.C. More than 110 U.S. Army soldiers from the 41st Field Artillery Brigade will also participate, deploying from Grafenwoehr, Germany, to Bardufoss, Norway. This segment of the exercise will showcase U.S. forces' ability to deliver long-range precision fires in Arctic conditions, a critical capability in defending the region’s strategic interests. The U.S. Army’s participation in Arctic Forge 25 and its ongoing focus on Arctic readiness underscore the U.S. military’s commitment to safeguarding national interests in the region. By developing the necessary operational capabilities, the U.S. is positioning itself to respond to any potential threats in a region increasingly seen as vital to global stability. In addition to military preparedness, the Arctic region is also a significant focus of U.S. foreign policy, and recent decisions by former President Donald Trump, following his return to office in 2025, underscore this growing emphasis. The Arctic’s strategic importance has only intensified under his leadership, and his administration’s actions reflect a broader strategy aimed at securing U.S. influence in the region. One of Trump’s first actions was to focus on enhancing the U.S. military presence in the Arctic, particularly as tensions with Russia and China continue to rise. His administration has also revived previous plans, such as the proposal to expand U.S. military operations in the Arctic, which is seen as crucial to maintaining control over emerging shipping routes and securing valuable resources. Trump’s broader defense policies have continued to center on national security and military strength, with a particular focus on ensuring that the U.S. maintains superiority in contested regions like the Arctic. His moves also involve pushing back against growing foreign influence in the region, especially from Russia and China, who have expanded their military and economic activities in the Arctic in recent years. Furthermore, Trump’s emphasis on military readiness is aligned with his broader vision of strengthening U.S. defense capabilities worldwide, making the Arctic a strategic focal point of his second term. Additionally, Trump has pursued a more isolationist and America-first approach to foreign policy, as evidenced by his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and his skepticism towards multilateral environmental initiatives. Despite facing legal challenges from environmental groups and states like California, Trump remains committed to his vision of promoting energy independence, which includes continued exploration of Arctic oil and gas reserves. Trump’s recent actions also include a continuation of his aggressive stance on China, with new measures aimed at limiting Chinese access to critical infrastructure and strengthening U.S. national security against technological influence from Beijing. This is in line with his previous policies and represents a broader strategy of reinforcing U.S. power in critical regions such as the Arctic. In sum, the Arctic region remains a critical area of interest for global armed forces, and with the continued influence of leaders like Trump, it is likely to see increased military and geopolitical attention. The U.S. Army’s exercises, such as Arctic Forge 25, and the broader strategic shifts under Trump’s presidency, reflect the growing significance of this region as a cornerstone of U.S. defense and foreign policy. As military activities in the Arctic intensify, both NATO forces and Arctic nations will continue to adapt and prepare for a future shaped by global competition and environmental changes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-army-deploys-11th-airborne-and-10th-mountain-divisions-to-arctic-to-secure-strategic-interests	2025-02-06T01:27:41-08:00	
Singapore Navy Relies on MARSEC USVs to Ensure Surveillance of Strait	The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) officially began autonomous deployments of its Maritime Security Unmanned Surface Vessels (MARSEC USVs) in January 2025.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) modernization program is in its final phase, Re-Horizon 3, approved in January 2024 with an estimated cost of $34 billion over ten years. The 2025 budget allocates $4.353 billion to defense, a 6.4% increase from 2024. Of this amount, $850 million is designated for military modernization. However, only $595 million is guaranteed, while $680 million remains under unprogrammed appropriations, requiring excess revenue before release. This reliance on standby funds marks a shift from previous years when guaranteed funding exceeded unprogrammed allocations. The executive branch initially proposed $850 million for the AFP modernization program in 2025, but Congress realigned $255 million to unprogrammed appropriations. This contrasts with past budgets under the Duterte administration, where guaranteed funds ranged from $425 million to $493 million, and unprogrammed portions did not exceed $187 million. In 2024, none of the $170 million in unprogrammed funds for military modernization had been released as of September. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro raised concerns in legislative hearings, while senators highlighted risks of delays in priority acquisitions. The AFP modernization program initially focused on internal security but has shifted toward external defense, particularly in response to maritime territorial disputes. The Philippine Army’s procurement plans prioritize land-based missile systems, anti-aircraft weapons, and additional armored vehicles. The 2025 budget includes $3.475 billion for land, air, and naval forces, with $850 million allocated for modernization programs. The Philippine Coast Guard, involved in patrols and resupply missions in the South China Sea, will see a 6% budget increase to $534 million. Despite budget increases, reliance on unprogrammed appropriations affects acquisition timelines. Budget adjustments have already impacted several projects, including cyber systems, forward support equipment, and tactical combat vehicles. The AFP modernization program has expanded since 2018, with total funding increasing from $510 million to $1.275 billion by 2025. However, the share of unprogrammed funds has also risen from $85 million in 2018 to $680 million in 2025. The Philippine Army continues to evaluate procurement options for additional self-propelled howitzers, multiple-launch rocket systems, and advanced air defense systems, with future acquisitions dependent on budget availability and revenue conditions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/philippine-army-could-purchase-additional-155mm-self-propelled-howitzers-in-2025	2025-02-04T03:53:22-08:00

Flash News: US Trump administration proposes $1 billion arms sale to Israel including bombs and bulldozers	According to information published by American Newspaper 'The Wall Street Journal', on February 3, 2024, the Trump administration has informally notified U.S. Congress of a proposed new arms sale to Israel valued at approximately $1 billion. The sale includes a variety of munitions and heavy equipment, specifically: 4,500 BLU-110 precision-guided bombs, 200 Mk 83 1,000-pound bombs, and Caterpillar D9 bulldozers, with the munitions valued at $700 million and the bulldozers at $300 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Aviation Ordnanceman 2nd Class Marilyn Marquez conducts an inventory of pallets containing MK 83/BLU-110 general-purpose bombs in the hangar bay of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) during an ammunition cross-deck operation with the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71). (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The BLU-110 bomb is a 225 kg (500-pound), precision-guided munition designed to penetrate hardened targets, making it highly effective against structures such as bunkers, command centers, and other fortified military assets. The BLU-110 is part of a broader family of bombs developed for precision strike capabilities, meaning that it can be launched from various aircraft and guided to its target with remarkable accuracy. This bomb uses GPS and inertial guidance systems, ensuring that even in contested environments with jamming or countermeasures, it can still strike its intended target with minimal deviation. The ability to target specific, high-value assets without causing widespread collateral damage is particularly crucial in modern military operations where minimizing civilian casualties is a priority. The Mk 83 bomb, on the other hand, is a much larger, 450 kg (1,000-pound) general-purpose bomb used by the U.S. and Israeli Air Forces for a wider range of tactical missions. Although it is less specialized than the BLU-110, the Mk 83 is designed to be a versatile weapon that can be used against larger or less fortified targets, such as military airfields, supply depots, and vehicle convoys. It is a free-fall bomb that can be equipped with precision-guided fuzes, allowing for accuracy when dropped from high altitudes or at stand-off distances. This bomb’s larger size and payload make it effective for clearing large areas or neutralizing more substantial enemy infrastructure. Both the BLU-110 and Mk 83 bombs are integral to Israel's airstrike capabilities, enhancing its ability to conduct operations against a range of targets with great precision. The BLU-110s, with their smaller size and advanced guidance systems, are particularly useful for surgical strikes in urban environments or against hardened military targets. In contrast, the Mk 83s, with their larger payload, are better suited for larger-scale attacks, such as demolishing military facilities, aircraft hangars, or supply lines. Together, these two types of bombs will greatly expand the Israeli Air Force's operational flexibility, allowing it to respond effectively to a variety of combat scenarios, from targeted strikes against militant leaders to large-scale raids on enemy infrastructure. The Caterpillar D9 bulldozers included in the sale are heavy-duty vehicles that have been adapted for military use by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for a range of engineering tasks. These bulldozers are often used in combat zones to clear obstacles, demolish enemy fortifications, and even construct defensive positions. The D9 has become an iconic piece of military equipment for Israel, particularly in urban warfare or areas with significant defensive structures, such as tunnels used by militant groups in Gaza. These machines are heavily armored to withstand small-arms fire and explosive blasts, allowing them to perform under direct fire without being easily neutralized. They play a critical role in ensuring that Israeli forces can maneuver freely, clear pathways, and neutralize enemy positions in both urban and rural settings. This proposed arms sale is part of broader strategic objectives shared by both nations, particularly in the context of growing regional tensions. Israel faces an increasingly volatile security environment, particularly due to Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East. The U.S. sees Israel as a key partner in countering Iran's destabilizing activities, which include supporting various militant groups across the region. The weapons offered in this sale will provide Israel with additional resources to bolster its defense and maintain its military superiority, which is critical in an area where Israel faces threats from multiple fronts. In addition to countering the influence of Iran, Israel's reliance on precision strikes has made weapons like the BLU-110 and Mk 83 bombs essential in its counterterrorism and defense efforts. These weapons are particularly effective in minimizing collateral damage while targeting military infrastructure, weapons caches, and underground bunkers. As Israel continues its efforts to address asymmetrical threats posed by hostile groups, the ability to strike with accuracy is crucial for its defense strategy. The inclusion of Caterpillar D9 bulldozers in this sale also emphasizes Israel’s need for heavy equipment in modern warfare. These bulldozers are often used in clearing obstacles, constructing defensive barriers, and demolishing enemy fortifications, making them indispensable in urban warfare and operations in areas with entrenched military positions. The D9 bulldozer has been used by the IDF in past operations, particularly in Gaza, where it played a significant role in clearing tunnels used by militants and other combat engineering tasks. While the arms sale has been notified to Congress, it has not yet been finalized. Congress has a 30-day period in which it can raise objections to the sale. However, given the long-standing and strategic relationship between the U.S. and Israel, such objections are unlikely to delay the sale significantly. Past arms sales between the two nations have generally faced little resistance, although some members of Congress may raise concerns about the humanitarian implications of providing advanced weaponry, particularly in the context of ongoing conflicts in the region.

Belgium could end a decade without tanks by entering into the European MGCS program	The Arizona agreement, finalized on February 2, 2025, outlines Belgium’s revised defense policy under the newly elected government led by Prime Minister Bart De Wever. While minor modifications may be made, the agreement discusses Belgium's potential participation in the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), a Franco-German initiative to develop a next-generation main battle tank (MBT) system. This decision aligns with Belgium's broader defense modernization efforts, which involve increased military spending and engagement in European military projects. It also indicates Belgium's renewed interest in acquiring tanks following the retirement of its last Leopard 1s in 2014.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Belgium's potential participation in the MGCS program would require investments in personnel, maintenance infrastructure, and training, as the country retired its last Leopard 1 main battle tanks in 2014. (Picture source: Rheinmetall) In the early post-World War II period, the Belgian Army operated various tanks, beginning with American M4 Sherman models post-World War II, including the M4A1(76)W HVSS, alongside British models. In the early 1950s, Belgium acquired M46 Patton tanks from the United States, which remained in service until the late 1960s. Between 1968 and 1971, Belgium procured 334 Leopard 1 tanks from Germany, distributing them among eight tank regiments and the Armour School. In the 1980s, 132 units were modernized to the Leopard 1A5(BE) standard, incorporating an improved fire control system and thermal imaging. The end of the Cold War led to reductions in the tank fleet, with 128 Leopard 1s sold to Brazil and the remainder retired in 2014. At that time, Belgium focused on mobility, flexibility, and rapid deployability for its armed forces, reducing costs. Consequently, Belgium acquired 242 Piranha IIIC 8×8 vehicles between 2008 and 2015, including 18 Piranha IIC DF90 fire support vehicles armed with a 90mm gun. However, the DF90’s inability to fire planned anti-tank rounds limited its role to infantry support with high-explosive ammunition. Additionally, 32 Piranha IIC DF30 vehicles were scheduled for retrofit with two Spike-MR anti-tank guided missiles each. As a result, by 2023, the Belgian Army lacked main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and air defense systems, operating a fleet primarily composed of wheeled vehicles, including 38 Pandur II reconnaissance vehicles. The withdrawal of heavy armor reduced Belgium’s armored capabilities significantly. During the Cold War, Belgium operated various types of armored vehicles, including German Jagdpanzer Kanone tank destroyers, American M113 and M75 armored personnel carriers, French AMX-13 VTT variants, and British Scorpion and Scimitar CVRTs. Belgium's forces in Germany were scaled down over time, with three brigades under British control in 1946 growing to a force of 150,000 personnel by 1952. By 1970, the Belgian presence was reduced to a single corps with two divisions, and by the end of the Cold War in 1990, it had declined to under 25,000 personnel. In recent years, Belgium has sought to rebuild its army, identifying the absence of heavy armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and air defense systems as capability gaps. The country joined the French Scorpion program in 2017, ordering 60 EBRC Jaguar reconnaissance vehicles and 382 VBMR Griffon armored personnel carriers. Belgium also ordered 19 CAESAR II self-propelled howitzers, with delivery expected between 2026 and 2030. Developed by a consortium comprising France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, the MGCS will not be a single tank but a 'system of systems' integrating crewed and uncrewed vehicles. (Picture source: Hensoldt) From an industrial standpoint, Belgium's potential entry into MGCS coincides with its defense firms’ expanding role in European defense projects. John Cockerill Defense is in the process of acquiring France’s Arquus to strengthen its position in the medium-armored vehicle sector. Meanwhile, FN Herstal has agreements for ammunition production, including a trilateral initiative with France and the Netherlands. Both companies are also involved in the MARTE program, a European research initiative for future MBT technologies. MARTE, which includes 47 European partners, is expected to support the MGCS by advancing armor protection, automated targeting, and firepower capabilities. The MGCS project, launched in 2017, is designed to replace the German Leopard 2 and French Leclerc tanks with a more advanced combat system by 2040. Developed by KNDS, a consortium comprising France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, alongside Rheinmetall, the MGCS will not be a single tank but a 'system of systems' integrating crewed and uncrewed vehicles. Its development focuses on modularity, better firepower, enhanced protection, and AI-driven battlefield management. However, France and Germany have disagreed on key technical aspects, such as gun caliber, with France advocating for a 140mm system and Germany supporting a 130mm alternative. Industrial competition has contributed to delays, but both governments remain committed to advancing the program as a critical component of European armored forces. As MGCS progresses, discussions about potential new partners, including Italy and Spain, have emerged. While France and Germany remain the primary stakeholders, expanding participation could introduce additional expertise and funding. However, integrating new members requires industrial and political negotiations, as France and Germany have historically maintained control over their defense projects. Therefore, Belgium's potential participation in the MGCS program would require investments in personnel, maintenance infrastructure, and training, alongside negotiations on technology transfer and industrial benefits. For the Belgian Army, joining the MGCS could indicate a long-term commitment to restoring armored capabilities and strengthening its role in European defense. The new Belgian government has also committed to investments in long-range firepower, including multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), which could align with MGCS participation. Options under consideration include the French FLP-T program, the American M142 HIMARS, and the Euro-PULS system from Elbit Systems and KNDS Deutschland. The focus on long-range strike capabilities is part of Belgium’s broader effort to enhance indirect fire and deep-strike capabilities. Alongside the MGCS, Belgium is engaged as an observer in the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) and is considering involvement in the Next Generation Rotary Capacity initiative to develop a replacement for the medium multi-role helicopters currently in service with European armies, such as the AW-101.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/belgium-could-end-a-decade-without-tanks-by-entering-into-the-european-mgcs-program	2025-02-04T01:40:28-08:00	
Saudi Arabia Increases its Military Budget and Reinforces its Leadership in Middle East	Saudi Arabia has announced an increase in its defense budget for 2025, raising military expenditures to $78 billion from $75.8 billion in 2024. This allocation accounts for 21% of the country's public spending and 7.1% of its gross domestic product, according to Ahmad Al-Ohali, Governor of the General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI). The increase follows a consistent growth trend, with an annual average rise of 4.5% since 1960. Saudi Arabia is now among the five largest military budgets globally and remains the leading defense spender in the Arab world.

This medium-range missile system complements existing capabilities such as the Patriot and THAAD systems, enhancing national air defense. In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense approved the sale of 220 AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder tactical missiles to Saudi Arabia, valued at $252 million. The agreement includes technical support and training programs to enhance the capabilities of the Royal Saudi Air Force. Additionally, in December 2024, the Spanish shipbuilder Navantia signed a contract with the Saudi Ministry of Defense to build three AVANTE 2200 corvettes for the Royal Saudi Navy. The final vessel is scheduled for delivery by 2028. The project includes crew training and integrated logistical support, with construction expected to generate around four million work hours and create up to 2,000 jobs in Spain. Saudi Arabia has also shown interest in acquiring Rafale F4 fighter aircraft from Dassault Aviation. After encountering difficulties in purchasing 48 Eurofighter Typhoon jets due to a German veto, the country submitted a request for a proposal in October 2023 for 54 Rafale F4 aircraft, marking a possible shift in its procurement strategy. These initiatives align with the broader goals of Vision 2030, which seeks to enhance domestic military production and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. At the World Defense Show 2024 in Riyadh, Ahmad Al-Ohali announced that the localization rate for Saudi Arabia’s defense industry had reached 19.35% by the end of 2023, up from 4% in 2018. This reflects ongoing efforts to develop a self-sufficient defense sector. To support these ambitions, GAMI launched the 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' platform in October 2023, aimed at attracting foreign investment and providing insights into opportunities within the Saudi defense market. In a recent statement, Ahmad Al-Ohali highlighted 74 identified opportunities in the country’s military supply chains, with 30 prioritized projects accounting for approximately 80% of future procurement expenditures. Saudi Arabia continues to position itself as a key player in the global defense industry while advancing its strategic objective of reducing reliance on foreign defense suppliers. The expansion of its military sector remains a central element of its broader economic and geopolitical transformation.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/saudi-arabia-increases-its-military-budget-and-reinforces-its-leadership-in-middle-east	2025-02-04T01:15:46-08:00	
Colombia Signs New Defense Contract with Israel for Kfir Aircraft	In contrast to previous statements by Colombian President Gustavo Petro regarding the suspension of defense and security relations with Israel, the Colombian government has finally concluded a new contract with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) for the maintenance of its Kfir fighter aircraft fleet. Infodefensa reported This on February 3, 2025.

The goal is to ensure the effective integration of the SM-6 missiles within the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), particularly on its Aegis-equipped destroyers, which are a key component of the country's air and missile defense strategy. The SM-6, developed by Raytheon, is a multi-role missile capable of intercepting terminal-phase ballistic missiles, aircraft, and cruise missiles. Its X-band active radar seeker, derived from the AMRAAM, enables beyond-line-of-sight targeting through the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) sensor network. Already in service with the U.S. Navy and allied forces, the SM-6 is expected to bolster Japan’s air defense network, particularly against emerging hypersonic missile threats from regional adversaries such as China and North Korea. The SM-6 is powered by a dual-pulse rocket motor, incorporating an SM-3 booster and an SM-2 airframe, allowing it to reach speeds exceeding Mach 3 and a range of approximately 370 km. Its advanced guidance system integrates inertial navigation, midcourse updates via Link 16, and an active radar seeker for terminal engagement, ensuring high precision against various aerial and naval targets. Beyond its defensive role, the SM-6 has also demonstrated the capability to engage surface targets, enhancing Japan’s maritime strike potential. Looking ahead, the SM-6 Block 1B variant, expected by 2027, will feature an upgraded propulsion system to extend its range and strike capabilities. By incorporating the SM-6 into its defense systems, Japan will significantly enhance its ability to counter airborne and missile threats at greater distances, providing an added layer of protection for its fleet and critical infrastructure. The missile’s ability to engage ballistic missiles in their terminal phase strengthens Japan’s missile shield, complementing existing systems such as the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) and the Patriot PAC-3. Furthermore, the SM-6’s capability to engage enemy surface vessels at extended ranges introduces a new dimension to Japan’s naval strategy, reinforcing deterrence in contested waters, particularly in the East China Sea. The integration of this system will provide Japan with greater operational flexibility in responding to evolving threats while improving coordination with U.S. and allied forces in the region. The integration of SM-6 Block I missiles into Japan’s fleet represents a significant enhancement of its defensive capabilities, particularly in countering evolving missile and aerial threats. This acquisition aligns with broader U.S.-Japan defense cooperation, aiming to reinforce deterrence amid regional tensions. Additionally, it is expected to improve interoperability between JMSDF units and U.S. Navy forces operating in the Indo-Pacific, contributing to a more coordinated regional security framework. The primary contractor for this sale will be RTX Corporation, with manufacturing facilities located in Camden, Arkansas. At this stage, no offset agreements have been announced, though such arrangements may be discussed in future negotiations. Furthermore, the transaction will not require additional deployment of U.S. military personnel to Japan, allowing for seamless integration without affecting allied force presence in the region. According to the U.S. Department of State, the sale will not alter the fundamental military balance in the Indo-Pacific and will not impact the operational readiness of U.S. forces. However, it reflects Japan’s continued investment in strengthening its defense posture amid increasing regional missile capabilities. The procurement of SM-6 Block I missiles is part of Japan’s broader effort to adapt to emerging security challenges and maintain stability in the Asia-Pacific region.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/japan-invests-in-us-sm-6-missiles-to-enhance-its-defense-against-missile-and-enemy-aircraft-attacks	2025-02-03T07:51:32-08:00	
Flash News: Netherlands to Deliver New Batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in 2025	On January 31, 2025, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed that the Netherlands will deliver another batch of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine this year. The announcement followed a meeting in The Hague with Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans, during which both officials discussed strengthening Ukraine’s air capabilities and ongoing training programs for Ukrainian pilots and technicians.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An F-16 fighter jet from the Dutch Air Force, part of NATO’s ongoing support to Ukraine, performs a demonstration flight. This multi-role aircraft, with upgraded avionics and weapons systems, plays a key role in bolstering Ukraine’s air defense capabilities against Russian invasion. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Netherlands has been a key supporter in Ukraine’s efforts to bolster its air defense, having already delivered U.S.-made F-16s, with the first jets arriving in August 2024. These aircraft, F-16A/B Block 20 MLU (Mid-Life Update) models, have significantly improved Ukraine’s ability to counter Russian air threats, particularly missile and drone attacks. The Block 20 MLU variant features upgraded radar systems, avionics, and weapons compatibility, making them capable of performing advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. The supply of F-16s to Ukraine is part of a broader coalition effort by NATO allies. The initial pledge to provide 42 F-16 Fighting Falcons was made public on August 20, 2023, with deliveries planned to begin in 2024. Since then, additional commitments from NATO members, including the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Belgium, have increased the total number of pledged F-16s to approximately 65 aircraft. Some of these jets have been retained in the Netherlands to support pilot training programs. Training is taking place at Volkel Air Base, where Ukrainian pilots, engineers, and technicians receive hands-on experience with the aircraft. These programs are expected to continue throughout 2025, ensuring that Ukrainian personnel are fully prepared to operate and maintain the fighter jets. In addition to the aircraft, the Netherlands has pledged significant financial and logistical support to ensure the operational readiness of Ukraine’s F-16 fleet.

These investments aim to ensure that Ukraine’s newly acquired fighter jets are fully equipped and maintained for both offensive and defensive missions. The addition of more F-16s is vital for Ukraine as it continues to face Russian air superiority. The Ukrainian Air Force has been operating older Soviet-era aircraft, which struggle to compete with modern Russian fighters and advanced air defense systems. The F-16s will provide a major boost to Ukraine’s air combat capabilities, allowing them to intercept Russian aircraft, destroy cruise missiles, and better defend strategic infrastructure from aerial threats. Moreover, the integration of F-16s into Ukraine’s Air Force aligns with its long-term goal of NATO interoperability. The ongoing training and technical support from European allies are accelerating Ukraine’s transition to Western-standard military aviation, ensuring that its pilots and engineers can operate and maintain the jets effectively for years to come. The F-16A/B Block 20 MLU is an upgraded version of the original F-16A/B models, incorporating modernized avionics, a more powerful AN/APG-66(V)2 radar system, and improved weapons compatibility. These modifications allow the aircraft to use advanced AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles and precision-guided munitions, significantly increasing their combat effectiveness. The MLU program also improves cockpit displays, navigation systems, and electronic warfare capabilities, ensuring the aircraft remain competitive against newer-generation fighters. Additionally, the Block 20 MLU variant benefits from structural reinforcements and updated flight control software, extending the operational lifespan of the jets. This makes them well-suited for Ukraine’s needs, as they provide a cost-effective yet highly capable multi-role fighter that can perform air superiority missions, ground attack operations, and reconnaissance. With these enhancements, the F-16A/B Block 20 MLU remains a formidable asset in modern aerial warfare, providing Ukraine with a crucial tool to counter Russian threats in the ongoing conflict. This new delivery of F-16s represents a critical phase in Ukraine’s defense strategy and underscores NATO’s continued commitment to supporting Kyiv in its fight against Russian aggression. With additional aircraft, advanced weaponry, and extensive training programs, Ukraine’s air defense forces are set to significantly enhance their effectiveness on the battlefield in 2025.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-netherlands-to-deliver-new-batch-of-f-16-fighter-jets-to-ukraine-in-2025	2025-02-03T07:30:16-08:00	
Baykar Sets Up Strategic Drone Maintenance Hub in Morocco Expanding African Reach	Turkish drone manufacturer Baykar has established a subsidiary in Morocco to set up a maintenance facility for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) it has sold to Rabat, according to Middle East Eye. The subsidiary, named 'Atlas Defence,' was officially registered with the Moroccan Trade Registry on December 5, 2024. According to an announcement published in Morocco’s Official Gazette No. 5857 on January 29, 2025, the Rabat-based company has a capital of 2.5 million dirhams ($680,000). Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In April 2021, Morocco ordered 13 Bayraktar TB2 drones for $70 million, receiving the first batch in September along with support infrastructure and a drone operations center (Picture source: Baykar) This initiative is part of Baykar’s broader strategy to expand its international operations, particularly in the African UAV market. By establishing this facility, the company aims to enhance its support capabilities for regional customers. Additionally, the investment is expected to contribute to Turkish-Moroccan diplomatic and economic relations by creating jobs and supporting the local economy. While military equipment sales generally involve government-to-government agreements, having an industrial presence in a partner country can further strengthen bilateral cooperation. Morocco has already been a major Baykar client, having procured Bayraktar TB2 drones. In April 2021, the country placed an order for 13 units, valued at approximately $70 million, with the first batch delivered in September of that year. The contract also included four ground stations, a configurable simulation system, a digital tracking infrastructure, and a drone operations center at Moroccan airbases. Moroccan military personnel underwent training in Turkey to operate these drones, with the first group completing their program in September 2021. Since then, Morocco has shown increased interest in Turkish defense equipment, exploring the possibility of acquiring Bayraktar Akıncı drones, a more advanced platform with a greater payload capacity and enhanced mission capabilities. Baykar’s establishment in Morocco is part of a broader trend of military cooperation between the two nations. Turkey has emerged as a key player in the armed drone sector, attracting multiple international clients. Morocco, on its side, is seeking to strengthen its defense autonomy and modernize its armed forces. The maintenance facility for Bayraktar TB2 drones, and potentially Akıncı drones in the future, would enable Morocco to optimize its fleet’s operational readiness. Despite uncertainties regarding the extent of local production, Baykar’s investment aligns with its strategy of expanding into emerging markets. The company has already begun constructing a factory in Ukraine, which is expected to produce up to 120 drones annually, and has also set up an assembly line in Saudi Arabia. While the Moroccan facility is comparatively smaller, it underscores Baykar’s intention to establish a lasting presence in Africa. As part of its efforts to develop a domestic defense industry, Morocco has also partnered with Israeli firm BlueBird Aero Systems to build a drone factory. However, this project, initiated in April 2024, has faced delays due to ongoing conflicts in Gaza. The collaboration between Morocco, Turkey, and Israel in defense and technology reflects a broader objective of modernizing Morocco’s armed forces and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Although Baykar’s new Moroccan subsidiary is not a full-scale production facility, it represents a step toward strengthening strategic ties between Rabat and Ankara while enhancing Turkey’s industrial presence in Africa.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/baykar-sets-up-strategic-drone-maintenance-hub-in-morocco-expanding-african-reach	2025-02-03T07:22:09-08:00

Lockheed Martin Strengthens US-UK Nuclear Deterrence Until 2084 with Trident II D5LE2	Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $383 million contract by the U.S. Navy to develop a modernized version of the Trident II nuclear ballistic missile, designated Trident II D5 Life Extension 2 (D5LE2). This program aims to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the strategic deterrence system deployed aboard ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) through 2084. The missile remains a key component of the deterrence posture of both the United States and the United Kingdom, which cooperate in this field under the Polaris Sales Agreement. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The D5LE2 modernization seeks to extend its operational lifespan while maintaining performance in response to evolving threats (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The Trident II D5 is currently in service on U.S. Ohio-class and British Vanguard-class submarines. Designed and developed by Lockheed Martin, this submarine-launched ballistic missile has a range exceeding 12,000 km and is capable of carrying multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Until now, Trident II missiles have been equipped with W76 and W88 nuclear warheads, but their service life, exceeding 25 years, has raised concerns regarding reliability and safety. The D5LE2 modernization seeks to extend their operational lifespan while maintaining performance in response to evolving threats. The upgrade includes improvements to the missile’s guidance and propulsion systems. With its three-stage solid-fuel propulsion, the Trident II D5 achieves rapid acceleration and a trajectory designed to evade interception. Its inertial guidance system, enhanced with electronic upgrades, contributes to increased accuracy. The Trident II has also been considered for conventional applications under the Prompt Global Strike program, which aimed to provide the United States with a rapid, non-nuclear strike capability. This initiative sought to equip certain Trident missiles with modified reentry vehicles featuring GPS navigation and trajectory correction systems, enabling an impact precision of approximately ten meters. However, the proposal generated significant international debate, with concerns that such a launch could be mistaken for a nuclear attack, potentially triggering an unintended response. The program was ultimately discontinued, but in 2018, the U.S. administration approved the production of the W76-2, a low-yield warhead specifically designed for Trident missiles. Its deployment was officially confirmed in 2020, with initial operational integration aboard USS Tennessee. To support the production and integration of D5LE2 components, Lockheed Martin has initiated the construction of a new production facility in Titusville, Florida. Covering approximately 21,000 square meters, the site will expand the company's presence on the Space Coast, a key aerospace industry hub. Scheduled to be operational by 2027, the facility is expected to create approximately 300 high-skilled jobs. Florida state authorities, represented by Secretary of Commerce J. Alex Kelly, have emphasized the economic significance of this investment in strengthening the region’s defense and aerospace industries. This contract is part of a broader effort to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In October 2024, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded Lockheed Martin Space a $2.1 billion contract for the production and sustainment of Trident II D5 missiles, as well as the development of new W93 nuclear warheads and their Mk7 reentry vehicles. These warheads, currently under development at Los Alamos National Laboratory, mark the first new U.S. nuclear weapons production initiative in 40 years. These programs reflect the ongoing commitment of the United States and the United Kingdom to maintaining technological and strategic capabilities in nuclear deterrence. Lockheed Martin, which this year marks 70 years of collaboration with the U.S. Navy under the Fleet Ballistic Missiles program, continues to play a central role in the evolution of strategic missile systems. With the Trident II D5LE2, both nations are ensuring the continued credibility and effectiveness of their deterrence posture in the decades ahead.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/lockheed-martin-strengthens-us-uk-nuclear-deterrence-until-2084-with-trident-ii-d5le2	2025-02-03T06:06:06-08:00

Malaysia awaits final US approval to complete the purchase of 30 F/A-18 Hornet fighters from Kuwait	As reported by Astro Awani on February 1, 2025, the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) is expected to finalize the acquisition of 30 used F/A-18C/D Hornet fighter jets from the Kuwaiti Air Force (KAF) in 2025. The deal has been under negotiation for several years and is now in its final stages, requiring only documentation and approvals from Kuwait and the United States. This purchase is intended to maintain Malaysia’s air defense capabilities while awaiting the implementation of its Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) program, projected to commence in the 15th Malaysia Plan around 2040.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F/A-18C is a single-seat variant, while the F/A-18D is a two-seat version configurable for training or as an all-weather strike aircraft with a Weapons and Sensors Officer operating targeting systems. (Picture source: US DoD) Malaysia’s interest in acquiring the Kuwaiti Hornets dates back to at least 2017, when the country first explored options to supplement its fighter fleet. The Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) currently operates eight two-seat F/A-18D Hornets, acquired in 1997, under the 18th Squadron at Butterworth Air Base. Over the years, these aircraft have undergone upgrades to avionics, communications, and weapons systems, including the integration of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and the Link 16 datalink. The MRCA program, originally intended to modernize Malaysia’s air combat capabilities, has faced delays, making the interim acquisition of the Kuwaiti Hornets a temporary solution. Kuwait operates 39 F/A-18C/D Hornets, delivered between 1992 and 1993, as part of its air force modernization following the Gulf War. The country is transitioning to newer aircraft, including the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter Typhoon, leading to the decision to sell its older Hornet fleet. Malaysia officially expressed interest in these aircraft during a visit by Defence Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin to Kuwait in October 2024. During the visit, Khaled inspected the aircraft and held discussions with Kuwaiti officials, resulting in the establishment of a joint committee to expedite the negotiation process. The sale remains contingent on approval from the United States, as the aircraft are American-made. One of the primary reasons for Malaysia’s acquisition is the need to address capability gaps in its air force while awaiting the MRCA program. The RMAF has faced maintenance and operational challenges, particularly with its Sukhoi Su-30MKM fleet, which has been affected by serviceability issues due to logistical constraints. Expanding the Hornet fleet is seen as a way to sustain operational capability without further delays. The relatively low flight hours and well-maintained condition of the Kuwaiti Hornets make them a viable option for extending Malaysia’s fighter fleet while offering an opportunity to standardize maintenance and operations. The acquisition has encountered challenges, including the requirement for approval from the United States, which has also considered the Kuwaiti Hornets for its Marine Corps. Tunisia has reportedly expressed interest in purchasing the same aircraft, creating potential competition. The process of securing U.S. authorization has caused delays, though Malaysian officials anticipate a resolution. Another challenge is the logistical and maintenance burden associated with operating an aging fleet. While Malaysia’s existing Hornets have been upgraded, the Kuwaiti models belong to an earlier production block, which may lead to compatibility issues with spare parts and software integration. Expanding the fleet with older aircraft may also impact operational budgets and maintenance capacity. The F/A-18C and F/A-18D Hornet are twin-engine, carrier-capable multirole fighter aircraft developed in 1987 as part of a block upgrade of the original F/A-18 Hornet, which was initially designed in the 1970s. The upgrade incorporated enhanced radar, avionics, and expanded weapons compatibility, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM, AGM-84E SLAM, and AGM-65F Maverick missiles. The F/A-18C is a single-seat variant, while the F/A-18D is a two-seat version configurable for training or as an all-weather strike aircraft with a Weapons and Sensors Officer operating targeting systems. The aircraft includes the Martin-Baker NACES ejection seat, a self-protection jammer, and a synthetic aperture radar for ground mapping in low-visibility conditions. Models delivered since 1989 feature improved night attack capabilities with the Hughes AN/AAR-50 thermal navigation pod, AN/AAS-38A NITE Hawk FLIR targeting pod, night vision compatibility, and upgraded multi-function displays. Some F/A-18D aircraft are configured for reconnaissance with the ATARS electro-optical sensor package. The aircraft are powered by two F404-GE-402 enhanced performance engines, increasing static thrust by 10%. Since 1993, they have included a laser designator/ranger for self-marking and targeting. Production ended in 2000, with the last F/A-18C delivered to Finland and the final F/A-18D to the U.S. Marine Corps. The U.S. Navy retired its F/A-18C/D fleet in 2019, but the U.S. Marine Corps continues to operate and upgrade its aircraft, integrating the APG-79(V)4 AESA radar system.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/malaysia-awaits-final-us-approval-to-complete-the-purchase-of-30-f-a-18-hornet-fighters-from-kuwait	2025-02-03T03:51:55-08:00	
France Turns to Its Automotive Industry for Military Drone Production	Amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising tensions in Europe, France is seeking to adapt its defense industry to meet new battlefield requirements. Traditionally characterized by slow production cycles focused on high-performance equipment, the sector now faces the challenge of increasing both speed and volume. To address this, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) is exploring new solutions by turning to the civilian industry, particularly the automotive sector, for the manufacturing of so-called 'kamikaze' drones similar to those used in Ukraine, according to a report by L'Opinion on February 2, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Colibri is a loitering munition drone specially adapted for short-range missions (Picture source: Army Recognition) These long-range remotely operated munitions (MTO), capable of striking targets over 100 kilometers away, could be produced by a yet undisclosed French industrial company. No firm orders have been placed at this stage, but the stated objective is clear: to deliver several thousand of these drones within a few months. This initiative marks a shift in France’s defense production model, which for decades has prioritized high-tech equipment, designed through lengthy and meticulous processes, rather than rapid large-scale manufacturing. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the limitations of this approach, exposing the difficulties of adapting to the demands of high-intensity conflict. 'This was not a criterion for us for decades,' acknowledges Emmanuel Chiva, the General Delegate for Armaments, emphasizing the need for a structural change. In response, the DGA is expanding its scope and looking to leverage expertise from other industries such as chemicals, energy, and even the agri-food sector, all accustomed to high-volume production. This shift is not entirely new. During World War I, Michelin produced aircraft while Renault manufactured tanks. Today, despite a relative state of peace, France faces growing strategic challenges, yet its defense industry still operates under a model favoring technological excellence over production speed and scale. The Rafale fighter jet, submarines, and the nuclear deterrent exemplify this approach, where emphasis has historically been placed on high performance, often at the cost of extended production timelines and significant expenses. However, modern conflicts require greater responsiveness, and this model is struggling to meet those needs. In June 2022, President Emmanuel Macron called for a transition to a 'war economy', a shift that has yet to be fully realized. Some notable progress has been made. Nexter, for example, has increased its production of 155mm shells sixtyfold since 2022, while Dassault Aviation is gradually reaching a production rate of three Rafale jets per month, compared to just one a decade ago. MBDA, meanwhile, is reducing the production time of the Aster air defense missile from 42 to 18 months by 2026. Despite these improvements, these lead times remain lengthy in the context of high-intensity warfare, where the rapid replenishment of equipment is crucial. Aware of this challenge, Emmanuel Chiva has suggested new approaches, including the development of *'low-cost'* surface-to-air missile designs to accelerate their production. This initiative aims to foster innovation among defense manufacturers and the 4,500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that form the backbone of the defense sector. The goal is to move away from a purely stock-based approach, where equipment ordered in batches reaches obsolescence simultaneously, toward a continuous supply system better suited to operational needs. The integration of the automotive industry into drone production aligns with this broader effort to adapt to evolving strategic conditions. By leveraging the civilian sector’s expertise in rapid and large-scale manufacturing, the DGA aims to meet the growing demand for military equipment.

Philippines Plans Acquisition of Fast Attack Interdiction Craft with Missiles to Strengthen Maritime Defense	The Philippine Navy is advancing with its project to acquire Fast Attack Interdiction Crafts with Missiles (FAIC-M) as part of Phase 2 of the Re-Horizon 3 modernization program under the Revised Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program (RAFPMP). The project outlines the acquisition of 10 new fast attack interdiction crafts equipped with missile systems to enhance the country’s defense and security capabilities in its littoral zones, particularly in the sensitive tri-border areas with Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as in the South China Sea, including the Kalayaan Island Group. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Philippine Navy is advancing with its project to acquire Fast Attack Interdiction Crafts with Missiles. (Picture source: Philippines Navy) This initiative follows the Philippine Navy’s ongoing efforts to modernize its fleet, which includes the retirement of the Tomas Batilo-class fast attack crafts, a South Korean version of the Chamsuri-class, which have been out of active service since 2021. The acquisition of these new boats, designed to strengthen the Navy’s effectiveness in rapid interdiction and defense operations, aligns with the broader goals of the modernization program. The new FAIC-M boats are expected to be equipped with advanced systems, including the Rafael Typhoon Mk.30C remote-controlled weapon station armed with a 30mm Mk.44 Bushmaster II autocannon, and the Typhoon MLS-NLOS missile launcher, capable of launching short-range surface-to-surface Spike-NLOS missiles. The acquisition plan, signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2024, allocates a total budget of 16 billion pesos for the procurement of the 10 new boats, an increase from the 10 billion pesos allocated in 2020 for the initial acquisition of nine boats. This budget increase accounts for inflation, as well as the cost of local construction of the boats at the Philippine Navy’s Naval Shipyard in Cavite, in addition to the increased number of missile systems and spare parts required. Phase 2 of the project is also expected to include the acquisition of weapons, ammunition, and potentially system integration, with separate contracts likely to be signed for the boats, weapons systems, and ammunition. Despite the approval of the funding plan, the project was not included in the programmed funding for 2025 under the AFP Modernization Program due to budget cuts. However, there is potential for financing through the Unprogrammed Fund, contingent on additional financial support from the national government. Alternatively, the Philippine Navy may use its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) funding for FY2025, which requires only an initial 10% commitment to initiate the project.

This expansion aligns with Belgium’s objective of reaching NATO’s 2% GDP defense spending benchmark by 2029 while maintaining interoperability with allied air forces. Increasing the number of F-35s would strengthen Belgium’s role in NATO air defense missions. Belgium is modernizing its ground forces within the CaMo program, focusing on improvements in firepower, logistics, and operational mobility. The army plans to introduce new platforms to enhance deep-strike capabilities, integrating multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS). Stockpiles of essential military equipment will be expanded, and an additional brigade for NATO operations is under consideration. The initiative prioritizes advanced technologies and cooperation with European allies to develop next-generation combat capabilities. Given Belgium’s plans to procure more American fighter jets and its efforts to stimulate the domestic defense industry by prioritizing local manufacturing and technology development, the possibility of Belgium opting for American MLRS systems remains significant. This is particularly relevant given that a Trump election victory could lead to increased purchases of American equipment, alongside indications tied to both the Belgian defense industry and Belgium’s previous international exercises. Thales Belgium has indicated that the US-made M270 MLRS can be configured to fire its 70mm rockets in a 9x6 array, which may align with Belgium’s interest in a system capable of launching both guided and unguided munitions. Given Belgium’s procurement strategy and industrial policies, selecting a modular MLRS with NATO-standardized ammunition would align with strategic objectives. The M270 MLRS, widely used by NATO allies, supports interoperability and the use of GMLRS, ER-GMLRS, and Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) for long-range engagements. An alternative under consideration is the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), a wheeled variant offering greater mobility compared to the tracked M270. HIMARS can launch the same range of guided munitions but is designed for rapid deployment and integration with mechanized and airborne units. Several European countries, including Poland and Romania, have already acquired HIMARS, underscoring its growing role in NATO’s artillery capabilities. Belgium’s potential procurement of either system would mark a significant step toward reinforcing its deep-strike capabilities, aligning with NATO’s push for increased long-range fire support among member states. Furthermore, the Belgian Air Force played a key role in the first-ever A400M HIRAIN (HIMARS Rapid Infiltration) mission in July 2024, when an M142 system was deployed by Belgium’s 20th Squadron Tactical Airlift, 15th Wing, during the Winter Shield exercise with U.S. and Latvian forces. Beyond air and ground force modernization, Belgium is allocating resources to naval expansion, unmanned systems, and cyber defense. The navy is set to acquire a third frigate and additional mine countermeasure vessels to support NATO maritime security operations. Investments in autonomous and remotely operated systems aim to improve underwater threat detection and neutralization. Belgium is expanding its drone fleet, integrating surveillance and combat-capable systems across multiple service branches to enhance reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, and precision-strike capabilities. Cyber warfare and electronic defense capabilities are being developed as part of Belgium’s modernization efforts. The government is strengthening cyber resilience, AI-driven defense applications, and electronic warfare tools. Military mobility investments include upgrades to transportation infrastructure, strategic landing capabilities, and specialized rail transport to support rapid deployments. Belgium is coordinating with NATO and EU partners to ensure interoperability and optimize logistical operations for allied forces in Europe.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-belgium-could-purchase-rocket-launcher-systems-to-modernize-its-artillery-capabilities	2025-02-03T01:21:10-08:00	
Flash News: US Strikes Terrorist Group in Somalia Marking First Operation of Trump Administration	On February 1, 2025, U.S. forces launched a series of airstrikes in northern Somalia, targeting members of the Islamic State's (ISIS) affiliate in the region. This operation, announced by U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, marks the first major military action in Somalia under the Trump administration's second term. It follows a pattern of increased U.S. military engagement in Africa, especially during Donald Trump’s first presidency, when the U.S. conducted extensive airstrike campaigns aimed at dismantling terrorist groups in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 1 conducts routine flight operations from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The strikes took place in the Puntland region, specifically within the Gholis mountain range, a known stronghold for ISIS in Somalia. AFRICOM confirmed that multiple ISIS operatives were killed, though it did not provide specific details about the individuals targeted. In a statement, President Donald Trump referenced the operation, noting that it was aimed at eliminating a senior ISIS planner operating in the area. This targeted action aligns with ongoing U.S. efforts to combat ISIS and other terror groups, such as Al-Shabaab, that have taken root in Somalia and the broader Horn of Africa. The military assets involved in this operation were not explicitly detailed by AFRICOM, but photos accompanying the announcement indicated that Carrier Air Wing 1, operating from the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75), played a key role. The Harry S. Truman, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier based at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, has been operating in the Red Sea and the waters surrounding Yemen and Somalia. This deployment is part of broader U.S. military efforts to combat regional instability, particularly the threat posed by the Houthi movement in Yemen. The Carrier Air Wing 1 includes several key squadrons, such as Strike Fighter Squadron 11 (VFA-11), flying the F/A-18F; Strike Fighter Squadron 143 (VFA-143) and Strike Fighter Squadron 81 (VFA-81), both flying the F/A-18E; and Electronic Attack Squadron 144 (VAQ-144), operating the EA-18G Growler for electronic warfare. Additionally, Airborne Command and Control Squadron 126 (VAW-126), flying the E-2D Hawkeye, and several other support and attack squadrons from Naval Air Station Oceana and Naval Station Norfolk were involved in the operation, enhancing the Harry S. Truman’s capability to project power in the region. The U.S. Navy’s regional presence is further bolstered by the USS Gettysburg (CG-64), a guided-missile cruiser, and multiple destroyers, including the USS Stout (DDG-55), USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109), and USS The Sullivans (DDG-68). These vessels are part of Destroyer Squadron 28, based at Naval Station Norfolk, and have been integral to the broader counterterrorism and counter-piracy missions in the region. Additionally, the Ohio-class guided-missile submarine, USS Georgia (SSGN-729), operating in the Middle East, has played a critical role in the naval presence, carrying 154 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles and special operations forces for precision strikes. This airstrike highlights the ongoing U.S. commitment to countering ISIS and other terrorist factions in Somalia, a country that has long struggled with instability. The operation in Puntland is a clear signal that the U.S. is willing to intensify its military efforts under the Trump administration to protect American and allied interests in Africa. It also underscores the strategic importance of the Horn of Africa, both in terms of counterterrorism operations and as a key maritime corridor for global trade. The involvement of the USS Harry S. Truman and its air wing in this operation suggests that U.S. forces are increasingly relying on carrier-based aviation to conduct strikes in support of counterterrorism operations, reflecting the global reach of U.S. military assets. As the region continues to grapple with the influence of terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, the U.S. will likely maintain a strong military presence in East Africa, with airstrikes and naval power playing a central role in shaping the security landscape. This operation is also a reminder of the enduring challenges the U.S. faces in countering transnational terrorism, even as other global conflicts, like the war in Ukraine, continue to dominate headlines. The results of the operation in Puntland serve as another significant chapter in the broader context of U.S. military strategy in Africa, where a mix of airstrikes, special forces operations, and partnerships with local governments remains central to the U.S. approach in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-news-us-strikes-terrorist-group-in-somalia-marking-first-operation-of-trump-administration	2025-02-03T01:18:49-08:00	
French Army Explores New Logistic Approach in Contested Zones with Airbus A400M Supply Glider Airdrop Tests	The Airbus A400M Atlas, already tested for drone airdrops, is set to explore a new logistical capability with the deployment of supply gliders. Faced with the limitations of traditional parachute drops, which require aircraft to fly directly over the landing zone and expose them to surface-to-air threats, the French Army is seeking to improve supply delivery in contested areas. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The A400M Atlas, a military transport aircraft designed for both strategic and tactical missions, serves as an ideal platform for integrating this glider (Picture source: French MoD) The concept involves a disposable glider that can be dropped at a distance and autonomously travel several dozen kilometers before reaching its target with high precision. Released from an altitude of 24,000 to 30,000 feet and more than 80 km from the landing point, this system would provide a safer and more flexible alternative for resupply in hostile environments. The project is currently the subject of a call for expressions of interest issued by the French Directorate General of Armaments’ aerospace innovation center (DGA/Techniques Aérospatiales IDEA3), with a submission deadline set for March 12. The A400M Atlas, a military transport aircraft designed for both strategic and tactical missions, serves as an ideal platform for integrating this glider. With a payload capacity of up to 35 tons, it can transport armored vehicles, helicopters, or up to 116 equipped paratroopers. Its range of 4,700 nautical miles allows it to reach distant operational theaters without refueling, while its four TP400-D6 engines, each producing 11,600 horsepower, provide high-performance capabilities. The A400M is also designed to operate from unprepared runways, a key feature for supporting forces deployed in difficult terrain. Its advanced avionics and automatic terrain-following system, a first for a transport aircraft, enable it to fly at very low altitudes and perform precise airdrops in contested environments. The supply glider must be fully autonomous, following a preprogrammed flight path after release. It must cover a distance of 70 to 80 km while carrying a payload of 700 kg, with a minimum volume of one cubic meter, expandable to 1.5 cubic meters depending on operational needs. The system must allow for serial deployment, with at least two units released simultaneously, requiring secure integration in the A400M’s cargo hold to ensure stable restraint and safe deployment. Designed as a disposable asset, it will not be recovered but must ensure the intact delivery of its cargo. Landing capability must be controlled, whether on dry or wet terrain, with a vertical impact speed below 9 m/s to preserve the payload’s condition and facilitate its rapid recovery by ground forces. This project represents a significant development in military airborne logistics, providing an alternative to traditional parachute drops while reducing transport aircraft exposure to hostile threats. By enabling a more flexible and secure resupply method, it could meet the needs of forces operating in contested environments, particularly when ground access is obstructed. The integration of such a system within the French Army would enhance operational resilience and responsiveness while optimizing air assets for logistical missions. Similar systems already exist, notably in the United States, where the Silent Arrow GD-2000, an autonomous and disposable supply glider, is designed for deployment from C-130 or CH-47 aircraft. The JPADS (Joint Precision Airdrop System), a GPS-guided parachute, is also used for precision supply drops. However, the French glider would distinguish itself by its integration with the A400M, enabling serial airdrops and optimized material delivery over longer distances. By leveraging the glider’s autonomous flight capability and the A400M’s high-altitude drop capacity, the French Army could benefit from an innovative solution that significantly enhances airborne logistical operations. If successfully developed, this project could transform resupply capabilities by offering a reliable and autonomous method for delivering cargo to difficult or conflict-affected areas. This technology could also pave the way for future innovations in military transport and logistics, with potential applications in humanitarian missions, such as delivering medical supplies or essential resources in crisis situations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/french-army-explores-new-logistic-approach-in-contested-zones-with-airbus-a400m-supply-glider-airdrop-tests	2025-02-03T00:54:32-08:00
