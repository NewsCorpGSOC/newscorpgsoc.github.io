This capability is supported by advanced sensors and fuzing mechanisms that detect the optimal moment to engage the target. Additionally, the TOW 2B's dual warhead design improves its effectiveness against reactive armor, providing superior penetration and lethality compared to earlier models. This makes the TOW 2B particularly valuable in countering modern tanks and armored vehicles, which increasingly incorporate sophisticated armor protection systems. 'The TOW anti-tank missilee system remains combat-proven, and these latest enhancements ensure it continues to excel in complex engagements, particularly in anti-tank operations,' said Tom Laliberty, President of Land and Air Defense Systems at Raytheon. The TOW missile has seen extensive service since its inception, with over 700,000 systems delivered to U.S. and international forces. It has been a critical asset in various conflicts, being deployed in combat more than 11,000 times since 2003. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Defense has provided Ukraine with approximately 13,000 TOW missiles to assist in its defense efforts amid ongoing conflict with Russia. One of TOW’s strengths is its compatibility with multiple platforms, including manned and unmanned vehicles. It can be integrated into the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), the Stryker anti-tank guided missile vehicle, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and various other light armored vehicles, making it a versatile tool for different combat scenarios. Raytheon's ongoing modernization of the TOW missile system positions it to meet future defense challenges. The updates also include improvements in the missile's design and packaging, ensuring that it complies with modern military environmental standards and is more resilient to varied terrain and logistical demands. The continued investment in TOW fortifies the U.S. Army and Marine Corps and addresses the needs of international allies, many of whom rely on the system for deterrence and defense. The TOW missile will be produced and assembled in Raytheon’s facilities in Tucson, Arizona. The company is poised to meet the global demand for this highly effective anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system. As land forces worldwide face increasingly sophisticated armored threats, the TOW system remains a vital asset in securing battlefield superiority. Raytheon’s $676 million contract to continue producing the TOW weapon system underlines the importance of this combat-proven anti-tank missile in modern warfare. With ongoing enhancements and a flexible platform integration capability, the TOW system ensures that U.S. and allied forces are equipped with one of the most advanced anti-armor weapons available.

Three NATO Countries Commit to Lithuania in Air Defense Rotation Agreement	The Lithuanian Ministry of Defense has confirmed that starting next year, three NATO allies will send their air defense systems as part of a rotational deployment. Details, shared by Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas on Žinių Radijas radio, indicate that these rotations aim to ensure a nearly continuous presence of NATO’s air defense capabilities in the Baltic states. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kasčiūnas confirmed that the Netherlands would be among the participating countries, though he did not specify the others (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) Kasčiūnas confirmed that the Netherlands would be among the participating countries, though he did not specify the others. When asked about potential Swedish involvement—particularly relevant as Lithuania strengthens military ties with Sweden through the acquisition of CV90 infantry fighting vehicles—the minister stated he could not confirm this possibility at this time. Germany, with its advanced Patriot systems and strong commitment to regional security, is a likely participant, as are the United States, which also has significant air defense capabilities. Poland, neighboring Lithuania, possesses modern Patriot systems and could be another key actor in these rotations. Additionally, France, equipped with SAMP/T systems, and potentially Sweden, now a NATO member and strengthening military links with Lithuania, are also plausible candidates. The rotational air defense initiative, approved by NATO last year, aims to bolster security in the Baltic Sea region by addressing rising security challenges. This rotation model seeks to offset the lack of permanent air defense systems in the Baltic states by maintaining a steady presence of allied forces, providing enhanced protection against potential threats. The Netherlands has previously deployed its long-range Patriot system at Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania this summer as part of the BALTCON24 exercise. This deployment marked a significant step toward closer cooperation between the two nations. Kasčiūnas also mentioned the possibility of a regular Patriot deployment from the Netherlands for exercises in Lithuania, underscoring the strategic value of this partnership. Alongside NATO's rotational deployments, Lithuania is actively strengthening its own air defense. Two agreements signed in October 2024 with European manufacturers reflect this commitment. The first, signed with Saab Dynamics on October 1, secures additional short-range air defense systems, RBS 70 NG, based on portable missiles, for approximately €130 million. These systems offer increased mobility and responsiveness against low-altitude aerial threats. The second agreement, concluded with Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace, involves the acquisition of the NASAMS medium-range system, valued at around €234 million. Originally scheduled for 2030, this acquisition was advanced by seven years through additional funding, allowing for early deployment of these essential capabilities. NASAMS will enhance the air defense of Lithuanian armed forces, providing improved coverage against mid-range aerial threats. These initiatives align with Lithuania’s defense strategy to reduce reliance on allied capabilities for air defense and reinforce collective security in the region. NATO's decision to take responsibility for the Baltic Sea region’s rotational air defense, in collaboration with member states, further demonstrates the Alliance’s commitment to safeguarding the Baltic countries against potential threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/three-nato-countries-commit-to-lithuania-in-air-defense-rotation-agreement	2024-10-25T02:26:06-07:00

South Korea reveals supersonic air-to-surface missile to strengthen fighter jets exports	On October 24, 2024, at the Sacheon Air Show, the South Korean Agency for Defense Development (ADD) unveiled a supersonic air-to-surface missile for the first time. This unveiling comes amidst concerns over delays in weapons integration, which have affected the export competitiveness of domestic fighter jets such as the FA-50 and the KF-21. However, the new missile offers promising export potential and may help strengthen the position of Korean defense exports in international markets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles. (Picture source: YouTube/슈퍼소닉TV) The supersonic air-to-surface missile is designed to be mounted on aircraft and can strike key ground targets with precision from long range. Similar to missiles like the Cheonryong developed by LIG Nex1 and Germany’s Taurus, this missile performs the same fundamental task. However, unlike subsonic air-to-surface missiles that fly at speeds of 700–1,100 km/h, the newly unveiled missile reaches supersonic speeds of Mach 2.5, or around 3,000 km/h, making it much harder to detect and intercept. With a range of 300 km, the missile can hit its target in just about five minutes after launch, significantly reducing the reaction time for enemy defenses. The missile is also expected to incorporate stealth technology, making it less detectable by enemy radar. One of the key features enabling such high speeds is the ducted ramjet engine. This innovative propulsion system combines the advantages of jet and rocket engines, using atmospheric oxygen instead of carrying an onboard oxidizer. This design not only simplifies the structure but also allows for longer burn times and faster speeds compared to traditional jet engines. Another notable characteristic of this missile is its modular design, which enables it to perform multiple functions. By simply swapping modules, the missile can be configured to engage either ground targets or enemy ships. The missile’s seeker, equipped with both radar and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) systems, further enhances its ability to accurately strike targets in various weather conditions and amidst electronic countermeasures. Although the missile displayed at the air show was a test model rather than a final product, it represents a significant step forward. Weapons intended for aircraft integration typically require extensive software development and flight testing, which incurs substantial costs. To address this, ADD has been using test models for preliminary drop and flight tests. Flight tests of this new missile are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform.

Flight tests are scheduled to begin in 2025, with the FA-50 light combat aircraft serving as the test platform. Key defense contractors such as Hanwha Aerospace and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) are participating in the missile's development. Once integrated with the FA-50, the supersonic air-to-surface missile will offer an unparalleled capability within its class, significantly boosting the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jet. In contrast, rival jets like the F-16V and JAS-39E Gripen currently only operate subsonic air-to-surface missiles. While France’s Rafale can carry supersonic air-to-surface missiles, these are equipped with nuclear warheads, making them unsuitable for export. As a result, the supersonic missile will be an exclusive asset for the FA-50 and KF-21. Countries that have already purchased the FA-50, such as Poland, are expected to express interest in this missile as well. For instance, the South Korean Air Force (ROKAF) first deployed the FA-50 in 2014, assigning 20 units to an Air Force wing. ROKAF ordered a total of 60 FA-50s, and in 2014, the aircraft successfully conducted a test firing of an AGM-65 Maverick missile. Indonesia signed a contract in 2011 for 16 T-50i aircraft, a variant of the FA-50 with light attack capabilities, followed by additional orders in 2021. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute to the export competitiveness of both the FA-50 and the KF-21 fighter jets. (Picture source: Twitter/KalisGo) Iraq also signed a contract for 24 FA-50IQ variants in 2013, receiving the first batch in 2017, though operational challenges delayed their deployment until 2022. The Philippine Air Force procured 12 FA-50PH units in 2014, and since 2017, these aircraft have been used in various combat operations, including airstrikes against terrorist positions. Additional orders are being considered as part of the PAF's Flight Plan 2028. Several other countries have purchased or shown interest in the FA-50. Thailand ordered a total of 12 T-50TH units, with deliveries starting in 2018. Poland is acquiring 48 FA-50 aircraft to replace its aging MiG-29 and Su-22 fleets, with deliveries beginning in 2023. Malaysia finalized a contract for 18 FA-50 Block 20 aircraft in 2023, with the possibility of future orders. Other nations expressing interest or considering the FA-50 include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Botswana, Brunei, Colombia, Croatia, Egypt, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, Spain, Slovakia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Vietnam. Some of these countries have explored options for joint production, while others are considering the FA-50 for advanced tactical and training purposes. Given its multi-purpose capabilities and potential for cost-effective production, the supersonic air-to-surface missile is anticipated to contribute not only to the enhancement of military power but also to the growth of defense exports. By adding a simple rocket booster, the missile could even be adapted for use from ships or ground-based missile launch trucks, similar to Taiwan’s Hsiung Feng III supersonic missile, thus replacing older subsonic anti-ship missiles.

US Marines Integrate Moving Stock Aiming System to Enhance Rifle Accuracy Against Drones	The U.S. Marines are exploring an automated targeting system for standard infantry rifles, aimed at improving every soldier’s capacity to defend against the rising threat of drones on the battlefield. The ZeroMark Fire Control System (FCS) innovation incorporates an automatic adjustment mechanism to fine-tune the aiming point, optimizing precision against unmanned aerial threats. Currently undergoing tests with the 3rd Marine Division in Hawaii, this equipment marks a significant advancement for accurately targeting moving threats, which are often challenging to counter through traditional methods. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. Marine fires a ZeroMark Fire Control System attached to an M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle during a live-fire demonstration on Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Oct. 23, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) Developed by New York-based startup ZeroMark, founded in 2022, the ZeroMark FCS has received investment from prominent backers, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Ground Up Ventures, and benefits from $7 million in funding for research and development. The system relies on sophisticated machine vision technology, with electro-optical cameras and LiDAR sensors to detect and track targets in real time. The system’s distinct feature lies in its motorized buttstock, which adjusts the rifle’s angle to optimize shooting accuracy, allowing the shooter to target drones more effectively. Unlike existing assisted-aiming systems like the SMASH 2000 series from Israeli firm Smart Shooter, ZeroMark’s FCS uses advanced vision algorithms to steer the weapon’s barrel, even making slight angular adjustments to maximize shot alignment. ZeroMark’s technology, described as a 'fire control system,' includes a small computer and motorized stock. CEO Joel Anderson explains that this motorized stock creates a virtual pivot between the shoulder and rifle, allowing small degree adjustments to refine shot trajectory and compensate for both drone and shooter movement, as well as variations caused by noise or torque. Installation on any rifle takes just 30 seconds, potentially making drone defense a manageable task for the average soldier. Anderson states that the system 'makes hitting a small drone at 200 yards as easy as hitting an 18-meter-diameter circle,' making such skills accessible to a broader range of soldiers. A former U.S. Navy member and the first security director of MongoDB, Anderson says he drew inspiration for ZeroMark after driving a Tesla with autopilot and wondering why similar technology wasn’t available to soldiers. Seeing a growing need for anti-drone solutions, he presented the prototype to a16z partners, who encouraged him to launch the startup in 2022. ZeroMark’s development is focused solely on countering offensive drones. While acknowledging that the concept of a weapon 'that never misses' may be controversial, Anderson clarifies that the company avoids marketing its systems to law enforcement, stating: 'I don’t believe the world is ready for that, nor am I. I don’t want to see AI-enabled weapons in police hands.' To mitigate potential misuse, the company has incorporated remote management, license-based activation, and fleet management features to ensure responsible use. FCS units are already in use by private security firms to protect assets like boats against potential drone threats related to piracy. ZeroMark is in talks to send its devices to Ukraine and is engaging in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense for testing and evaluation that could lead to larger orders. Beyond self-targeting capabilities, Anderson envisions ZeroMark software being applied in other contexts, such as cameras capable of identifying drone types, origin, or payload. In the long term, he envisions integrating the system into head-up displays or auditory interfaces to deliver real-time critical information to soldiers. Anderson sums up his vision: 'Large systems like aircraft carriers don’t win wars. They help project power but don’t capture Husseins, don’t kill Bin Ladens, don’t bring hostages home; soldiers do... and I want them to be as untouchable as an F-22 in the sky.'	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-marines-integrate-moving-stock-aiming-system-to-enhance-rifle-accuracy-against-drones	2024-10-25T00:50:07-07:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Qatar’s Mirage 2000-5 aircraft, consisting of nine single-seaters and three two-seaters, were originally delivered in 1997. These aircraft have been maintained in a way that allows for substantial remaining operational life. They took part in NATO’s Odyssey Dawn operation over Libya in 2011, enforcing a no-fly zone. Despite Qatar's decision to retire these aircraft, they remain in good condition. Qatar's modernization program includes acquiring more advanced multirole aircraft like the Boeing F-15QA and Eurofighter Typhoon, reducing the country’s dependence on the Mirage 2000s. Price remains a significant sticking point in the negotiations. Qatar is asking for ₹4,160,000,000 (approximately $49,920,000) per aircraft, while the IAF is seeking a price closer to ₹3,000,000,000 (approximately $36,000,000) per aircraft, which would include spare engines and additional MICA air-to-air missiles. Some within the IAF support delaying the purchase to focus on developing the domestically produced Tejas MkII fighter, which offers a projected service life of 40 years and could potentially lower operational costs. However, the Tejas MkII is still under development, and the gap it would leave in the IAF's fighter capability may require interim solutions such as the Mirage 2000-5. The decision on whether to proceed with the procurement of the Qatari Mirage 2000s will depend on the IAF's analysis of cost-effectiveness, operational compatibility, and long-term strategic objectives. Negotiations continue, with both sides working to reach an agreement that addresses India's fighter jet needs within its budget constraints. If the deal with Qatar is finalized, the IAF's Mirage 2000 fleet would increase to 60 aircraft.

(Picture source: French Air Force) In the early 1980s, India sought to counter Pakistan's acquisition of F-16 fighters by acquiring a comparable aircraft. After reviewing available options, India chose the Mirage 2000 based on its design and performance. In 1982, an order for 36 Mirage 2000H and four Mirage 2000TH aircraft was placed with Dassault, and deliveries occurred between 1985 and 1994. The Mirage 2000 became an integral part of the IAF’s fleet. Although India initially considered domestic production of the Mirage 2000, this plan was set aside in favor of continuing defense cooperation with the Soviet Union, resulting in the acquisition of the MiG-29. In 2011, India approved an upgrade of its Mirage 2000 fleet to the Mirage 2000-5 Mk.2 standard, adding improvements to avionics, radar, electronic warfare systems, and the integration of MICA missiles. The Mirage 2000 was used during the 1999 Kargil War as part of Operation Safed Sagar, flying over 500 sorties for airstrikes. It was also deployed during the 2001–02 India-Pakistan standoff, where it used precision-guided bombs against Pakistani bunkers. In 2019, 12 Mirage 2000s were used in an airstrike on an alleged terrorist camp in Balakot, marking the first time since 1971 that IAF fighters entered Pakistani airspace. During the 2020 China-India standoff, Mirage 2000Is were deployed along the Line of Actual Control after the Galwan Valley skirmish. In 2021, India purchased retired Mirage 2000 airframes from France for parts to maintain its fleet, with the deal valued at ₹3,000,000,000 (approximately $36,000,000). This was intended to maintain the operational readiness of the IAF’s Mirage squadrons by securing spare parts. The Mirage 2000 is a single-seat multirole fighter, measuring 14.36 meters in length, 9.13 meters in wingspan, and 5.2 meters in height.

The missile's pinpoint accuracy, reportedly within five meters, gives Hezbollah a tactical advantage in hitting strategic and critical infrastructure targets with high precision. According to the Iranian Press Agency, Hezbollah launched these missiles in response to air strikes on Lebanese territory in recent days. The Qader-2 missiles were part of a broader missile barrage that included Nasr 1 missiles, aimed at the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Iran has been a critical supporter of Hezbollah, providing the group with financial, military, and logistical backing for decades. This support includes the supply of advanced weaponry, such as the Qader and other ballistic missiles, which significantly enhance Hezbollah’s military capabilities. Iran's Revolutionary Guard plays a pivotal role in training Hezbollah fighters and aiding in the development of their missile programs, including the construction of underground launch sites. This relationship allows Hezbollah to maintain a robust arsenal and operational infrastructure, enabling it to challenge Israeli forces and carry out sophisticated attacks. Iran’s support of Hezbollah is part of its broader strategy to exert influence in the region and confront Israel indirectly through proxy forces. What makes this attack particularly concerning is the method of deployment. The Qader-2 missiles were fired from underground silos, demonstrating Hezbollah's increasing reliance on concealed and hardened launch sites. This tactic complicates efforts to detect and intercept such missiles, making it more difficult for Israel's missile defense systems to neutralize before launch. The use of underground missile sites underscores Hezbollah's capability to strike while minimizing exposure to counterstrikes. The Qader-2 missile represents a significant leap in Hezbollah's military technology, enhanced to meet the group’s specific operational needs. With an increased range, accuracy, and destructive power, these missiles enable Hezbollah to carry out more precise attacks on Israeli territory, including heavily fortified areas. This latest round of missile strikes marks a new chapter in the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, intensifying regional tensions as both sides continue to escalate their military actions. As Hezbollah deploys more advanced weaponry like the Qader-2 from underground silos, the threat to Israeli cities and infrastructure grows, raising the stakes in the ongoing confrontation. The key threat to Israel from Hezbollah's missile attacks lies in the advanced technology and tactics the group employs. Missiles like the Qader-2, with an extended range of up to 300 kilometers and precision targeting within five meters, can strike deep into Israeli territory, including densely populated cities and critical infrastructure. Hezbollah's use of underground silos for launching these missiles makes detection and pre-emptive strikes difficult, reducing Israel's ability to neutralize threats before launch. Despite Israel's sophisticated air defense systems, such as Iron Dome and David’s Sling, the sheer volume of missile barrages combined with Hezbollah's ability to conceal launch sites strains these defenses, increasing the likelihood of successful strikes and further complicating Israel’s military response.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-hezbollah-launches-qader-2-missiles-from-underground-silos-targeting-israel	2024-10-24T02:18:21-07:00

US confirms 3000 North Korean soldiers moved to Russia for military training	On October 23, 2024, during a press conference, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the deployment of these 3,000 North Korean soldiers to eastern Russia. According to reports, these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan region in North Korea to Vladivostok, a major port in eastern Russia. They were then transferred to various military training centers in eastern Russia, where they are currently undergoing intensive training. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning (Picture source: KNCA) The final destination of these North Korean soldiers remains uncertain, but the likelihood of them joining Russian forces on the Ukrainian front is considered highly probable and concerning. Fears of these troops engaging in combat alongside Russian forces have heightened concerns about further escalation in the war in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin echoed this concern, stating that this development would be a 'serious step' after North Korea had already supplied arms to Russia. The exact nature of the North Korean soldiers' mission, who are currently in training, remains unclear. This situation arises as Russia seeks to bolster its military capabilities in a conflict that has become protracted. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, the war has escalated, causing significant casualties on both sides, while remaining largely focused on the eastern front of Ukraine. The potential arrival of North Korean soldiers could mark a significant shift in this war of attrition. The U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation and has briefed Ukrainian authorities as well as international partners. Kirby added that should these North Korean soldiers enter combat, they would become 'legitimate targets' for the Ukrainian forces. The deployment of North Korean soldiers to Russia is seen by many observers as a sign of weakness on the part of the Kremlin. The decision to turn to Pyongyang, a largely isolated state on the international stage, reflects the difficult position in which Moscow finds itself after more than two years of conflict. Relying on North Korean human resources further highlights Russia’s growing dependence on marginal alliances, even as its losses on the battlefield continue to mount. The South Korean government, for its part, has expressed concern about the potential military technology Russia might offer North Korea in exchange for this military support. Some experts suggest that Moscow could provide advanced military technologies to Pyongyang, particularly in the areas of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which would significantly enhance the threat posed by North Korea to the Korean Peninsula and East Asia. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service has also indicated that this deployment could involve up to 10,000 North Korean soldiers by the end of the year. Despite denials from both Moscow and Pyongyang regarding troop deployments or arms transfers, the international community, especially NATO, views this growing military alliance between Russia and North Korea as a major concern. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been invited to Brussels to share intelligence on these developments with NATO.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-confirms-3000-north-korean-soldiers-moved-to-russia-for-military-training	2024-10-24T01:10:49-07:00

A helicopter was also utilized in the exercise to deliver materials onto the ship, showcasing the vessel’s air replenishment capability.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link China Type 093A comprehensive supply ship Kekexilihu. (Picture source: Chinese MoD) The Type 903A supply ships are integral to the PLA Navy’s logistics, designed to support naval operations through extensive replenishment functions. The Kekexilihu is equipped to deliver a wide array of supplies, including fuel and essential materials, while also facilitating helicopter operations. Replenishment operations Replenishment at sea (RAS) plays a crucial role in modern naval warfare by enabling fleets to remain operational far from their home bases for extended periods. This capability extends the endurance of naval forces by allowing them to resupply with fuel, ammunition, food, and other essential stores without returning to port, thus maintaining their presence in the operational area and maximizing combat effectiveness. During major naval campaigns like World War II, RAS allowed fleets, such as the U.S. Navy’s Task Force 58, to remain engaged in continuous operations, including long-range strikes against Japan, by refueling and resupplying at sea. The ability to conduct underway replenishments meant that fleets could avoid the lengthy transit times to distant bases, which would otherwise limit their operational tempo. By the end of the war, the U.S. had refined RAS to include not just fuel but also ordnance, enabling sustained high-tempo operations over vast distances​. In more recent conflicts, such as the Falklands War, the critical nature of RAS was highlighted when the British Navy operated 7,000 miles from home. The success of this operation relied heavily on the Navy’s ability to sustain its fleet through effective resupply at sea. Similarly, today’s complex naval missions—ranging from humanitarian aid to high-intensity conflict—depend on the logistical support provided by RAS to maintain forward-deployed naval forces​. Moreover, replenishment operations are not without risks. Ships involved in RAS are highly vulnerable, as their ability to maneuver is limited while they are connected for resupply. This vulnerability underscores the importance of coordination, precision, and technology, as modern RAS systems increasingly emphasize safety and reliability​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/china-supply-ship-kekexilihu-conducts-helicopter-replenishment-during-maritime-drill-in-yellow-sea	2024-10-24T00:50:54-07:00	
Leave SCAF for GCAP: Germany’s Growing Alliance with UK in Combat Drone Technology	The strategic relationship between Germany and the United Kingdom has taken on new following the announcement of the Trinity House Agreement on October 23, 2024. This defense agreement focuses on joint development efforts, particularly creating a combat drone. The collaboration between the two countries could signal a shift in Germany's defense alignment, as it also encompasses areas related to both the SCAF (Système de Combat Aérien du Futur) and GCAP (Global Combat Air Programme) projects. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance (Picture source: Leonardo ) In November 2023, rumors surfaced suggesting that Germany might abandon the SCAF program in favor of joining GCAP. Despite official denials, the Trinity House Agreement seems to bolster these claims by intensifying defense ties between Germany and the UK, including joint land-based weapons projects and drone development. The SCAF Project, also known as FCAS (Future Combat Air System), is a large-scale European initiative involving France, Germany, and Spain. It aims to develop a next-generation air combat system, expected to be operational around 2040. This program is based on a 'system of systems' approach, including three main components: the Next Generation Fighter (NGF), unmanned systems called Remote Carriers (RC), and a digital infrastructure known as the Combat Cloud. The NGF, led by Dassault Aviation, will serve as the central platform for advanced combat missions, assisted by RC drones that provide specific support capabilities. The Combat Cloud will enable integrated communication between all system elements, optimizing data management and decision-making, even in contested environments. The objective is to strengthen European technological sovereignty and ensure autonomous defense capabilities for future threats. The GCAP Project, launched in 2022, is a competing initiative led by the UK, Italy, and Japan. The goal is to develop a sixth-generation fighter that can operate alongside unmanned systems, combat drones, and advanced intelligent weapons. Unlike SCAF, which focuses on intra-European collaboration, GCAP seeks to form a broader transcontinental alliance. The project aims to replace the UK and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons and Japan's Mitsubishi F-2 by 2035. It benefits from industrial expertise provided by partners such as BAE Systems, Leonardo, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries​. While both programs aim to develop next-generation air combat capabilities, they differ in structure and ambition. SCAF focuses on enhancing European interoperability between existing platforms like the Rafale and Eurofighter, while GCAP involves broader cooperation with a focus on transnational alliances beyond Europe. However, delays in the SCAF program could lead to Germany reorienting part of its efforts toward projects that address its more immediate needs. The Trinity House Agreement, presented by the UK Ministry of Defense as a significant step for European security, underscores the growing importance of cooperation between the two largest European defense investors. In addition to enhanced joint exercises, the agreement includes provisions to protect critical underwater infrastructure and marks the first-ever temporary deployment of German P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft in Scotland, bolstering the UK's surveillance capabilities. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon (Picture source: Army Recognition) A major component of this agreement is the defense industry collaboration, including plans for a large-caliber weapons manufacturing facility in the UK and joint work on ground-based drones (UGVs). This initiative could pave the way for British participation in the Franco-German MGCS (Main Ground Combat System) project. The agreement also emphasizes the rapid development of new, more precise long-range weapons systems. Although the German Defense Ministry has been vague on this point, these projects could fall under the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, which the UK recently joined. The Trinity House Agreement also touches on air defense cooperation, with plans to integrate British and German systems to better protect European airspace from long-range missile threats. Despite the UK's current limitations in this domain, as noted in a recent report, this cooperation could enhance collective security in Europe. One of the most notable aspects of this agreement is the commitment to developing autonomous aerial drones that can operate in coordination with fighter aircraft. Although Germany had initially planned to collaborate with France on the Maritime Airborne Warfare System (MAWS) project, Berlin's decision to purchase P-8A Poseidon aircraft from Boeing ended that initiative. The agreement with the UK could signal a shift toward solutions more tailored to the specific needs of both nations. The German Ministry of Defense clarified that these drones will be developed in close cooperation with allies, particularly France, as part of SCAF's third pillar, which Germany oversees. This pillar focuses on drones and connected effectors. During the ILA Air Show in Berlin in June 2024, Airbus Defence &amp; Space unveiled a collaborative drone concept, or 'loyal wingman,' designed to accompany fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon. Although the technical details of this project remain undisclosed, it appears to align with the goals of the Trinity House Agreement. Finally, supporting Ukraine remains a central objective for both countries. This agreement reaffirms their commitment to providing Ukraine with the military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Concrete initiatives include integrating modern missile systems into the Sea King helicopters donated by Germany and closer collaboration between the UK and German defense industries to support Ukraine's war effort.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/leave-scaf-for-gcap-germanys-growing-alliance-with-uk-in-combat-drone-technology	2024-10-24T00:27:21-07:00

The SA-35MM combines the AM-35mm automatic cannon with a programmable munition system and a third-generation Jelcz 6x6 platform. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) The TUGA radar, part of the hybrid fire control system, operates on continuous wave modulation by frequency (FMCW) with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) antenna in the X-band. This radar technology uses low transmitted signal power, making it difficult to detect by enemy reconnaissance devices, thus increasing operational security. Despite its low power and compact size, the TUGA radar has a detection range from 50 meters to 50 kilometers and can detect small drones at distances up to 5 kilometers. The development of this artillery system is a collaborative effort involving Pit-Radwar, the Military University of Technology, and the defense company Mesko. The project is co-financed by Poland's National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR), as part of Competition no. 12/2022 for projects in development works for state defense and security. The Tactical and Technical Assumptions have been approved by the AU Chief, with the objective to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system. The implementation period spans from December 20, 2022, to June 20, 2025. During the congress, Pit-Radwar conducted demonstrations showcasing the system's capabilities. One test involved targeting a small unmanned aerial vehicle located 1,000 meters away, with an angular size of 0.5x2.0 milliradians. The AG-35 cannon achieved a dispersion of no more than 0.5 milliradians, closely matching the dimensions of the drone, demonstrating the system's precision. Field test results indicated that achieving a 99% probability of hitting the target with at least one projectile required firing 24 rounds of typical TP-T/FAPDS-T ammunition. In contrast, using programmable ABM ammunition, firing only seven projectiles achieved a probability of hitting at the level of 97%, with each projectile releasing over 50 subprojectiles. This represents a significant reduction in ammunition consumption while maintaining a high probability of target destruction. The objective is to deliver nine prototypes after qualification tests, integrated with the OSU-35K naval gun system, before June 20, 2025. (Picture source: Pit-Radwar) Pit-Radwar proposed integrating the 35mm cannon into self-propelled artillery systems mounted on the AS-35 wheeled chassis.

British army Intel Reports Russia's Escalation in Use of One-Way Attack Drones Against Ukraine	According to a report published by the British Ministry of Defense (MoD) Intelligence Service on September 23, 2024, Russia launched over 1,300 One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (OWA-UAVs) into Ukraine during September alone. This marks the highest number of such drone strikes in a single month since the beginning of the conflict, signaling a significant escalation in the use of these unmanned aerial systems. The British MoD warns that, based on the current rate of operations, it is almost certain that Russia will surpass this figure in October 2024, reflecting a growing trend of intensified aerial assaults against Ukrainian targets.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Debris of a Russian Shahed-136 (Geran-2) drone scattered across a Ukrainian field. (Picture source: Russian Social Network) While it remains unclear whether Russia can sustain this aggressive rate of OWA-UAV (One-Way Attack Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles ) strikes throughout the year, intelligence reports suggest that Moscow is likely expanding its capacity to produce these drones domestically. Previously reliant on Iranian-supplied UAVs, Russia is believed to be increasing its production capabilities to maintain and even amplify its ability to carry out large-scale attacks on Ukraine. This shift in supply lines is seen as part of a broader strategy to mitigate the risks of sanctions and supply chain disruptions, giving Moscow a more resilient capability to sustain its drone warfare efforts. OWA-UAVs, often colloquially referred to as 'kamikaze drones,' are primarily employed to strike critical Ukrainian infrastructure, particularly energy facilities. These drones, due to their low cost and ability to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory, have proven effective in disrupting energy supplies and damaging critical civilian infrastructure, particularly ahead of the harsh winter months. This has put enormous pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems, which are tasked with countering both conventional missile strikes and these swarming UAVs. In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, several Russian One-Way Attack (OWA) drones, or loitering munitions, have been deployed, each with specific technical features. The Shahed-136 (Russian designation: Geran-2), developed by Iran, is one of the most frequently used OWA drones. It is known for its delta-wing design, giving it a distinctive appearance. The Shahed-136 is powered by a small engine, typically the MD-550, and has a range of about 2,500 kilometers. It carries a warhead of approximately 40-50 kilograms and is designed to strike static targets such as infrastructure and supply depots. While its speed is relatively low (about 185 km/h), its main strength lies in the ability to be deployed in large numbers, making it difficult for defense systems to intercept all of them​. The Shahed-131 (Russian designation: Geran-1) is a smaller version of the Shahed-136 and shares much of the same design, though with a smaller payload and range. It has a range of about 900 kilometers and carries a warhead weighing around 10-15 kilograms. It also features a delta-wing design and is primarily used for shorter-range attacks on military targets​. Russia’s domestically produced Lancet drone, developed by ZALA Aero, features more advanced targeting capabilities compared to the Shahed drones. The Lancet is equipped with electro-optical systems for greater precision and can carry a payload of up to 3 kilograms, depending on the model. It has a range of up to 40 kilometers and a speed of about 110 km/h. It is designed for tactical strikes on specific targets such as artillery, vehicles, and air defense systems. The Lancet’s modular design allows it to be used for both surveillance and attack missions​. Each of these drones plays a crucial role in Russia’s strategy in Ukraine, especially in targeting rear positions and forcing Ukraine to expend significant resources on air defense. Despite their widespread use, many of these drones have been intercepted by Ukrainian defense systems, but their low cost and mass deployment make them a persistent threat​. The increased tempo of drone attacks is likely aimed at exhausting Ukrainian air defense resources, compelling Ukraine to divert attention from other threats, such as ballistic and cruise missile strikes. In addition, these drone assaults are part of Russia's broader strategy to weaken Ukraine’s economic resilience, particularly by targeting its energy grid. The surge in drone attacks is raising significant concerns in Kyiv and among Ukraine's Western allies. Ukrainian officials have warned that the continuous targeting of energy infrastructure could lead to widespread blackouts, severely impacting both civilian life and military operations. As winter approaches, such attacks on power stations, substations, and other critical utilities could lead to further humanitarian challenges, especially in regions already hard-hit by the war. Ukraine has requested additional Western support, particularly in the form of advanced air defense systems capable of intercepting these UAVs. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are working to adapt their tactics to counter the evolving drone threat, employing electronic warfare and anti-drone systems to mitigate the impact. As Russia escalates its OWA-UAV campaign, Ukraine faces increasing pressure on multiple fronts. The British MoD’s report highlights not only the unprecedented scale of these drone attacks but also the potential for further intensification as Russia builds up its domestic production capabilities. With winter looming and infrastructure already under strain, the coming months could prove to be a critical period in the ongoing conflict, with both sides seeking to gain the upper hand in a war of attrition.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/british-army-intel-reports-russias-escalation-in-use-of-one-way-attack-drones-against-ukraine	2024-10-23T01:58:54-07:00

UK’s first E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft receives VIII Squadron livery and NATO markings	On October 17, 2024, the Royal Air Force (RAF) marked a significant event as its first E-7 AEW&amp;C (Airborne Early Warning and Control) aircraft, built by Boeing UK, rolled out from Southend Airport. This is the first time the E-7 has been painted in RAF livery. The aircraft, designated WT001, carries the markings of VIII Squadron, which is set to operate the Wedgetail. The squadron’s badge, a sheathed Arabian dagger known as a Jambiya, reflects its long association with Arabia, a symbol approved by King George VI in 1943 to signify their role.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The VIII squadron’s badge, a sheathed Arabian dagger known as a Jambiya, reflects its long association with Arabia, a symbol approved by King George VI in 1943 to signify their role. (Picture source: British MoD) In addition to RAF roundels and markings, the aircraft bears the emblem of NATO’s Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Force (NAEW&amp;CF), linking the UK’s Wedgetail with NATO’s airborne surveillance mission. The E-7 has been selected by NATO as its next command and control aircraft, and the RAF’s Wedgetails will contribute to NATO’s Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Force. After departing Southend Airport, the Wedgetail returned to STS Aviation Services in Birmingham for additional modifications and is scheduled to undergo further testing and evaluation before entering full service in 2025. This aircraft will serve as the most advanced AEW&amp;C platform for the RAF, providing the UK with expanded airborne surveillance capabilities to improve situational awareness. Wing Commander McDonnell, Officer Commanding VIII Squadron, noted the significance of the UK’s first painted Wedgetail, highlighting that it represents a step toward achieving operational capability. The RAF’s Wedgetail fleet will operate under No. 8 Squadron and be stationed at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, alongside the nine Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Both the Wedgetail and Poseidon are based on the Boeing 737-700 increased gross weight (IGW) airframe, known for its reliability and reduced maintenance requirements. The 737 series benefits from a global supplier base and support network, which supports the long-term operation of these fleets. RAF Lossiemouth has undergone infrastructure upgrades to accommodate the Wedgetail, including a maintenance facility built by McLaughlin &amp; Harvey. This facility supports both the Wedgetail and Poseidon fleets, and at its peak employed over 175 people, with involvement from five Scottish subcontractors. The facility was officially opened in September 2024 and is expected to support the AEW&amp;C fleet for at least 20 years. The first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. (Picture source: Boeing) The UK’s decision to acquire the E-7 began in October 2018, when the British government entered discussions with Boeing to replace its aging E-3D Sentry fleet. These discussions also involved potential cooperation with Australia, which already operated the Wedgetail. The decision to proceed without a competitive tender process led to some criticism, including concerns over favoritism toward Boeing. Saab, a competitor, expressed opposition, stating it could offer its Erieye system on an Airbus A330 MRTT platform. Despite this, in March 2019, the UK finalized a $1.98 billion deal (approximately $2.33 billion in 2023) to purchase five Wedgetail AEW1 aircraft. In December 2020, reports indicated that the UK might reduce its Wedgetail order from five to three aircraft. This reduction was confirmed in the 2021 Integrated Defence Review, raising concerns that only one aircraft might be available for operational tasking at a time. However, in February 2023, Air Chief Marshal Michael Wigston suggested the order might eventually increase to five aircraft depending on future requirements. Initially, Marshall Aerospace was selected to carry out airframe modifications, but the company withdrew in May 2020. Boeing then contracted STS Aviation Group’s UK branch to complete the modifications in Birmingham, where more than 100 specialists are converting two commercial airliners, with the remaining aircraft being newly built. Each conversion takes around 24 months, and the first British Wedgetail successfully completed its maiden flight on September 20, 2024. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered by 2026. Sharing key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER, the E-7 has undergone several modifications to fulfill its AEW&amp;C role, including the addition of ventral fins to balance the radar’s weight and countermeasures mounted on the nose, wingtips, and tail. (Picture source: British MoD) The E-7 Wedgetail shares key characteristics with the Boeing 737-700ER and is intended to provide the UK with AEW&amp;C capabilities beyond those offered by ground-based systems and fighter aircraft sensors.

India quietly launches fourth nuclear missile submarine amid rising maritime focus	According to information published by Hindustan Times on October 22, 2024, India has launched its fourth nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), codenamed S4*.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the Arihant-class submarine S4*. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The launch, which occurred on October 16 at the Ship Building Centre (SBC) in Visakhapatnam, was conducted quietly amidst ongoing diplomatic tensions with Canada. The event came just a day after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Very Low Frequency Naval Station in Telangana, aimed at enhancing command and communications with the Navy's strategic assets. The S4* SSBN is an advanced model in India's Arihant-class submarines, with nearly 75% indigenous content. Equipped with K-4 nuclear ballistic missiles, the submarine significantly enhances India’s strike capability, boasting a range of 3,500 kilometers. This places it well above the earlier INS Arihant, which carries shorter-range K-15 missiles. The S4* is the last of the current class, following the earlier vessels INS Arihant, INS Arighat, and the soon-to-be-commissioned INS Aridhaman. India’s focus on strengthening its SSBN fleet underscores its strategic shift towards undersea nuclear deterrence. Given the vulnerability of surface assets like aircraft carriers to long-range missile systems, particularly those fielded by China’s PLA Navy, nuclear-powered submarines provide a critical edge. The Cabinet Committee on Security recently cleared plans to develop two more nuclear attack submarines. India’s investment in both nuclear and conventional submarine capabilities is poised to play a pivotal role in securing its interests in the Indian Ocean Region. The commissioning of the sixth Kalvari-class diesel-electric submarine, INS Vagsheer, later this year, further underscores this trend. Technical data The Arihant and Arighaat displace around 6,000 tons (5,900 long tons; 6,600 short tons) when surfaced, while the S4 and S4* displace approximately 7,000 tons (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons). These submarines also differ in length, with the Arihant and Arighaat measuring 111 meters (364 feet) long, and the S4 stretching to 130 meters (430 feet). All vessels share a beam of 11 meters (36 feet) and a draft of 15 meters (49 feet). Their propulsion system is powered by a single CLWR-B1 pressurized water reactor, delivering 83 MW to a single shaft. This system allows the submarines to reach speeds of 12–15 knots (22–28 km/h) while surfaced, and up to 24 knots (44 km/h) when submerged. The submarines have an unlimited range, restricted only by the need to replenish food supplies, and can dive to a test depth of 450 meters (1,480 feet). Each vessel typically operates with a complement of 95 personnel.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/india-quietly-launches-fourth-nuclear-missile-submarine-amid-rising-maritime-focus	2024-10-22T00:47:14-07:00	
South Korea’s KF-21 and Lockheed Martin’s F-16 shortlisted for Philippines fighter jet contract	The defense market in the Philippines is intensifying as two major competitors, South Korea's KF-21 and the American F-16 from Lockheed Martin, have been shortlisted for the Philippine government’s multirole fighter (MRF) aircraft procurement project. According to an article from The Korea Economic Daily published on October 18, 2024, the KF-21 is considered a strong contender for meeting the Philippines' needs. With an estimated budget of 400 billion Philippine pesos ($6.95 billion), this project aims to address the growing threat China poses in the South China Sea. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Only the KF-21 Boramae from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Lockheed Martin's F-16 were shortlisted, setting up a two-way competition (Picture source: KAI/US DOD) The Philippine Air Force launched this project in August, seeking to acquire around 40 multirole fighter jets. In the first phase, a budget of 61.2 billion pesos ($1.1 billion) has been allocated to purchase 10 combat aircraft. Initially, several aircraft were considered, including the Swedish Gripen, the French Rafale, and the European Eurofighter Typhoon. However, only the KF-21 Boramae from Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Lockheed Martin's F-16 were shortlisted, setting up a two-way competition. The KF-21, South Korea’s first domestically developed fighter, offers advanced technology. This 4.5-generation fighter features partial stealth capabilities, a maximum payload of 7,700 kilograms, and 10 hardpoints for air-to-air missiles and other weapons. With a top speed of 2,200 km/h and a range of 2,900 kilometers, it is equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems such as the AESA radar and is powered by a GE Aerospace F414 engine. The unit cost of the KF-21 is estimated at $71.5 million, around $36.5 million less than its European competitors like the Typhoon or Rafale. The KF-21 Boramae is a 4.5-generation multirole fighter developed by South Korea to replace older models such as the F-4 Phantom II and KF-5E/F in the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). The project began in the early 2000s and involved several feasibility studies, with international collaboration from Indonesia. The aim of the KF-21 project is to bolster South Korea’s domestic fighter production capabilities and reduce reliance on foreign military technology suppliers. The KF-21 includes several planned variants, such as Block I, Block II, and Block III, along with potential derivatives like the KF-21N (carrier-based version), KF-21EA (electronic warfare variant), and KF-21SA (export version). Block I focuses on air-to-air capabilities, while Block II aims to enhance air-to-ground missions and sensor systems. Block III (KF-21EX) is expected to incorporate more advanced stealth features and integration with unmanned systems. The design of the KF-21 emphasizes reducing its radar cross-section (RCS) and includes provisions for future upgrades, such as full stealth capabilities. The Block I version, scheduled for production between 2024 and 2028, is configured primarily for air-to-air combat with limited air-to-ground capabilities. It features semi-embedded weapons and advanced radar and sensor systems. Forty units are planned for delivery to the ROKAF, with an additional 50 for the Indonesian Air Force. The KF-21’s design includes a delta-wing configuration with canards for improved agility and maneuverability. It also provides for an internal weapons bay in later versions and uses composite materials to reduce weight and optimize performance. Key features include a glass cockpit with a large-area display (LAD) and advanced avionics, such as sensor fusion technology, which integrates data from multiple onboard and external sensors. The aircraft employs a digital Fly-By-Wire (FBW) control system, nonlinear dynamic model inversion control, and safety features such as automatic terrain following and ground collision avoidance systems. It also uses radar-absorbing materials (RAM) and radar-absorbing structures (RAS) to minimize radar visibility. KAI plans to add air-to-ground capabilities by 2028, with mass production of upgraded versions expected to follow (Picture source: KAI) In terms of performance, the KF-21 is powered by the F414-GE-400 engine, providing a thrust-to-weight ratio comparable to the Eurofighter Typhoon. The aircraft is designed for maneuverability, featuring low wing loading and advanced flight control systems to support agility and high-angle-of-attack capabilities. It has a maximum speed of Mach 1.8 and a combat radius of approximately 1,800 kilometers, depending on mission profile and loadout. The KF-21 is equipped with an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, enabling the simultaneous tracking and engagement of multiple targets. This is complemented by an infrared search and track (IRST) system and electro-optical targeting pods (EOTGP) for extended-range aircraft detection and targeting. The avionics suite includes an integrated electronic warfare system with radar warning receivers (RWR), electronic countermeasures (ECM), and countermeasure dispensing systems (CMDS), offering data fusion capabilities to enhance situational awareness and targeting. The KF-21 can carry a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder, AIM-120 AMRAAM, MBDA Meteor, and IRIS-T missiles. It is equipped with 10 external hardpoints, with plans for an internal weapons bay in future versions. Ground-attack capabilities include guided bombs, anti-ship missiles, and various domestically developed munitions, such as the Cheonryong air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Additionally, the KF-21 is armed with an M61A2 Vulcan cannon for short-range engagements. The F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles (Picture source: US DoD) On the other hand, the F-16 has proven its capabilities on the battlefield. Since its debut in 1978, over 4,500 units have been sold to 25 countries, making it one of the most widely sold fighter jets in the world. However, as a fourth-generation fighter, the F-16 lacks the stealth and advanced electronic warfare systems featured in the KF-21. Its price is estimated at $43 million per unit, making it a less expensive option compared to the South Korean fighter. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is known for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and a range of precision-guided missiles. One of its notable features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing improved detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry various air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfights. With its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X can lock onto targets from extreme angles, making it highly effective in close combat. This combination of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate both long-range and short-range engagements. The F-16 compensates for its older design with better maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures against radar-guided threats. Its agility, combined with helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to target enemies by looking at them, gives the F-16 an advantage in close combat. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable to a variety of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, its ability to engage multiple targets at different ranges and its integrated defensive measures provide a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While the Philippines have shown interest in acquiring the F-16, other factors may influence their decision. The country aims to eventually acquire the F-35, regarded as the most advanced fighter jet in operation. The Philippines may choose the F-16 as a stepping stone toward future F-35 procurement. However, the U.S. government strictly controls the sale of the F-35, and some nations, including the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, have had their requests denied. Korea Aerospace Industries is also leveraging its previous success in military aircraft exports. In 2014, KAI delivered 12 FA-50s to the Philippines and has since provided logistical and military support, including maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. Similar models have also been sold to countries such as Poland and Malaysia. KAI hopes to build on this success by offering similar services, including system and weapon upgrades for the KF-21, should the Philippines choose to purchase it. Currently, the KF-21 is limited to air-to-air combat. KAI plans to add air-to-ground capabilities by 2028, with mass production of upgraded versions expected to follow. If KAI secures the contract to supply 10 aircraft to the Philippines, it would mark the first export of the KF-21, a significant milestone for South Korea’s defense industry, which aims to become the third-largest arms exporter within the next five years. The KF-21 Boramae is a joint project between South Korea and Indonesia, aimed at developing a next-generation supersonic fighter with homegrown technology for key components. A prototype was unveiled in April 2021, and mass production is expected to begin by the end of this year, with the first delivery to the South Korean Air Force scheduled for the second half of 2026.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/south-koreas-kf-21-and-lockheed-martins-f-16-shortlisted-for-philippines-fighter-jet-contract	2024-10-22T00:24:05-07:00	
Focus | Russia’s war in Ukraine triggers Sweden’s biggest defense investment since Cold War	On October 15, 2024, the Swedish government introduced its defense strategy for 2025–2030. The plan allocates 170 billion SEK (€14.9 billion) for military defense and 35.7 billion SEK (€3.1 billion) for civil defense, aiming to raise defense spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2028. It also includes a gradual increase in conscription, targeting 10,000 conscripts annually by 2030 and up to 12,000 by 2035​.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2035, the wartime organization of the Swedish Armed Forces is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. (Picture source: Sweden MoD) Sweden’s transition from military neutrality to full NATO membership has evolved over recent years, particularly in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This shift in policy represents a significant change from Sweden’s traditional stance, which had prioritized neutrality during the Cold War. Sweden began enhancing its defense posture in 2015 and further increased support to Ukraine after the invasion. As part of its integration into NATO, Sweden has aligned its national defense strategy with collective defense obligations. This transition has involved increasing military readiness, modernizing key systems, and preparing to support NATO operations. The new plan reflects Sweden’s commitment to NATO’s collective security framework. This article examines the details of Sweden's 2025–2030 defense budget, which includes significant investment in military upgrades, expansion of personnel, and improvements across various defense sectors. The strategy aims to strengthen Sweden’s military capabilities and civil defense infrastructure. Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided approximately €4.2 billion of military aid to Ukraine across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. (Picture source: 45oabr) Since Russia’s invasion, Sweden has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, totaling 48 billion SEK (approximately €4.206.600.000) across 17 packages, including systems like Stridsvagn 122 tanks, CV90 IFVs, and Archer self-propelled howitzers. This experience underscores the importance of maintaining stockpiles and rapidly replenishing donated equipment, which explains why the new defense strategy highlights the need for logistical support in prolonged conflicts. The Swedish government has committed 75 billion SEK (€6.572.812.500) over three years (2024–2026) for military assistance to Ukraine, covering financial donations, soldier training, and procurement through the Defense Materiel Administration. Sweden’s participation in capability coalitions (focusing on drones, maritime security, and demining) further demonstrates its dedication to supporting Ukraine's defense. For Swedish authorities, the conflict also highlights the critical role of civilian defense, emphasizing societal resilience and cyber defense. To protect critical infrastructure, the new defense strategy includes the creation of a national cybersecurity center to counter Russian cyberattacks. Another lesson from Ukraine is the importance of technological adaptability in warfare. Rapid integration of new technologies and modifications to existing systems are seen as crucial. The Ukraine conflict also revealed the high resource consumption associated with intense warfare, particularly in terms of ammunition and other vital supplies. Consequently, Sweden plans to collaborate with the defense industry and government to enhance readiness for innovation, ensuring stockpiles of key materials and systems with long delivery times. Additionally, the strategy recognizes the significance of layered air defense and long-range strike capabilities. The strategy emphasizes improving intelligence, particularly in reconnaissance and surveillance, with the Swedish Air Force set to receive new reconnaissance aircraft. The value of unmanned aerial systems in Ukraine has prompted Sweden to plan for their expanded use in operations to enhance situational awareness and mobility. For instance, this has led BAE Systems Hägglunds and UAV manufacturer Airolit to join forces in integrating autonomous drone surveillance capabilities into the CV90 combat vehicle. The Swedish government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) One of the most critical aspects of Sweden’s defense strategy is the significant expansion of conscription and personnel within the Swedish Armed Forces. By 2035, the wartime organization is projected to require approximately 130,000 personnel. To achieve this, the annual intake of conscripts will gradually increase, with targets of 10,000 conscripts by 2030 and 12,000 between 2032 and 2035. This expansion highlights the government's view that conscription is essential to maintaining the Swedish Armed Forces at a level sufficient for national defense and meeting NATO commitments under Article 3. The government also plans to increase the number of conscripts trained for junior leadership roles to strengthen the chain of command and address potential leadership shortages as Sweden expands its defense capacity. Additionally, a fourth testing center will be established to manage the increased recruitment and testing of conscripts. In line with Sweden's integration into NATO, conscripts may participate in the alliance's collective defense efforts. In an Article 5 scenario, Swedish conscripts could be deployed internationally to support NATO operations. This represents a shift in Sweden’s defense approach, with conscripts expected to contribute to collective defense beyond national borders. The Swedish defense strategy further emphasizes improving the unit turnover system, ensuring operational units remain ready through refresher training exercises. The Total Defense Conscription and Testing Agency will play a key role in reaching the increased conscription targets and preparing the forces for both peacetime and wartime scenarios. Efforts to retain personnel and address current shortages are also part of the strategy. These include increasing the number of professional officers and group leaders, expanding officer training programs, and boosting civilian staffing to free military personnel for tasks requiring specific expertise. By addressing these challenges, Sweden aims to build a defense force capable of fulfilling both national and NATO obligations in the future. Priorities for the Swedish Army include modernizing the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle, acquiring additional combat vehicles and tanks such as the STRV 122 and STRV 123A, and upgrading artillery and air defense systems by 2030. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) By 2030, Sweden plans to have four fully operational brigades, with conscription increasing to 10,000 by 2030 and 12,000 by 2035. The strategy focuses on enhancing the Army's capacity to operate in larger formations, such as divisions and corps, in alignment with NATO’s requirements. New territorial units will be established to support national defense and NATO operations, working alongside the Home Guard. These territorial units, including rifle battalions, communications teams, and support units, will operate independently using equipment from upgraded field units, providing flexibility. Their development will occur between 2025 and 2035. This reorganization aims to align Sweden’s military structure with its new NATO commitments. Modernization efforts will also extend to field units, which will receive additional combat and support resources. This includes two artillery battalions, a rocket artillery unit, and battalions specializing in intelligence, engineering, air defense, and logistics. The procurement of rocket artillery and cruise missiles is a key element of the strategy, enhancing Sweden’s deterrence capabilities for national defense and NATO operations, particularly during crises. The government recognizes the need to improve the Army's readiness, noting that some equipment is nearing the end of its lifecycle. Priorities include modernizing the CV90 infantry fighting vehicle, acquiring additional combat vehicles and tanks such as the STRV 122 and STRV 123A, and upgrading artillery and air defense systems by 2030. To improve the Army's capabilities in areas such as reconnaissance, surveillance, command and control, and fire control, various types of unmanned remotely operated aerial vehicles will also be acquired. By 2030, the Swedish Air Force will retain six fighter squadrons equipped with JAS 39 aircraft, split equally between the JAS 39E variant and the older JAS 39C/D models. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) The Swedish Air Force is set to implement significant upgrades aimed at improving its integration into NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) system. A key focus will be on enhancing control over Sweden’s airspace in coordination with allied forces, with the capacity for rapid responses to potential threats. By 2030, the Air Force will retain six fighter squadrons equipped with JAS 39 aircraft, split evenly between the JAS 39E variant and the older JAS 39C/D models. The Swedish government has recognized the need to make a strategic decision by 2030 regarding the replacement of the JAS 39 fighter jet, requiring broad political consensus and thorough evaluation. Although the JAS 39 is expected to remain in service beyond 2050, the lengthy development timeline of up to 25 years for a new fighter system necessitates early planning. Consequently, the government has tasked the Armed Forces with conducting a concept study. In response, Saab has announced the development of both manned and unmanned fighter concepts, aiming to establish a sixth-generation combat air platform for Sweden's defense needs. This study will assess three potential options: developing a domestic system, collaborating internationally, or procuring a foreign system. The decision, which must be made by 2030, will consider the time needed to specify requirements, develop, and introduce a new system, with long-term financial commitments expected beyond 2035. A parliamentary reference group will be included in the study to ensure the necessary political support. Another aspect of the Air Force's development will involve upgrading airbase infrastructure. Sweden plans to disperse and mobilize air assets across five main airbases, allowing for swift responses to threats and ensuring continuous operations. These efforts include developing a network of national sensor, control, and response systems, modernizing command centers to meet NATO standards, and enhancing the ability to host allied forces. Sweden is also planning to acquire long-range strike capabilities, focusing on procuring munitions and systems to enable extended-range operations in line with NATO’s expectations for mobility and precision strikes. The supply of various ammunition types for air, maritime, and land targets is planned for the 2025–2030 period and beyond. The capability for long-range land attack will be introduced during 2025–2030 within the fighter divisions, in line with the 2020 defense decision. The integration of the S 106 Global Eye airborne early warning and control system will enhance Sweden's detection and tracking capabilities, replacing the older ASC 890, which will be transferred to Ukraine. (Picture source: Saab) Additionally, the integration of the S 106 Global Eye airborne early warning and control system will enhance threat detection and tracking, replacing the older ASC 890, which will be transferred to Ukraine. To address personnel shortages, Sweden will expand its fighter pilot training programs, including some international training opportunities. The Air Force will also replace outdated equipment, such as the Saab 105/SK 60 training aircraft with the Grob G 120 TP (SK 40), and invest in new counter-drone capabilities. The procurement of unmanned aerial systems for reconnaissance and security will be a priority in the coming years. Sweden’s transport aviation capabilities will be bolstered by replacing its six C-130H Hercules (TP 84) aircraft to ensure continued tactical airlift capacity. Additional upgrades will involve reviewing the replacement of the Saab 340B (TP 100) and Gulfstream IV (TP 102) aircraft used for personnel transport and addressing operational challenges with the NH90 Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTP), designated by Sweden as HKP 14. As noted in the document, the HKP 14 has low availability and high operational costs, and its maritime version (HKP 14F) is not yet fully operational. Therefore, the Swedish Armed Forces propose phasing out the land version (HKP 14E) as more Sikorsky UH-60M (HKP 16) units are delivered. The Armed Forces also propose acquiring a new ship-based maritime helicopter for the new Luleå-class surface combat vessels, with the new system to be delivered by 2035 as an integrated part of the vessel’s capabilities. Finally, space operations are an integral part of Sweden’s defense strategy, with plans to enhance capabilities in communication, reconnaissance, and early warning through the acquisition of surveillance satellites, secure satellite communications, and satellite launch capacity from Esrange. These developments support Sweden’s strategic autonomy and its contribution to NATO operations, particularly in the Arctic. The Navy’s surface combat capabilities will be strengthened through the mid-life upgrades of the Visby-class corvettes and the acquisition of new surface combat ships of the Luleå-class between 2025 and 2030. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) The Swedish Navy's role in securing control over maritime areas, particularly in the Baltic Sea region, is a central component of the new defense strategy. Its primary mission is to protect critical sea routes essential for trade and the transport of military units and supplies. This responsibility aligns with Sweden's duties as a NATO member, ensuring open sea routes and supporting the Alliance's deterrence and defense operations. The Navy will maintain high availability, readiness, and operational mobility, enhancing its capabilities both independently and in cooperation with NATO forces. The Navy’s surface combat capabilities will be strengthened through the mid-life upgrades of the Visby-class corvettes. These upgrades include arming the ships with air defense missile systems, improving sensors for air, surface, and underwater surveillance, and enhancing electronic warfare capabilities. The Navy is also gradually introducing command support systems to increase interoperability with NATO. Additionally, the acquisition of new surface combat ships of the Luleå-class is set to begin between 2025 and 2030. These ships will provide extended endurance, enhanced air defense capabilities, and leadership functions at sea. The enhanced air defense system, integrated with the Air Force's command and surveillance systems, will improve Sweden's air defense capability and contribute to NATO's integrated air and missile defense. Mine clearance remains crucial for ensuring mobility for both national and allied forces. Between 2025 and 2030, existing mine clearance vessels will be supplemented with unmanned, autonomous, and remotely controlled systems. The current naval mine clearance systems are outdated, prompting the Armed Forces to initiate studies and concepts to assess future capability needs and replacements. Seagoing platforms, combined with unmanned mine clearance systems, will form the core of this effort. Additionally, the development and procurement of unmanned aerial vehicles will begin. Amphibious units will further specialize in both land and sea operations and will receive new indirect fire capabilities, as well as new vessels to replace the Combat Boat 90H. (Picture source: Swedish MoD) Submarines continue to be critical to Sweden's defense strategy. A life-extension program for Gotland-class submarines is planned for 2025–2030 to maintain their capabilities and increase availability. The production of Blekinge-class submarines will also continue, with preparatory work beginning to eventually replace the Gotland-class submarines during 2025–2030. Amphibious units will further specialize in both land and sea operations and will receive new indirect fire capabilities. Procurement of air defense systems for amphibious units and weapons systems for engaging both land and sea targets will commence. Command systems will be upgraded to achieve greater interoperability. The replacement of older transport boats, including the Combat Boat 90H, will also occur. The ability to support special forces and NATO's special operations using parts of the amphibious units will be further developed.

North Korea Develops Drones Equipped with Reverse-Engineered American Hellfire Missiles	North Korea is intensifying its efforts in military drone development by equipping its unmanned systems with reverse-engineered copies of American Hellfire missiles. This information, shared by Brigadier General Patrick Costello during the 2024 United States Army Association conference, has raised significant concerns in the U.S., particularly regarding the growing threats in the Indo-Pacific region. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft over the Nevada Test and Training Range and fires an Air-to-Ground Missile-114 Hellfire missile on August 30, 2023 (Picture source: US DoD) According to General Costello, North Korea's newly revealed drones not only resemble U.S. models like the MQ-9 Reaper and the RQ-4 Global Hawk, but they are also equipped with missiles modeled after the AGM-114 Hellfire, a guided air-to-surface missile used on U.S. drones. Costello noted that Pyongyang has focused on developing drones that weigh approximately 600 kilograms or less, fitting into the categories of small to medium-sized drones with multirole capabilities. These statements follow North Korea's display of two drones in July 2023, which garnered attention due to their striking resemblance to U.S. models. While the exact capabilities of these drones and their missiles remain unclear, the U.S. military now believes they were developed with some knowledge of American technologies. Videos released by North Korean state media showed one of the drones firing missiles closely resembling the Hellfire, further drawing comparisons in the West. This development comes as the U.S. military braces for the growing threat posed by drones, a phenomenon that has intensified in recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine. General Costello emphasized that the technological transfers and relationships observed in ongoing conflicts, particularly between North Korea and Russia, warrant close monitoring. Russia, which is engaged in the war in Ukraine, could benefit from North Korea’s new capabilities to bolster its military arsenal. General David Stewart, Director of the Joint Counter-UAS Office, also noted that drone threats have now become an integral part of modern military environments, regardless of the conflict zone. In response, the U.S. Department of Defense has requested a budget of $2.4 billion for unmanned aerial systems in the 2025 fiscal year. Various branches of the U.S. military are also seeking additional funding to develop counter-drone technologies, with an unfunded request for $741 million in this fiscal year alone.

Companies like Anduril, led by Palmer Luckey, have signed multibillion-dollar contracts with U.S. Special Operations Command to provide counter-drone technologies. Recently, the Pentagon awarded the company another $250 million contract for 500 reusable drones and associated jamming technologies. North Korea’s advances in military drones, combined with its progress in missile reverse-engineering, present significant challenges for the U.S. and its allies. Although these North Korean drones are less sophisticated than their American counterparts, they still pose a serious threat in conflict scenarios, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. As the U.S. continues to strengthen its drone defense capabilities, it is becoming evident that mastery of this technology by nations like North Korea could redefine the nature of modern conflicts. U.S. intelligence services recently confirmed the extent of North Korean reverse-engineering during the October 2024 U.S. Army Association conference. At the event, **Business Insider** revealed that North Korea had modeled its Saetbyol-4 and Saetbyol-9 drones after the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These North Korean drones were first observed during a July 2023 military parade, where one was filmed launching missiles similar to the Hellfire. While it remains unclear how Pyongyang acquired these technologies, U.S. officials suspect espionage or the recovery of parts from conflict zones. This situation is especially concerning as North Korea could potentially share these weapons with Russia, aiding Moscow’s war efforts in Ukraine.

Canadian frigate conducts joint transit through Taiwan Strait amid regional tensions	According to information published by the US DoD on October 20, 2024, the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Higgins (DDG 76) and the Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver (FFH 331) completed a joint transit through the Taiwan Strait.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax-class frigate HMCS Vancouver. (Picture source: Canadian DND) The operation, described as routine by both navies, underscores their commitment to maintaining freedom of navigation in this critical waterway, which is claimed by China as part of its territorial waters. The transit occurred amidst heightened military activity in the region, with China recently conducting large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. HMCS Vancouver HMCS Vancouver is a Halifax-class frigate of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) that has been heavily involved in operations across the Indo-Pacific in 2024. As part of Operation Horizon, it has been deployed in the region for six months, contributing to international maritime security and stability efforts. A milestone for the ship during this deployment was its participation in the first forward missile rearmament outside North America, a complex operation conducted in Broome, Australia. This involved loading Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), a critical part of the frigate's air defense system. Canada-China relations Canada's defense relations with China and Taiwan are shaped by distinct geopolitical considerations and policies. Canada's relationship with China has become increasingly strained, especially following tensions over Chinese interference in Canadian affairs and China's aggressive posture toward Taiwan. Recent diplomatic exchanges between Canada and China, including defense ministers' meetings in 2024, have focused on sensitive issues such as foreign interference, China's military activities around Taiwan, and its support for Russia. Although Canada remains committed to dialogue with China, there is growing concern over Beijing’s actions in the Taiwan Strait, where Canada participates in U.S.-led naval exercises to assert freedom of navigation. These actions have drawn strong responses from China, reflecting broader regional tensions. On the other hand, Canada's ties with Taiwan are shaped by the 'One China' policy, which limits formal defense relationships. However, Canada has engaged in unofficial defense and trade-related exchanges with Taiwan. These include the provision of military technology and expertise for Taiwan's naval capabilities, as well as collaboration on resilience-building in areas such as cybersecurity. Additionally, Canada's Indo-Pacific Strategy has highlighted the importance of Taiwan as a key economic and strategic partner, particularly in terms of technology and supply chain security, though military cooperation remains constrained by its official stance on Taiwan's status.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/canadian-frigate-conducts-joint-transit-through-taiwan-strait-amid-regional-tensions	2024-10-21T02:45:20-07:00	
Poland Considers Acquisition of CH-47F Chinook Heavy Transport Helicopters to Address Logistical Gaps	In an interview on October 15, 2024, with the Portal Obronny, Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz announced that Poland is seriously considering the acquisition of heavy transport helicopters including the CH-47 Chinook, to address a critical shortfall within its armed forces. He emphasized the need for larger helicopters capable of carrying heavy loads and more troops to inaccessible areas, while also facilitating the evacuation of personnel. The minister noted that an order could be finalized shortly, signaling a shift in Warsaw’s logistical strategy in response to operational challenges and recent crises. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Kosiniak-Kamysz mentioned the potential purchase of the CH-47F Chinook, an American-made model by Boeing (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) This decision aligns with Poland’s ongoing efforts to modernize its military capabilities since the war in Ukraine began. Despite the acquisition of numerous assets, including M1A2 Abrams tanks, F-35A fighters, and HIMARS artillery systems, the absence of heavy transport helicopters remains a notable gap. The urgency of this need became apparent during relief operations following last month’s storm 'Boris,' which caused widespread flooding in Poland. These events highlighted the necessity for helicopters capable of carrying larger numbers of people, supplies, and heavy materials required to temporarily repair damaged flood defenses. While the Polish Navy has already acquired four AW-101 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare missions, which also belong to the heavy transport category, Kosiniak-Kamysz mentioned the potential purchase of the CH-47F Chinook, an American-made model by Boeing. Already in service with several NATO members, this helicopter's interoperability could be a decisive factor in Poland’s choice. Germany, for instance, cited this reason when it decided in 2022 to purchase 60 of these helicopters. The CH-47F Chinook is a heavy transport helicopter designed to carry substantial loads under varied conditions. Equipped with two Honeywell T55-GA-714A engines, each providing 4,777 shp, it can reach a maximum speed of 315 km/h and carry over 9,500 kg of payload. Its cargo area spans 42m³, allowing for the transportation of up to 50 troops or two HMMWVs. The cabin can also be configured for medical evacuation, accommodating 24 stretchers. The Chinook’s triple-hook system enables the external transport of heavy loads, making it essential for complex logistical missions. The CH-47F Chinook is a heavy transport helicopter designed to carry substantial loads under varied conditions (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) In terms of armament, the CH-47F is equipped with three machine guns, two mounted on the starboard crew door and one on the port side. Its advanced avionics include the Rockwell Collins Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) and BAE Systems' Digital Advanced Flight Control System (DAFCS), enhancing navigation and communication capabilities. Combined with a reinforced structure, these systems allow the Chinook to operate in challenging environments while minimizing maintenance requirements. Another option for Poland could be the CH-53K King Stallion, offered by Sikorsky, a subsidiary of Lockheed-Martin. However, the Chinook seems to have an advantage due to its integration within NATO forces and defense cooperation agreements. The number of helicopters Poland plans to acquire has not yet been disclosed, but this information is expected once the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DCSA), the U.S. body responsible for military equipment exports, delivers its opinion on the potential purchase.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/poland-considers-acquisition-of-ch-47f-chinook-heavy-transport-helicopters-to-address-logistical-gaps	2024-10-21T02:30:02-07:00	
US approves sale of Rolling Airframe Missiles to Japan for enhanced defense	According to information published by the US Gov on October 18, 2024, the US State Department has approved a possible Foreign Military Sale to Japan, which could see the transfer of up to 212 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Block 2B Tactical Missiles, alongside related equipment, for an estimated value of $360 million.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS New Orleans (LPD-18) fires a RIM-116 missile from its RAM launcher during a live-fire exercise off the coast of California. (Picture source: Dvids) The sale includes the advanced RIM-116E RAM Block 2B, known for its enhanced area defense capabilities, designed to protect key maritime and coastal regions from incoming missile threats. This package also comprises supporting elements, including RAM Guided Missile Round Packs, specialized shipping containers, training gear, technical manuals, and logistical support. Notably, the sale will also aid in establishing an Intermediate Level Maintenance Facility (ILMF) in Japan to support these systems. Technical comments The RAM Block 2B missile system that Japan is acquiring brings a highly adaptable and advanced defensive capability to its maritime forces. Designed to counter sophisticated threats, the RAM Block 2B employs an enhanced dual-mode seeker using both passive radio frequency and infrared guidance. This enables it to track and engage advanced anti-ship missiles, even those that utilize countermeasures like radar jamming or infrared decoys. The improved guidance system allows the missile to operate in complex electronic warfare environments, increasing the likelihood of successful target interception. In terms of its kinetic performance, the RAM Block 2B is a supersonic missile, reaching speeds in excess of Mach 2. Its high maneuverability and speed allow it to engage agile sea-skimming missiles, which are designed to evade radar by flying at very low altitudes. This capability is critical as Japan faces growing concerns over China’s deployment of highly advanced anti-ship missiles such as the YJ-12, which poses a significant threat to its naval forces. The RAM’s ability to counter these fast-moving threats at close range offers a crucial layer of defense in high-risk zones like the East China Sea. Technologically, one of the key advancements of the Block 2B variant is its missile-to-missile link, which allows missiles launched in salvo to coordinate and share targeting information in real-time. This system optimizes the defense against complex and simultaneous missile raids by improving engagement efficiency. It is particularly important when dealing with saturation tactics, where a large number of incoming missiles can overwhelm traditional defense systems. Japan’s decision to integrate RAM Block 2B into its naval platforms reflects a broader strategic goal of building a multi-layered defense system. The missile’s modular design allows it to be installed on a variety of ships, from smaller patrol vessels to larger Aegis-equipped destroyers, enhancing the defensive network across Japan’s fleet. By providing close-in defense capabilities, RAM Block 2B complements longer-range systems, creating a more robust defense architecture. This adaptability is crucial for Japan, as it seeks to defend its maritime territory against increasingly sophisticated and fast-evolving missile threats from regional actors like China and North Korea.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-approves-sale-of-rolling-airframe-missiles-to-japan-for-enhanced-defense	2024-10-21T01:51:15-07:00	
US Says THAAD Anti-Missile System is Now in Place in Israel	On October 21, 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced during his visit to Ukraine that the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system was now in place, though he did not confirm if it was fully operational. This system was deployed to Israel on September 25, 2024, in response to recent escalations between Israel and Iran. The deployment followed Iran’s launch of approximately 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel earlier in October, an event seen as retaliation for Israeli strikes on Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon and the death of a Hamas leader in Tehran. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The US military deploys a THAAD missile defense system in Israel, in March 2019 (Picture source: US DoD) The THAAD system, a key component of the U.S. military's layered air defense network, has now been positioned in Israel to enhance the country’s already strong missile defense capabilities. According to Austin, the system is 'in place' and can be quickly made operational, though specific details on its current readiness were not provided. THAAD adds an important layer to Israel’s defense system, complementing existing systems like the Patriot by covering larger areas and intercepting threats at ranges of up to 200 kilometers. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) missile system is designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at altitudes of up to 150 km and ranges between 150 and 200 km. It is a transportable ground-based system equipped with eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 radar for target detection, and a control and communication center to manage operations. THAAD uses hit-to-kill technology, where the missile's kinetic energy neutralizes incoming warheads either within or outside the atmosphere. Developed by Lockheed Martin, THAAD was first deployed in 2008. Several U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and more recently Germany and Japan, have acquired or integrated THAAD into their air defense systems. With its high mobility and ability to intercept at high altitudes, THAAD plays a critical role in protecting military forces, infrastructure, and civilian populations from ballistic missile threats. Israeli sources indicate that the system is already operational, with up to three batteries in use. These reports come amid rising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation, which could prompt an Israeli military response. While the scope of future Israeli strikes remains unclear, Austin emphasized the importance of de-escalating tensions while continuing to meet Israel’s defense needs. He also noted that the U.S. is diplomatically working to reduce tensions between Iran and Israel, though any military actions would ultimately be Israel’s decision. US Air Force shows a US Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense at Fort Bliss, Texas, on Feb. 23, 2019 (Picture source: US DoD) The Pentagon had previously confirmed the arrival of an advance team and essential components needed to operate the THAAD system in Israel, with additional personnel and equipment arriving in the days following. This deployment involves approximately 100 U.S. personnel, putting American forces on the ground in Israel and deepening U.S. involvement in the region. The deployment of THAAD signals a significant shift as the U.S. moves from a supportive role to a more active defense posture, potentially placing American forces at greater risk should hostilities intensify. Developed in the 1990s and operational since 2008, this missile defense system includes truck-mounted launchers, radar systems, and fire control components. Each battery consists of six launchers, each equipped with eight interceptors. THAAD is specifically designed to intercept and destroy short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles at high altitudes, providing a critical defense layer against Iranian missile threats. The deployment of THAAD to Israel demonstrates the continued U.S. commitment to Israel’s defense, particularly in light of the growing missile threats from Iran. The Pentagon has confirmed that the THAAD system will soon be fully operational and capable of defending Israeli airspace. Despite the complexity of the situation, the U.S. continues to prioritize diplomatic efforts aimed at reducing tensions while maintaining a robust defense posture in the region. This development also coincides with a warning from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Israeli officials, urging them to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The U.S. has made clear that continued military support will depend on significant efforts to address the humanitarian crisis, and Israel has since facilitated the entry of aid trucks into Gaza.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-says-thaad-anti-missile-system-is-now-in-place-in-israel	2024-10-21T01:49:05-07:00	
Chinese DF-31AG Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Launched from Hainan Island	On September 25, 2024, China's Ministry of National Defense announced that the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) had conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the South Pacific. This exercise, described as part of China's annual training plan, drew attention due to its unusual launch site: Hainan Island. The missile, a DF-31AG, traveled an estimated 11,700 km before landing in the Pacific, marking the first time since 1980 that China has targeted this area during an ICBM test. The last such event involved a DF-5 missile launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An image of the DF-31AG launch was released by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on September 25, 2024 (Picture source: PLA) The launch has sparked discussions regarding China’s nuclear posture and its advancing military modernization. Navigation warnings and trajectory calculations quickly identified that the missile had been fired from northeast Hainan Island, a location not typically used for ICBM launches and lacking a permanent ICBM brigade. This unusual choice suggests that China used a mobile launcher for the test, likely a DF-31AG, as confirmed by images released shortly after the event. The DF-31AG is a modernized version of the DF-31, China’s first solid-fuel ICBM, introduced in 2017 to replace earlier models. The DF-31AG is mounted on an eight-axle mobile transporter, which offers improved maneuverability and requires less logistical support than previous versions. The Dong Feng 31 (DF-31), also known as CSS-9 according to NATO classification, is a mobile, long-range ICBM developed by China. This three-stage missile, powered by solid fuel, was designed in the 1980s as a successor to the DF-4. First unveiled during China's National Day Parade in 1999, the DF-31 is housed in a large container mounted on an eight-wheeled trailer, providing significant operational flexibility. With an estimated range of 8,000 to 11,700 kilometers, it can strike targets across much of the continental United States, giving China a second-strike nuclear capability that is difficult to counter. The missile's accuracy is estimated at around 150 meters for mobile launches and 100 meters for silo-based launches. The DF-31 can carry a single 1-megaton nuclear warhead or multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), capable of delivering three to four warheads with yields ranging from 20 to 150 kilotons. It uses an inertial navigation system coupled with stellar and GPS updates to improve precision. In terms of mobility, the missile is transported on HY4430 trailers towed by off-road trucks designed to operate in rugged conditions. The DF-31 remains a central component of China's nuclear deterrent, offering rapid strike capabilities and an extended range, making it difficult to neutralize. An image of the DF-31AG missile driving on Hainan Island shortly after the launch (Picture source: X Channel @Resonant_News) The DF-31AG used a cold-launch method, where the missile is ejected from its canister using compressed gas before its engine ignites. This method makes it more challenging to geolocate the exact launch site, as there are no burn marks left on the ground. This test is significant for China, which has not conducted an ICBM test in the Pacific for over four decades, typically opting for high-apogee tests within its own borders. The missile was likely transported from the Shaoyang brigade, about 800 km from Hainan, via rail and sea before being driven to the final launch site. Analysis of images and videos identified a probable launch area near Wenchang, on Hainan Island, which appears to be part of a newly developed military training zone, reinforcing the strategic importance of this location for future observations. The decision to launch an ICBM from Hainan could serve multiple purposes, such as allowing a full-range test without debris fallout or overflight of other countries. This test may also be part of a broader PLARF strategy to restore credibility following internal issues such as corruption scandals and leadership changes. Furthermore, by conducting this test as part of a military drill rather than a technological development program, China may be aiming to demonstrate combat readiness while reinforcing its status as a global nuclear power. The Pentagon confirmed it had received prior notice of the launch, which could set a precedent for future risk-reduction communications. It remains to be seen whether China will continue conducting such tests outside its borders and whether it will maintain this policy of pre-launch notifications to relevant states.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/chinese-df-31ag-intercontinental-ballistic-missile-launched-from-hainan-island	2024-10-21T00:51:27-07:00

RTX Coordinates Autonomous UAV Airstrike During US Army's EDGE24 Exercise	On October 14, 2024, three uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) from RTX scanned miles of rugged terrain to identify potential threats during the U.S. Army’s EDGE24 military exercise. The drones detected and assessed risks using RF signals, recording their positions. Within seconds, this information was relayed to a command center, which then deployed additional UAVs to confirm the targets and simulate a strike. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link While UAVs are already used for reconnaissance and strike missions, this demonstration showed that they can now operate with minimal human intervention, relying on autonomy to make real-time decisions (Picture source: US Army) This demonstration, conducted as part of the U.S. Army's EDGE24 exercise in Yuma, Arizona, marked a significant step for RTX. Teams from Collins Aerospace and Raytheon, both divisions of RTX, completed a flight mission that had previously been tested only in simulations. While UAVs are already used for reconnaissance and strike missions, this demonstration showed that they can now operate with minimal human intervention, relying on autonomy to make real-time decisions. Two key RTX technologies were employed in this test: Collins Aerospace's RapidEdge mission system and Raytheon’s CODE autonomy. Rather than following precise commands or preplanned routes, the UAVs were assigned a broad objective. They communicated with one another to strategize and adapt to obstacles encountered during the mission. Even when the communication link between the drones and the ground station was severed, simulating a communication-denied environment, the UAVs continued to execute the mission autonomously. They also coordinated their actions with Raytheon’s Coyote Block 3 system, demonstrating the technology's capability in realistic and challenging conditions. Bernd Knox, Collins’ business development lead, highlighted the system’s ability to quickly and effectively distribute critical data to both Raytheon’s team and the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team. He emphasized the importance of timely information sharing to leverage the system’s capabilities fully. This exercise supports the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift initiative, with Peter Laird noting that autonomous behavior adds complexity that can only be fully validated in real flight conditions (Picture source: US Army) The EDGE24 event, also known as the Experimentation Demonstration Gateway Event, tested emerging launched effects technologies and their integration with other systems on a simulated battlefield. This exercise supports the U.S. Army’s Future Vertical Lift initiative, which seeks to modernize its rotorcraft fleet. Peter Laird, Collins’ program manager for autonomy and launched effects, pointed out the complexity added by autonomous behavior, which can only truly be validated in real flight conditions, despite the inherent challenge of flying the UAVs themselves. The demonstration also showcased the speed and agility of Collins’ RapidEdge team. They developed the system used in the EDGE24 exercise in just five months, using advanced prototyping, integration, and simulation techniques. These simulations can execute entire missions in seconds, while hardware-in-the-loop testing combines simulation data with real flight equipment to fine-tune performance before the final real-world test. RTX aims to go beyond providing standalone collaborative autonomy capabilities by supporting the development of flexible platforms capable of performing multiple mission types. Although the systems demonstrated at EDGE24 are still in development, the team plans to build on this experience to refine and enhance the technology for future deployments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/rtx-coordinates-autonomous-uav-airstrike-during-us-armys-edge24-exercise	2024-10-21T00:08:34-07:00	
North Korean Hwasong-9 Ballistic Missiles Reportedly Used By Russia To Target Ukraine	Credible reports have emerged indicating that North Korea’s Hwasong-9 medium-range ballistic missiles have been deployed against Ukrainian targets. According to an update shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Chuck Pfarrer, a former U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six leader and renowned military analyst, these North Korean missiles have been used on Ukrainian territory since November of last year.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Hwasong-9 is a medium-range ballistic missile developed by North Korea based on the Hwasong-6 (Scud-C) design. It is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile capable of striking targets up to 500-700 kilometers away . (Picture source: MDAA website) Pfarrer's report highlights the potential deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, with North Korea's provision of strategic missile support representing a notable escalation. North Korea's Hwasong-9 missiles are a critical component of its ballistic missile arsenal, developed indigenously from the earlier Hwasong-6, which is itself a variant of the Soviet-era Scud-C missile. The Hwasong-9 is a mobile, surface-to-surface missile (SSM) capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. It was designed to improve on the Hwasong-6, which North Korea has had in its inventory for several decades. The Hwasong-9 has an estimated range of around 500-700 kilometers, allowing it to strike targets within short to medium distances. The missile's mobility and versatility are key attributes, as it is mounted on a transport erector launcher (TEL), allowing for rapid repositioning and surprise launches. This development demonstrates North Korea’s long-standing strategy of adapting foreign technology, like the Scud-C, to suit its own military needs and ambitions. It also raises significant concerns about the ongoing transfer of military technologies between countries like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. North Korea has played a significant role in supplying munitions for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine, reportedly providing about half of the large-caliber ammunition used on the battlefield in 2024. Ukrainian sources indicate that over 2 million rounds of ammunition were supplied, alongside KN-23 ballistic missiles, which were utilized in dozens of strikes across Ukraine during the winter of 2023-2024. In May 2024, the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed through debris analysis that Russia was indeed deploying North Korean missiles, following a summit between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin in September 2023. The deployment of the Hwasong-9 against Ukraine marks the first clear instance of North Korea’s military involvement in the conflict. The specific targets struck by these missiles remain unclear, but such an involvement suggests a growing alignment between Russia and North Korea, particularly in military terms. This alliance has been developing since the start of the war, with Russia reportedly seeking North Korean arms and ammunition to bolster its military supplies, strained by more than a year and a half of intense fighting in Ukraine. For Ukraine, the addition of a new type of ballistic missile to the conflict adds another layer of complexity to its defense strategy. Ukraine has largely relied on air defense systems provided by Western allies to intercept Russian missile strikes. However, the inclusion of North Korean systems, such as the Hwasong-9, will likely force Ukraine to adapt further, as it is unfamiliar with North Korean missile technology.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korean-hwasong-9-ballistic-missiles-reportedly-used-by-russia-to-target-ukraine	2024-10-20T11:34:40-07:00

Britain Joins European Cooperation for Long-Range Missile Development	The war in Ukraine continues to shift the military balance in Europe, prompting NATO to intensify its response. On October 17, 2024, Britain officially announced its participation in a program for developing long-range missiles alongside Germany, France, Poland, and other European partners. This initiative aims to address a gap in military stockpiles highlighted by the conflict in Ukraine, where the use of long-range missiles has become strategically important. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. (Picture source: MBDA) British Defense Secretary John Healey confirmed this commitment during a meeting with his NATO counterparts in Brussels. He explained that the UK is formally joining the long-range missile development program, which is intended to improve the integration of European air defense systems, enhancing their collective effectiveness. According to Healey, these missiles will provide capabilities far beyond those currently available to participating nations, in line with NATO's broader goal of strengthening deterrence and protecting Europe. At the NATO summit in Washington in July, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland had already signed a letter of intent to collaborate on developing missiles with a range of more than 500 kilometers. Military sources at the time indicated that the goal was to create a new land-based cruise missile with a range between 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers to meet NATO's deterrence requirements. Britain's participation underscores the importance of the program as Europe seeks to protect itself against external threats, particularly from Russia. As part of this cooperation, the United States and Germany also announced that starting in 2026, they will temporarily deploy U.S. long-range missiles on German soil, including SM-6, Tomahawk missiles, and developmental hypersonic weapons. This deployment, criticized by Moscow as a 'very serious threat' to Russian national security, is seen as a temporary measure until Europe develops its own long-range missiles. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, missiles with ranges of several hundred kilometers have seen renewed importance. Moscow has increased cross-border strikes, while Kyiv has responded by targeting sites within Russian territory. Existing European stocks of cruise missiles, such as Britain's Storm Shadow, France's Scalp, and Germany's Taurus, which have a range of around 500 kilometers, have become critical in addressing these escalating threats. Alongside the missile development program, Healey also confirmed that Britain is ready to quickly deploy troops to Estonia, if necessary, to bolster NATO's eastern flank against the Russian threat.

(Picture source: Fleetphoto) Eighteen oil tankers and four liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers have been added to the sanctions list, making it the largest single action to date against Russia’s maritime fleet. These vessels will be barred from accessing British ports and services, bringing the total number of sanctioned Russian ships to 43. This network of tankers is crucial for maintaining Russian oil exports, a significant source of revenue funding its ongoing war in Ukraine. The United States and Canada have joined the UK’s 'Call to Action' initiative, first announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in July, which now has 47 signatories. These countries are working together to address the shadow fleet's violation of international safety standards and the potential environmental hazards it poses, such as the risk of oil spills. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized the importance of cutting off Russia’s financial lifelines, noting that the shadow fleet poses a threat not only to maritime safety but to the global economy. As a result of the sanctions, Russia’s state-controlled shipping giant, Sovcomflot, has been scrambling to evade penalties by renaming and reassigning its vessels. Despite these efforts, many ships have been forced to idle in international waters, unable to unload their cargo or generate revenue. This development has added strain to Russia's energy sector, where flagship companies like Gazprom have already reported significant losses, including a $6.9 billion net deficit in 2023—their first in over two decades. The sanctions also extend beyond the shadow fleet, targeting key players in Russia's gas industry, such as Rusgazdobycha JSC. Background The UK's latest sanctions on Russia’s 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers represent a critical escalation in the effort to cripple the financial resources fueling President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. These measures are part of a broader campaign, which has already blocked Russia from accessing over $400 billion in assets and revenues since the start of the war. The shadow fleet, a collection of vessels designed to evade sanctions and continue the illicit trade of Russian oil, has become a primary target, with the UK's actions disrupting operations of vessels that have collectively transported billions in oil since February 2022​. This crackdown aligns with wider international efforts, with the US, Canada, and several European countries backing the UK's initiative to halt Russia’s oil trade. Notably, the shadow fleet comprises ships operating under complex management systems often based in non-Western jurisdictions, making enforcement challenging.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uk-imposes-largest-sanctions-yet-on-russian-oil-tankers-targeting-shadow-fleet	2024-10-18T03:39:36-07:00

France and United Arab Emirates in Talks for Joint Financing of Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development	According to the French newspaper La Tribune on October 16, 2024, France and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are engaged in discussions on joint financing for the development of the future Rafale F5 fighter jet standard. This potential partnership, initiated within the informal framework of the 'Rafale Club,' would allow the UAE to participate in the evolution of the French fighter, thus strengthening the strategic bond between the two nations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link France Next-Gen Rafale F5 Fighter Jet Development Program (Picture source: French MoD) The military relationship between France and the UAE has deepened over the decades, based on strategic cooperation and mutual trust that extend far beyond arms contracts. This alliance is notably illustrated by the permanent presence of French forces in the UAE since 2009, symbolizing a partnership that spans training, intelligence, and joint operations. The UAE has become a major partner for France in the Gulf region, supported by large-scale military contracts, such as the 2021 agreement for the purchase of 80 Rafale F4 aircraft, valued at more than €16 billion—the largest arms export contract in French history. Abu Dhabi would benefit from direct involvement in future innovations of the aircraft, also providing financial relief for the French Ministry of Armed Forces in a context of budgetary constraints. France’s Ministry of Armed Forces recently announced the start of Rafale F5 development without disclosing the details of these advanced discussions with the UAE. This co-financing would cover only non-sovereign elements of the Rafale, leaving France with exclusive control over critical components. In return for this cooperation, the UAE is considering an additional order of 20 Rafales, complementing the 80 aircraft acquired in 2021 under a historic contract, including Mica NG and Black Shaheen missiles. Led by the General Directorate of Armament (DGA), the Rafale program aims to launch the F5 standard in the next decade. This new version introduces significant advancements in connectivity and data processing to enhance the operational capabilities of client air forces. This upgrade will include a new radar, a state-of-the-art electronic warfare system, advanced optronic sensors, and the integration of the ASN4G missile for French forces. Additionally, the Rafale F5 will be supported by a stealth combat drone inspired by the Neuron demonstrator, designed to assist the aircraft in penetrating enemy defenses. This companion drone, a key feature of the F5 standard, will be engineered for maximum stealth and advanced connectivity, allowing operations over extended ranges thanks to aerial refueling. Its mission, enhanced by native integration of artificial intelligence, will enable direct collaboration with the Rafale in adaptive combat strategies, providing a foundational component of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program. This potential partnership with the UAE arises as France seeks to optimize its defense budget for the 2024–2030 period, with a €413 billion military programming budget. In 2023, Minister of the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu discussed the possibility of Rafale Club members contributing to development costs while ensuring sovereignty over critical components. This shared financing would also strengthen France’s relations with Rafale clients, while maintaining national control over sensitive elements. Expected by 2030, the Rafale F5 fighter jet will succeed the F4 standard, addressing modern threats for both conventional missions and nuclear deterrence missions within the French Strategic Air Forces (FAS). It represents a new generation of connected fighters, integrating interoperable systems with other ground and aerial platforms. For the UAE, this project represents not only a military upgrade but also an extension of their cooperation with France in defense, consolidating their position as one of France's privileged allies. The UAE Armed Forces are among the best-trained and most capable among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. While Iran remains a major strategic concern, partly due to an ongoing dispute over islands in the Strait of Hormuz, the UAE has shown an increasing capacity to project influence and engage militarily beyond its borders. Their involvement in conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as their crucial role in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, has reinforced their experience and strategic approach to managing military risks. This orientation towards international engagement is supported by foreign bases, including a French base and a South Korean contingent, as well as diversified defense relations, particularly with Israel, Turkey, and China, while maintaining a primary partnership with the United States.

Netherlands Confirms a Reduced Order of H225M Caracal Helicopters for Special Forces	In a letter to the House of Representatives, the new State Secretary for Defence, Gijs Tuinman, confirmed on October 16, 2024, the project to purchase 12 Airbus H225M Caracal helicopters, with a contract signing planned no later than November 2024. This announcement marks a significant revision to the acquisition program, initially set to procure 14 helicopters. The project is now reduced to 12 units, with deliveries extended over time. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Derived from the Cougar Mk2 model, the Caracal meets the demands of combat search and rescue (CSAR), special operations, and tactical transport missions (Picture source: Netherlands MoD) This adjustment, implemented due to budget constraints and specific requirements of the special operations forces, aims to tailor each helicopter to the missions of the elite 300 Special Operations Squadron. This compromise allows for the replacement of the aging Cougar helicopters, in service since 1996, though the first Caracals are only expected to arrive by early 2030. Full fleet delivery is projected for 2032, two years behind the initially planned schedule. The H225M Caracal, originally known as the Eurocopter EC725, is a medium-sized, twin-engine military helicopter developed by Airbus Helicopters. Derived from the Cougar Mk2 model, the Caracal meets the demands of combat search and rescue (CSAR), special operations, and tactical transport missions. After its maiden flight in November 2000, it entered service with the French Air Force in 2005. Its versatility and advanced avionics have since made it popular with military forces worldwide, including in Brazil, Malaysia, and Singapore. The H225M Caracal can carry up to 29 soldiers or a combination of personnel and cargo, with a total payload capacity of up to 4,750 kg for underslung loads. Inspired by the Cougar family, it incorporates several enhancements, such as a five-blade main rotor and a reinforced transmission gearbox, which increase its payload capacity, range, and speed. Powered by two Safran Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines, each delivering 2,382 horsepower, the helicopter reaches a maximum speed of 324 km/h. It has a range of around 1,200 kilometers with additional fuel tanks and can operate at altitudes up to 6,095 meters (20,000 feet), making it suitable for high-altitude missions. The cabin can be configured for various missions, including medical evacuations, with space to accommodate up to 11 stretchers. Equipped with advanced avionics, the H225M Caracal features a digital cockpit with multifunction displays, a digital map, and an autopilot system that eases pilot workload and supports operations in challenging environments. The five-blade main rotor is designed to optimize lift and reduce vibrations, ensuring stable flight performance. The helicopter has been deployed in several notable missions, such as evacuations during the 2006 Lebanon conflict and support operations in Afghanistan. Its international adoption is highlighted by orders like Brazil’s purchase of 50 units. The H225M’s survivability is enhanced by a radar warning receiver, missile approach warning system, laser warning receiver, and chaff/flare dispensers. (Picture source: Army Recognition) According to the Ministry of Defence, the decision to reduce the order was necessary to remain within the allocated budget, which ranges between 1 and 2.5 billion euros. Customization and adaptation costs for the Caracal to meet the unique demands of special operations have been higher than anticipated. This adjustment, communicated to Dutch parliament members, shows the need for various contracts to equip the helicopter with advanced mission systems. Although Airbus Helicopters remains the program’s primary contractor, the Dutch Defence Ministry also plans complementary contracts to equip nine of the helicopters with specific capabilities. Among the selected suppliers, Israel’s Elbit Systems will provide a proven self-protection suite already installed on the Gulfstream G650ER and future C390M transport aircraft for Dutch Defence. This suite will enhance the Caracal’s survivability against modern threats. Additionally, radio equipment from the American group L3 Harris will be integrated through the Foxtrot program, ensuring secure communications and improved interoperability with allied forces. Airbus Helicopters, in partnership with the Netherlands and Germany, is also developing a new mission computer to centralize all data flows in a single display, facilitating real-time decision-making. The acquisition of these helicopters includes infrastructure and training programs. Next-generation simulators will be implemented through a separate program starting next year, aiming to increase training hours from 700 for the current Cougar fleet to between 2,000 and 3,000 for the Caracal, preserving the aircraft while enhancing pilot and operator readiness for critical missions. This adjustment will impact the operational capacity of the 300 Special Operations Squadron. While the initial plan anticipated the ability to conduct two simultaneous missions over six months, the current configuration limits capacity to one long-term mission, with a second short-term mission possible if needed. This change reflects Defence’s intent to maximize capabilities within budget constraints, taking into account rising integration costs and logistical challenges. Anticipated delivery delays also stem from technical challenges associated with integrating numerous mission systems and high demand on Caracal’s production lines internationally. The Dutch Ministry of Defence acknowledges that further delays cannot be ruled out, though contractual safeguards aim to minimize this risk. In the worst case, an extension of the Cougar helicopters’ operational life may be considered to offset scheduling delays. With the acquisition’s preparatory phase now complete, a final agreement with Airbus Helicopters is expected next month.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/netherlands-confirms-a-reduced-order-of-h225m-caracal-helicopters-for-special-forces	2024-10-17T06:13:43-07:00

Armenia Could Be First Country to Acquire India's Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile	On October 16, 2024, News.Az reported that the Indian Ministry of Defense authorized the export of Pralay quasi-ballistic missiles to Armenia, marking an important step in strengthening the defense partnership between India and Armenia. This decision, which has yet to receive official confirmation from the Armenian Ministry of Defense, reflects India's intent to conclude an agreement aimed at bolstering Armenia’s defensive capabilities in a context of regional tensions. According to Alpha Defense, this potential agreement is at an advanced stage, with sources indicating that India is actively negotiating to finalize it in the near future.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link India Home-made Pralay Quasi-Ballistic Missile (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Pralay missile, developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), is an advanced short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile, primarily designed for tactical use in combat conditions. Launched in 2015, the Pralay program represents a strategic advancement for India’s missile arsenal, incorporating sophisticated quasi-ballistic trajectory adjustments that allow the missile to evade interceptors and anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses. The missile has already successfully completed several tests, with the first two conducted in December 2021 and a third in November 2023, each demonstrating the missile’s accuracy, payload capacity, and terminal maneuverability. The Pralay's unique quasi-ballistic trajectory enables it to shift from a traditional ballistic path to a flatter trajectory after launch, making interception more difficult by reducing its radar profile. This feature, combined with high speed and terminal maneuverability, brings the Pralay closer to the Russian Iskander-M missile, which has proven effective in recent conflicts, notably in Ukraine. The Pralay shares characteristics with the Iskander-M, such as a CEP (Circular Error Probable) of around 10 meters, highlighting its high accuracy and ability to evade air defenses. India and Russia have long-standing collaboration in missile technology, a partnership that has significantly shaped India's missile capabilities. One of the most notable outcomes of this cooperation is the BrahMos missile, developed jointly by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyenia. Launched as the world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile, the BrahMos demonstrates both high speed and precision, making it a valuable asset in India’s arsenal. This collaboration has allowed India to integrate Russian expertise in propulsion and guidance systems with its own indigenous technological advancements, setting a foundation for India's development of future missile systems. Russia’s involvement in India’s missile program has also extended through technology transfers and support in ballistic missile defense research, further strengthening India's defense capabilities and boosting its strategic autonomy in missile production. To comply with international arms control regulations, India has committed to limiting export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 kilometers and a payload capacity not exceeding 500 kilograms. This adherence to missile technology control guidelines requires technical modifications to the Pralay system, an adaptation that India is actively pursuing. Powered by a solid-fuel motor and integrating maneuverable re-entry vehicle (MaRV) technology, the missile can carry payloads ranging from high-explosive fragmentation warheads to runway denial submunitions. These capabilities enable it to effectively target and neutralize critical military infrastructure such as radar installations, command centers, and forward airstrips, with enhanced precision and lethality. Armenia’s interest in acquiring the Pralay missile stems from its need to counterbalance the capabilities acquired by Azerbaijan through its purchase of LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missiles developed by Israel Aerospace Industries. With a range of 400 kilometers and a CEP of 10 meters, the LORA missile represents a significant threat to Armenia’s strategic assets. The Pralay’s compatibility with various warhead types and its advanced guidance system, using both inertial navigation and a DSMAC (Digital Scene-Matching Area Correlation) seeker for increased accuracy, provide Armenia with an adequate response to Azerbaijan’s missile capabilities. A distinctive feature of the Pralay is its fused silica radar dome (RADOME), which enhances its evasion capabilities and survivability in hostile airspace. The jet vane thrust vector control system allows the Pralay to perform evasive maneuvers in the terminal phase, effectively countering enemy defense systems. Additionally, the Pralay includes two sets of small fins that help reduce its radar signature, further complicating interception efforts. The Indian Pralay missile and the Israeli LORA (Long-Range Artillery) missile are two quasi-ballistic systems with short to medium range, but their performances and capabilities differ in several aspects. The Pralay has a theoretical range between 150 and 500 km, with a payload capacity ranging from 350 kg to 700 kg, allowing it to target strategic installations such as radars, command centers, and airstrips. However, to comply with international arms control regulations, India has limited export versions of the Pralay to a maximum range of 300 km and a payload not exceeding 500 kg. This technical adaptation, necessary to adhere to missile technology control guidelines, ensures that exported versions meet international standards. The LORA, on the other hand, has a maximum range of 400 km and a payload capacity of approximately 570 kg. This missile was operationally used by Azerbaijani forces during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, demonstrating high accuracy with a CEP of 10 meters, particularly on targets such as bridges and critical infrastructure. Its guidance system, using GPS and TV imaging in the terminal phase, ensures high precision, although it remains potentially vulnerable to electronic countermeasures. Thus, the Pralay prioritizes better terminal maneuverability to evade interceptions, while the LORA stands out for its extreme precision in targeted strikes, with each featuring specific adaptations according to their usage contexts and regulatory requirements. The Indian armed forces have shown strategic interest in the Pralay missile, with substantial orders from both the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. In 2022, the Indian Ministry of Defense approved the purchase of 120 missiles for the Air Force, followed in 2023 by the acquisition of a regiment of 250 missiles for the Army, intended to strengthen tactical capabilities along sensitive borders with China and Pakistan. If the agreement with Armenia is finalized, this country would become the first international buyer of the Pralay missile, marking a historic milestone in Indian defense exports. Defense relations between India and Armenia have considerably strengthened in recent years, illustrated by the transfer of sophisticated weaponry to meet Armenia's growing security needs in a tense regional context. In 2020, India sold Armenia four Swathi radars, capable of detecting and locating enemy artillery fire, as well as M982 Excalibur precision artillery shells, enhancing Armenia’s defensive and retaliatory capabilities. Armenia is also interested in ATAGS (Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System) howitzers developed by DRDO, which offer extended range and increased accuracy, with the capability to fire projectiles up to 48 km. The addition of ATAGS would strengthen Armenia's offensive capabilities, complementing its current arsenal. Additionally, the Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, also developed by DRDO, has attracted significant interest from Armenia. Capable of launching a salvo of twelve rockets in less than 45 seconds and reaching a range of 40 to 75 km depending on the variant, the Pinaka would provide mobile and versatile firepower, ideal for saturation strikes and ground support missions. Integrating the Pinaka would further strengthen Armenia's tactical options, while consolidating India as a key partner in defense.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/armenia-could-be-first-country-to-acquire-indias-home-made-pralay-quasi-ballistic-missile	2024-10-17T04:52:13-07:00

UK maintains Challenger 3 Tank schedule toward 2030 full capability	As reported by the UK Defence Journal on October 11, 2024, the British Ministry of Defence has confirmed the continued progress of the Challenger 3 main battle tank program, in response to questions from Danny Kruger, MP for East Wiltshire, regarding the review's potential impacts on the program and recent discussions with the Army Board. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence Luke Pollard clarified that the Challenger 3 is set to achieve Initial Operating Capability by 2027, with Full Operating Capability expected by 2030.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Pollard noted that the Strategic Defence Review aims to align future capability development with the UK’s security needs. As part of this process, the Ministry will provide regular updates to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Secretary of State for Defence, with a comprehensive final report anticipated by mid-2025. This review is intended to ensure that the UK’s defense infrastructure supports both current and future requirements. The Challenger 3, developed by the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL), represents an upgrade of the existing Challenger 2 tanks rather than the deployment of entirely new vehicles. The program evolved from the Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme (LEP), designed to improve mobility, lethality, and survivability for continued use through the 2030s. The primary modification in the Challenger 3 is the integration of a new turret with a 120mm L55A1 smoothbore gun, replacing the previous L30A1 rifled gun. This modification aligns with NATO standards, improving interoperability, although it requires a new kinetic energy round to be developed in collaboration with Germany, as the smoothbore system is incompatible with current Challenger 2 ammunition. Initial deliveries of pre-production Challenger 3 tanks began in early 2024, with live-firing trials starting in Germany in April. The British Army is scheduled to receive a total of 148 tanks, with the first units entering service in 2025. The project’s estimated cost is approximately $1.17 billion, and it is expected to support around 300 jobs at RBSL’s Telford facility, with an additional 450 positions across the UK defense supply chain.

(Picture source: Army Recognition) Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system. The tank also features upgraded targeting systems for the commander and gunner, including advanced thermal imaging. While the adoption of the smoothbore gun introduces an ammunition compatibility issue, the Ministry of Defence has partnered with German defense companies to develop a new Enhanced Kinetic Energy (EKE) round, suitable for both the Challenger 3 and the Leopard 2 tanks. The Challenger tank series has a long history, starting with the first Challenger during World War II, followed by the Challenger 1 in the 1980s and then the Challenger 2, which saw action in the 2003 Iraq War. The Challenger 3 continues this progression with modular armor upgrades and enhanced survivability features, including Active Protection Systems (APS). Previous trials on the Challenger 2 tested APS such as the Rheinmetall ROSY Rapid Obscurant System and the MUSS system, providing a basis for their integration into the Challenger 3. Additionally, the Challenger 3 is powered by a Perkins CV12-9A 26.1-liter V12 diesel engine, delivering 1,500 bhp, and utilizes a David Brown Santasalo TN54E transmission system with updated components. The development of the Challenger 3 reflects the UK's approach to modernizing its existing tank fleet rather than procuring new models from other countries. In a 2021 report, the Defence Select Committee noted challenges in the LEP, including budget overruns and delays. Later that year, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would upgrade 148 Challenger 2 tanks into Challenger 3 models through a contract with RBSL valued at £800 million. This contract solidified the selection of Rheinmetall’s upgrade proposal, which includes the 120mm smoothbore gun. Upgrades in the Challenger 3 include a digital electronic architecture, improved third-generation hydrogas suspension for mobility, and an enhanced fire control system.

In recent years, Iran has conducted missile attacks against Israel, and the B-2 Spirit is the only U.S. aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a bomb designed to target fortified facilities such as Iran’s nuclear sites. The Houthis have continued to attack merchant vessels in the Red Sea since October 2023, and CENTCOM’s strikes align with efforts to secure these waters against further disruptions to commercial shipping. The Houthis claim their attacks target vessels linked to Israel, the U.S., and the U.K., citing these countries' involvement in the Gaza conflict, although some targeted vessels have not been directly connected to the conflict. Additionally, Houthi attacks have seized one vessel, sunk two others, and led to the deaths of four sailors, prompting ongoing concerns about the group’s impact on maritime security. The Northrop B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy strategic bomber developed under the Advanced Technology Bomber program in the late 1970s. Launched during the Carter administration, the B-2 was designed to enhance the U.S. military’s ability to penetrate radar defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the Soviet Union. Originally intended to replace the Mach 2-capable B-1A, the B-2 program faced significant delays and rising costs, leading to extensive debate in Congress. The B-2 can carry up to 18,000 kg of ordnance, including conventional and nuclear payloads, and has a maximum unrefueled range of 11,000 km, with a service ceiling of 15,000 m. (Picture source: US DoD) Ultimately, the planned production was reduced from 132 units to 21, reflecting changing strategic priorities after the Cold War. Entering service in 1997, the B-2 made its combat debut during the Kosovo War in 1999 and has since been deployed in conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The B-2’s flying wing design, which lacks both a fuselage and tail, contributes to a reduced radar cross-section and increased aerodynamic efficiency, enabling extended range operations. The aircraft’s structure includes radar-absorbing materials and advanced flight controls for stability, allowing a two-person crew to operate the bomber. Maneuverability is achieved through a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust, supporting the aircraft’s low radar profile. The B-2 is equipped with the AN/APQ-181 radar, which provides multi-mode functionality to support navigation and target acquisition. During the RIMPAC 2024 exercise, the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit bomber also employed the QUICKSINK maritime strike capability, designed to sink surface vessels with modified JDAM precision-guided bombs, marking the first publicly reported test of this system. Conducted during the second SINKEX exercise, the test demonstrated the B-2’s capability in maritime strike roles. Developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, QUICKSINK converts JDAMs into precision-guided bombs equipped with GPS-assisted INS guidance, a radar seeker, and an Imaging Infrared camera, allowing them to target moving maritime threats. Ongoing modernization programs for the B-2, supported by a recent $7 billion contract with Northrop Grumman, focus on enhancing defensive and communication systems to address emerging threats, including cyber risks. (Picture source: US DoD) The B-2 can carry up to 18,000 kg of ordnance, including conventional and nuclear payloads, and has a maximum unrefueled range of 11,000 km, with a service ceiling of 15,000 m. Its bomb bays are configured to accommodate up to 80 GPS-guided bombs or two Massive Ordnance Penetrators for penetrating fortified targets. Powered by four non-afterburning turbofan engines, the aircraft can reach speeds of up to 1,010 km/h.

The enhanced protocols currently apply to a limited number of military installations, which had reportedly received concrete threats. These measures were implemented as of yesterday and will remain in place indefinitely. Similar Incidents in Germany This development follows similar actions taken in Germany earlier this year, where heightened security was introduced at various military bases due to concerns over sabotage. In August, the NATO Air Base in Geilenkirchen, near the borders of the Netherlands and Belgium, saw an increase in security measures due to a 'potential threat.' Additionally, a week earlier, a major German airbase near Cologne was temporarily locked down after concerns arose over possible water supply tampering. A soldier discovered a breach in the fence surrounding the base's drinking water facility, and abnormal readings were detected in the water. Similar security precautions were also implemented at another German NATO base for related reasons. The broader European security landscape has been deeply influenced by Russia's continued covert operations, which have included cyberattacks, sabotage, and espionage targeting NATO members and their critical infrastructure. The Belgian government’s response is part of a collective effort by European nations to safeguard military operations amidst these growing challenges. Pro-Russian hacker groups have previously targeted Belgian infrastructure, and while no official connection has been made, this escalation follows a pattern of cyber and physical sabotage that has been observed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine​. Security analysts have noted that these incidents are likely part of a larger strategy to disrupt Western military and defense logistics. Recent events such as the attempted sabotage of water supplies at German airbases and fire incidents at defense facilities have put NATO countries on high alert. The possibility of espionage and sabotage being used to weaken European military capacities, especially those involved in supporting Ukraine, continues to be a significant concern for NATO and EU member states alike.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/belgian-military-barracks-tighten-security-amid-sabotage-and-espionage-threats	2024-10-17T00:31:39-07:00

Textron Creates Next-Gen XM204 Top Attack Mine System for Tactical Obstacles Against Tanks	At the AUSA 2024 exhibition, held from October 9 to 11 in Washington, D.C., the American company Textron is presenting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) System, a new type of system developed under the U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program to block enemy armored vehicles by deploying mines. Equipped with autonomous sensors, the XM204 TA can launch mines to create complex tactical obstacles, combining top and bottom attacks. Its mobility could be further enhanced through drone transport, as demonstrated at the event.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Textron XM204 Top Attack Mine System could be further enhanced through drone transport (Picture source: Army Recognition) Textron’s XM204 Top Attack (TA) system marks a significant advancement in terrain-shaping obstacle technology, designed to meet the U.S. Army’s temporary requirements for top-attack anti-vehicle capabilities, specifically to support U.S. Army Europe Command (USAREUR). Used as a standalone solution or in conjunction with other systems, it enables the creation of complex obstacles by combining top and bottom attacks, especially when deployed alongside the XM343 Standoff Activated Volcano Obstacle (SAVO) system. The operational concept of the XM204 TA involves several steps: once manually armed, the system activates its ground sensors and submunitions to autonomously detect, track, and engage multiple vehicle targets. Its detection and tracking process relies on seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors, paired with an explosively formed penetrator (EFP) warhead for top attack, maximizing its effectiveness against weaker vehicle armor. The operational stages include target detection, submunition deployment, engagement area scanning, target confirmation, EFP charge activation, and, ultimately, target destruction. The U.S. Army’s Terrain Shaping Obstacles (TSO) program aims to develop and deploy defense systems that create tactical obstacles to slow down, divert, or immobilize enemy armored vehicles on the battlefield. These obstacles, which include technologies such as the XM204 Top Attack (TA) system, are designed to be autonomous and used in diverse operational scenarios to enhance the combat brigades' counter-mobility capabilities. The TSO allows forces to create temporary yet effective barriers that exploit specific terrain areas to block the advance of enemy armored formations, particularly in open and sparsely vegetated environments. The XM204 Top Attack (TA) is an autonomous anti-vehicle system designed to attack armored vehicles from above, targeting their vulnerability in the upper armor. After being manually activated by a soldier, the XM204 uses a combination of seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors to detect, track, and identify enemy vehicles within a 100-meter radius. When a target is confirmed, the system deploys submunitions equipped with explosively formed penetrator (EFP) charges to engage and neutralize the vehicle. The EFP detonates either above or near the target, maximizing the damage to render the vehicle inoperable. Designed to function autonomously after activation, the XM204 is resistant to active protection systems, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and deactivation attempts. It is also equipped with programmable self-destruct timers (4 hours, 48 hours, or 15 days), ensuring the area’s safety after engagement. This system thus allows the creation of effective obstacles against armored vehicles in strategic zones without requiring continuous monitoring. The XM204 TA features a 'Zone of Authority' (ZOA) with a 100-meter diameter, providing extensive engagement area coverage. It is designed to resist active protection systems, smoke, thermal and radiofrequency jamming, and mechanical deactivation attempts, making it a robust counter-mobility tool suitable for varied terrains and conditions. The system is also recoverable, reusable, and equipped with visual safety indicators to alert on its arming status. The XM204 can be deployed quickly by hand and is resistant to unauthorized handling. It also offers three manually programmable self-destruct durations—four hours, forty-eight hours, or fifteen days—to meet specific mission requirements in the field. This system will be fielded for the first time in the U.S. Army during the 2025 fiscal year, thus meeting the Army’s modernization priorities, including long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, and soldier lethality. Mounting the XM204 Top Attack (TA) on a drone would provide significant strategic advantages by increasing its range, mobility, and flexibility on the battlefield. While the system is currently limited to manual and ground-based deployments, integration on a drone would enable the XM204 to be transported over long distances, precisely positioned in hard-to-reach or hazardous areas, and used to create anti-vehicle obstacles in regions where ground forces cannot safely intervene. Additionally, the drone could relocate or reposition the XM204 based on enemy movements, optimizing its autonomous multi-target engagement capability through its advanced seismic, acoustic, and radar sensors. This combination with a drone would transform the XM204 into a dynamic, responsive defense system capable of creating mobile obstacles and adapting to the evolving needs of a modern combat environment. Several stakeholders are involved in the development of this system, including the Project Manager Close Combat Systems (PM CCS) within the Joint Program Executive Office for Armaments and Ammunition, in collaboration with Textron Defense Systems and centers of excellence such as the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence. The Combat Capabilities Development Command Armaments Center also provides critical functions within the program.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/textron-creates-next-gen-xm204-top-attack-mine-system-for-tactical-obstacles-against-tanks	2024-10-16T03:28:09-07:00

What’s new in Canada’s upgraded Leopard 2A6MC2 Main Battle Tank?	As noted by Jeff2146 on October 15, 2024, the German television network ARD 1 recently aired footage believed to show the first public appearance of Canada’s Leopard 2A6M C2 tanks during a tour of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) facilities. The Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN is an upgraded Canadian variant of the German Leopard 2A6 main battle tank, created by converting 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks under a $76 million contract with KMW. This overhaul includes upgrades to optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces, replacing outdated analog technology with modern components to improve their operational lifespan.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN overhaul includes upgrades to optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces, replacing outdated analog technology with modern components to improve the operational lifespan of the Leopard 2A6M CAN. (Picture source: ARD 1) In February 2023, Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand stated that Canada plans to replace the Leopard 2 tanks sent to Ukraine, though specific timelines for these acquisitions have not been disclosed. Meanwhile, Canada is preparing to upgrade its remaining Leopard 2 tanks through a Leopard Long Term Support Contract (LTSC), which aims to keep the fleet operational until 2035. Department of National Defence spokesperson Jessica Lamirande explained that the LTSC will include maintenance, upgrades, supply chain management, and technical support. At that time, the contract was estimated between $730 million and $1.09 billion, or approximately $44 million to $64 million per year. Canada released an Advanced Contract Award Notice in August 2022, awarding KMW a sole-source position for the LTSC, with a formal contract published on September 13, 2024, valued at $710,732,013.98. The LTSC encompasses various Leopard 2 models within Canada’s military, including main battle tanks like the 2A4 CAN, 2A4M CAN, 2A6M CAN, and 2A6M C2 CAN, as well as Leopard 2 ARV CAN armored recovery vehicles, Leopard 2 AEV CAN engineering vehicles, and specialized equipment such as the Mine Clearing Roller System (MCRS), Track Width Mine Plow (TWMP), dozer blades, add-on armor, and slat armor. Canada is preparing to upgrade its remaining Leopard 2 tanks through a Leopard Long Term Support Contract (LTSC), which aims to keep the fleet operational until 2035. (Picture source: ARD 1) Maintenance responsibilities will involve systems integration, engineering, configuration and obsolescence management, depot-level inspections, and spare parts supply. The contract also specifies the provision of technical and field service representatives, who will provide in-depth support and guidance for the maintenance processes. Additionally, Canada awarded KMW a separate contract worth $76 million in June 2022 to repair, overhaul, and convert 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks to align with the 2A4M configuration. The modifications include updating optics, fire control systems, and user interfaces with more modern components, as the existing analog technology is considered obsolete. According to available information, the first conversion was completed and accepted by Canada in 2022, establishing a reference model for the rest of the fleet. Conversion work on the remaining 19 tanks began at FFG Canada’s Bathurst facility in spring 2023, with completion expected by the end of 2025. These upgraded tanks will be designated as Leopard 2A6M C2 CAN. The LTSC encompasses various Leopard 2 models within Canada’s military, including main battle tanks like the 2A4 CAN, 2A4M CAN, 2A6M CAN, and 2A6M C2 CAN, as well as Leopard 2 ARV CAN armored recovery vehicles and Leopard 2 AEV CAN engineering vehicles. (Picture source: ARD 1) As reported by Army Recognition in October 2023, modernization efforts for the Leopard 2 fleet are under consideration, with Army Lt. Col. Chloeann Summerfield indicating that further upgrades will cost over $620 million. These enhancements may include improvements to protection, surveillance, target acquisition, firepower, and mobility. Canada expects to issue a request for industry bids by 2028, with the first upgraded tanks anticipated to be operational by 2030. This modernization aims to align Canadian Leopard 2 configurations with those of NATO allies to enhance interoperability. Financial considerations are a significant factor in the Canadian government’s plans for its tank fleet. Canada’s defense budget is already allocated toward major projects, such as the procurement of F-35 fighter jets, surface combatant ships, and P-8 patrol aircraft, limiting available funds for new tank acquisitions. Although the government announced plans to replace the tanks sent to Ukraine, no further information has been released, and financial constraints may delay this process. Canadian defense analyst Martin Shadwick has highlighted that Canada’s approach to tanks has varied over time, noting that a 2003 decision to retire the Leopard fleet was reversed in favor of lighter vehicles, only to be reinstated when tanks were deployed in Afghanistan. The future of Canada’s tank fleet remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether Canada will acquire new tanks in the immediate future. To address maintenance needs, Canada has increased the use of contracted Field Service Representatives (FSRs) from KMW since 2018, allowing for specialized technician support at Army facilities across the country. Additionally, adjustments to the training and management of Canadian technicians are intended to strengthen maintenance capabilities and ensure sufficient technical support during periods of increased demand. The Canadian Army has emphasized that these changes are part of broader efforts to maintain the operational readiness of the Leopard 2 fleet, with the LTSC anticipated to play a critical role in sustaining the tanks until their projected end-of-service date in 2035. The Leopard 2A6M CAN C2 seems to retain the weaponry of the Leopard 2A6M CAN, which is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun and two 7.62mm machine guns. (Picture source: ARD 1) Currently, Canada operates 74 Leopard 2 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) in three main variants: 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. Additionally, 52 older Leopard 1C2 tanks remain in storage. In addition to these tanks, the Canadian Army has around 30 recovery and engineering vehicles, including 5 Buffalo Armoured Engineering Vehicles (AEVs) and 18 Wisent 2 vehicles, as well as 12 BPz-3 Büffel Armoured Recovery Vehicles (ARVs). With 8 tanks donated to Ukraine and 15 Leopard 2A4 tanks now deployed to Eastern Europe as part of NATO’s bolstered presence since the onset of the Ukraine conflict, questions have arisen about the readiness and condition of Canada’s remaining tanks. National Defence spokesperson Dan Le Bouthillier emphasized that Leopard 2 tanks, like other heavy vehicles, require extensive maintenance and inspections. On average, these tanks spend about 30% of their time in maintenance, which includes scheduled inspections. In response to reports that Canada was allegedly cannibalizing certain tanks to maintain others, Le Bouthillier clarified that such practices are only permitted under specific and urgent circumstances, with authorization from local commanders. He noted that no Leopard 2 tanks have been permanently decommissioned to support other units. Canada's defense policy contends with limited defense spending and a complex security environment. In 2023, the defense budget was about 1.38% of GDP, below NATO’s 2% target. However, Canada ranks seventh in NATO for absolute defense spending, with some modest increases in outlays planned. Plans include doubling its NATO Enhanced Presence Battlegroup in Latvia by 2026 and committing more than $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine, along with continuing training under Operation Unifier. Currently, Canada operates 34 Leopard 2A4 tanks designated for training, 20 upgraded Leopard 2A4M tanks, and 20 Leopard 2A6M tanks. (Picture source: Canadian MoD) The Leopard 2A6M CAN is a Canadian version of the German Leopard 2A6 main battle tank, deployed in 2007 to address operational needs in Afghanistan. Canada initially assessed its Leopard C2 tanks but determined that they were insufficient for the region's conditions, particularly due to a lack of air conditioning, which impacted crew performance. Consequently, Canada arranged for the German Bundeswehr to loan twenty Leopard 2A6 tanks, which were then modified by KMW to include mine protection and other adjustments to meet Canadian Army requirements. This deployment aimed to enhance vehicle protection and provide a more suitable platform for Canadian forces in Afghanistan's demanding operational environment. The Leopard 2A6M CAN includes several modifications unique to this variant. Enhancements consist of a mine protection package to reinforce the tank's underside, specific communications and anti-IED jamming equipment mounted on the turret, and stand-off slat armor for additional defense. An air conditioning unit and cooling vests were later added to reduce heat strain on the crew, alongside Saab Barracuda camouflage mats to decrease heat absorption by 50 percent. The initial twenty tanks were on loan from Germany, configured with MG3 machine guns, while subsequent tanks, procured from the Netherlands, were integrated with C6 GPMGs for consistency with Canadian forces. Upon returning to Canada in 2011, features like ECM boxes and slat armor were removed, yet the Canadian Army retained and continues to modify these tanks. In terms of specifications, the Leopard 2A6M CAN is equipped with a 1,500-horsepower MTU diesel engine and RENK transmission, enabling a top speed of 68 km/h and a range of 550 km on roads. It is armed with a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun, with a wide range of elevation, and two 7.62mm machine guns. The tank, weighing 62.3 tons in combat, can traverse obstacles up to 1.1 meters high and 3 meters wide. Other features include modular and composite armor, NBC protection, and options for additional modular armor. These characteristics contribute to the tank’s operational capabilities in various combat scenarios.

Rafael expands Iron Beam laser family with new mobile variant on Tatra chassis	At the AUSA 2024 exhibition, the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems introduced a new version of its Iron Beam High Energy Laser Weapon System (HELWS), mounted on a Tatra T815-7 8x8 truck chassis. Expected to be operational by late 2025, this 100kW system aims to provide a cost-effective component of Israel's air defense by countering drones, rockets, and mortars.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link To date, the Iron Beam family includes multiple versions under development, such as a 100kW variant, this 50kW mobile truck-mounted Iron Beam-Mobile (Iron Beam-M), and a lighter 10kW system, Lite Beam, designed for larger infantry vehicles. (Picture source: Army Recognition) To date, the Iron Beam family includes multiple versions under development, such as the 50kW mobile truck-mounted Iron Beam-Mobile (Iron Beam-M), expected to complete its 18-month development phase by late 2025, and a lighter 10kW system, Lite Beam, designed for larger infantry vehicles and anticipated to be operational within two years. On September 12, 2024, Yoav Turgeman, CEO of Rafael, confirmed that the Iron Beam would be deployed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 2025. This laser system will integrate with the Iron Dome, allowing coordination between missile interceptors and the laser-based system. According to Rafael, the Iron Beam can direct up to 100 kilowatts of laser power at aerial targets, destroying them in seconds. The effective range of the system, which can handle short- and medium-range threats, is up to 7 kilometers, depending on weather conditions and the type of target. The system has undergone tests, including those conducted by the IDF in 2022, demonstrating its ability to intercept drones, mortar bombs, and missiles. One notable aspect of the Iron Beam system is its lower cost per interception compared to traditional missile systems. Each use of the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, significantly less than the $40,000 to $50,000 per interception for the Tamir missiles used in the Iron Dome. The system also has an unlimited firing capacity, requiring no reloads, and reduces the potential for collateral damage by not producing debris from intercepted threats. This is particularly relevant in light of ongoing military engagements, where Israel has faced a shortage of Iron Dome missiles, and the economic impact of the Gaza conflict has exceeded $67.3 billion, according to Israeli economists. Each use of the Iron Beam is estimated to cost up to $1,000, significantly less than the $40,000 to $50,000 per interception for the Tamir missiles used in the Iron Dome. (Picture source: Army Recognition) Turgeman also highlighted the effectiveness of Rafael's Python 4 and Python 5 missiles, which have countered drones and cruise missiles during recent Iranian attacks. While the Python 4 missile has been in service for several decades, Rafael continues to develop the 'Skysonic' system, aimed at providing hypersonic interception capabilities. Rafael has been working on directed-energy systems for over 30 years. In collaboration with Lockheed Martin, it is developing an enhanced version of the Iron Beam, which could achieve power levels up to 300 kW by using multiple beams to engage several targets simultaneously. This development is funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. At AUSA 2024, Rafael confirmed that the 100kW version is entering production, with fielding expected by the end of next year. The Iron Beam, also known as 'Magen Or' or 'Shield of Light,' was first revealed at the Singapore Airshow in 2014. The system uses fiber laser technology to intercept various aerial threats, including short-range rockets, artillery, mortar bombs, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It can function as a stand-alone system or as part of a larger air defense network. The Iron Beam is part of Israel's broader missile defense strategy, complementing systems such as Arrow 2, Arrow 3, David's Sling, and Iron Dome. A naval version is also under development for Israeli Navy ships, such as the Reshef-class corvette, with operational readiness expected within four to five years.

In April 2022, tests confirmed the Iron Beam's ability to intercept drones, rockets, mortar bombs, and antitank missiles. Following these trials, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced plans to deploy the system to Israel's southern border with the Gaza Strip, where it could be tested in active conflict scenarios, including during the 2023 Israel–Hamas conflict. The system is expected to reach full operational capacity by the end of 2025, with coordinated defense using both missile interceptors and laser technology. Moreover, Rafael, in collaboration with Lockheed Martin, continues to enhance the Iron Beam's capabilities, with future developments expected to enable it to reach higher power levels and engage multiple threats simultaneously. The Iron Beam's fiber laser system can achieve a maximum effective range of up to 7 kilometers, neutralizing targets within seconds of contact. By 2023, the technology had advanced to a point where the laser could deliver energy levels exceeding 100 kW, with the beam focused to the diameter of a coin at distances of up to 10 kilometers. However, the effectiveness of high-energy lasers like the Iron Beam can be influenced by atmospheric conditions such as rain or clouds, which may limit the laser's ability to hit its target. The system also requires sustained focus on a moving target for several seconds to deliver enough energy to destroy it, which could reduce its effectiveness against multiple simultaneous threats, such as rocket barrages. In addition, certain targets may be equipped with materials designed to resist laser attacks, further limiting the system’s effectiveness.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/rafael-expands-iron-beam-laser-family-with-new-mobile-variant-on-tatra-chassis	2024-10-15T23:49:11-07:00

Polish Navy The Polish Navy is undergoing a substantial transformation as part of the country's broader military modernization efforts, but it faces several key challenges. A major hurdle is the aging of its fleet, which is currently in a state of transition. The modernization programs, such as the Miecznik frigate and Orka submarine projects, are intended to address this, but there remains a significant gap between the retirement of older vessels and the operational readiness of new platforms. For example, Poland’s outdated Kobben-class submarines have been retired, and the Orka submarine program, which seeks to acquire modern ocean-going submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion and long-range missiles, has been delayed several times. These delays risk a near-term capability gap until new vessels become operational. The shift from a littoral (Baltic Sea) focus to a more oceangoing 'blue-water' navy is another significant challenge. This transformation reflects Poland’s changing security environment and growing international responsibilities, such as securing energy supply routes and managing long-range maritime logistics. However, this change demands a large investment in new ships, infrastructure, and training, adding to the financial and logistical pressures on the Navy​.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/poland-begins-construction-of-final-kormoran-ii-class-minehunter-orp-czajka-in-gdansk	2024-10-15T07:21:40-07:00

US Navy Demonstrates New At-Sea Missile Reloading System for Warships	According to information published by the US DoD on 7, October, 2024, the Navy showcased a groundbreaking rearming system designed to reload warships at sea, in a recent demonstration at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Sailors from the Navy and USS Chosin (CG 65) demonstrate reloading a MK 41 Vertical Launching System cell. (Picture source: DVIDS) The event featured the Transferrable Rearming Mechanism (TRM), which successfully transferred a missile canister along cables to simulate the reloading of a ship’s MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) cell. This demonstration involved sailors from the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group and crew members from the USS Chosin (CG 65). The TRM allows for at-sea replenishment of munitions, potentially reducing the time a warship would need to spend in port for resupply. Comments This capability enhances both strategic and tactical flexibility. Strategically, the Navy can maintain a forward presence without frequent interruptions for resupply, keeping vessels on station longer and increasing mission endurance. Tactically, the ability to rearm during operations enables quicker adaptation to evolving threat environments. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where maintaining a constant missile loadout is critical, such as anti-air warfare, missile defense, and strike operations. From an operational standpoint, the TRM could significantly reduce dependency on fixed supply chains, allowing task forces to operate further from logistical bases. This reduces vulnerabilities, as adversaries may target supply hubs or transit routes in an effort to limit naval power projection. In contested regions, where port access might be constrained, the TRM provides a degree of independence from shore-based infrastructure, improving the Navy's ability to operate in hostile environments. However, the implementation of at-sea rearming will require adjustments. First, the technical and procedural aspects of using such a system in real-world conditions, especially during combat or high-threat scenarios, need to be thoroughly validated. Safety and efficiency concerns in transferring heavy missile canisters across cables in potentially rough seas will also require attention. Training sailors to operate the system effectively and integrating it into existing replenishment doctrines will be key to realizing its potential. In terms of broader strategic implications, the TRM contributes to the concept of distributed maritime operations (DMO). By decentralizing logistical capabilities, the Navy can distribute forces more widely across a theater.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-demonstrates-new-at-sea-missile-reloading-system-for-warships	2024-10-14T05:07:21-07:00	
US Marine Corps famous America's Squadron welcomes first F-35B Block 4 stealth fighter	On October 11, 2024, the US Marine Corps' Fighter Attack Squadron VMFA-533, under Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) 31 and part of the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), received its first F-35B Lightning II Block 4 stealth fighter jet at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Beaufort, South Carolina. This arrival establishes VMFA-533 as the Marine Corps’ second operational F-35B squadron on the East Coast and the first operational F-35B squadron at MCAS Beaufort.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The F-35B Block 4's arrival establishes the VMFA-533 as the Marine Corps’ second operational F-35B squadron on the East Coast and the first operational F-35B squadron at MCAS Beaufort. (Picture source: US DoD) Prior to this, only the US Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 operated F-35 aircraft at the station, focusing on core introduction and fighter/attack training for new F-35 pilots. VMFA-533, known as 'America’s Squadron' for its red, white, and blue insignia, has a history that dates back to 1943. It was initially commissioned as Marine Night Fighter Squadron 533 (VMF[N]-533) and has operated various aircraft over the decades, including the F6F Hellcat, F7F Tigercat, F2H Banshee, F9F Cougar, and A-4 Skyhawk. In 1965, the squadron transitioned to the A-6 Intruder and was redesignated Marine Attack Squadron 533 (VMA-533). In 1992, it converted to the F/A-18 Hornet, remaining an F/A-18 unit for 31 years until its redesignation to VMFA-533 in September 2023. Since then, the squadron has completed preparations for the F-35 transition, including achieving 'Safe for Flight' certification. The arrival of the F-35B to VMFA-533 initiates deliveries to MCAS Beaufort’s operational squadrons and continues the 2nd MAW’s transition from legacy fixed-wing tactical aircraft to the F-35 platform. The F-35 Lightning II, developed by Lockheed Martin as part of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program starting in 1995, aimed to create a versatile stealth fighter to replace multiple aging aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the A-10 Thunderbolt II, the F/A-18 Hornet, and the AV-8B Harrier II. Lockheed Martin's X-35 was chosen over Boeing's X-32 in 2001, leading to the creation of three variants: the F-35A is the Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL) variant, featuring an internal cannon and optimized for maneuverability. The F-35B is the Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) version, with a unique lift fan for vertical flight capabilities. Lastly, the F-35C, the Carrier Variant (CV), is built for catapult launches and arrested landings on aircraft carriers, with larger wings for better low-speed control and the longest range among the three models. The F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft was developed to replace aging vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft such as the AV-8B Harrier II. (Picture source: USMC) In the US armed forces, the F-35A variant is operated by the United States Air Force, with 1,763 planned units. It is currently based at multiple locations, including Moody AFB, Eglin AFB, and Hill AFB, among others. Key wings include the 388th Fighter Wing at Hill AFB, the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB, and units across the Air Education and Training Command. The Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard also host squadrons at various bases, supporting both training and operational missions globally. The F-35B is operated by the United States Marine Corps, with 340 aircraft planned. The Marine Corps utilizes this variant at installations like Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni in Japan, MCAS Yuma in Arizona, and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina. Notable Marine Fighter Attack Squadrons (VMFAs) include VMFA-121, VMFA-242, and VMFA-211, which are deployed on amphibious assault ships and forward bases, providing flexibility for rapid deployment in varied combat environments. The F-35C is the carrier-capable variant designed for the United States Navy and Marine Corps, with 260 Navy and 80 Marine Corps aircraft planned. The Navy operates F-35Cs from NAS Lemoore in California, with squadrons such as VFA-97, VFA-115, and VFA-125, while Marine Corps squadrons like VMFA-311 and VMFA-314 are based at MCAS Miramar. This variant is built for catapult launches and arrested landings on aircraft carriers, featuring larger wings for improved low-speed control and the longest range among the three variants, enhancing the Navy's capabilities for extended maritime operations.

The Marine Corps utilizes this variant at installations like Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni in Japan, MCAS Yuma in Arizona, and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina. (Picture source: USMC) The F-35B, specifically, is the world’s first operational supersonic STOVL aircraft, capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings due to its integrated Rolls-Royce Lift System. This system includes a lift fan, drive shaft, and a Three-Bearing Swivel Module that allows for vectoring the engine’s thrust downwards for vertical flight. The F-35B can transition between conventional flight and STOVL mode, which is vital for operations from shorter runways or amphibious assault ships. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 27,300 kg and can perform vertical landings with a gross weight limit of 18,415 kg. The F-35B has a wingspan of 10.7 meters, a length of 15.4 meters, and an internal fuel capacity of 6,045 kg, which is less compared to the F-35A and F-35C. Its range on internal fuel is approximately 900 nautical miles (1,670 km), and it has a combat radius of 469 nautical miles (845 km). The F-35B is equipped with advanced avionics such as the AN/APG-81 AESA radar, AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and an Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS), enhancing its situational awareness and target acquisition capabilities. The F-35B's internal weapons bay, which is slightly smaller than those of the other F-35 variants to accommodate the lift fan, can carry two AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles and two 1,000-pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) or other compatible payloads while maintaining stealth. Additionally, it supports a variety of external weapon configurations, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder for air-to-air engagements, GBU-12 Paveway II laser-guided bombs, and up to two 1,500-pound weapons on its outermost wing pylons. For close air support, the F-35B is fitted with an optional 25 mm GAU-22/A gun pod, mounted externally on the aircraft’s centerline. The F-35B is capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings due to its integrated Rolls-Royce Lift System, which includes a lift fan, drive shaft, and a Three-Bearing Swivel Module that allows for vectoring the engine’s thrust downwards for vertical flight. (Picture source: USMC) Initiated in 2019, the Block 4 upgrade for the F-35 introduces over 75 enhancements, marking the most significant modernization phase for the F-35 Lightning II to date. Specifically, it increases the fighter's missile carriage by incorporating systems like the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile and the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, expanding its combat reach and flexibility. The Block 4 suite also includes the AN/APG-85 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, which provides enhanced detection capabilities, and upgrades to the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) for improved 360-degree situational awareness. These upgrades enable the F-35 to carry a wider range of precision-guided munitions, allowing it to engage both air and ground targets more effectively. Technology Refresh-3 (TR-3) serves as the backbone of Block 4, providing a major overhaul to the F-35’s computing and data-processing systems. At the heart of TR-3 is a new Integrated Core Processor (ICP) developed by Lockheed Martin, which offers over 25 times the processing power of its predecessor. This ICP is paired with a new Panoramic Cockpit Display and an enhanced Memory System, supporting advanced applications and enabling the integration of future technologies. TR-3 also introduces an open mission systems architecture, making the F-35 more adaptable to rapid updates and capable of hosting additional software-driven capabilities, such as advanced sensor fusion and AI-assisted targeting. The upgrade package is completed by the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) by Pratt &amp; Whitney, which addresses the cooling and thrust needs generated by the new Block 4 capabilities. The ECU provides increased bleed air (compressed air taken from the engine) required for the jet's enhanced electronic systems, while simultaneously boosting engine durability and fuel efficiency, allowing for an expected $40 billion in lifecycle cost savings. This enables the F-35 to operate at higher temperatures and power levels, optimizing the platform for sustained, high-intensity missions. Initiated in 2019, the Block 4 upgrade for the F-35 introduces over 75 enhancements, marking the most significant modernization phase for the F-35 Lightning II to date.

Iran Missile Strikes on Israel Reveal Limits of Ballistic Missile Threat in Modern Warfare	According to information published by Business Insider on October 12, 2024, Iran's recent missile strikes on Israel highlight a growing debate about the effectiveness of ballistic missiles in modern warfare. Despite their ability to deliver sudden, destructive blows, the real-world impact of these weapons appears to be less decisive than their reputation suggests.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Crane clearing debris from Iranian missiles fired on Israel. (Picture source: Twitter account of Israel Defense Forces) In two high-profile attacks, Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, yet the results were underwhelming. In April, a barrage of 300 missiles and drones was largely intercepted by Israeli and allied defense systems, while a subsequent strike in October saw a higher percentage of missiles breaching defenses but causing minimal damage overall. While these attacks made headlines with their dramatic visuals—explosions, fiery streaks across the sky—the aftermath tells a different story. Critical infrastructure remains functional, public morale appears undeterred, and the Israeli military continues its operations. This mirrors the experience of Ukraine, which has endured repeated Russian missile attacks over two years without a collapse in its fighting capacity. Such resilience raises questions about whether the threat posed by ballistic missiles is overstated. Ballistic missiles have long been feared for their potential to strike without warning, following a high-arcing path before slamming into targets at high speed. This threat, dating back to World War II with Nazi Germany's V-2 rockets, has only grown as more countries—31 at present—develop their own missile capabilities. Yet, history shows that ballistic missiles, despite their lethality, rarely decide wars on their own. Whether in the 1980s Iran-Iraq conflict, the 2015 Houthi missile strikes on Saudi Arabia, or recent conflicts involving Israel and Ukraine, missile barrages have inflicted damage but failed to break the will of the targeted populations. Modern ballistic missiles are more accurate than their historical counterparts, aided by advanced guidance systems like GPS. Still, even high-tech missiles often miss precise targets, and the damage inflicted is often limited compared to the massive bombing raids of previous wars. In World War II, for example, Allied forces dropped millions of tons of bombs on Germany without compelling surrender, showing that even overwhelming firepower from the air has its limits. Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, reportedly numbering around 3,000, may seem formidable on paper, but in practice, even a simultaneous launch of all these weapons would face significant interception and accuracy issues. Furthermore, the damage caused by those that do get through would likely be less than a single large-scale bombing raid from the past. Ballistic missiles remain a potent symbol of military power, and their proliferation is a legitimate concern, especially if used to target infrastructure or as a means of political coercion. However, as Iran's attacks on Israel suggest, these weapons alone are unlikely to secure a decisive victory in war.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/iran-missile-strikes-on-israel-reveal-limits-of-ballistic-missile-threat-in-modern-warfare	2024-10-14T03:10:16-07:00	
North Korea Attempts to Down South Korean Modern Drone with Old KS-19 Anti-Aircraft Guns	On October 13, 2024, according to Yonhap, North Korea ordered its artillery units, including eight brigades stationed near the South Korean border, to be on high alert and prepared to engage in response to alleged South Korean drone incursions over Pyongyang. North Korea’s General Staff directed these brigades, which reportedly include older KS-19 100mm anti-aircraft guns, to be fully armed and set in wartime configuration. Pyongyang accused South Korea of flying drones over its capital multiple times earlier in the month. In a statement, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry warned that any further incursions would be met with a military response, describing such actions as 'acts of war.'Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link South Korea RQ-101 Songgolmae fixed-wing UAV from Korea Aerospace Industries (Picture source: Wikimedia) Meanwhile, South Korea denied any airspace violations, condemning North Korea's recent use of propaganda balloons and waste-filled devices across the border, which South Korea views as provocations disrupting the security of its border regions. This exchange of accusations has intensified tensions along the Demilitarized Zone, with both countries expanding their military drone programs. While North Korea has made drone development a strategic priority, recently unveiling a suicide attack drone, South Korea is preparing to counter potential escalations with its own advancements in drone technology. The South Korean military employs a variety of High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE) drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, primarily to monitor North Korean military activities and potential security threats. These drones play a critical role in enhancing South Korea’s border surveillance, maritime monitoring, and intelligence capabilities. Among the HALE assets is the RQ-4 Global Hawk, capable of operating at high altitudes for extended periods, providing broad-area coverage with real-time intelligence over long distances. For medium-altitude operations, South Korea utilizes MALE drones such as the KUS-FT, developed by Korea Aerospace Industries. The RQ-101 Songgolmae is a fixed-wing UAV designed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) primarily for reconnaissance. With a wingspan of 6.4 meters and a maximum takeoff weight of 290 kg, it has a range of up to 200 km and an endurance of approximately 6 hours. This drone is equipped with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras and GPS/INS navigation systems, which allow it to gather high-resolution images and real-time intelligence over long distances. Operating at altitudes of up to 4,500 meters, the Songgolmae is especially useful for monitoring the heavily militarized border areas, giving South Korea crucial surveillance capabilities without risking personnel​. South Korea, in collaboration with Boeing, is working on a new High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) drone development project designed to enhance its surveillance capabilities, particularly for monitoring North Korea. This initiative stems from a Memorandum of Understanding signed between South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Boeing in April 2023, aiming to build a South Korean-manufactured HALE UAV that benefits from Boeing's design expertise and technological support. The joint project intends to position South Korea at the forefront of advanced UAV production, with a focus on developing a model suited for long-endurance reconnaissance missions. South Korea's Air Force operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones, a high-altitude, long-endurance platform developed by Northrop Grumman. The RQ-4 operates at altitudes up to 60,000 feet with a range of over 12,000 miles, equipped with advanced radar and infrared sensors for long-range surveillance. It can remain airborne for over 30 hours, covering extensive areas and providing high-resolution imaging, making it a valuable tool for observing North Korea's military movements. South Korea also uses KUS-FT drones, developed domestically by Korea Aerospace Industries. The KUS-FT operates at medium altitudes, up to 30,000 feet, with an endurance of around 24 hours. Equipped with electro-optical and infrared sensors, it is designed for tactical reconnaissance and can conduct close monitoring along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), complementing the broader surveillance provided by HALE drones like the Global Hawk. South Korea’s drones are tailored for intelligence-gathering missions that allow for extended coverage of North Korean activities, including potential missile launch sites, military movements, and cross-border provocations. By leveraging drones with high-definition imaging, infrared vision, and real-time data links, the South Korean military can maintain a continuous, low-profile surveillance presence. These capabilities reduce the need for manned flights, minimizing risk while maximizing reach and responsiveness. Furthermore, United States operates RQ-4 Global Hawk drones in collaboration with South Korea to monitor North Korean activities across the Korean Peninsula. These high-altitude, long-endurance UAVs are stationed at Sacheon Air Base in South Gyeongsang Province, where they serve as a crucial part of South Korea's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Delivered through a strategic partnership, four Global Hawks were supplied to South Korea's Air Force between 2019 and 2020, as part of a defense initiative to enhance South Korea’s monitoring capabilities against regional threats​. The Global Hawk drones, designed by Northrop Grumman, are equipped with high-resolution synthetic aperture radar and electro-optical/infrared sensors, allowing them to capture detailed images of large areas, including North Korean military installations and missile sites. This UAV fleet is capable of covering up to 100,000 square kilometers in a single flight, which is approximately the size of South Korea, enabling comprehensive border surveillance and intelligence sharing between U.S. and South Korean forces​. This collaboration not only enhances South Korea’s situational awareness along the demilitarized zone (DMZ) but also strengthens interoperability with U.S. forces, who are stationed in the region as part of a defense alliance. These joint efforts aim to maintain a high level of readiness against North Korean provocations, ensuring a rapid response to emerging threats in the region. North Korea’s recent provocations include frequent missile tests and the development of drones, which serve both strategic deterrence and as direct responses to perceived threats from South Korea and the U.S. In 2023 alone, North Korea test-fired a variety of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-15 and Hwasong-17, capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. The Hwasong-17, one of its most advanced ICBMs, is estimated to have a range of up to 15,000 kilometers and can potentially carry multiple warheads or countermeasures designed to evade missile defenses. This long-range capability adds to North Korea’s growing arsenal of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles that can target South Korea and U.S. bases in Japan. Additionally, North Korea has enhanced its maneuverable, solid-fueled missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept, posing a significant challenge to South Korean and U.S. missile defenses. Beyond missiles, North Korea has also advanced its drone program, often utilizing these unmanned aerial systems as tools of psychological and military provocation. The North has deployed drones capable of surveillance and, potentially, small payloads. This was evident in recent incidents where North Korean drones allegedly crossed into South Korean airspace, heightening tensions on the peninsula. Combined with North Korea’s efforts to send balloons with propaganda and waste materials into the South, these drones add a new layer to Pyongyang’s tactics, aiming to provoke and destabilize without direct engagement, a strategy that allows it to maintain pressure on its adversaries while avoiding immediate military escalation. These provocations underscore North Korea’s commitment to demonstrating its military capabilities and maintaining a high-stakes environment in the region. As a reminder on July 27, 2023, North Korea unveiled two new drones, the 'Morning Star-4' and 'Morning Star-9,' which closely resemble the U.S.-designed MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. These drones, categorized as High-Altitude Long-Endurance (HALE) and Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance (MALE), are intended for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and ground-strike missions. Despite significant challenges posed by U.N. sanctions, North Korea appears to have made strides in replicating these advanced models, possibly influenced by prior incidents involving captured U.S. drones in Iran. However, questions remain about the drones’ actual capabilities and North Korea’s access to advanced SATCOM technology, sparking speculation of potential foreign assistance. The capabilities of North Korean artillery brigades to shoot down South Korean surveillance drones are limited due to the anti-aircraft equipment available. North Korea primarily uses anti-aircraft guns like the ZU-23 23 mm and the KS-19 100 mm, which are designed to target low-flying aircraft rather than high-altitude drones. These systems lack the precision and tracking abilities needed to effectively engage modern MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) or HALE (High Altitude, Long Endurance) drones used by South Korea. To intercept surveillance drones operating at higher altitudes, North Korea would require modern surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) with radar or infrared guidance, capable of tracking high-speed targets over long distances. Although North Korea possesses older SAMs, such as the Soviet-era SA-2 and SA-3, these systems are not sufficiently accurate to reliably target modern drones. Consequently, South Korean high-altitude drones remain less vulnerable to North Korea’s conventional artillery defenses.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/north-korea-attempts-to-down-south-korean-modern-drone-with-old-ks-19-anti-aircraft-guns	2024-10-14T02:46:25-07:00	
Turkiye and Serbia Sign Defense Cooperation Agreement Focused on Drone Technology	According to information published by Middle East Monitor on October 12, 2024, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić announced a strategic collaboration between their countries in the defense industry during an official visit to Belgrade.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Bayraktar TB3 Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle. (Picture source: Navy Recognition) This agreement includes joint efforts in military technology, particularly focusing on drones, a sector where Turkey has become a global leader. Erdoğan emphasized that Turkish drone technology, including the renowned Bayraktar TB2 systems, would be an integral part of this cooperation. Turkish Defense Industry in Balkan countries Several Balkan countries have purchased Bayraktar TB2 drones from Türkiye, reflecting the growing military ties between the region and Ankara. Kosovo, which has been working to strengthen its defense capabilities, received its first batch of Bayraktar TB2 drones in July 2023. This acquisition is viewed as a strategic move amid ongoing tensions with Serbia, and it has been reported that Kosovo bought five drones, although the exact number remains unconfirmed​. Albania also joined the ranks of Bayraktar TB2 buyers in 2022, purchasing three drones to support both military and civilian operations, including surveillance and firefighting efforts. Bosnia and Herzegovina recently followed suit, placing an order for at least six Bayraktar TB2 drones in 2024. This move is designed to bolster its defense capabilities amid the complex security dynamics of the Balkans. Turkey’s role is not without challenges. Its involvement in the defense sectors of both Serbia and Kosovo positions it at the center of regional tensions. The sale of advanced weapons to countries in close proximity, often with competing interests, requires a careful diplomatic balance. Turkey has used its military strength and its defense industry to foster partnerships, positioning itself as a reliable supplier of advanced military technology, but it must also be wary of exacerbating existing conflicts. In the Balkans, Turkish arms sales serve not only as an economic driver but also as a tool for increasing Ankara’s regional influence. The Balkan states, many of which are NATO members or aspirants, see Turkish military technology as a valuable addition to their security frameworks. Turkey’s defense industry policy in the Balkans is a calculated mix of economic strategy, geopolitical ambition, and military influence. As Turkey continues to expand its defense exports, its ability to manage the complex political landscape of the Balkans will be crucial to its long-term success in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/turkey-and-serbia-sign-defense-cooperation-agreement-focused-on-drone-technology	2024-10-14T02:15:11-07:00	
Germany Launches Technical Talks with Türkiye for Eurofighter Fighter Jet Sale	With German Chancellor Olaf Scholz scheduled to visit Türkiye on October 19, 2024, Germany has greenlit technical discussions with Türkiye for a potential sale of Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. This decision, taken in a confidential meeting by the German Federal Security Council, marks a shift from Berlin, which had previously blocked the sale over concerns that these aircraft could be used against Kurdish armed groups in Syria and Iraq. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase (Picture source: Eurofighter) The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, multi-role combat aircraft developed by a European consortium composed of Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom under Eurofighter GmbH. Used by several European nations and Saudi Arabia, the Typhoon is designed to perform air superiority missions, airspace defense, interdiction, close air support, and reconnaissance. Its delta-wing configuration, combined with advanced control systems and optimized aerodynamic instability, delivers exceptional agility and speed, reaching up to 2,495 km/h. Equipped with two EUROJET EJ200 engines, the Typhoon offers robust power and redundancy for secure operations both in peacetime and in conflict. Technologically, the Typhoon stands out with its CAPTOR radar, a mechanically scanned system that can evolve to AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, providing long-range detection, advanced air-to-ground capability, and enhanced electronic protection. This radar offers a broad field of view optimized for both aerial and ground engagements. The Typhoon’s weaponry includes 13 hardpoints for missiles and bombs, with configurations tailored to mission requirements: air-to-air AMRAAM and ASRAAM missiles, anti-radar and anti-ship missiles, and guided bombs. This weapon system, coupled with advanced piloting controls such as voice-commanded VTAS (Voice Throttle and Stick), maximizes in-flight effectiveness and reduces pilot workload, enabling swift responses in demanding combat scenarios. The Eurofighter consortium, consisting of Germany, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom, fully supports the potential sale of 40 Eurofighters to Türkiye, valued at approximately $5.6 billion. The agreement gained momentum following a meeting between Chancellor Scholz and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the UN General Assembly in New York last month. The technical talks, expected to last about three weeks, will cover aircraft specifications, acquisition stages, personnel training, and maintenance and spare parts management protocols. The first batch could include 24 aircraft, with the remaining 16 delivered in a later phase. Additionally, sources close to the matter indicate that Chancellor Scholz might be seeking an agreement to expedite the repatriation of approximately 15,000 Turkish nationals whose asylum requests were denied in Germany, thereby strengthening ties between Berlin and Ankara. Airbus, one of Eurofighter's main partners, has actively supported efforts to navigate political challenges. Simon Ward, head of Airbus in Türkiye, even suggested that Eurofighters could arrive in Türkiye sooner than anticipated. While the start of technical talks does not guarantee a finalized sale, this move is seen as a significant indication of Germany’s openness amid rising regional tensions, particularly with the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the ongoing Gaza crisis. Turkish defense officials suggest that acquiring the Eurofighter would provide Türkiye’s air force with AESA radar technology for the first time, significantly enhancing its capabilities. Turkish experts view the Eurofighter as an optimal interim solution while Türkiye awaits the integration of its domestic KAAN fighter jet and American F-16 Block 70s into its fleet. The outcome of these talks could also pave the way for broader military-economic partnerships between Germany and Türkiye, a development closely observed by other Eurofighter consortium members. In conclusion, this initiative marks a turning point in bilateral relations and highlights the complexity of defense negotiations in Europe, shaped by geopolitical dynamics and regional security imperatives.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/germany-launches-technical-talks-with-tuerkiye-for-eurofighter-fighter-jet-sale	2024-10-14T02:06:03-07:00	
Australia’s new AS9 Huntsman 155mm howitzer makes first appearance in South Korea for testing phase	As reported by Mason on October 12, 2024, the Australian variant of the K9A1, the AS9 Huntsman, was reportedly observed in South Korea for the first time. It is likely that the 155mm self-propelled howitzer was transported by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development (ADD), which is responsible for developing the K9 Thunder and conducting various testing and evaluation services.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Australian variant of the K9 Thunder, later known as the AS9, is set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, quality assessment tests for mass-produced military products, performance tests for export items, and performance enhancement evaluations. The prospect of Australia acquiring the South Korean K9 Thunder was first publicly discussed in June 2005, when discussions began between Australian and South Korean defense officials about potential trade opportunities, including the K9 Thunder and Australian naval gun ammunition. By August 2009, Samsung Techwin and Raytheon Australia became leading contenders for Australia’s Land 17 artillery replacement program, as other bidders did not provide sufficient detail. Testing of the K9 platform commenced in April 2010, and the vehicle successfully fired the M982 Excalibur, meeting key requirements for the program. The proposed Australian variant, later known as the AS9, was set to include NATO-standard fire control systems, anti-tank mine protection, and an enhanced suspension to accommodate its weight. One possibility is that the AS9 was taken to ADD's Changwon Proving Ground, where the agency performs developmental testing and evaluation for military equipment, and performance tests for export items. (Picture source: Twitter/Mason) In June 2010, the K9 was announced as the preferred option for the Land 17 program. However, funding for the project was redirected due to floods in Queensland in 2011, leading to the program’s cancellation in 2012. In 2019, then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia planned to acquire 30 K9 howitzers and ten K10 ammunition resupply vehicles, although no specific timeline was provided at that time. In September 2020, Australia issued a tender for Hanwha Defense Australia to locally produce 30 K9 variants as part of the Land 8116 Phase 1 project. The Australian variant, based on the Norwegian K9 VIDAR, was to include enhancements first proposed in 2010, alongside up-to-date modifications. In December 2021, the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG) and Hanwha Defense Australia formalized a $788 million contract for the production of 30 AS9 howitzers and 15 AS10 armored ammunition resupply vehicles at a new facility in Geelong, Victoria. Hanwha’s Geelong facility, the Hanwha Armoured Vehicle Centre of Excellence (H-ACE), began construction in April 2022. This 150,000-square-meter site includes a 1.5-kilometer test track and various R&amp;D areas, with plans to create 300 jobs for local specialists. Through international partnerships, including a $67 million deal with Norway’s Kongsberg Gruppen for Integrated Combat Solutions (ICS) and a contract with Hanwha Systems worth 20.8 billion KRW, Hanwha Defense Australia has integrated various systems into the AS9. The AS9 Huntsman, a 155mm/52-caliber self-propelled howitzer, has a maximum firing range of 40 kilometers with standard ammunition and can reach up to 60 kilometers with specialized rounds. (Picture source: Australian MoD) Mass production of the AS9 and AS10 began at H-ACE in 2024, and the first deliveries to the Australian Army are expected by 2027. The AS9 includes an enhanced suspension system, additional armor for increased protection, and a fire control system from Kongsberg, which allows for integration with other Australian defense assets. These modifications align with the Australian Army’s specific requirements and distinguish the AS9 from the original K9 Thunder. Capable of firing three rounds in 15 seconds and sustaining a rate of six to eight rounds per minute, the AS9 is also equipped with a semi-automated loading system.

US Army accelerates M113 replacement with new $184 Million AMPV order	On October 9, 2024, BAE Systems received a $184 million contract modification from the U.S. Army for an additional 48 Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV), building on the existing full-rate production agreement. The AMPV Family of Vehicles (FoV) is being introduced to replace the older M113 series in the U.S. Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs), offering modernized capabilities in survivability, mobility, and interoperability. The contract modification will support the Army’s plan to expand its fleet of AMPVs, thereby modernizing and improving the operational flexibility of the ABCTs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles (AMPV) program was initiated with a $383 million EMD contract in 2014, producing 29 prototypes before entering low-rate production to deliver 289 vehicles by 2020. (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV lineup includes five specialized variants, each designed for specific roles: the M1283 General Purpose (GP), M1284 Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), M1285 Medical Treatment Vehicle (MTV), M1286 Mission Command (MC), and M1287 Mortar Carrier. The M1283 GP variant is utilized for resupply, maintenance, and casualty evacuation operations. The M1284 MEV is equipped for medical evacuation, accommodating up to six ambulatory personnel or four patients on litters. The M1285 MTV functions as a mobile medical treatment facility, supporting battlefield care with equipment typically found in civilian ambulances. The M1286 MC variant supports mission command functions, enhancing command, control, and communication within the ABCT. The M1287 Mortar Carrier provides indirect fire support using the M121 Mortar System and the M95 Mortar Fire Control System. The AMPV program has been pursued to address the limitations of the M113, a platform that has been in service since the 1960s. Although versatile, the M113 has shown vulnerabilities in modern combat scenarios, particularly during the Iraq War where urban warfare tactics exposed its weaknesses. The Army subsequently adopted Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles for active service. However, the AMPV is intended to offer enhanced off-road mobility, similar to that of the M2 Bradley and M1 Abrams, making it more suitable for a variety of operational environments.

(Picture source: US DoD) This follow-on order represents the Army’s shift in acquisition priorities, following the cancellation of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. Initially, the GCV was intended to replace M2 Bradley vehicles within the ABCT, but cost constraints led to a preference for the AMPV program, estimated to cost over $5 billion, compared to the $37 billion projected for the GCV program. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office highlighted the AMPV as a more feasible option, and the Army’s FY 2015 budget proposal reflected a reallocation of resources to focus on AMPV production. BAE Systems, in response to the contract modification, has expanded its production capabilities, particularly at its York, Pennsylvania facility. Alongside facilities in South Carolina, Alabama, Arizona, and Michigan, this network is designed to meet current and projected demand for AMPVs. The expansion aligns with the Army’s objective to gradually increase production, reaching full-rate production after an initial low-rate production phase that began in 2018. Production plans include an incremental ramp-up, from 57 vehicles in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 to 122 units annually by FY 2026 and FY 2027, before reducing in later years. The AMPV program’s phased approach began with a $383 million Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) contract awarded to BAE Systems in 2014. This phase produced 29 prototypes, followed by a low-rate production phase to supply 289 vehicles by 2020. General Dynamics initially contested the AMPV requirements, claiming the design favored the BAE Bradley chassis. However, the Army Materiel Command dismissed the protest, stating that BAE’s manufacturing of the M113 and Bradley provided certain logistical advantages that did not constitute preferential treatment. The AMPV’s modular design aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. (Picture source: US DoD) Following this decision, General Dynamics did not pursue further action through the Government Accountability Office but continued to advocate a mixed fleet concept to Congress. This proposal suggested combining tracked Bradley and wheeled Stryker vehicles, which General Dynamics argued could enhance mission flexibility and reduce life-cycle costs. The AMPV’s modular design allows for future upgrades in communications and electronic systems, supporting the Army’s strategy of leveraging commercial off-the-shelf components. This approach aims to manage operational costs, which for the AMPV are estimated at $90 per mile, compared to the M113’s $58 per mile. By allowing for incremental upgrades, the Army plans to incorporate new technologies over time, including satellite communications, further integrating the AMPV into the digital battlefield. Looking forward, the AMPV program includes potential future variants designed for counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) roles. One such variant may feature the Leonardo DRS Maneuver Short Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) turret, equipped with a 30mm XM914 cannon, a 7.62mm M240 machine gun, and Stinger missile launchers. This development aligns with the Army’s intent to adapt the AMPV for a range of defense scenarios within the ABCT framework, while also considering international interest in the platform. The AMPV shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for the US Army's Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs). (Picture source: US DoD) The AMPV continues to replace the M113 in Army units, such as the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division, which recently replaced over 130 M113s with AMPVs after completing necessary training. This replacement supports the Army’s Next Generation Combat Vehicle Modernization Priority, with AMPVs designed to withstand threats from mines, improvised explosive devices, and direct fire. Their design shares common elements with the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109A7 Paladin, simplifying maintenance and logistics for ABCTs. BAE Systems has also developed additional variants to fulfill specific mission requirements. Recently, a turreted mortar variant was introduced, equipped with the Patria NEMO 120mm remote-controlled mortar system. This variant provides responsive fire support within the ABCT. With the full-rate production now underway, BAE Systems will continue to supply AMPVs to the U.S. Army, fulfilling both current operational needs and potential future requirements as the Army transitions its fleet to more modernized combat vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-army-accelerates-m113-replacement-with-new-184-million-ampv-order	2024-10-14T00:26:14-07:00

Breaking News: US Authorizes Deployment of THAAD Air Defense Missile in Israel to Counter Missile Threats from Iran	On Sunday, October 13, 2024, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had authorized the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to Israel at the direction of President Joe Biden. This move comes in response to recent escalations, including Iran's ballistic missile attacks on Israel in April and October of this year. Ryder emphasized that the deployment would strengthen Israel’s air defense capabilities amid heightened regional tensions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A U.S. Air Force Airman unloads an American THAAD air defense missile system from a C-17 Globemaster III at Nevatim Air Base, Israel, on March 1, 2019. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) This is not the United States' first deployment of THAAD in the region. President Biden directed a similar deployment last year, following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, to protect American troops and interests. The U.S. also deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 as part of a joint training and integrated air defense exercise. The new deployment adds to Israel’s already robust air defense systems, which include the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow 3 systems, designed to intercept threats ranging from short-range rockets to long-range missiles. THAAD, or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase—right before impact—providing a crucial layer of defense against missile threats. THAAD’s key strength lies in its ability to intercept threats at both high altitudes and long ranges, making it particularly effective against ballistic missiles. The system can engage targets at ranges of up to 200 kilometers and at altitudes exceeding 150 kilometers, far beyond the reach of most missile defense systems, allowing it to neutralize warheads before they reenter the atmosphere. Iran possesses one of the largest and most diverse missile arsenals in the Middle East, comprising a wide range of short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles. The country has developed several missile systems, such as the Shahab, Ghadr, and Sejjil series, capable of striking targets throughout the region, including Israel and U.S. military bases. Some of Iran’s missiles, like the Shahab-3, have a range of over 1,000 kilometers, while more advanced systems like the Sejjil-2 have ranges that extend beyond 2,000 kilometers, potentially reaching parts of Europe. These missiles can carry conventional or, in a worst-case scenario, nuclear warheads, though Iran insists its missile program is defensive. In addition to ballistic missiles, Iran has also developed cruise missiles, which are more difficult to detect and intercept due to their low-altitude flight paths. Iran’s missile capabilities, combined with its ability to produce and modify these systems domestically, pose a significant strategic threat in the region, especially to adversaries like Israel and the United States. These missiles have been central to Iran’s military strategy, allowing it to project power and retaliate against potential threats without relying solely on conventional forces. Against Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, which includes a variety of long-range and medium-range systems, THAAD offers a significant defensive advantage.

This victory, Ukraine's first in air-to-air combat using the F-16, was achieved with the advanced AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, known for its infrared homing and high maneuverability. The AIM-9X, widely regarded for its lethality, gives the F-16 a significant edge in dogfights, able to engage enemy aircraft at high angles and within close-range combat scenarios.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Historic Moment: Ukrainian F-16 Claims First Air-to-Air Victory by Downing Russian Su-34 Fighter-Bomber The F-16 Fighting Falcon is renowned for its versatile air-to-air combat capabilities, combining advanced avionics, radar systems, and an array of precision-guided missiles. One of its standout features is the AN/APG-66(V2) radar, which allows it to track multiple targets simultaneously while providing enhanced detection range and precision. The F-16 can carry a range of air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM for beyond-visual-range engagements and the AIM-9X Sidewinder for close-range dogfighting. Thanks to its off-boresight capability, the AIM-9X's ability to lock onto targets from extreme angles makes it particularly lethal in close-quarters combat. This mix of radar-guided and infrared-guided weapons enables the F-16 to dominate in both long-range and short-range engagements​. Compared to other contemporary fighter aircraft, such as Russia’s Su-35 and MiG-31, the F-16 has certain advantages regarding agility and electronic warfare capabilities. While the Su-35 boasts superior long-range radar and missile systems, the F-16 compensates with its superior maneuverability and integrated electronic warfare systems like the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System (PIDS), which deploys countermeasures to evade radar-guided threats. This agility, coupled with advanced helmet-mounted cueing systems that allow pilots to engage targets by simply looking at them, gives the F-16 a distinct advantage in close combat​. Moreover, the F-16’s multirole capabilities make it adaptable for a range of missions beyond air-to-air combat, including ground-attack roles. In air-to-air confrontations, however, its ability to engage multiple targets at various ranges and its integrated defensive measures provides a balanced approach to modern aerial warfare. While Russian aircraft like the Su-35 may have superior radar range, the F-16’s electronic warfare and countermeasures systems, combined with its superior dogfighting agility and modern missile systems like the AIM-9X, allow it to compete effectively against modern Russian fighters in both defensive and offensive air operations​. The AIM-9X Sidewinder missile is a state-of-the-art air-to-air weapon that has revolutionized modern dogfighting. Its infrared (heat-seeking) guidance system allows it to detect and lock onto the heat signature of an enemy aircraft, typically from the engines, making it highly effective against fast-moving targets. What sets the AIM-9X apart from previous iterations is its 'high off-boresight' capability. This means that the pilot doesn’t need to be directly facing the enemy to fire; the missile can target and hit aircraft even at extreme angles relative to the jet's flight path. This off-boresight capability is paired with a helmet-mounted sight (HMS) system, enabling the pilot to simply look at a target to guide the missile. This feature drastically reduces the reaction time needed in close air engagements, a critical advantage when pilots maneuver at high speeds and in high-threat environments. Moreover, the AIM-9X is known for its agility and ability to perform sharp turns, allowing it to stay locked onto highly agile enemy fighters. In addition to the AIM-9X, the F-16 itself offers a combination of speed, radar systems, and maneuverability that make it a formidable platform for air-to-air combat. Equipped with beyond-visual-range missiles (such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM) alongside the AIM-9X, the F-16 can engage enemies both at close range and from distances where visual contact is not required. This first victory in air-to-air combat for Ukraine marks a significant milestone in the conflict, demonstrating the growing capability of the Ukrainian Air Force thanks to NATO's continued support in terms of advanced weaponry and pilot training. The F-16, paired with the AIM-9X, offers a significant edge in aerial warfare against Russian aircraft like the Su-34, which are typically less maneuverable in close engagements​.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-ukrainian-f-16-fighter-wins-first-air-to-air-fight-shoots-down-russian-su-34	2024-10-13T08:20:31-07:00
