(Picture source: Russian MoD) During recent joint exercises of the Russian Navy and Aerospace Forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Russian Ministry of Defense released a video showcasing the launch of a 3M55 P-800 Onyx multi-purpose supersonic tactical missile from the K-340P launcher of the Bastion-P coastal missile system. This demonstration highlighted the Bastion-P system’s capabilities, underscoring its operational flexibility and strategic importance in Russia’s coastal defense framework. The Bastion-P, developed by NPO Mashinostroyenia, is a highly mobile coastal defense platform designed to shield coastlines from various threats, including surface vessels and amphibious forces. Mounted on a high-mobility MZKT-7930 chassis, the system can quickly deploy across diverse terrains, offering rapid-response capabilities crucial in dynamic conflict scenarios. At the heart of the system is the P-800 Onyx missile, known by its NATO reporting name 'SS-N-26 Strobile.' The Onyx is a supersonic missile capable of reaching speeds up to Mach 2.5 and engaging targets at ranges of up to 600 kilometers, depending on operational conditions. Its versatility allows it to strike both naval and land-based targets with precision, even in adverse weather conditions. This recent launch underscores the Bastion-P’s role in enhancing Russia’s anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) strategy. The system integrates advanced radar and target acquisition technologies to detect, track, and engage enemy vessels effectively, solidifying its position as a cornerstone of Russia’s maritime defense network. The P-800 Onyx missile's supersonic speed and sophisticated guidance systems enable it to evade modern air defense systems, making it a significant deterrent against adversarial forces. For NATO and U.S. naval forces, systems like the Bastion-P, armed with the P-800 Onyx missile, present significant challenges. The high speed and low radar cross-section of the Onyx make it difficult for conventional shipborne air defense systems, such as the U.S. Navy’s Aegis Combat System or NATO’s Sea Ceptor, to intercept effectively. The missile’s ability to perform complex maneuvers in its terminal phase further reduces the likelihood of successful interception. Additionally, the system's long-range allows it to engage targets well beyond the immediate coastal area, threatening aircraft carriers, destroyers, amphibious assault ships, and logistics vessels critical to NATO’s power projection capabilities. In a broader strategic context, the Bastion-P system enhances Russia’s ability to enforce maritime exclusion zones, a concept central to its A2/AD doctrine. Such zones restrict the operational freedom of NATO and U.S. naval forces, complicating their ability to provide support in contested areas like the Eastern Mediterranean, the Black Sea, or the Arctic. This threat is particularly acute for carrier strike groups, which rely on secure operational areas to launch air missions. The presence of advanced coastal missile systems forces NATO forces to adopt costly and complex countermeasures, such as deploying electronic warfare systems, long-range standoff weapons, or preemptive strikes to neutralize threats. The deployment of the Bastion-P system in the Eastern Mediterranean aligns with Russia’s regional strategic goals. Given the area’s increased naval activity, including operations by NATO forces, this exercise demonstrates Russia’s ability to secure critical maritime zones and maintain a credible defensive posture. By emphasizing its advanced coastal defense systems, Russia reinforces its capability to protect vital sea lanes and safeguard national interests. This successful demonstration highlights the operational readiness of Russian forces and the importance of modern coastal defense systems in contemporary military strategies. As regional tensions and maritime competition continue, the Bastion-P system, armed with the formidable P-800 Onyx missile, remains a vital asset in Russia’s defense arsenal, posing a credible and evolving challenge to NATO and U.S. naval operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/focus-russian-navy-demonstrates-p-800-onyx-supersonic-cruise-missile-power-during-mediterranean-drills	2024-12-05T06:22:33-08:00

Syrian Rebels capture Syrian Army's most modern T-90A tanks in major offensive	As reported by Tendar on December 4, 2024, Syrian opposition forces have captured several T-90 and T-90A tanks, among the most modern combat vehicles supplied by Russia to the Syrian Army. These tanks, equipped with sophisticated firepower, protection systems, and mobility features, could significantly enhance the rebels’ combat capabilities. Their acquisition occurs amid an escalating conflict, where the Syrian Army is increasingly abandoning intact, modern Russian-supplied equipment during retreats, particularly following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Of the 30 T-90 and T-90A main battle tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been abandoned by the Syrian Army and captured by opposition forces. (Picture source: Twitter/Tendar and T-90K) During a recent offensive in Syria, opposition forces, including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), captured significant quantities of Russian military equipment left behind by retreating Syrian government forces. To date, this included between six and eight T-90 and T-90A tanks, a Russian-made 48Ya6-K1 Podlet-K1 low-altitude surveillance radar system, a Buk-M2 air defense system, and one of two ZSU-23-4M 'Mahmia' vehicles equipped with Sarab-2 countermeasures. A Pantsir-S1 air defense system was also seized. Additionally, older systems such as T-72M and T-55 tanks, BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, a BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher, two BREM recovery vehicles (BREM-1 or BREM-2), and a 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer were captured. At Neyrab Air Base near Aleppo, opposition forces seized eight L-39 Albatros light jets and three MiG-23 fighter aircraft. The range of equipment captured highlights the extent of material losses suffered by the Syrian Army. Among the captured equipment, the T-90 and T-90A tanks are particularly significant. Of the 30 T-90 tanks delivered to Syria by Russia in 2015, approximately 10 have now been captured during this new offensive. Earlier incidents also reveal a consistent pattern of equipment loss. In 2016, a T-90A was captured by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham during clashes near Aleppo, marking the first documented instance of this tank falling into opposition hands. That unit has since been observed in various operations. Another T-90 was captured in 2020 during a government retreat. These incidents underscore vulnerabilities in securing advanced equipment during Syrian Army withdrawals. The latest captures occurred amid an offensive following the rebel seizure of Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. This marked the first time opposition forces had taken control of Aleppo since 2016. The offensive, led by HTS, progressed into Hama province after capturing key installations such as the 87th Brigade base and a tank school. Despite breaching Hama’s defenses, opposition forces were eventually pushed back by counterattacks from Syrian government troops, supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militias. The captured T-90A tank provides Syrian rebels with notable combat capabilities due to its modern design and equipment. It is armed with a 125mm 2A46M-5 smoothbore gun, capable of engaging targets at distances up to 5 kilometers with precision, including while the tank is in motion. The tank supports the use of guided missiles and various ammunition types, including armor-piercing and high-explosive shells. Its fire control system, equipped with ESSA TPV thermal imaging and night vision devices, enhances target detection and engagement in low-visibility conditions, offering operational utility in nighttime or urban environments. The T-90A's armor includes Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, which is designed to reduce the effectiveness of anti-tank projectiles and missiles. The Shtora-1 active protection system is integrated to counter guided missile threats. Its 1,000-horsepower V-92S2 diesel engine supports mobility and maneuverability across diverse terrains. The compact design facilitates repositioning during combat. These features collectively enhance the tank's functional value for the rebels in scenarios where older or less capable armor is commonly encountered. The Syrian Army continues to face challenges in safeguarding its equipment during strategic retreats. The rapid advance of HTS and allied forces, combined with logistical constraints, has resulted in the abandonment of high-value assets. The Syrian military’s reliance on Russian-supplied systems, which are not fully integrated into its operational framework, further complicates its ability to manage withdrawals. Additionally, Russia’s focus on its own military commitments, including operations in Ukraine, has limited its capacity to provide immediate support to Syrian forces. These factors have contributed to repeated equipment losses, significantly impacting the Syrian Army’s overall operational capability. On the other hand, Syrian opposition forces have shown mixed capacities in effectively using captured tanks, including advanced models like the T-90A, against the Syrian Army. These capabilities are influenced by various factors, such as technical expertise, availability of spare parts, and tactical integration. Groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Free Syrian Army (FSA) have historically captured tanks during engagements, including T-55, T-72, and more advanced T-90A models. The T-90A, equipped with advanced thermal imaging, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor, and a powerful 125mm smoothbore gun, poses significant challenges for opposition forces to maintain and operate due to its sophisticated systems. Nevertheless, there have been instances where such tanks were employed effectively, including a confirmed case in 2017 where HTS militants used a captured T-90A against government forces. Recent offensives, particularly in northwestern Syria, have also resulted in the capture of additional tanks abandoned by retreating Syrian Army units near Aleppo and Idlib. However, opposition forces often struggle with sustaining these platforms due to limited access to skilled operators, logistical challenges, and an inability to repair complex damage. The integration of captured equipment is further hampered by fragmentation among opposition groups, varying levels of military training, and reliance on external support for anti-armor operations. Despite these limitations, the use of captured tanks provides a significant psychological and tactical boost, enabling rebels to counter Syrian Army advances when deployed strategically.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/syrian-opposition-captures-syrian-armys-most-modern-t-90a-tanks-in-major-offensive	2024-12-05T02:22:38-08:00

(Picture source: Russia Zvezdanews) The Kinzhal missile, which translates to 'Dagger' in Russian, is an air-launched hypersonic weapon designed to deliver unparalleled speed, precision, and power. Capable of traveling at speeds up to Mach 10 and performing evasive maneuvers during flight, the Kinzhal is a formidable weapon against both static and mobile targets. With a reported range of approximately 2,000 kilometers, it has the ability to strike critical assets such as aircraft carriers, command centers, and strategic infrastructure with minimal warning. The deployment of this missile on MiG-31I aircraft enhances Russia’s ability to project power across key regions, including the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The MiG-31I is a specialized variant of the MiG-31 interceptor, adapted to carry hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal. Compared to the original MiG-31, which was designed primarily for high-altitude interception of enemy aircraft, the MiG-31I has been optimized for carrying and launching large payloads, including hypersonic weapons. While retaining the original’s exceptional speed—capable of reaching Mach 2.8—the MiG-31I also benefits from enhanced avionics and missile integration systems tailored to the operational demands of hypersonic missile deployment. This transformation significantly expands the aircraft's combat capabilities, making it not only a high-speed interceptor but also a strategic strike platform. The operational integration of the MiG-31I and Kinzhal missiles is a continuation of Russia’s hypersonic strategy. In October 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that MiG-31 fighter jets equipped with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles would begin patrolling the Black Sea. This announcement underscored Moscow’s intent to establish a robust hypersonic deterrent in a region of heightened geopolitical tension, signaling Russia's readiness to counter perceived threats and assert its influence over contested areas. The Russian armed forces also operate another air-launched hypersonic missile system in limited service: the GZUR (Hypersonic Guided Airborne Missile). While less publicized than the Kinzhal, the GZUR is designed for tactical roles and can be deployed from multi-role fighter jets, expanding the operational flexibility of Russia’s hypersonic arsenal. Together, these two systems—the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal and the GZUR—form the backbone of Russia’s air-launched hypersonic capabilities, ensuring both strategic and tactical coverage in modern warfare. Hypersonic missiles like the Kinzhal and GZUR are revolutionizing modern warfare by challenging existing defense systems and reshaping strategic paradigms. The extreme speeds of hypersonic weapons drastically reduce the reaction time available to adversaries, making them difficult to intercept with conventional missile defense systems. Their ability to maneuver mid-flight further complicates defensive measures, effectively rendering many current systems obsolete. The proliferation of hypersonic weapons has also intensified the global arms race. As Russia advances its capabilities, other nations, including the United States and China, are accelerating the development of their own hypersonic systems. This technological race not only raises the stakes in global power competition but also introduces new risks, including the potential for miscalculation or unintended escalation in conflict zones. The deployment of hypersonic missiles in active theaters, such as the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, also poses emerging threats. The dual-use capability of hypersonic weapons, which can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads, adds ambiguity to their deployment. This uncertainty increases the risk of misinterpretation, particularly in high-stakes confrontations, potentially triggering disproportionate responses. Furthermore, the spread of hypersonic technology raises concerns about its potential acquisition by non-state actors, amplifying the threat to global security. Russia’s demonstration of its hypersonic capabilities in the Mediterranean is a clear message to both regional and global adversaries. By integrating advanced weapon systems like the Kinzhal and GZUR into its strategic arsenal and pairing them with high-performance aircraft like the MiG-31I, Moscow is not only solidifying its position as a leader in hypersonic technology but also reshaping the future of warfare. As these weapons continue to evolve, their role in military strategy is poised to grow, heralding a new era where speed, precision, and unpredictability define the battlefield.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/breaking-news-russian-mig-31i-fighter-jet-with-hypersonic-missile-in-military-exercise-demonstrating-new-threats	2024-12-05T01:26:23-08:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) The Long Range Maneuvering Projectile (LRMP) is designed to achieve a range exceeding 120 kilometers, approximately four times greater than conventional 155mm artillery rounds. This extended range is achieved through a Reuleaux triangle shape and foldable wings that enable the projectile to glide without auxiliary propulsion. A Reuleaux triangle is a curved triangle with constant width, formed from the intersection of three circular disks, each having its center on the boundary of the other two. This unique shape provides aerodynamic stability and is simpler than a circle to manufacture. Upon launch, the projectile ascends to an altitude of 12 to 14 kilometers, where its wings deploy for the glide phase toward the target. This system is intended for use in GPS-denied environments and enables the engagement of both static and moving targets. The guidance system for the LRMP incorporates technologies derived from General Atomics’ previous work in hypersonics, railguns, and unmanned systems. It includes onboard cameras and machine learning algorithms, which allow the projectile to visually track and adjust its trajectory in real time. Elements of the guidance system are based on technologies from the MQ-9 Reaper drone and the Vintage Racer program, contributing to its ability to function across multiple operational scenarios. Showcased at AUSA 2024, the LRMP is compatible with existing artillery systems, including legacy launchers, autoloaders, and handling equipment. Its modular payload supports different mission types, such as kinetic strikes and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations. A naval version for 127mm guns is under development, with a reduced range of 75 kilometers to address maritime applications. Initial testing has focused on validating the LRMP’s survivability, aerodynamics, and performance characteristics. Glide tests are scheduled at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, with additional tests planned during the contract period to confirm its capabilities. A full-scale model of the LRMP was exhibited at the AUSA 2024 event, showcasing its operational features. The project has been under development by General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS) for the past three years, funded internally by the company. Anticipating demand for extended-range precision artillery, GA-EMS is preparing for low-rate production by 2025. The company has also outlined plans for high-volume manufacturing, targeting production rates of up to 100,000 rounds per month. The Long Range Maneuvering Projectile (LRMP) incorporates a discarding sabot, which protects its internal components and wings during launch. Its size allows for a kinetic payload equivalent to a 120mm shell. The payload itself is being developed by an external partner, and the modular design accommodates ISR capabilities. These specifications align with the goals of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps to enhance artillery technologies. Development of similar long-range maneuvering artillery projectiles is underway across the defense sector. BAE Systems is working on the XM1155-SC, a munition under the U.S. Army’s Extended Range Artillery Projectile program, which aims to double the range of current 155mm rounds to engage targets at distances exceeding 109 kilometers. Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense and BAE Systems Bofors have developed the M982 Excalibur, a GPS-guided round capable of achieving ranges up to 40 kilometers with a circular error probable of 4 meters. Other efforts include Boeing and Norway’s Nammo, which have collaborated on a ramjet-powered 155mm projectile tested with the Army’s Extended Range Cannon Artillery prototype.

Breaking News: What are the Three US Land Mine Systems ADAM MOPMS and Volcano for Ukraine?	On December 2, 2024, The New York Times reported that the United States is set to provide Ukraine with a new batch of advanced land mine-laying systems. As part of its latest military aid package to Ukraine, the United States will provide three land mine systems designed to enhance Ukraine’s ability to secure critical terrain and impede enemy movement. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The ADAM 155mm (Area Denial Artillery Munition) is a precision-guided artillery shell designed to deploy anti-personnel mines over a wide area, creating rapid minefields for area denial. (Picture source: US RDECOM) These land mine systems include the M692/M731 Area Denial Artillery Munition (ADAM), the M131 Modular Pack Mine System (MOPMS), and the M136 Volcano mine-laying system. Each of these remotely delivered or manually deployed technologies offers unique capabilities: the ADAM delivers a rapid minefield using 155mm artillery, the MOPMS is a flexible, portable system for infantry use, and the Volcano is a vehicle-mounted dispenser capable of laying large-scale minefields over vast areas. Together, these systems will give Ukraine a powerful toolkit to fortify its defenses and slow the advance of Russian forces.1. M692/M731 ADAM: 155mm Area Denial Munition The M692/M731 ADAM is a 155mm artillery shell designed to deploy anti-personnel mines quickly across a broad area. This system, part of the U.S. Army's 'Family of Scatterable Mines' (FASCAM), was developed during the 1980s to enhance battlefield control by creating instant minefields. Each artillery round fired from a Howitzer delivers 36 mines, which are equipped with self-destruct features to minimize long-term risks to civilians. These mines either deactivate or self-destruct after a pre-determined period—typically 4 to 48 hours—ensuring that they do not pose a persistent threat once hostilities have subsided. Tripwires activate the mines in the ADAM system and feature a spherical warhead designed to create deadly shrapnel patterns. Upon activation, the warhead is launched to a height of 1 to 2 meters and detonates, releasing approximately 600 fragments that can incapacitate or kill enemy personnel within a wide radius. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance, addressing ongoing humanitarian concerns related to land mines.

(Picture source: U.S. DoD) 2. M131 MOPMS: Modular Pack Mine System The M131 Modular Pack Mine System (MOPMS) is a portable and flexible mine-laying system designed for rapid deployment by infantry or engineer units. It is primarily used for creating both anti-personnel and anti-vehicle minefields in various tactical scenarios. The system consists of modular packs, each containing a set of mines and components necessary for deployment. These packs are lightweight, typically weighing between 13 to 18 kg (30 to 40 pounds), allowing soldiers to carry and place them in the desired locations easily. MOPMS can deploy multiple types of mines, including M14 anti-personnel mines and M16 anti-tank mines. The mines can be configured to detonate either upon impact or after a set delay, providing tactical flexibility. The impact-triggered mines are designed to activate when a vehicle or personnel come into contact with them, while the timed mines can be set to explode after a specified delay, allowing troops to control the exact timing of the detonation. This feature enables military forces to adapt the minefield to the specific needs of the battlefield, such as blocking enemy movement, securing routes, or defending key positions. One of the key features of the MOPMS is that the mines it deploys are self-neutralizing. This means they either self-destruct or deactivate after a set period, which reduces the risk of unexploded ordnance harming civilians or friendly forces after the conflict. This self-destruct feature is an essential part of the system, addressing humanitarian concerns related to landmines in post-conflict zones. The system’s modular design also allows for flexibility in how it is deployed. Infantry units can manually place the mine packs in various configurations depending on the operational needs of the moment. Whether laying a minefield in dense forests, urban environments, or along critical choke points like roads or bridges, the MOPMS offers versatility in minefield creation. Furthermore, the system is compatible with military vehicles, enabling quicker deployment during larger operations. A U.S. Army vehicle-mounted M136 Volcano mine dispenser rapidly deploys a wide-area minefield, creating an effective barrier to block enemy movement. The system ejects mine canisters containing anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, dispersing them across a large area to deny access to critical routes and infrastructure. (Picture source U.S. DoD) 3. M136 Volcano: Vehicle-Mounted Mine Dispenser The M136 Volcano is a highly effective, vehicle-mounted mine-laying system designed to rapidly deploy anti-personnel and anti-tank mines across large areas. It is commonly mounted on various military vehicles, such as armored personnel carriers, engineering vehicles, and trucks, providing flexibility in deployment across different operational environments. The Volcano system uses M87 mine canisters, which hold up to six mines each. Depending on the configuration of the vehicle, the system can carry up to 24 canisters, allowing it to deploy a significant number of mines in a very short time. Once activated, the Volcano system rapidly disperses the mines in a predetermined pattern over a wide area, usually between 30 to 60 meters from the vehicle. This wide dispersion helps create a dense minefield that can block or disrupt enemy movement. The mines deployed by the Volcano include M14 anti-personnel mines and M15 anti-tank mines, both of which are designed to deny access to key areas, such as roads, fields, and critical infrastructure like bridges or supply routes. A critical feature of the Volcano system is its ability to set self-destruct or self-neutralizing functions for the mines. Each mine is equipped with a timer, ensuring that it either self-deactivates or self-destructs after a certain period—typically ranging from a few hours to several days—minimizing the risk of unexploded ordnance. This self-sanitizing feature significantly reduces long-term hazards to civilians or friendly forces once the immediate military need has passed. The system can be deployed from both ground and air platforms. While most commonly mounted on vehicles, it can also be delivered via helicopters, giving military commanders the flexibility to deploy minefields in a variety of terrains and scenarios. The Volcano can lay a minefield in just a few minutes, making it a highly efficient tool for creating instant area denial during combat operations. Tactically, the Volcano system is particularly valuable for halting enemy advances, especially in high-traffic areas like roads or chokepoints. The dense minefields it creates can slow down or halt both enemy infantry and armored vehicles, allowing friendly forces to secure key positions or gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, its rapid deployment and large mine-laying capacity make it a force multiplier for armored or mechanized units operating in concert with engineers. The provision of these mine-laying systems provides Ukraine with a broad range of options to disrupt and delay Russian forces. The ability to deploy mines remotely—either via artillery, vehicle, or infantry—gives Ukrainian forces flexibility in controlling and denying key terrain. These mine systems will be especially valuable in slowing Russian advances, protecting key infrastructure such as bridges and supply routes, and securing defensive positions. The U.S. has also ensured that these systems are 'non-persistent,' meaning that the mines will self-neutralize or self-destruct after a short time, reducing the risks to civilians after the mines' operational use. For Ukrainian commanders, the new systems significantly enhance their battlefield capabilities. The ADAM system provides rapid mine deployment over a large area, while the MOPMS and Volcano systems allow for more tactical, localized minefields. Together, these tools will help Ukraine to delay, disrupt, and inflict casualties on Russian forces, providing a force-multiplying effect on the battlefield. The addition of the ADAM, MOPMS, and Volcano mine-laying systems to Ukraine’s arsenal represents a strategic enhancement to its defensive capabilities. By providing both rapid, artillery-based and manual mine-laying solutions, the United States is enabling Ukraine to create powerful, flexible minefields that will impede enemy movements and protect vital positions. With these systems, Ukraine gains an important advantage in the ongoing conflict, ensuring that it can better control its territory and slow the advance of Russian forces while minimizing long-term humanitarian risks.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-what-are-the-three-us-land-mine-systems-adam-mopms-and-volcano-for-ukraine	2024-12-03T08:57:56-08:00	
Focus: What is Lockheed Martin’s Secret X-59 Experimental Supersonic Aircraft?	This article explains the Lockheed Martin X-59, an experimental supersonic aircraft developed with NASA to address the disruptive sonic boom. Designed to make commercial supersonic travel over land possible, the X-59’s innovative technologies could also revolutionize military aviation, offering advanced stealth and high-speed capabilities. We'll examine the aircraft’s aerodynamic design, challenges, and potential to transform civilian and military aviation.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On January 12, 2024, NASA and Lockheed Martin publicly unveiled the X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft at a ceremony at Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California. (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) The key to the X-59’s success lies in its unique aerodynamic design. Built by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works® division, the X-59 features an elongated fuselage and a specially designed long, pointed nose, which are critical to reducing the shockwaves that produce the sonic boom. These shockwaves are often heard as a loud, disruptive boom when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, especially near the ground. The X-59, however, aims to reshape those shockwaves into a softer, less noticeable 'thump', making the noise barely perceptible to the human ear. At the core of the X-59’s quiet supersonic flight technology is its ability to minimize the intensity of shockwaves that occur during the aircraft's supersonic passage. The aircraft achieves this through its unique design that ensures smooth airflow and minimizes disruptions that create noise. Its long, slender fuselage and forward-swept wings ensure that the aircraft flies efficiently at high speeds while reducing the loudness of any sonic disturbances. This quieter supersonic flight could open the door to a new era of high-speed air travel, making it possible for travelers to fly from New York to London in about three hours, halving the time of current commercial flights. On January 12, 2024, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works® marked a significant milestone in the X-59 program with a rollout ceremony held in Palmdale, California. This event celebrated not only the completion of the aircraft but also the culmination of years of research, development, and collaboration between Lockheed Martin and NASA. During the ceremony, John Clark, Vice President and General Manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works®, expressed his excitement about the project, stating, 'We’re thrilled to take on this challenge alongside NASA, whose quiet supersonic technology mission will have lasting, transformational impacts for people around the world. This project is just one example of the broader ingenuity of our industry as we continually strive to push the envelope of what’s possible.' The X-59 is a unique technology demonstrator aircraft, designed to generate a quieter, less disruptive sonic boom that would make supersonic travel over land feasible once again. The data collected from X-59 flight tests will be pivotal in shaping new aviation regulations for supersonic noise, which have traditionally been a barrier to commercial supersonic flight over populated areas. This data is expected to influence FAA and international regulators, potentially leading to the lifting of the ban on commercial supersonic flights over land, a restriction that has been in place since the retirement of the Concorde in 2003. While the primary focus of the X-59 is on commercial supersonic travel, its cutting-edge technology and aerodynamic innovations could have significant future applications in both the military and combat aviation sectors. The aircraft’s quiet supersonic flight capabilities may serve as a foundation for developing stealthier high-speed military aircraft. The X-59's low-noise supersonic flight is achieved by minimizing the shockwaves that lead to sonic booms, an approach that could be adapted to enhance the stealth capabilities of future military aircraft. A quieter supersonic jet would be harder to detect by enemy sensors, especially in high-speed combat scenarios where detection and evasion are critical. The ability to fly at supersonic speeds with reduced acoustic signatures would provide military aircraft with a distinct advantage, particularly in strike missions or reconnaissance over adversary territory. Moreover, the X-59's aerodynamic design, including its advanced wing and fuselage configuration, could significantly influence the development of next-generation fighter jets and bomber aircraft, where speed, agility, and stealth are paramount. The X-59's design's maneuverability and high-speed performance could provide valuable insights into optimizing future military aircraft for rapid, high-speed missions. The X-59’s advanced flight control systems, which ensure stability during high-speed flight, may also offer enhancements for future unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), contributing to more precise and efficient drone strikes or surveillance operations in hostile environments. Despite its remarkable promise, the X-59 faces the challenge of establishing new global aviation regulations allowing supersonic flight to resume over land. The current regulatory framework, established in the 1970s and reinforced by the Concorde’s retirement, bans commercial supersonic flights over land due to the disruptive impact of sonic booms. By generating a quieter, less intrusive sonic thump, the X-59 could prove that commercial supersonic flight is no longer an environmental burden, potentially leading to new international standards for acceptable supersonic noise levels. If successful, the X-59 could help set the foundation for the development of commercial supersonic airliners capable of providing faster-than-sound travel without disturbing people on the ground. It would also be a critical step in revolutionizing air travel by enabling airlines to offer shorter flight times, drastically reducing travel times between distant cities. The X-59 is a groundbreaking initiative in the field of supersonic aviation, and its successful development could bring about profound changes in the aviation industry. By overcoming the sonic boom challenge, Lockheed Martin and NASA are opening up new possibilities for supersonic air travel — ones that are faster, quieter, and more efficient than ever before. Beyond its civilian applications, the X-59’s innovative technologies could have major implications for military aviation, offering stealth and high-speed capabilities that could redefine modern combat strategies. As the X-59 moves into its flight test phase, it stands as a symbol of the future — a future where supersonic flight is not only a reality but one that is quiet, efficient, and transformational for both commercial and military aviation alike. With the world eagerly awaiting the X-59's test flights, this aircraft is setting the stage for the next generation of high-speed air travel and combat aviation.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/focus-what-is-lockheed-martins-secret-x-59-experimental-supersonic-aircraft	2024-12-03T08:29:45-08:00	
Analysis: Next-Generation Russian Shtorm Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier Set to Challenge US Nimitz Class	Russia’s 'Shtorm' next-generation nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, currently under development by the Krylovsky State Research Center, is shaping up to be a formidable competitor to the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz-class carriers, which have long been a cornerstone of Western naval power. The 'Shtorm' is set to be a nuclear-powered, multi-purpose warship capable of carrying a large air group, with several advanced features designed to enhance Russia’s ability to project power across distant regions, particularly in the Arctic. Although specific technical specifications are still emerging, the 'Shtorm' is expected to rival the Nimitz-class in terms of size, capabilities, and versatility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Graphic Illustration of the Future Russian Shtorm Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier. (Picture source: Russian social network) In terms of size and displacement, the 'Shtorm' is projected to have a full displacement of 95,000 tons, putting it in the same class as the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz-class carriers, which displace between 90,000 and 100,000 tons. The Nimitz-class, which has been the backbone of U.S. naval air power for decades, measures 330 meters (1,083 feet) in length, almost identical to the projected length of the 'Shtorm' carrier. This scale will allow both ships to operate large air wings, with the Nimitz-class able to carry up to 90 aircraft, while the 'Shtorm' will be able to deploy up to 100 aircraft, offering a slight edge in air group capacity. The propulsion systems of both ships will feature nuclear reactors, with the 'Shtorm' using a RITM-200 or RITM-400 nuclear reactor, likely providing similar advantages in terms of endurance and range. The Nimitz-class uses a nuclear power system as well, with four reactors, offering it a top speed of 30 knots, similar to the 'Shtorm’s' projected speed of 30 knots (56 km/h). While both carriers share comparable maximum speeds, the 'Shtorm' may have the edge in maneuverability due to its hull design, which incorporates a 20% reduction in water resistance. Additionally, the Nimitz-class carries a more conventional fuel-powered propulsion system, while the 'Shtorm' will rely on a combination of nuclear and gas turbines, which may provide improved operational efficiency. Both aircraft carriers will feature state-of-the-art aircraft launch and recovery systems, though the 'Shtorm' is expected to incorporate two runways to ensure nearly continuous aircraft operations. In contrast, the Nimitz-class carriers feature an angled flight deck with four launching positions (two ski-jump ramps and two electromagnetic catapults). The Nimitz-class employs traditional arresting gear for aircraft landings, while the 'Shtorm' will likely include similar facilities designed for a range of aircraft, including MiG-29K fighters, Su-57 stealth jets, and Ka-27 helicopters. These aircraft types are designed for a variety of missions, from air defense to anti-submarine warfare and reconnaissance, similar to the diverse aircraft mix employed by the U.S. Navy. Regarding air defense, the 'Shtorm' is expected to be equipped with the advanced S-500 air defense missile system, capable of engaging multiple ballistic and supersonic targets simultaneously, further enhancing its protection against aerial threats. The Nimitz-class, on the other hand, is likely to have unspecified anti-aircraft systems, but there have been indications that it may include elements of the S-400 or newer air defense technologies in its arsenal. Both ships will be equipped with radar systems for surveillance, and the Nimitz-class is particularly notable for its multi-functional phased array radar that supports both defense and navigation capabilities. One of the unique features of the 'Shtorm' is its ice-class hull, which allows it to operate in Arctic conditions. This capability will give Russia a significant advantage in protecting its strategic interests in the increasingly contested Arctic region. In contrast, the Nimitz-class carriers do not feature an ice-strengthened hull, which limits their operational flexibility in polar environments. The service life of the 'Shtorm' is expected to span 50 years, comparable to that of the Nimitz-class, which has an expected operational lifespan of roughly 50 years as well. Both carriers are designed to serve for decades, with autonomy capabilities allowing them to operate without refueling for long periods, with the 'Shtorm' able to remain operational for up to 120 days at sea. In terms of weapons systems, the 'Shtorm' will carry cruise missiles and aerial bombs, alongside an anti-aircraft missile artillery system with four combat modules, likely offering a significant increase in offensive and defensive capabilities compared to the Nimitz-class, which relies on its aircraft and traditional air defense systems. The 'Shtorm' is set to be a symbol of Russia’s increasing focus on enhancing its blue-water navy capabilities, particularly in the face of rising geopolitical tensions. With its advanced technologies, including nuclear propulsion, air defense systems, and a more versatile air wing, the 'Shtorm' aims to compete head-to-head with the Nimitz-class, offering Russia a powerful tool to project military power globally, particularly in the Arctic and other strategic regions. As the development of the 'Shtorm' continues, it is clear that Russia is determined to challenge the U.S. Navy’s supremacy in the aircraft carrier domain. With comparable size, advanced capabilities, and a strategic focus on Arctic operations, the 'Shtorm' may well become a key asset in Russia’s naval strategy, reshaping the balance of power on the world’s oceans.

Capable of engaging targets at ranges up to 500 kilometers, PrSM provides a critical edge over adversaries by enabling the Army to disrupt enemy command and control, logistics, air defense, and other high-value targets located deep behind enemy lines. One of PrSM's most notable features is its precision guidance system, which combines advanced GPS and inertial navigation technology to ensure high accuracy, even at extended ranges. This makes PrSM an ideal tool for neutralizing enemy infrastructure, missile systems, and other critical assets without the need for costly airstrikes or manned aircraft missions. PrSM is also integrated with the HIMARS launch system, which is already in use with the U.S. Army and allied forces. HIMARS is a mobile, truck-mounted system that can rapidly deploy and launch PrSM missiles, offering strategic flexibility in responding to battlefield threats. While PrSM enhances the Army's precision strike capabilities, the Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) program takes these concepts even further by pushing the boundaries of speed and range. LRHW is part of a broader effort to develop hypersonic missiles—missiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5 (approximately 3,800 miles per hour). This makes them extremely difficult to intercept and enables strikes at ranges exceeding 1,000 kilometers. The LRHW’s high-speed characteristics make it an effective tool for counterstrikes against both fixed and mobile targets deep within enemy territory. U.S. Army Soldiers from Bravo Battery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery, Long Range Fires Battalion, 1st Multi-Domain Task Force, showcase the capabilities of a Long Range Hypersonic Weapon Transporter Erector Launcher during Exercise Bamboo Eagle 24-3 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on August 2, 2024. (Picture source: U.S. DoD The LRHW (Long Range Hypersonic Weapon) employs an advanced boost-glide system that allows the weapon to reach extreme speeds while maintaining maneuverability throughout its flight path. Unlike traditional ballistic missiles, which follow a predictable trajectory, hypersonic weapons can change their flight path mid-course, making them far more challenging to detect and intercept by existing missile defense systems. This technology grants the U.S. Army the ability to launch precision strikes against high-value targets, such as air defense systems, missile silos, and command centers, while minimizing the risk of retaliation. The LRHW’s range and maneuverability make it an essential tool for penetrating sophisticated air defense systems. In future conflicts, adversaries might deploy advanced defense networks such as the Russian S-400 or the Chinese HQ-9, which are designed to deny access to certain regions of the battlefield. LRHW’s speed, reach, and ability to evade these systems will be crucial for maintaining U.S. military dominance. While the PrSM and LRHW represent monumental advancements in long-range firepower, they do not operate in isolation. The integration of these systems with existing platforms like HIMARS will be vital to ensuring future power projection and deterrence. The HIMARS has already demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world combat, such as in Ukraine, where it has been used to strike Russian artillery positions, command posts, and logistics hubs at extended ranges. This real-world application underscores HIMARS' value as a flexible, rapid-response platform for launching precision strikes. The synergy between HIMARS, PrSM, and LRHW provides the U.S. Army with unparalleled flexibility. Whether it's a rapid counterattack, precision strikes against high-value targets, or sustained campaigns against enemy infrastructure, these systems, when fully integrated, will offer a comprehensive capability to project power across vast theaters of conflict. The ability to strike deep into enemy territory, adjust targets in real-time, and defeat sophisticated defenses will be key to shaping the future of modern warfare. As the U.S. Army continues to develop and deploy these advanced technologies, long-range precision strikes will become an increasingly critical component of battlefield strategy. The PrSM and LRHW are not just tools for engaging targets in near-peer conflicts but also serve as powerful deterrents, signaling to potential adversaries that any aggressive action will be met with a swift, overwhelming response. The integration of these systems, combined with the continued development of autonomous systems and advanced sensors, represents the future of modern warfare. In this future, rapid, long-range precision strikes will replace traditional forms of combat, and the ability to project force quickly and decisively will be crucial for maintaining global security. As the U.S. Army progresses through various testing and deployment phases, these systems will redefine the U.S. military’s role in deterrence, power projection, and leadership in advanced warfare technologies. The growing sophistication of U.S. long-range fires will pose significant challenges to adversaries, complicating any efforts to counter American military dominance. In this evolving landscape, systems like the PrSM and LRHW will be indispensable for maintaining U.S. military superiority in future conflicts. By integrating these cutting-edge technologies into its arsenal, the U.S. Army is positioning itself for long-term dominance in precision strike capabilities, ensuring that it remains a formidable force on the global stage for years to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-how-the-u-s-armys-next-gen-long-range-missiles-revolutionize-precision-strike-and-counterstrike-capabilities	2024-12-02T06:41:15-08:00

After the prototyping phase completed in the summer of 2023, the first laboratory tests were carried out in September 2023. In March 2024, Thales initiated dynamic field trials with partner military units. These tests, completed in July 2024, confirmed the performance and reliability of the SMK-Eco, particularly its ability to generate a dense and stable smoke screen. The SMK-Eco is a 120 mm rifled munition designed to be fired from the 2RM mortar system. It utilizes eco-friendly chemical compounds, reducing toxic emissions and post-use residues. The rifled design enhances in-flight stability, ensuring better accuracy and uniform smoke coverage. These features enable the SMK-Eco to provide effective coverage while minimizing its ecological footprint in operational areas. The SMK-Eco uses smoke agents based on environmentally friendly chemical mixtures. Unlike traditional smoke munitions that often rely on halogenated compounds or other toxic substances, the SMK-Eco incorporates non-toxic smoke agents such as glycol-based and biodegradable resin mixtures. These agents produce dense and persistent smoke while reducing the emission of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. This formulation allows for effective coverage without compromising the health of soldiers or damaging local ecosystems. Thales designed the SMK-Eco smoke munition not only to deliver optimal military performance but also to minimize its environmental impact. A key aspect of this approach is the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions generated during the combustion of propellants and smoke agents. Below is an overview of Thales’ efforts to limit the CO₂ weight emitted by the SMK-Eco and the technologies employed to achieve this. The SMK-Eco uses specially formulated chemical propellants designed to burn cleaner than traditional propellants. These low-emission propellants are based on advanced organic compounds that optimize combustion, thereby reducing the amount of CO₂ produced per munition. Although precise figures on the CO₂ weight emitted per shot are not publicly available, Thales claims that the SMK-Eco propellant formulation allows for a significant reduction in emissions compared to conventional smoke munitions. This reduction is achieved through more complete combustion and the use of less carbon-intensive chemical materials. Compatibility with the 2RM mortar system, introduced in September 2023, allows for seamless integration of the SMK-Eco into military operations. The 2RM, renowned for its versatility, facilitates the rapid deployment of the smoke munition across various terrains. The SMK-Eco is scheduled to enter service in the first quarter of 2025, providing armed forces with a reliable and sustainable coverage solution that complies with strict environmental standards. Thales emphasizes the importance of sustainability in the development of the SMK-Eco. By incorporating biodegradable materials and eco-friendly manufacturing processes, Thales meets international environmental protection standards. This initiative is part of the company’s overall strategy to balance military performance with environmental responsibility, thereby reinforcing its position as an innovative leader in the defense sector. As a reminder, the return to high-intensity warfare requires infantry to be equipped with armored combat vehicles possessing sufficient firepower to support future mechanized brigades and tactical groups. Thales’ 120 mm rifled mortar system (2R2M) perfectly meets this need by offering exceptional mobility and optimized firing and movement capabilities. Highly automated, the 2R2M allows for semi-automatic loading and firing of 10 rounds per minute, ensuring operational efficiency from the first salvo. Additionally, its advanced design guarantees a very high level of crew protection, enhancing safety in combat zones. The 2R2M stands out for its improved accuracy, being three times more precise than a traditional smoothbore mortar, and for its maximum range of 8 to 13 kilometers. This increased accuracy allows for effective neutralization of enemy targets while minimizing the risk of accidental fires. Tested in the field across various operational theaters, the 2R2M has already been adopted by six NATO member countries, with over 170 systems deployed as part of military operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/french-army-successfully-tests-thales-new-generation-smk-eco-120mm-rifled-smoke-munitions	2024-12-02T05:13:13-08:00

USS Zumwalt stealth destroyer to become first hypersonic missile warship in US Navy	As reported by the Associated Press on November 30, 2024, the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), the lead ship in the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers of the US Navy, is currently being modified at Huntington Ingalls Industries' shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The ship is undergoing an upgrade to integrate the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) missile system, which will make it the first US warship capable of deploying hypersonic weapons. This modification involves replacing its original Advanced Gun System (AGS) with four large-diameter missile tubes, each accommodating three hypersonic missiles, for a total capacity of 12 missiles per ship.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000), the lead ship in the Zumwalt-class stealth destroyers of the US Navy, is currently being modified to provide the United States with the ability to execute precision-guided conventional strikes globally within one hour. (Picture source: US DoD) Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII)’s Ingalls Shipbuilding division has played a significant role in the modernization of Zumwalt-class destroyers. On August 29, 2023, it was awarded a $154.8 million contract to upgrade the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000), including the integration of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system. This follows earlier contracts, including a $10.5 million award in January 2023 for the modernization planning of USS Zumwalt and USS Michael Monsoor (DDG 1001). HII has also been involved in outfitting Zumwalt-class destroyers with advanced Mk 57 vertical launch systems under a $74 million contract awarded in April 2024. Leveraging nearly $1 billion in infrastructure investments, HII continues to enhance the combat capabilities and technological sophistication of these stealth warships. The Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) program, initially referred to as Prompt Global Strike, is designed to provide the United States with the ability to execute precision-guided conventional strikes globally within one hour. CPS utilizes technologies such as hypersonic glide vehicles and surface-, air-, and submarine-launched missile platforms. Potential delivery systems include rockets akin to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), hypersonic cruise missiles, and kinetic weapons launched from orbit. A key objective is to address rapid-response scenarios and expand options beyond nuclear strikes. Testing milestones include the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon's 2011 flight, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body tested in 2020, and integration plans for Zumwalt-class destroyers in 2024. Design measures aim to differentiate CPS from nuclear systems to mitigate risks of misinterpretation by adversaries. The CPS upgrade program involves multiple defense contractors. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor responsible for final missile assembly, which takes place in Courtland, Alabama, integrating components manufactured by Northrop Grumman and Dynetics. Northrop Grumman builds the missile boosters and payload module, while Dynetics constructs the hypersonic glide body. Funding and oversight for the program are managed by the DDG-1000 Program Office. However, the cost of these systems has raised concerns. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that producing and maintaining 300 hypersonic missiles over 20 years could cost nearly $18 billion, averaging $60 million per missile. Critics argue that the expense may exceed the value of many potential targets. Proponents counter that hypersonic weapons extend operational range and precision beyond the reach of conventional systems, providing an advantage in contested environments. The USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) is a guided missile destroyer and the lead ship of its class, named after Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. It displaces 14,564 tons, measures 600 feet in length, and is powered by an Integrated Power System generating 78 MW, enabling speeds of 33.5 knots. Initially equipped with two 155 mm Advanced Gun Systems designed for Long Range Land Attack Projectiles, the cancellation of ammunition rendered the guns inoperable, leading to a shift from land attack to surface warfare. The vessel features 80 Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launch System cells for various missiles, a radar cross-section designed for reduced detection, and an automation-focused design for a smaller crew. Commissioned in 2016, the Zumwalt has undergone modifications, including the planned replacement of the Advanced Gun Systems with hypersonic missile launch systems during a modernization period that began in 2023. The Zumwalt-class destroyers were conceived during the DD-21 program, launched in the 1990s, as a 21st-century solution for naval fire support, a role previously filled by battleships. The program aimed to develop multi-mission warships with a focus on land attack, anti-surface warfare, and reduced radar detection, aligning with Congressional mandates for enhanced naval firepower. Due to rising costs and evolving military priorities, the program was restructured into the DD(X) initiative, and the number of planned ships was reduced from 32 to 3. At an estimated total program cost of $22.5 billion, the Zumwalt-class represents a shift toward smaller, more technologically integrated fleets, as well as an attempt to balance technological innovation with fiscal and operational challenges, amid a global race for the hypersonic superiority. In fact, hypersonic capabilities are now considered essential by the United States for maintaining strategic parity with competitors such as Russia and China, who have made significant advancements in this field. China tested its DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle between 2014 and 2016, reportedly entering service by 2019 along with other hypersonic weapons like the DF-27 and the YJ-21. Russia has pursued analogous technologies, including the Avangard hypersonic weapon system, which began series production in 2018, and the OPreshnik, recently used in Ukraine. Concerns about strategic stability and misidentification have been raised internationally, particularly by Russia, which has responded with upgraded missile defenses, precision weapons, and continued strategic nuclear modernization.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uss-zumwalt-stealth-destroyer-to-become-first-hypersonic-missile-warship-in-us-navy	2024-12-02T03:04:14-08:00

Analysis: Lessons from Ukraine War how small arms and advanced systems redefine drone defense	The Ukrainian war has provided invaluable lessons in countering aerial drones, FPV (First-Person View) drones, and loitering munitions. The conflict has forced both sides to innovate rapidly, particularly in the realm of air defense. Ukraine’s experience offers a blueprint for future warfare, emphasizing the need for layered defenses, cost-effective solutions, and adaptability in the face of evolving aerial threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ukrainian soldiers target and destroy a Russian Shahed-136 kamikaze drone at close range using a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun mounted on a truck, showcasing mobile air defense capabilities in action. (Picture source: MilitaryNewsUA X account) One of the most striking elements of the Ukrainian experience is the effectiveness of small-caliber weapons against drones. Mobile air defense teams equipped with ZU-23-2 automatic cannons, mounted on trucks for rapid deployment, have been instrumental in intercepting Russian Shahed-136 drones. These 23mm twin-barreled automatic cannons, initially designed for anti-aircraft use, have proven capable of destroying drones during their low-altitude, terminal approach phase. The combination of high mobility and a rapid rate of fire allows these units to adapt to the dynamic nature of drone warfare, particularly when drones are deployed in swarms. Shotguns have emerged as another practical solution for frontline soldiers to counter FPV drones. Ukrainian forces have adopted semi-automatic shotguns, such as the Safari HG-105M and Hatsan Escort BTS 12, using buckshot cartridges to take down low-flying drones. FPV drones, often used for reconnaissance or precision strikes, are fast and operate at very low altitudes, making them difficult targets for larger, more advanced systems. The shotguns provide an inexpensive, easy-to-deploy option for infantry, particularly in urban or trench warfare scenarios where FPV drones pose an immediate threat. The Gepard Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun (SPAAG), supplied by Germany, has been a game-changer for Ukraine’s drone defense strategy. Equipped with twin 35mm Oerlikon cannons and guided by advanced radar, the Gepard has proven especially effective against loitering munitions like the Shahed-136. Its programmable AHEAD ammunition, which disperses sub-projectiles in the target's path, ensures high lethality against small, fast-moving drones. Ukrainian forces have successfully used the Gepard to protect critical infrastructure and urban centers, particularly during large-scale swarm attacks. The mobility and precision of the Gepard make it an ideal middle layer in a multi-tiered air defense system, bridging the gap between smaller-caliber weapons and advanced missile systems. Despite the successes of small-caliber weapons and anti-aircraft guns, Ukraine has also relied on modern air defense missile systems, such as the IRIS-T SLM, NASAMS, and Patriot, to provide a robust defense against drones and other aerial threats. These systems have proven highly effective at long-range interception and protecting high-value targets. However, their use against low-cost drones like the Shahed-136 highlights a critical issue: cost inefficiency. Firing expensive, high-precision missiles at drones costing as little as $20,000 is unsustainable during prolonged conflicts, particularly when facing large numbers of drones. The war has also revealed the limitations of these advanced systems when faced with drone swarms. Loitering munitions often operate at low altitudes and have small radar cross-sections, making them challenging to detect and intercept using traditional missile systems. This has reinforced the need for a layered defense approach, where advanced systems handle high-altitude and long-range threats, while small-caliber weapons and systems like the Gepard address lower-altitude, close-range targets. A critical takeaway from the Ukrainian experience is the importance of mobility and flexibility. Both small-caliber systems like the ZU-23-2 and larger platforms like the Gepard have demonstrated the value of rapid deployment and repositioning in response to evolving threats. Static systems are vulnerable in dynamic combat environments, whereas mobile units can adapt to shifting drone flight paths and operational priorities.

(Picture source Ukraine MoD The conflict in Ukraine has also underscored the need for integrated technology and AI-driven solutions. Combining small-caliber weapons, radar, and AI-enhanced fire control systems can significantly improve detection and engagement success rates. For example, integrating drones and counter-drone systems into a unified command-and-control network ensures faster response times and more efficient resource allocation. AI can enhance threat prioritization, especially during swarm attacks, where human operators might struggle to manage multiple targets simultaneously. For future conflicts, the Ukrainian experience highlights the necessity of a comprehensive, multi-layered defense strategy against aerial drones, FPV systems, and loitering munitions. Small-caliber weapons provide a cost-effective frontline solution, anti-aircraft systems like the Gepard offer a critical middle layer, and modern missile systems serve as a high-capability shield for long-range and high-altitude threats. These layers must work in unison, supported by advanced sensor technology, AI integration, and mobile platforms. The war in Ukraine has also emphasized the importance of training and adaptability for counter-drone operations. Soldiers have rapidly adapted to using unconventional weapons like shotguns for drone defense, and mobile air defense teams have learned to respond quickly to drone incursions. This adaptability will be a crucial element of future conflicts, where technological advances and new drone tactics will continue to challenge traditional defense paradigms. Ultimately, Ukraine’s experience has reshaped the understanding of modern drone warfare. The combination of layered defenses, cost-effective countermeasures, and technological integration will be essential for any military preparing to face the growing threat of drones, loitering munitions, and other unmanned aerial systems in future conflicts.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-lessons-from-ukraine-war-how-small-arms-and-advanced-systems-redefine-drone-defense	2024-11-30T05:44:01-08:00

The operation required adjustments to stabilize the refueling basket and ensure the aerodynamic propeller on the pod could operate the pumps effectively. The DGA has not disclosed specific results or metrics from the tests but released imagery indicating that the operation was conducted successfully. The DGA had ordered 16 NARANG pods from Zodiac Aerotechnics, now part of Safran, in a project initiated in 2011. The pods were first delivered in 2019, and operational certification was achieved in January 2021. These pods are used exclusively with the Rafale M for buddy-refueling missions, referred to in France as 'nounou' or 'nanny' configuration. In this configuration, the Rafale M can deliver up to two tonnes of fuel at a range of 400 nautical miles from the carrier. The tests aimed to ensure the Rafale M could safely refuel the E-2D in scenarios where fuel reserves are low, such as after extended missions. The French Navy plans to deploy the E-2D aboard the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier. The introduction of air-to-air refueling capability in the E-2D is expected to enhance operational endurance and flexibility for the French Navy’s carrier air wing. The Rafale M currently operates as a refueling platform for other Rafale aircraft, as well as for potential future operations involving the E-2D. The recent tests serve to confirm the readiness of the NARANG pod to support these operations under the required conditions, ensuring its capability aligns with the operational requirements of the future E-2D aircraft.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-rafale-m-fighter-jet-performs-first-mid-air-refueling-with-narang-pod-for-future-missions	2024-11-29T04:58:16-08:00

Germany Proposes Deployment of Patriot Systems in Poland to Protect Ukraine’s Military Supply Lines	Amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and intensified international efforts to support Kyiv, Germany has announced a major new initiative. On November 28, Berlin proposed deploying Patriot air defense systems to Poland, a measure aimed at securing a critical logistics hub used for transporting military supplies to Ukraine. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Germany could supply these Patriot systems from its own inventory, which currently includes nine operational units (Picture source: Bundeswehr) The German Ministry of Defense stated in a communiqué that this initiative, submitted to NATO, seeks to enhance the security of vehicle, weapon, and ammunition supply chains that are essential to Ukraine’s war effort. This proposal comes as Ukraine continues to face a Russian offensive that began in February 2022. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasized the strategic significance of the project, describing the targeted logistics hub in Poland as a vital link in the supply chain to Kyiv. The Patriot MIM-104 is a versatile missile defense system designed to counter a wide range of airborne threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft. Originally developed by the United States and first deployed in the 1980s, the Patriot system has become a cornerstone of integrated defense systems for the U.S. military and its allies. It combines high-performance radar systems, advanced interceptors, and a modular, mobile architecture that allows for rapid field deployment. Featuring passive electronically scanned array radar technology, the system provides simultaneous detection, tracking, and engagement of multiple targets while maintaining resilience against electronic countermeasures. Its ability to integrate with other air defense units further strengthens its role within comprehensive air and missile defense networks. The Patriot system features several missile variants, including the PAC-2 and PAC-3, tailored to address modern threats. Notably, the PAC-3 missile employs hit-to-kill technology to neutralize warheads with exceptional precision. A standard Patriot battery includes launchers capable of carrying up to sixteen PAC-3 missiles or four PAC-2 missiles per launcher, as well as multifunction AN/MPQ-53 or -65 radars, AN/MSQ-104 control stations, and communication and power units. During operations, the radar detects and tracks threats, relays data to the control center, calculates the optimal trajectory, and guides the missile to the target. Deployed globally, the system provides robust, adaptable air defense against increasingly sophisticated threats. The proposed deployment to Poland would be temporary, lasting up to six months, with German soldiers accompanying the systems to manage their operation and maintenance. Exact details, including the placement of the units, are under discussion between Germany, Poland, NATO allies, and Brussels authorities. This move aligns with previous deployments, such as the 2023 stationing of Patriot systems in Zamosc, southeastern Poland, near the Ukrainian border, where they were tasked with protecting a key railway hub critical to military logistics. Germany could supply these Patriot systems from its inventory, which currently includes nine operational units. To address stock reductions, partly due to deliveries of Patriot systems to Ukraine since 2022, and to enhance its defense capabilities, Berlin signed a €1.4 billion contract in March 2024 for the procurement of four additional Patriot batteries. This new commitment reflects Germany’s broader military support for Ukraine. Since the start of the invasion, Berlin has become the European Union’s primary supplier of military aid to Kyiv, though this role has strained the capabilities of Germany’s armed forces. The Bundeswehr continues to face challenges stemming from years of underfunding, an issue the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz aims to address through an ambitious rearmament program. However, this effort is constrained by financial and logistical limitations. Nonetheless, Germany’s willingness to strengthen collective defense does not extend to all aspects of Ukraine’s requests. Berlin has refused to provide long-range missiles, unlike countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom, which have supplied these capabilities. The delivery of Patriot systems to Poland would significantly enhance the country’s air defense capabilities and, by extension, bolster NATO’s eastern flank. These systems, known for their ability to counter various threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft, would offer critical protection to strategic infrastructure, such as logistical hubs vital for supplying Ukraine. By deploying these systems on Polish soil, NATO would strengthen its deterrence against aerial threats while improving the security of member states near the conflict zone. This deployment would also reassure NATO partners, demonstrating the Alliance’s commitment to collective defense mechanisms.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-proposes-deployment-of-patriot-systems-in-poland-to-protect-ukraines-military-supply-lines	2024-11-29T02:40:22-08:00	
France to Modernize Infantry with Advanced Electronic Warfare to Counter Enemy Jamming	During the 2024 edition of the 'Présentation de l’armée de Terre' (PRAT), the French Army introduced the ISIS project, an initiative aimed at equipping infantry regiments with electronic warfare capabilities. This project, which responds to evolving operational needs observed in recent conflicts such as in Ukraine, marks an important step in expanding these capabilities beyond specialized units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Army VAB CATIZ Electronic Warfare Vehicle (Picture source: French MoD) Until now, electronic warfare has been primarily handled by specialized units such as the 44th and 54th Signal Regiments and the 785th Electronic Warfare Company. These units, now grouped under the Intelligence and Cyber-Electronics Brigade (BRCE), operate under the Command of Deep Actions and Intelligence (CAPR). They use advanced systems like LINX (Localization and Interception of Exotic Emissions), CATIZ (Ground Capability for Zone Interception), and VOBULE (Vehicle for Wideband Jamming Operations). LINX is designed to locate and intercept radio signals emitted by enemy devices, such as command posts or communication systems. On the battlefield, this system is used to identify and locate enemy radio transmissions, enabling the neutralization of a communication network or precise targeting of key infrastructure. For example, during an offensive, LINX can detect an enemy command post from several kilometers away, allowing for accurate strikes or coordinated actions. The ISIS project aims to extend these capabilities to infantry units, which face modern threats such as drones, remotely operated munitions, and electronic interference. It seeks to provide simplified tools for detecting, locating, and analyzing radio signals, thereby improving real-time tactical situational awareness. CATIZ is used to monitor a defined area and intercept all radio emissions within it. On the battlefield, this system can help secure an area before an operation by intercepting signals from enemy drones or identifying jamming devices. During reconnaissance missions, CATIZ can help detect enemy activities that are invisible to the naked eye, such as hidden sensor networks or emitters used to coordinate attacks. VOBULE is a vehicle dedicated to jamming radio frequencies over a wide range. On the battlefield, it is used to prevent the enemy from communicating effectively or controlling drones. For example, during an attack on a fortified position, VOBULE can neutralize the enemy’s radio communications, causing disruption and facilitating the advance of allied forces. For reference, ISIS is presented as a system capable of continuously analyzing the radio spectrum to identify used frequency bands, locate emission sources, and characterize intercepted signals. This system provides non-specialized units with the means to monitor the electromagnetic environment and represent tactical information in real-time. According to the Technical Section of the French Army (STAT), the system will enhance communication resilience in complex or degraded environments, contributing to better control of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is essential for modern operations. The development of ISIS is being carried out in collaboration with TRAAK, a company specializing in geolocation and biometric tracking solutions, and GeePs (Electrical and Electronic Engineering Laboratory of Paris). This collaboration between industry and academic research aims to design a performance-driven solution that meets the operational needs of the French Army. Special attention is given to the system's ergonomics to ensure it can be used by non-specialized soldiers and integrated into infantry regiments. The ISIS project will enable infantry regiments to strengthen their electronic warfare operational capabilities and better respond to current electronic threats. This initiative is part of a broader effort to equip front-line units with tools adapted to modern conflicts. Still in development, ISIS represents a technological advance that could play a key role in future operations for the French Army, ensuring a strategic advantage in increasingly contested environments.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-to-modernize-infantry-with-advanced-electronic-warfare-to-counter-enemy-jamming	2024-11-29T02:29:12-08:00

(Picture source: Japanese Navy) Antarctica presents a unique geopolitical theater, where Japan’s actions subtly intertwine science, diplomacy, and latent strategic interests. Bound by the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), which forbids militarization and emphasizes peaceful, scientific cooperation, Japan ostensibly operates within these parameters. However, the nation's engagement with Antarctica reveals a deeper strategic posture shaped by its broader security concerns and regional rivalries, particularly with China and Russia. Japan’s Antarctic operations, including its robust scientific programs and logistical support from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), are emblematic of a dual-purpose strategy. The icebreaker Shirase, a JMSDF vessel, exemplifies this balance, officially providing logistical support for research missions while implicitly signaling Japan’s capacity to project power—even in the world’s most remote regions. This dual use of military assets underscores Japan’s subtle assertion of presence in a region increasingly viewed through a strategic lens, despite its demilitarized status. In the context of Japan’s geopolitical reality, its Antarctic engagement cannot be disentangled from its Indo-Pacific strategy. China’s assertive expansion in both polar regions—characterized by the construction of research bases and resource mapping—casts a long shadow over Antarctic governance. For Japan, China's activities represent more than scientific competition; they echo the broader challenge of revisionist powers undermining established norms. This concern becomes even more pressing when coupled with Russia’s militarization of the Arctic, which Japan sees as a harbinger of potential shifts in Antarctic policy, should global tensions erode the ATS’s framework. Japan’s scientific endeavors in Antarctica also reflect a calculated effort to shape the continent’s future governance. Its leadership in research reinforces its role as a stakeholder in the ATS, ensuring that any renegotiation of the treaty or its protocols—particularly regarding resource exploitation—will include its voice. The issue of marine resources, such as krill fisheries, further highlights the tensions between conservation and economic interests. Japan’s controversial whaling programs in the Southern Ocean, often framed as 'scientific research,' illuminate how the country uses Antarctic science to navigate the fine line between compliance and competition. As climate change accelerates the melting of polar ice, exposing potential reserves of untapped resources, Antarctica’s strategic importance is poised to grow. Japan’s investment in Antarctic infrastructure and technology positions it as a prepared actor in this evolving landscape. While the ATS currently prohibits resource exploitation, Japan’s careful preparation signals its recognition of a future where these rules may be contested. Ultimately, Japan’s Antarctic strategy reflects a nuanced approach to global power dynamics. It adheres to the letter of the Antarctic Treaty while leveraging its participation to assert a strategic presence, counterbalance regional rivals, and prepare for an uncertain future.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/japans-polar-exploration-icebreaker-shirase-departs-for-antarctic-expedition	2024-11-29T00:54:43-08:00

Official figures indicate that troop levels will be scaled down from 2,300 to just 600 personnel, distributed among Chad, Gabon, Côte d’Ivoire, and Senegal. Djibouti, considered part of the Indo-Pacific strategy, remains unchanged. The Chief of Defense Staff, General Thierry Burkhard, defended this adjustment during a Senate hearing, stating that while France’s military presence in Africa had proven effective, negative perceptions were undermining its benefits. The revised approach will focus on temporary deployments driven by local requests, reducing the footprint of French forces and the visibility of their bases, often located in capital cities. This transition seeks to lessen the symbolic and operational impact of their presence. France has gradually reduced its military presence in Africa and West Africa in recent years. In August 2022, French troops withdrew from Mali following tensions with the ruling military junta. In December 2022, they also pulled out of the Central African Republic, where they had been deployed since 2013, due to deteriorating relations with the Central African government and the arrival of Russian forces, notably the Wagner Group. In February 2023, France announced the withdrawal of its forces from Burkina Faso after the expulsion of its ambassador by the military junta. More recently, in September 2023, France decided to withdraw its troops from Niger following the military coup on July 26, 2023, and at the request of the new Nigerien authorities. Meanwhile, Russian and Chinese influence in Africa has intensified. Russia, through the Wagner Group and later Africka Korps, has strengthened its presence in the Central African Republic, providing military and security assistance to the government in power. This presence has been accompanied by a disinformation campaign aimed at advancing Russian interests and undermining Western influence. China, for its part, has increased its investments in Africa, particularly in West Africa, by multiplying infrastructure projects and becoming one of the continent's main trading partners. These initiatives aim to strengthen economic and political ties between China and African countries, offering an alternative to traditional partnerships with Western powers.Simultaneously, to address broader strategic needs, France plans to strengthen its military presence in the UAE, where it already maintains a substantial deployment. Under a 2008 defense agreement, the French Forces in the United Arab Emirates (FFEAU) consist of 650 to 700 personnel stationed at a naval base, the Al Dhafra Air Base—home to six Rafale jets from the 1/7 Provence Fighter Squadron—and Zayed Military City, which hosts the 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers. The 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers is a versatile unit comprising a command and logistics squadron, 16 Leclerc tanks, an infantry section equipped with Infantry Fighting Vehicles (VBCI), and an artillery sub-unit operating five CAESAr self-propelled artillery systems. Minister Lecornu announced that starting in 2025, this regiment will be bolstered by the permanent deployment of an infantry company of approximately 100 soldiers. Additional engineering capabilities may also be deployed to enhance cooperation with Emirati forces. This strategic realignment is designed to operationalize the Franco-Emirati defense agreement while meeting specific operational requirements. The FFEAU fulfill three primary missions: supporting French operational deployments in the region, fostering military cooperation with the UAE, and hosting units from metropolitan France and foreign contingents for training in desert and urban environments typical of the Middle East.This rebalancing reflects France's determination to adapt its geopolitical priorities to a shifting international context while consolidating key partnerships in strategically important regions. By strengthening its presence in the United Arab Emirates, France seizes the opportunity to project its operational capabilities in the Middle East, a critical area for global energy security and international trade. This deployment also enables more effective participation in regional stabilization efforts and counterterrorism operations. Furthermore, close cooperation with Emirati forces provides benefits in terms of training, technological exchanges, and arms sales, thereby bolstering the French defense industry.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-revises-its-military-strategy-by-shifting-forces-from-africa-to-united-arab-emirates	2024-11-28T05:13:59-08:00

Analysis: What is the 64N6 'Tombstone' Radar Destroyed by Ukraine's ATACMS Missile Strike?	The 64N6 'Tombstone' radar, a critical element of Russia's S-300 and S-400 air defense missile systems, was recently destroyed by Ukrainian forces in a precision strike using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. This radar is a surveillance tool and a cornerstone of Russia’s air defense network, designed to detect, track, and manage aerial threats across vast distances. Its destruction marks a significant blow to the Russian military, as it directly undermines the effectiveness of one of its most formidable surface-to-air missile systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 64N6 'Tombstone' Radar, a pivotal component of Russia's S-300 air defense system, known for its long-range surveillance and threat management capabilities. Overlayed is an image vignette of the radar's aftermath, destroyed by a precision Ukrainian ATACMS missile strike, highlighting the impact of modern warfare on critical defense infrastructure. (Picture source: Mix Army Recognition Group/Telegram) The 64N6, NATO designation Tombstone is a long-range, three-dimensional phased-array radar operating in the S-band frequency, making it highly effective in detecting aerodynamic and ballistic targets. With a maximum detection range of approximately 300 kilometers, the radar can monitor and identify threats well beyond the immediate engagement zone of the S-300 PM air defense missile systems family. It can simultaneously track up to 100 targets, including fast-moving fighter aircraft, low-flying cruise missiles, and high-speed ballistic projectiles. This multitasking capability ensures that the S-300 PM system can respond to multiple threats in a highly dynamic combat environment. A key feature of the 64N6 radar is its phased-array antenna, which allows for rapid and precise scanning of airspace. This technology enables the radar to continuously track targets accurately while resisting electronic countermeasures, such as jamming. Mounted on a semi-trailer, the radar is mobile and can be deployed quickly, ensuring that it remains operational despite shifting battlefield dynamics. The 64N6 radar is important because it acts as the 'eyes' of the S-300PM/PMU-1 system. It acts as the primary sensor for target acquisition and feeds real-time data to the command post, which coordinates the engagement of threats using the system’s missiles. Without the 64N6, the S-300 system is effectively blind, unable to detect or engage incoming threats with the same level of precision. This makes the radar a high-value target in any conflict where disrupting enemy air defenses is a priority. For Ukraine, destroying the 64N6 radar represents a major tactical victory. By neutralizing this critical component, Ukrainian forces have significantly degraded Russia's regional air defense capabilities. This creates opportunities for Ukrainian drones, missiles, and aircraft to operate with reduced risk, enabling more effective strikes against other strategic targets. The use of ATACMS missiles for this operation highlights the strategic importance of such targets. With their extended range and precision, ATACMS missiles are ideally suited for striking high-value assets like the 64N6 from well behind the front lines. The loss of the 64N6 radar also creates long-term challenges for Russia. Replacing such a sophisticated and expensive system requires significant time, resources, and logistical coordination. This delays Russia's ability to restore full air defense coverage in the area, leaving critical infrastructure and military assets vulnerable to future attacks. From a broader perspective, the destruction of the 64N6 radar underscores the evolving nature of modern warfare, where targeting critical nodes in an enemy’s air defense network can shift the operational balance. For Ukraine, this successful strike demonstrates not only its growing capability to counter advanced Russian technology but also the strategic value of leveraging Western-supplied precision-guided munitions to achieve high-impact results. As the conflict continues, operations like this will likely play a pivotal role in shaping the battlefield dynamics and weakening Russia's overall defensive posture.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-what-is-the-64n6-tombstone-radar-destroyed-by-ukraines-atacms-missile-strike	2024-11-27T07:09:41-08:00

Singapore Navy transitions to Invincible-class retires Challenger-class submarines	According to information published by the Singapore MoD on November 25, 2024, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) formally decommissioned its final two Challenger-class submarines, RSS Conqueror and RSS Chieftain, in a solemn ceremony at RSS Singapura – Changi Naval Base. Presided over by Chief of Navy Rear Admiral (RADM) Sean Wat, the event marked the end of an era for the RSN, as the fleet transitions fully to the modern and more capable Invincible-class submarines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Singapore Navy Challenger-class submarine RSS Chieftain. (Picture source: Mindef Singapore) The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) has taken a monumental step in its maritime defense capabilities, transforming its undersea fleet into a potent symbol of deterrence and strategic strength. The recent commissioning of the Invincible-class submarines marks a turning point in the RSN’s operational depth, positioning Singapore as a key player in the increasingly competitive underwater arena of the Asia-Pacific region. For decades, Singapore relied on its Challenger-class submarines, which were retrofitted Swedish vessels initially designed for Cold War operations. These submarines served as a foundation for the RSN’s submarine operations but were gradually outpaced by advances in submarine technology and the evolving dynamics of maritime threats. The decommissioning of the final two Challenger-class vessels, RSS Conqueror and RSS Chieftain, signified the end of an era. The introduction of the Invincible-class submarines, custom-built by Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), represents a deliberate and forward-thinking investment in undersea warfare. These submarines are meticulously designed for operations in Singapore’s challenging maritime environment, characterized by shallow waters, high shipping traffic, and tropical thermal layers. Equipped with advanced air-independent propulsion systems, they can remain submerged for extended periods without surfacing, enhancing their survivability and operational stealth. The integration of noise-reduction technologies and automated systems further elevates their effectiveness, allowing a small crew to execute highly complex missions with precision. In addition to their advanced propulsion and stealth features, the Invincible-class submarines offer improvements in armament. Armed with eight torpedo tubes, these vessels can deliver a range of payloads, from torpedoes to sea mines. This level of firepower, combined with their extended endurance, provides the RSN with a platform capable of both deterrence and offensive operations. The strategic timing of this submarine modernization is notable. The Asia-Pacific region is witnessing a surge in submarine acquisitions, with major powers such as China and India, as well as regional neighbors like Indonesia and Vietnam, investing heavily in undersea warfare. This quiet competition is reshaping the regional security landscape, where the ability to control the underwater domain is increasingly seen as a critical aspect of national security. For Singapore, the Invincible-class submarines are not just military assets; they are strategic tools that reinforce its autonomy and credibility. The ability to conduct extended undersea operations strengthens the nation’s deterrence posture, protecting critical sea lanes and territorial waters that are vital to its economy. Looking ahead, the RSN’s submarine fleet will continue to grow as additional Invincible-class submarines, RSS Illustrious and RSS Inimitable, are delivered in the coming years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/singapore-navy-transitions-to-invincible-class-retires-challenger-class-submarines	2024-11-27T05:04:41-08:00	
AI-Enhanced Cameras Deployed to Prevent Aerial Attacks on Washington's Strategic Sites	On November 25, 2024, the United States Department of Defense announced the deployment of a new artificial intelligence-based air surveillance system designed to address potential aerial threats in the National Capital Region (NCR). This advanced system, intended to safeguard strategic sites such as the White House, the Capitol, and the Supreme Court, represents a significant step in strengthening air security. It is part of a broader effort to prevent events similar to those of September 11, 2001, when hijacked planes targeted high-value symbolic and strategic locations, including the Pentagon. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link ERSA cameras are equipped with both electro-optical and infrared imaging, high-definition resolution, and features such as infrared colorization that enhance target detection through heat signatures(Picture source: US DoD) The new system, known as Enhanced Regional Situational Awareness (ERSA), integrates advanced visual recognition cameras and lasers. Gradually being implemented across the NCR, it incorporates AI-driven identification and tracking capabilities, offering significant improvements over legacy systems. Manufactured by the technology firm Teleidoscope, this system replaces equipment installed in 2002, which was itself a replacement for earlier post-9/11 technology. ERSA cameras are equipped with both electro-optical and infrared imaging, high-definition resolution, and features such as infrared colorization that enhance target detection through heat signatures. These capabilities are further supported by a laser rangefinder that accurately measures the distance and altitude of objects. According to Air Force Master Sgt. Kendrick Wilburn, who oversees operations at the Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC), the system can automatically lock onto and track moving targets through machine learning algorithms. The more the system is utilized, the more precise it becomes, improving its overall effectiveness. The system also includes a visual warning device using a red-green laser to alert non-compliant aircraft to immediately exit the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA). These eye-safe lasers help avoid the need for costly military aircraft deployments to investigate potential violations. Wilburn explains that these visual signals, referred to by operators as 'sparkles,' often prompt pilots to adjust their course and contact the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as required. This advanced defense system was developed to address the complex challenges of urban airspace protection. Testing conducted in 2022 compared several camera prototypes, with Teleidoscope emerging as the preferred choice due to its significant software enhancements. Currently, two cameras are operational, and in upcoming phases, plans are to deploy an additional seven cameras each year. The ERSA system could, in the future, benefit from advancements achieved with the MEGA-Army application developed by Belgian company IDDEA. Originally designed for identifying land-based military equipment through advanced image recognition, the application could be adapted for aircraft identification. Such an adaptation would not only enable recognition of aircraft but also provide detailed information on their capabilities, armaments, radar systems, and defensive measures. This integration could enhance ERSA’s ability to deliver critical real-time data for identifying and validating aerial threats. These developments highlight the potential of combining aerial surveillance technologies with advanced recognition tools, further modernizing defense strategies. Improvements brought by the ERSA system have already transformed how aerial threats are detected and managed. Wilburn notes that the cameras are capable of detecting and tracking small targets, such as birds in flight—capabilities unattainable with previous systems. Additionally, partial automation of the system allows operators to focus on more complex analytical tasks, such as evaluating the intent of suspicious aircraft. This modernization reflects a proactive approach to preventing incidents akin to those of September 11, 2001. By integrating advanced technology, artificial intelligence, and human expertise, the ERSA system provides a robust and adaptable response to contemporary aerial threats. The Department of Defense, in collaboration with the Air Force and the Accelerate the Procurement and Fielding of Innovative Technologies program, has facilitated the rapid implementation of this project, underscoring the United States' commitment to protecting its critical infrastructure.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/ai-enhanced-cameras-deployed-to-prevent-aerial-attacks-on-washingtons-strategic-sites	2024-11-27T04:59:17-08:00

With a modular design, the Type 32 will be capable of adapting quickly to different mission requirements, ensuring its relevance in an evolving threat environment. This frigate class is not only a response to operational demands but also a reflection of Britain’s broader global ambitions. It aims to enhance the United Kingdom’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region, enhance NATO operations in the North Atlantic, and strengthen the Royal Navy’s capacity for humanitarian missions and joint exercises with allies. The adaptability of the Type 32 could also position it as a testbed for emerging naval technologies, such as advanced directed-energy weapons, enhanced radar systems, and AI-driven operational tools. With the inclusion of the Type 32, the Royal Navy will expand its escort fleet from 19 to 24 vessels by the 2030s, achieving a better balance between high-end capabilities (Type 26 for anti-submarine warfare) and general-purpose (Type 31 and Type 32). Despite the promise of the Type 32, the program faces significant hurdles. Defense analysts have flagged affordability as a pressing concern. Initial cost estimates for the class have already triggered skepticism, with the National Audit Office highlighting potential delays or program adjustments to align with fiscal realities. Moreover, with other high-profile Royal Navy programs like the Dreadnought-class submarines and Type 26 frigates demanding significant resources, there is an ongoing debate about whether the Type 32 can be funded without compromising other priorities. Industry leaders will need to balance capability with cost-effectiveness to ensure the program remains viable. The introduction of the Type 32 aligns with a broader trend among naval powers to modernize their fleets with multi-role platforms capable of integrating new technologies. Comparable initiatives by the U.S. Navy (Constellation-class frigates) and France (FDI-class frigates) suggest a global arms race in designing future-proof warships. The Type 32’s focus on unmanned systems and modularity places it at the forefront of this trend. By leveraging these innovations, the Royal Navy aims to future-proof its surface fleet against emerging threats such as hypersonic missiles, cyber warfare, and asymmetric tactics.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/next-generation-of-uk-frigates-what-we-know-about-type-32	2024-11-27T03:30:24-08:00

Türkiye renews its interest in 40 F-35 fighter jets amid possible US policy shift	On November 26, 2024, Turkish Defense Minister Yaşar Güler addressed the Planning and Budget Committee in the Turkish Parliament, stating that the United States may reconsider selling F-35 fighter jets to Türkiye. He revealed that Türkiye had formally resubmitted its request to purchase 40 F-35s and emphasized that six aircraft originally ordered by Türkiye remain in storage in the U.S., undelivered due to Türkiye’s removal from the F-35 program in 2019.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Türkiye became a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program in 2002, intending to procure 100 F-35As, but was removed from the program following the purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems. (Picture source: US Air Force) Güler linked this potential shift in U.S. policy to Türkiye’s progress in developing its fifth-generation fighter jet, named KAAN, produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ). The KAAN conducted its maiden flight in early 2024 and is intended to replace aging F-16s in the Turkish Air Force by the 2030s. According to Güler, U.S. officials have recently expressed the possibility of providing the F-35s, though no definitive progress has been made. Güler also reiterated Türkiye’s position on reclaiming its production share in the F-35 program, alongside acquiring the additional jets. Türkiye became a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program in 2002, intending to procure 100 F-35A variants. Turkish companies contributed to the aircraft's production with a combined investment exceeding $1 billion. The first Turkish F-35A was completed in 2018, with deliveries expected to follow training of Turkish pilots in the United States. However, deliveries were halted in 2019 after Türkiye purchased Russian S-400 air defense systems, which the U.S. argued posed a security risk to the F-35 platform. This led to Türkiye’s removal from the program and the reallocation of eight Turkish-bound F-35s to the U.S. Air Force. Despite Türkiye's suspension, production of some F-35 components in Türkiye continued until 2022 under preexisting contracts. The U.S. has not refunded the $1.4 billion paid by Türkiye for the aircraft. In early 2024, U.S. officials indicated that Türkiye could potentially rejoin the program if it abandoned the S-400 system. However, Güler stated that Türkiye has no plans to discard the S-400s, noting that the system remains inactive but could be operational within 12 hours if necessary. In parallel, Türkiye has pursued the modernization of its fighter fleet. Türkiye has committed to purchasing 40 F-16 Block 70 Viper aircraft, with an estimated total cost of $6.5–7 billion, including specialized munitions and logistical support. An initial payment of $1.4 billion has already been made. However, Güler announced that Türkiye had canceled plans to modernize 79 older F-16s with U.S. Viper kits, delegating the task to Turkish Aerospace Industries under the domestic ÖZGÜR program, which involves locally designed hardware and software. Türkiye has also sought to diversify its fleet with the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. Initial hesitancy from Germany delayed the deal, but Güler confirmed that approvals have now been obtained from all relevant European parties, allowing discussions to proceed. Türkiye’s acquisition of the S-400 system remains a central issue in its defense strategy and relations with NATO allies. Güler explained that the system is intended for use only in response to high-level air threats. Its acquisition in 2017 marked Türkiye as the first NATO member to purchase the Russian system, straining relations with the U.S. and prompting sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has previously asserted that Türkiye will recoup the $1.4 billion paid for the F-35 program, either through delivery of the jets or reimbursement. Additionally, Erdoğan has stated that Türkiye’s purchase of the S-400 was a necessity after the U.S. refused to sell Patriot missile systems. Turkish officials have maintained that the S-400s will operate independently from NATO’s defense network. The U.S.-Türkiye discussions over the F-35 coincide with broader defense developments in Türkiye. Mass production of the Altay main battle tank is set to begin by the end of 2025. Türkiye has also continued to assert its maritime claims in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean, with Güler accusing Greece of militarizing demilitarized zones and reaffirming Türkiye’s rights under international law. Türkiye’s position within NATO remains complex. Its veto power has influenced negotiations on other defense matters, such as approving Sweden and Finland’s NATO memberships. As Türkiye seeks to balance its national defense priorities with its NATO commitments, its renewed bid for F-35s highlights ongoing efforts to resolve disputes with the U.S. and diversify its military capabilities. Whether these efforts lead to Türkiye’s readmission into the F-35 program remains uncertain, as discussions continue amid longstanding geopolitical tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/tuerkiye-renews-its-interest-in-40-f-35-fighter-jets-amid-possible-us-policy-shift	2024-11-27T02:03:25-08:00	
France to develop new ballistic missile for addressing gaps in long-range strike capabilities	According to Challenges on November 27, 2024, France is exploring the development of a new land-based ballistic missile with a range exceeding 1,000 kilometers, the first such initiative since 1997. This development reflects a growing global reliance on ballistic missiles, which have proven effective in various conflicts. The proposed missile aims to fill a gap in France’s capabilities, as its current ballistic missile systems are exclusively submarine-based and designed for nuclear deterrence.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Pluton land-based ballistic missile, developed in the 1960s, served as a key component of France's tactical nuclear deterrence during the Cold War, with a range of 7 to 120 km and a 25-kiloton warhead. (Picture source: Facebook/Les Historateurs) France currently lacks land-based ballistic missile capabilities. Its only ballistic missile, the submarine-launched M51, serves as a nuclear deterrent. Discussions between the French armed forces and the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) have centered on creating a land-based missile system operable from mobile platforms, such as trucks. Early design concepts suggest the missile may feature terminal-phase maneuverability similar to other advanced systems, making it more difficult for enemy defenses to intercept. The effectiveness of such ballistic missiles has been evident in recent conflicts. For example, Ukraine’s interception rate of Russia’s Iskander-M missiles stands at just 4.3%, while Iranian strikes on Israel revealed the limitations of advanced systems like Iron Dome and David’s Sling against large-scale attacks. Historically, France has developed several ground-launched ballistic missiles since World War II. Between 1946 and 1947, German engineers in France worked on the Super V2, an intermediate-range ballistic missile project with planned variants capable of ranges up to 3,600 kilometers and warheads weighing up to 1,000 kilograms. However, the project was discontinued in 1948. The S2 missile, operational from 1971, was a two-stage, solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile equipped with a 1.2-megaton thermonuclear warhead. It was succeeded in 1980 by the S3 missile, which shared similar specifications and remained in service until 1996. In 1974, France introduced the Pluton missile, a short-range tactical ballistic missile with a range of up to 120 kilometers, designed for nuclear or conventional warheads. The Pluton was replaced in 1991 by the Hadès missile, which had a range of approximately 480 kilometers. Intended as a pre-strategic nuclear deterrent, the Hadès missile was decommissioned by 1997. This new program is distinct from France's Long-Range Land Strike (FLP-T) initiative, which focuses on developing rocket artillery replacements with ranges up to 150 kilometers. In contrast, the proposed ballistic missile would exceed 1,000 kilometers, offering additional strategic options for deep strikes in conflicts. However, funding remains a significant challenge, as France’s military budget is already allocated to high-priority projects such as M51 missile upgrades and the development of the ASN4G air-launched nuclear missile. This potential project could also align with the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), a collaborative initiative involving Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. If developed, the missile would complement France’s existing capabilities, such as Rafale jets and cruise missiles, enhancing its capacity for strategic strikes. Ballistic missiles are designed to deliver warheads over long distances via a high-arcing trajectory. They are powered during the initial phase of flight, after which they follow a ballistic path influenced by gravity and air resistance. This design enables them to strike targets at ranges varying from short to intercontinental distances. Their high speed and altitude make interception challenging. Some ballistic missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to deploy multiple warheads to different targets. These features underline the strategic importance of ballistic missiles, as demonstrated by their effectiveness in recent conflicts and their potential to address gaps in capabilities like those identified in France’s current arsenal. On October 1, 2024, Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, with several penetrating Israel's multi-layered missile defense systems and striking key military bases. In response, Israel conducted airstrikes using Blue Sparrow ballistic missiles carried by F-15 fighters. Analysts regard these exchanges as part of the first 'ballistic battle,' following similar events in April 2024. Russia has employed nearly 200 ballistic missiles since its invasion of Ukraine began, including the Iskander and Kinzhal systems, as well as North Korean-manufactured KN-23 missiles. Russia has also developed new missiles like the Oreshnik and Iskander-1000, which reportedly doubles the range of its predecessor. On October 22, 2024, Yehor Cherniev, head of Ukraine's NATO delegation, indicated forthcoming 'concrete results' from the use of domestically produced ballistic missiles, likely referring to the Hrim-2. The United States, meanwhile, has progressed with its Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) program, delivering the first units in December 2023. Non-state actors such as the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon have also demonstrated the increasing proliferation of ballistic missile technology. China has heavily invested in ballistic missile programs, with systems like the DF-21D and DF-26 capable of targeting installations across the Western Pacific. Additionally, the range of its DF-100 supersonic missile has been extended to 4,000 kilometers. South Korea’s Hyunmoo-V missile, capable of carrying an eight-ton warhead over 3,000 kilometers, targets underground facilities and strategic sites in North Korea. North Korea has also tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, potentially solid-fueled, with the capability to reach the United States. These developments underscore the increasing importance of land-based, long-range strike capabilities in modern defense strategies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-to-develop-new-ballistic-missile-for-addressing-gaps-in-long-range-strike-capabilities	2024-11-27T01:51:51-08:00

The development of the Grille drone by Avilus spanned several years and was based on collaboration among industry, academia, and the armed forces. The initiative began in 2020 when Ernst Rittinghaus, founder of Avilus, proposed the idea of a 'flying stretcher' to doctoral students at the Institute of Flight System Dynamics at the Technical University of Munich. Within weeks, a preliminary technical concept was developed, quickly evolving into the drone evacuation system, named DRONEVAC. Between 2020 and 2021, the team used advanced simulation tools, such as Simulink, to model and optimize the aircraft's behavior, resolving potential issues before building a physical prototype. In 2021, a functional prototype was tested to validate its performance, including autonomy, payload capacity, and robustness. By 2022, Avilus partnered with the German Army, particularly the Bundeswehr Medical Academy and the Medical Squadron Bischofswiesen, to test the drone in real military exercises. These trials were supplemented by logistics missions and medical evacuation scenarios conducted in collaboration with KNDS to demonstrate the coordination between autonomous aerial and ground transport systems. In 2023, the drone was officially presented as a modular and operational solution, also integrating a ground control segment (GCS) linked to the BOXER armored vehicle, enabling mobile and secure mission management. This gradual development reflects Avilus' commitment to meeting modern operational needs by combining technological innovation, digital simulation, and strategic partnerships. The Grille drone stands out for its advanced technical capabilities. Designed as a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aerial vehicle, it can carry a maximum payload of 135 kg with a total take-off weight of 695 kg. Powered by a 240 kW electric system, it reaches a cruising speed of 86 km/h, with a range of 51 km and a maximum altitude of 2,100 meters. Its modular cabin allows it to adapt quickly to various missions, including logistics, reconnaissance, or medical evacuation. Additionally, its compact design enables transport in a standard ISO container, enhancing its operational mobility. In the context of the war in Ukraine, technologies like the Grille drone could provide crucial solutions.

Analysis: Russia’s Hypersonic Missiles Cannot Be Countered by Current US and European Air Defenses	Due to the new threats posed by hypersonic ballistic missiles, particularly those that Russia could deploy to target Ukraine and potentially Europe, the urgency of developing effective countermeasures has become critical. With their extreme speed and unpredictable flight paths, these weapons remain unstoppable by today’s air defense systems. No existing system can reliably intercept and destroy hypersonic ballistic missiles, leaving nations vulnerable to a new class of advanced weaponry. As the global arms race intensifies, countries like the United States and key European nations focus on detecting and countering this emerging threat.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Russian Air Force Mikoyan MiG-31K fighter jet carrying the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile. (Picture source: Wikimedia) Hypersonic ballistic missiles, capable of traveling at speeds greater than Mach 5 and maneuvering unpredictably, expose critical gaps in missile defense systems. While advanced radar systems have proven effective at detecting and tracking these high-speed threats, no current air defense system can intercept or destroy them. Modern radars, such as the U.S. AN/TPY-2 and SPY-6, are specifically designed to detect and track hypersonic targets from long ranges. The AN/TPY-2, a key component of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, is capable of tracking both ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. Similarly, the SPY-6 radar, integrated with the Aegis Weapon System, enhances multi-target tracking capabilities, offering a significant upgrade for naval defenses. Space-based systems, including the U.S. Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and the emerging Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensors (HBTSS), complement these ground-based capabilities by providing persistent, global surveillance and early warning of missile threats. However, detection alone is insufficient without the development of interceptors capable of neutralizing these advanced weapons. In Europe, systems like Israel's Green Pine radar—adopted as part of Germany's Arrow 3 missile defense acquisition—are being leveraged for early warning and tracking of high-speed threats. Additionally, Sweden’s Saab-developed Giraffe 4A radar highlights how European nations are investing in versatile detection systems. These capabilities, however, only address one part of the problem. Detecting a hypersonic missile is not the same as intercepting it. The inability to intercept hypersonic ballistic missiles is exacerbated by the rapid development of these weapons by nations such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Russia has already deployed hypersonic systems like the Avangard glide vehicle and the Kinzhal missile, which have been touted as capable of evading all known missile defense systems. These weapons have been integrated into its military arsenal, with the Kinzhal reportedly used during the conflict in Ukraine. China is developing its own hypersonic arsenal, including the DF-ZF glide vehicle and other advanced systems aimed at bypassing U.S. and allied defenses. North Korea has recently tested hypersonic missiles, signaling its ambitions to incorporate such technologies into its strategic weapons program. Meanwhile, Iran has unveiled prototypes of hypersonic missiles, further raising concerns about regional stability and global proliferation. Northrop Grumman is set to produce the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), a groundbreaking defensive system designed to counter hypersonic missile threats. (Picture source: Northrop Grumman) The United States has taken a leading role in developing advanced interception technologies to address the hypersonic missile challenge. One of the most promising programs is the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), specifically designed to neutralize hypersonic glide vehicles during their glide phase—the most vulnerable segment of their flight. This phase occurs after the missile has re-entered the atmosphere but before it reaches its terminal trajectory, providing a critical window for interception. The GPI is being developed to integrate seamlessly with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system, leveraging its advanced radar and fire-control systems for deployment from naval platforms. The GPI represents a significant technological leap in hypersonic defense, utilizing advanced propulsion, guidance, and sensor technologies to engage maneuvering hypersonic targets that conventional missile defenses cannot counter. Initial development has progressed steadily, but operational capability is not expected until the latter half of the decade, reflecting the complexity of the challenges involved. In parallel, the U.S. is also advancing directed energy solutions, such as high-energy lasers and microwave systems, aimed at disabling hypersonic weapons during their boost phase, where they are still accelerating and most vulnerable. While these technologies remain experimental in 2024, they offer a promising complementary layer of defense that could significantly enhance U.S. capabilities against hypersonic threats in the future. In Europe, collaborative efforts to address the hypersonic missile threat are gaining momentum, with the TWISTER (Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based Theater Surveillance) program standing out as a flagship initiative. Supported by the European Defence Fund, TWISTER is part of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) framework and aims to develop a next-generation missile defense system capable of addressing a broad spectrum of advanced threats, including hypersonic glide vehicles, maneuvering reentry vehicles, and other advanced ballistic threats. The TWISTER program emphasizes a multi-layered defense approach that integrates space-based and ground-based components. One of its core objectives is to develop a state-of-the-art interceptor capable of engaging hypersonic threats in both endo-atmospheric (within the Earth's atmosphere) and exo-atmospheric (outside the atmosphere) flight phases. This new interceptor, tentatively referred to as the 'Endo-Exo Interceptor,' will feature advanced propulsion and guidance systems to address the speed and maneuverability of hypersonic missiles. Key to the TWISTER program is its reliance on space-based theater surveillance. The program envisions deploying a network of advanced sensors in orbit to provide persistent tracking and early warning of missile threats. These sensors will complement existing terrestrial radar systems, significantly enhancing Europe's ability to detect and monitor hypersonic weapons during all phases of flight. France leads the TWISTER program, with participation from Germany, Italy, Finland, Spain, and the Netherlands, reflecting the EU’s commitment to pooling resources and expertise for collective security. The program’s development phase is well underway to achieve operational capability in the 2030s. Complementing TWISTER is the HYDEF (Hypersonic Defence Interceptor) program, which focuses specifically on developing an endo-atmospheric interceptor for terminal-phase interception of hypersonic threats. Together, these programs represent Europe’s proactive response to the growing capabilities of nations like Russia and China in the hypersonic domain. They also underscore the EU's determination to develop indigenous technologies that reduce reliance on external defense systems and enhance regional security. Germany will receive the Arrow 3 missile defense system, while the next-generation Arrow 4 will feature capabilities to intercept hypersonic missiles. (Picture source Is Israeli MoD) Germany’s acquisition of the Arrow 3 air defense missile system from Israel adds an important, albeit interim, layer of defense for Europe. The system, designed for exo-atmospheric interception of ballistic missiles, provides Germany with advanced capabilities to defend against high-altitude threats. While Arrow 3 offers limited potential to counter some hypersonic missiles, it remains fundamentally a ballistic missile defense system. This highlights the pressing need for Europe to accelerate the development of dedicated hypersonic countermeasures to address emerging threats fully. Israel and the United States have already embarked on developing the Arrow 4, an advanced upgrade to the Arrow family of missile defense systems. Arrow 4 aims to bridge the gap by offering enhanced capabilities to intercept next-generation threats, including hypersonic glide vehicles. Designed to replace the older Arrow 2 system and work alongside Arrow 3, the Arrow 4 is being engineered with more sophisticated propulsion, maneuverability, and advanced targeting technologies. Its ability to engage hypersonic missiles during the glide phase or high-speed terminal phase represents a significant step forward in missile defense. Although Arrow 4 remains under development, its planned capabilities align with Germany’s long-term defense strategy, suggesting that it could eventually become a cornerstone of Europe’s hypersonic missile defense architecture. By adopting and potentially co-developing such cutting-edge systems, Germany and its European allies are positioning themselves to address the growing missile threat from state actors such as Russia, China, and North Korea. Arrow 4’s anticipated deployment later in the decade further underscores the ongoing efforts to enhance collective security and technological independence within NATO and the European Union. Despite these advancements, hypersonic missiles' unpredictable trajectories and extreme speeds leave defense planners with little margin for error. Tracking systems provide early warning, but the response time for interception remains critically short. Integrating artificial intelligence into missile defense systems is being explored to enhance real-time tracking and response capabilities. Additionally, reliance on space-based detection is expected to grow, as nations expand satellite networks to provide persistent global surveillance of missile activities. While detection capabilities have seen significant progress, the absence of proven hypersonic interception technologies underscores the urgency of continued innovation. As hypersonic weapons proliferate, international collaboration and sustained investment in advanced technologies will be essential to safeguarding global security against this unprecedented threat.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-russias-hypersonic-missiles-cannot-be-stopped-by-current-us-and-european-air-defenses	2024-11-26T07:51:09-08:00

Greece and Türkiye Draw Inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome to Develop Their Own Air Defense Systems	Amid ongoing strategic competition, Greece and Türkiye, despite being NATO allies, are intensifying efforts to develop advanced air defense systems, as reported by Forbes. While their approaches differ significantly, both nations share a key similarity: they draw substantial inspiration from Israel’s battle-tested defense technologies. Greece seeks to collaborate with Israel to either acquire or co-develop systems modeled after the Iron Dome, while Türkiye is pursuing an autonomous approach with its 'Steel Dome' project, emphasizing self-reliance against perceived threats. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link While Israeli systems serve as a model, Greece's collaboration with Israel reflects its broader strategy to diversify alliances with the US and EU, while Türkiye pursues independent defense development (Picture source: Raphael) In November 2024, Greece expressed its interest in partnering with Israel to enhance its air defense capabilities. Athens is exploring two main options: co-developing a customized system with Tel Aviv or procuring established Israeli technologies like the Iron Dome or David’s Sling. According to Reuters, this collaboration could involve an estimated €2 billion investment, reflecting Greece’s commitment to modernizing its military. The move aligns with recent acquisitions by other European nations, such as Germany and Finland, of similar Israeli systems. Israeli defense systems have become a global benchmark. The Iron Dome, designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery, has proven highly effective in high-density attacks. Complementing it, the David’s Sling intercepts medium-range ballistic threats, while the Arrow 3 targets high-altitude projectiles in the exo-atmosphere. These multi-layered capabilities are particularly appealing to Greece, whose existing military infrastructure could benefit from enhanced protection against evolving threats. Greece already maintains strong defense ties with Israel. In 2022, it deployed an anti-drone network based on Israeli technology, adapted to its specific needs. This system protects strategic sites, including islands in the Aegean Sea, an area frequently subject to Turkish military overflights. Expanding this cooperation could provide Greece with capabilities similar to the Iron Dome while bolstering its defense posture amid regional tensions. Türkiye, by contrast, is pursuing a different strategy. It is developing air defense systems independently, as its relations with Israel remain strained due to political tensions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Despite this, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced plans to create a system equivalent to the Iron Dome, branded as the 'Steel Dome.' This ambition reflects Türkiye’s effort to demonstrate its technological capacity without external assistance. Ankara is leveraging its domestic defense industry to build a multi-layered air defense system. Its low-altitude Korkut and Sungur systems are replacing U.S.-made Stinger missiles, while the Hisar O provides medium-altitude coverage. At the top of this network is the Siper, which can reportedly intercept threats at a range of up to 100 km. However, Türkiye’s acquisition of Russian S-400 systems in 2019 remains unresolved due to sanctions and NATO compatibility concerns, leaving them unintegrated into its broader defense network. The longstanding rivalry between Greece and Türkiye, rooted in historical disputes over the Aegean Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Cyprus, continues to fuel their respective military ambitions. These tensions, frequently marked by displays of force, justify both nations’ heavy investments in advanced defensive systems. Israel’s role as a global leader in air defense extends beyond this regional dynamic. European countries are increasingly adopting Israeli technologies to bolster their own capabilities. Germany recently acquired the Arrow 3 system, while Finland, a new NATO member, opted for the David’s Sling. Central European nations, including Hungary and Slovakia, have also integrated components of the Iron Dome into their arsenals. This trend underscores Europe’s growing focus on reliable defense solutions to address contemporary threats, both state and non-state in origin. The strategic implications of these developments are significant. Greece’s partnership with Israel strengthens its alignment with Western allies and enhances its deterrence against Türkiye’s military activities, particularly around contested Aegean islands. Meanwhile, Türkiye’s 'Steel Dome' project aims to address its perceived threats while projecting regional autonomy. These advancements also impact NATO, which must balance the conflicting interests of these two member states. Additionally, such initiatives may prompt other regional actors, like Cyprus or Egypt, to invest in their own defense capabilities, further militarizing an already volatile area. Although Israeli systems serve as a model, their influence on Greek and Turkish strategies is not absolute. Greece’s collaboration with Israel is part of a broader effort to diversify its alliances, which include closer ties with the United States and the European Union. These relationships play a significant role in shaping its military procurement decisions. Similarly, Türkiye’s 'Steel Dome' reflects a pursuit of technological sovereignty, even if the concept draws from Israel’s success. Furthermore, strained Israeli-Turkish relations have driven Ankara to rely on domestic industries and alternative partners like Russia and China, diluting Israel’s direct impact on its strategic developments. The contrasting approaches of Greece and Türkiye illustrate their enduring rivalry and mutual recognition of the need for advanced air defense systems. Greece’s collaborative efforts with Israel align with its broader strategic partnerships, while Türkiye’s focus on self-reliance underscores its ambition to achieve autonomy. These divergent paths reflect not only political choices but also distinct strategies for addressing contemporary security challenges. Against the backdrop of rising global tensions, these developments highlight how historical rivalries continue to shape military priorities in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-and-tuerkiye-draw-inspiration-from-israels-iron-dome-to-develop-their-own-air-defense-systems	2024-11-26T02:53:37-08:00	
Greece to transfer S-300 and Tor-M1 air defense systems to Armenia instead of Ukraine in strategic shift	According to Enikos.gr on November 25, 2024, Greece is proceeding with the transfer of several Russian-made air defense systems, including the S-300 PMU-1, Tor-M1, and Osa-AK, to Armenia instead of Ukraine as part of its broader strategy to replace aging equipment with Western and Israeli technologies. This decision aligns with the Greek Armed Forces' plan to de-Russify its arsenal and address challenges related to maintaining Russian systems, which have been exacerbated by sanctions on Russia and associated supply chain disruptions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link As NATO and the EU now prioritize providing Ukraine with Western-standard systems, Greece has therefore opted to redirect its Russian-origin systems to Armenia, where they can be more effectively integrated and maintained. (Picture source: CyprusMail) According to information from the Greek General Staff of National Defense (GEETHA), the transfer of these systems to Armenia is part of a cooperative effort involving France, which will also provide Armenia with additional weapons. This initiative reflects strategic considerations, including Greece’s historical ties with Armenia, shared religious affiliations, and mutual interests in countering Turkish support for Azerbaijan. The proximity of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its implications for regional stability also factored into this decision. The systems being transferred include Greece's S-300 PMU1 system, acquired following the Cyprus Missile Crisis and stationed in Crete. The system comprises one regiment with four systems, eight fire units, 32 launchers, and 175 missiles. The S-300, with a range of 200 kilometers and the ability to track up to 100 targets, was first used operationally in Greece during the 2013 White Eagle exercise, 15 years after its acquisition. Despite prior discussions about sending the S-300 to Ukraine in exchange for a PAC-3 Patriot missile system, concerns over potential gaps in Greek air defense led to the cancellation of those plans. Armenia, which has experience operating Russian-made systems, is considered well-equipped to integrate the S-300 and other transferred systems into its existing defenses. The country’s prior collaboration with Russia included training for the operation of S-300 systems, and Armenian forces have used these systems as part of a joint air defense framework under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Spare parts and maintenance for these systems, previously sourced from Armenia by Greece, have played a critical role in this transfer decision. To replace the outgoing Russian systems, Greece is investing in new Israeli air defense systems, including David’s Sling, Barak MX, and Spyder. These systems offer coverage ranges from 20 to 300 kilometers and are part of a larger project to establish an 'Iron Dome' over the Aegean islands. This initiative, costing approximately €2 billion, is expected to be operational by the end of 2026, providing a timeline for when the transferred systems might leave Greek service. Armenia, which has experience operating Russian-made systems, is considered well-equipped to integrate the Soviet-era Osa-AK and other transferred air defense systems into its existing defenses. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The cooperation with Armenia extends beyond equipment transfers. The number of Armenian students in Greek military academies has doubled, and joint exercises have become more frequent. A recent exercise, 'Olympic Cooperation 24,' conducted at the Petrohori range in Xanthi, involved live-fire scenarios with Greek tanks, French armored vehicles, and simulated drone operations. Such collaborations are intended to enhance Armenia's military preparedness, particularly in light of Azerbaijan's use of drones in previous conflicts. Greece has experience replacing military assets following international transfers. An earlier initiative involved sending 40 BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine in exchange for 40 German Marder vehicles. While initial plans included 120 replacements, domestic political concerns reduced the scope. Greece is also in advanced negotiations with the United States for the acquisition of 164 Bradley armored vehicles, with a projected cost of €4 million per vehicle after reconstruction. The decision to transfer these systems to Armenia rather than Ukraine reflects changing dynamics in military supply preferences. NATO and the EU now prioritize providing Ukraine with Western-standard systems that align with existing supply chains. Greece has therefore opted to redirect its Russian-origin systems to Armenia, where they can be more effectively integrated and maintained. This transfer is part of Greece's broader effort to modernize its defense capabilities while aligning more closely with NATO and EU standards. The collaboration with France and Armenia aims to strengthen regional partnerships and address shifting security challenges in the Eastern Mediterranean and South Caucasus. By replacing Russian systems with Israeli technology and reinforcing Armenia's defenses, Greece seeks to maintain a strategic balance in a region marked by competing interests and ongoing tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-to-transfer-s-300-and-tor-m1-air-defense-systems-to-armenia-instead-of-ukraine-in-strategic-shift	2024-11-26T02:23:56-08:00

These capabilities enable the Challenger 3 to detect and engage threats more effectively, even in contested environments with multiple targets. Compared to the advanced sensor suites of Russia’s T-90M, which incorporates a thermal imaging system and panoramic sights, the Challenger 3 has comparable or superior tracking and targeting precision. The lessons learned from the Challenger 2’s deployment in Ukraine have underscored the need for modernization. While the Challenger 2 has demonstrated its resilience, it lacks the advanced capabilities required to effectively counter Russia’s upgraded MBT fleet. Tanks like the T-80BVM, with its powerful gas turbine engine, and the T-90M, with its advanced armor and fire control systems, have shown the importance of continuous innovation in tank design. The Challenger 3 directly addresses these gaps by providing superior firepower, protection, and mobility. The Challenger 3 program has achieved significant milestones ahead of schedule. The first pre-production Challenger 3 vehicles entered trials in early 2024, with further testing planned for 2025. The British Army plans to upgrade a total of 148 Challenger 2 tanks to the Challenger 3 standard. While this number represents a reduction from the Cold War era fleet, the enhanced capabilities of the Challenger 3, including advanced armament, protection systems, and mobility, are designed to meet current and future operational requirements. These technological advancements, combined with NATO's collective strength, position the Challenger 3 as a critical asset in countering modern armored threats. With its new armament, enhanced survivability, and superior maneuverability, the Challenger 3 MBT positions the U.K.’s armored forces to face the challenges of modern warfare and ensures Britain’s relevance on the battlefield for decades to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/new-british-army-challenger-3-tank-surpasses-russias-t-90m-t-80bvm-and-t-72b3-deployed-in-ukraine-war	2024-11-24T10:25:51-08:00	
Analysis: Unspecified 155mm Shells in US Aid Suggest Delivery of ADAM Anti-Personnel Mines to Ukraine	The United States has confirmed the delivery of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine as part of a $275 million military aid package announced on November 20, 2024. While the package did not explicitly mention anti-personnel mines, it included an unspecified quantity of 155mm artillery shells. Based on previous deliveries, this has led to speculation that the package could include Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), a type of 155mm shell designed to scatter anti-personnel mines across targeted areas. ADAMs are used to impede enemy troop movements and bolster defensive capabilities, adding a strategic layer to Ukraine’s resistance against Russian forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link PowerPoint slide showcasing ADAM Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions technology from a US Army ARDEC presentation. (Picture source: US Army RDECOM) The U.S. has also been supplying Ukraine with Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAM) projectiles, the anti-tank counterpart to ADAMs. RAAMs (Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions) are designed to disperse nine anti-tank mines upon firing, which can self-destruct after a set time period, effectively creating temporary minefields to slow or block advancing armored units. Pentagon statistics indicate that, alongside over three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds, more than 70,000 RAAM projectiles have already been sent to Ukraine. The M692 and M731 are two variants of the 155mm Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), designed to disperse 36 anti-personnel mines over targeted areas. These munitions use a timed release mechanism, ejecting their payload from the rear of the shell mid-flight, enabling precise placement of temporary minefields. The mines are equipped with anti-disturbance triggers, deterring attempts to clear them, and feature a programmed self-destruct mechanism, ensuring they deactivate after a specific period to reduce post-conflict hazards. The key difference between the M692 and M731 lies in their active durations. The M692 is designed for short-term engagements, with mines that deactivate within 4 to 48 hours, making it ideal for rapidly shifting battlefield conditions. The M731, in contrast, deploys mines that remain active for up to 15 days, making it suitable for prolonged defensive operations or to hinder enemy reinforcements over extended periods. Both variants deploy M74 anti-personnel mines, ensuring high effectiveness against enemy infantry while reducing risks to civilians through their self-deactivation feature. Tactically, ADAMs provide commanders with a flexible tool for battlefield control, allowing for the creation of barriers or chokepoints without direct troop involvement. These munitions are effective for delaying enemy advances, securing flanks, or covering retreats. When used alongside anti-tank systems like the Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAMS), ADAMs contribute to a layered defense strategy that targets both infantry and armored units, forcing adversaries into predictable movement patterns that can be exploited by friendly forces. The potential inclusion of ADAMs follows a pattern in U.S. military support for Ukraine. The U.S. has already supplied Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAM) projectiles, the anti-tank counterpart to ADAMs, which disperse anti-tank mines in a similar manner. According to the Pentagon, more than 70,000 RAAM projectiles have been delivered to Ukraine alongside over three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds. The addition of ADAMs would represent a further evolution in Ukraine’s capability to employ artillery-delivered munitions in both defensive and offensive operations. Defense analysts have noted that the unspecified 155mm artillery shells listed in the aid package are consistent with the U.S.'s history of providing advanced munitions tailored to Ukraine’s battlefield needs. The ongoing shift in Russian tactics, including concentrated ground assaults and infantry advances, makes systems like ADAMs highly relevant. These munitions can be deployed to block or channel enemy troops, buying time for Ukrainian forces to regroup or counterattack. While ADAMs provide significant strategic benefits, their use also carries potential humanitarian implications. The U.S. has emphasized that any mines provided to Ukraine are to be used strictly within its territory and away from civilian areas. Additionally, the self-deactivating nature of ADAM mines is intended to mitigate risks to non-combatants, addressing some concerns raised by international human rights organizations. Although not officially confirmed, the possibility of ADAMs being part of the latest aid package underlines the U.S.'s commitment to equipping Ukraine with the tools necessary to defend its sovereignty. As the situation on the ground evolves, the focus remains on leveraging advanced munitions to counter the persistent threat posed by Russian forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-unspecified-155mm-shells-in-us-aid-suggest-delivery-of-adam-anti-personnel-mines-to-ukraine	2024-11-24T05:11:32-08:00	
France Confirms Full Commitment to Support Ukraine Including Use of SCALP Missiles Against Russia	During an interview with the BBC, the United Kingdom's national broadcaster and one of the world’s most respected news organizations, on November 23, 2024, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot affirmed that France recognizes no 'red lines' when it comes to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. Barrot stressed that Ukraine is within its rights to use French-supplied SCALP long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia as part of its self-defense. However, he refrained from confirming whether these French weapons had already been utilized in such operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A French SCALP long-range cruise missile mounted on a Ukrainian Su-24 strike aircraft symbolizes France's commitment to bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities in its conflict against Russian aggression.(Picture source: Ukraine MoD) The SCALP missile, known internationally as the Storm Shadow, is a highly advanced, long-range cruise missile developed by France and the United Kingdom. It has a range of over 250 kilometers and is equipped with precision-guided technology, allowing it to strike high-value targets with minimal collateral damage. Designed to evade enemy air defense systems, the SCALP missile is an invaluable asset for operations against heavily fortified or remote locations. It is fired from aircraft, and its stealth capabilities enable it to penetrate deep into enemy territory, making it a critical component of Ukraine's ability to disrupt Russian logistics and command centers. Since the beginning of the war in February 2022, Ukraine has received unprecedented military support from Western allies. This assistance has evolved from initial deliveries of small arms, ammunition, and humanitarian aid to the provision of advanced weaponry and training. Key contributions have included U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems, Patriot air-defense batteries, and artillery systems such as the French Caesar howitzers. Tanks, including the German Leopard 2 and British Challenger 2, have bolstered Ukraine's ground forces, while modern drones and counter-drone systems have enhanced its aerial capabilities. Additionally, NATO countries have provided training, logistical support, and intelligence-sharing to strengthen Ukraine’s resistance and its ability to conduct complex operations. Barrot’s comments come in the wake of the first confirmed strikes using U.S. and U.K. SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles on Russian soil, highlighting a turning point in the conflict. His remarks follow similar indications from French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this year, who suggested that French missiles could be used against Russian targets under the logic of self-defense. Barrot’s unequivocal stance now solidifies France’s position, reinforcing the message that arbitrary limitations will not constrain Western support for Ukraine. During his visit to London, where he held talks with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Barrot emphasized the importance of sustained and unrestricted aid for Ukraine. 'Western allies should not set and express red lines,' he declared, underlining the need for unity and determination among NATO members. This rhetoric aligns with France’s broader strategy of ensuring Ukraine has the resources necessary to counter Russian advances, while simultaneously preparing for a potentially prolonged conflict. The dramatic escalation of events on the ground underscores the significance of Barrot’s statement. Recent reports indicate that U.S. and U.K. SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles were used for the first time to target Russian military sites. Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly deployed a new type of missile, and President Vladimir Putin has warned of the risk of global conflict. These developments underscore the high stakes of maintaining robust Western support for Ukraine. France’s contributions are part of a broader NATO effort to sustain Ukraine’s resistance. Western nations are increasingly focused on long-term financial and military aid packages, with one source highlighting the need for a comprehensive 'war chest' to support Ukraine through 2025 and beyond. European countries are also considering intensified measures, such as seizing Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s defense. Additionally, intelligence suggests that Ukraine has been conducting effective drone operations, targeting Russian ammunition depots far behind enemy lines. In mid-September, drones reportedly destroyed four depots stocked with Russian and North Korean-supplied munitions, representing one of the most significant blows to Russia’s logistical network during the war. While it remains unclear whether these drones were provided by the U.K., France, or other allies, the strikes illustrate the growing sophistication of Ukraine’s capabilities, supported by Western technology and expertise. France’s unwavering support since the onset of the war has been instrumental in Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russian aggression. By removing so-called 'red lines' and providing advanced weaponry like the SCALP missile, France demonstrates its commitment to ensuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This approach, echoed by other Western nations, sends a clear message that the alliance is resolute in its determination to counter Russian aggression and support Ukraine for as long as it takes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-confirms-full-commitment-to-support-ukraine-including-use-of-scalp-missiles-against-russia	2024-11-24T04:11:49-08:00	
Exclusive: Algeria eyed as first export buyer of Russia's Su-57E stealth fighter jet	Speculation is intensifying around Algeria as the potential first export customer for Russia’s Su-57E stealth fighter following an announcement made by the Russian State Defense Agency Rosoboronexport during the 2024 Airshow China in Zhuhai. Russia revealed it had secured an international buyer for its fifth-generation fighter but declined to disclose the customer's identity, sparking widespread debate. Among the potential candidates, Algeria stands out due to its long-standing military ties with Russia and its ongoing efforts to modernize its air force with next-generation technology.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russia's Su-57E stealth fighter on display at Airshow China 2024, where Rosoboronexport announced its first international sale of the fifth-generation aircraft. (Picture source: Weibo aero_jack-li) Algeria has historically been one of Russia’s most significant arms clients, consistently acquiring advanced military hardware to maintain its strategic edge in North Africa. The Algerian Air Force already operates a robust fleet of Russian-manufactured aircraft, including Su-30MKAs, MiG-29s, and Su-24 strike jets. This history of cooperation has cemented Algeria’s reputation as a key partner in Moscow’s defense export strategy, making it a logical choice for introducing the Su-57 to the international market. Over the past decade, defense ties between Algeria and Russia have deepened significantly, driven by Algeria’s strategic focus on upgrading its military capabilities and diversifying its arsenal with state-of-the-art systems. Between 2010 and 2020, Algeria signed major contracts for advanced platforms, including Su-30MKAs and MiG-29M/M2 fighters, as well as modernized T-90S main battle tanks. Russia also supplied Algeria with sophisticated air defense systems, such as the S-300PMU-2 and, more recently, the S-400 Triumf, underscoring the importance of their partnership. These agreements reflect Algeria's reliance on Russian expertise to counterbalance NATO-supplied assets in the region. This partnership extends beyond equipment sales to include joint training and technical cooperation. Algeria regularly participates in Russian-led military exercises, and its personnel undergo training in Russian academies to operate and maintain advanced systems. The collaboration highlights a mutual trust that has allowed Algeria to acquire sensitive technologies such as Iskander ballistic missile systems. This decade of cooperation has not only bolstered Algeria’s defense posture but also reinforced its role as a pivotal Russian ally in North Africa. The Su-57, Russia’s first operational fifth-generation fighter, is central to this speculation. Combining stealth, agility, advanced avionics, and multi-role capability, it represents the pinnacle of Russian aeronautical engineering. Its airframe incorporates composite materials and a reduced radar cross-section to evade detection, while its twin high-thrust turbofan engines enable it to achieve supersonic cruise speeds without afterburners, known as supercruise. The fighter is equipped with an AESA radar, advanced electronic warfare (EW) systems, and networked sensors, allowing it to function as a command-and-control node in network-centric operations. Its internal weapons bays maintain its stealth profile while accommodating a versatile mix of K-77M air-to-air missiles and Kh-59MK2 precision-guided munitions, among others. The Su-57 has also proven itself in combat scenarios. During Russia's involvement in Syria, the fighter was deployed to test its capabilities, including precision strikes on high-value targets and the use of electronic warfare in contested environments. In the ongoing Ukraine conflict, it has been utilized in a limited capacity, leveraging its long-range sensors and stand-off missile capabilities. These operational experiences have helped validate the Su-57's systems and refine both the domestic and export variants, making the Su-57E a highly attractive option for nations like Algeria seeking cutting-edge technology. Reports of Algeria’s interest in the Su-57 have circulated for years. As early as 2019, sources indicated Algeria’s intent to procure at least 14 units of the advanced fighter, making it the first international operator of Russia’s most advanced aircraft. Subsequent reports in 2020 suggested that Algeria had allocated funding under its 2021–2027 defense modernization plan to acquire cutting-edge military systems, including fifth-generation fighters like the Su-57. This timeline aligns with the recent announcement, with the first deliveries of the Su-57E expected to commence as early as 2025. For Algeria, acquiring the Su-57 would counterbalance recent arms purchases by neighboring Morocco, which has procured a fleet of F-16C/D Block 72 fighters from the United States. This rivalry has fueled an arms race in North Africa, with both nations seeking to secure technological and operational advantages. Introducing a fifth-generation stealth fighter into its arsenal would allow Algeria to maintain air superiority and assert its dominance in the region. The implications of such a deal extend beyond regional dynamics. If confirmed, Algeria’s purchase of the Su-57E would mark a significant milestone for Russia’s defense industry, as the aircraft’s first export sale would demonstrate its growing appeal in the global arms market. It could also heighten tensions with NATO countries, given Algeria’s proximity to Europe and its alignment with Moscow, further intensifying the geopolitical competition between Russian and Western defense exports. While the buyer's identity remains officially undisclosed, all signs point to Algeria as the likely candidate. If confirmed, this acquisition would underline the strength of Algeria’s defense partnership with Russia and signal its ambition to lead the military landscape in North Africa.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/exclusive-algeria-eyed-as-first-export-buyer-of-russias-su-57e-stealth-fighter-jet	2024-11-24T02:23:31-08:00

Oreshnik appears to merge these features, achieving hypersonic speeds while maintaining ballistic properties, making it an especially challenging weapon for existing missile defenses to counter. The inclusion of MIRV technology further enhances the system's threat profile. MIRVs allow a single missile to carry multiple warheads, each capable of independent targeting upon re-entry into the atmosphere. This capability not only increases the efficiency of a single missile launch but also complicates interception efforts. A missile equipped with MIRVs can overwhelm missile defense systems by presenting multiple incoming warheads, effectively saturating defensive capabilities. With a reported range of approximately 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), Oreshnik is designed for versatility, suitable for both regional and long-range missions. Russian military sources have confirmed that it can deliver six to eight warheads per missile, underscoring its strategic value. According to Anatoly Matviychuk, a Russian military expert, the missile is likely already in service, given the scale of Russia's missile stockpiles and the decision to move forward with mass production. Putin also revealed that additional systems of similar design are currently being developed, with several prototypes being tested. These new systems aim to expand Russia's hypersonic missile arsenal, including medium- and shorter-range platforms, ensuring the country maintains its edge in this rapidly evolving domain of military technology. The Oreshnik system’s announcement comes amid reports of an intensifying conflict in Eastern Europe, with missile technology playing a growing role. The alleged strike on Dnipro by the RS-26 'Rubezh' raises concerns about deploying such advanced systems in active conflict zones. If confirmed, the use of these weapons would mark a significant escalation, emphasizing the need for renewed international dialogue on arms control. The global implications of the Oreshnik missile are profound. Its claimed ability to evade interception while delivering devastating payloads poses a challenge to nations reliant on advanced missile defense systems. The inclusion of MIRVs adds an additional layer of complexity, making it a key component in Russia’s strategic deterrence arsenal. As tensions continue to rise, the deployment of hypersonic weapons like Oreshnik underscores the urgent need for international efforts to address the emerging challenges of hypersonic and MIRV-equipped ballistic technologies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-russia-confirms-use-of-oreshnik-hypersonic-ballistic-missile-in-ukraine-conflict	2024-11-22T10:11:30-08:00

The Navy’s approach emphasizes leveraging mature technologies and a modular open systems design to reduce development timelines and control costs while maintaining the flexibility for future upgrades. The United States first introduced nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles in the mid-1980s with the deployment of the TLAM-N, a nuclear variant of the Tomahawk Land-Attack Missile. These missiles were stationed on both surface ships and attack submarines, offering a range of approximately 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles). In 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced the withdrawal of all sea-based tactical nuclear weapons, leading to the removal of TLAM-N missiles by mid-1992. The Navy retained the option to redeploy them on attack submarines if necessary. However, in 2010, the Obama Administration recommended retiring the TLAM-N system, deeming it redundant given other available nuclear capabilities. The retirement was completed in 2013. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) under the Trump Administration proposed developing a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, now known as SLCM-N. This initiative aimed to provide a 'non-strategic regional presence' and address the need for 'flexible and low-yield options' in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The SLCM-N was intended to strengthen deterrence against regional adversaries and reassure U.S. allies. In its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request, the Biden Administration allocated funds for research and development of the SLCM-N. However, the 2022 NPR recommended canceling the program, suggesting that existing capabilities were sufficient to meet deterrence requirements. Despite this, Congress continued to provide funding for the SLCM-N and its warhead. The Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated the executive branch to ensure the initial operational capability of the SLCM-N. Subsequently, the Administration has taken steps to implement the program. Proponents of the SLCM-N argue that it offers a flexible and survivable nuclear option, capable of being deployed in various regions without the need for forward-basing nuclear assets on allied territories.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-seeks-industry-input-for-development-of-nuclear-armed-sea-launched-cruise-missile-slcm-n	2024-11-22T05:46:13-08:00

Based in Toulon, the vessel is now fully ready for deployment at the order of the Chief of Defense Staff.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BRF Jacques Chevallier is now in active service, contributing to the French Navy's operational support and readiness. (Picture source: French MoD) The Jacques Chevallier is the first in a series of four BRFs designed to modernize and enhance the French Navy's logistical capabilities. It will be joined by its sister ship, the Jacques Stosskopf, in 2026, which was launched in August 2024, followed by two additional vessels in 2028 and 2033. These ships will progressively replace the older Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR). The BRFs are central to the extensive capacity renewal efforts outlined in France's previous Military Programming Law (LPM) and further reinforced under the 2024–2030 LPM. As part of the FlotLog program, these ships ensure the fleet's operational readiness and endurance during long-term deployments. They play a critical role in supporting the fleet’s operational effectiveness by delivering essential supplies, including fuel, munitions, provisions, and technical support. These capabilities enable the BRFs to sustain the carrier strike group centered around the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle or other units involved in strategic deterrence missions. Since its delivery by the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA) on July 18, 2023, the Jacques Chevallier has demonstrated exceptional performance in diverse environments. It has spent 193 days away from its home port, including 153 days at sea, taking part in inter-service training and high-intensity exercises with allied navies. A highlight of its early operations was its participation in the AKILA mission, integrated into the carrier strike group during Mediterranean deployments. The ship has proven its operational flexibility, successfully performing complex resupply missions. Notably, on June 24, 2024, it conducted a sophisticated ammunition replenishment maneuver in coordination with a Multi-Mission Frigate (FREMM). Replenishment ships are the backbone of any blue-water navy, enabling sustained operations far from home ports. They provide essential support in terms of fuel, munitions, spare parts, and provisions, ensuring that frontline combat units, such as aircraft carriers, frigates, and submarines, can remain at sea for extended periods. For the French Navy, which aspires to maintain its position as a global maritime power, replenishment ships are critical. The Navy's capacity to deploy its carrier strike group, centered on the Charles de Gaulle, hinges on a robust and reliable logistical support system. These ships are equally vital for France’s strategic deterrence, as they support submarines and surface ships involved in the country’s nuclear deterrence missions. However, for years, France's fleet of replenishment ships has been insufficient, outdated, and overstretched, limiting the Navy's ability to operate effectively in multiple theaters simultaneously. France's existing Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR), introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, have struggled to meet the demands of a modern blue-water navy. The Somme, Marne, and Var—the three remaining BCRs—are nearing the end of their operational lives. These ships lack the fuel and cargo capacity to support modern naval operations, particularly for high-intensity deployments involving the carrier strike group or multinational coalitions.

The E-130J, previously referred to as the E-XX, is poised to replace the venerable E-6B Mercury, becoming the backbone of the Navy’s Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) mission.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lockheed Martin unveils the first C-130J-30 Super Hercules for the U.S. Navy's E-130J program, set to redefine strategic airborne communications for the TACAMO mission. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program is a transformative step in modernizing its airborne strategic communications, replacing the aging fleet of E-6B Mercury aircraft. The E-6B, built on the Boeing 707 airframe, has been a cornerstone of the Navy's 'Take Charge and Move Out' (TACAMO) mission since the 1980s. This mission ensures resilient and secure communication links between national command authorities and strategic ballistic missile submarines. However, with the closure of the Boeing 707 production line and increasing maintenance costs, the Navy has faced growing challenges in sustaining the E-6B fleet. The E-130J program addresses these issues by leveraging the modern and reliable Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Super Hercules as its foundation. This airframe was selected after rigorous evaluations under the Navy’s E-XX program, with the decision driven by the C-130J’s proven operational history, manufacturing sustainability, and ability to meet the demanding TACAMO mission requirements. The C-130J’s enhanced payload capacity, extended range, and advanced avionics systems make it an ideal platform for long-duration, mission-critical operations. In October 2024, the U.S. Navy officially designated this new platform as the E-130J. Lockheed Martin began assembling the first E-130J aircraft at its Marietta, Georgia facility shortly thereafter. The program's timeline aims for initial delivery by 2026, with additional units to follow in subsequent years. The Navy plans to procure between eight and twelve E-130J aircraft to fully replace the E-6B fleet, ensuring continuity of operations and enhanced performance. The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program, built on the C-130J-30 Super Hercules airframe, aligns with a global trend among nations to enhance strategic airborne command and control platforms, particularly for missions critical to national defense and continuity of government operations. While the United States is transitioning to this medium-sized, highly adaptable platform, other countries have opted for varying strategies based on their unique requirements, technological bases, and military doctrines. Russia’s primary airborne command and control aircraft are the Ilyushin Il-80 (NATO reporting name: Maxdome) and its smaller counterpart, the Il-82. These aircraft function as 'doomsday planes,' ensuring continuity of operations during nuclear or large-scale conflicts. Based on the Il-86 passenger aircraft platform, the Il-80 is heavily modified with advanced Very Low Frequency (VLF) communication systems to maintain secure communication with Russia’s nuclear forces, similar to the TACAMO role of the U.S. E-130J. The Il-80 is equipped with nuclear blast-resistant shielding, no external windows (other than the cockpit), and advanced onboard command systems capable of coordinating military forces in a crisis. Its larger size compared to the C-130J-30 offers greater payload capacity for extensive onboard communication suites and command equipment. However, this bulkier design limits operational versatility and requires substantial runway infrastructure, in contrast to the E-130J’s ability to operate from shorter, less-developed airstrips. China has adopted its domestically produced Y-20 Kunpeng strategic transport aircraft as the basis for a new generation of airborne command and control platforms. These modified Y-20s focus on integrating advanced communication systems that enable strategic coordination between the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) branches, particularly in operations requiring nuclear deterrence or rapid-response military mobilization. The Y-20 platform provides China with a dual-use capability, functioning both as a strategic transport and as an airborne command post. While the Y-20’s larger payload capacity and longer range provide advantages for hosting extensive command systems, its size may limit deployment flexibility, especially in contested regions where runway availability is constrained. India’s Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&amp;CS), primarily based on the Embraer ERJ 145 platform, represents a different approach. While primarily designed for surveillance and reconnaissance, these aircraft are also equipped with command and control capabilities, allowing them to serve dual purposes in strategic missions. India has also developed the DRDO AEW&amp;CS, an indigenous system designed to complement its Embraer-based fleet, with expanded roles for strategic communication. The AEW&amp;CS platforms offer cost-effective solutions compared to the larger aircraft used by the U.S., Russia, or China, but their smaller size and limited range reduce their utility for extended strategic missions such as TACAMO.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/lockheed-martin-prepares-1st-c-130j-30-super-hercules-aircraft-for-us-navy-strategic-mission	2024-11-22T01:32:33-08:00

'Israel must study this experience, utilize it, and we are already doing so because we face the same problem with Iranian drones in our territory,' he stated. Brodsky also highlighted how the war in Ukraine has driven the rapid development of innovative military technologies that Israel sees as valuable for strengthening its aerial defense capabilities. Since the conflict began in 2022, Ukraine has faced thousands of drone attacks, mainly involving Shahed-136 kamikaze drones supplied by Iran to Russia. These inexpensive, low-flying drones have posed significant threats to civilian and military infrastructure. Their frequent use has strained traditional defense systems, prompting Ukraine to innovate cost-effective and efficient solutions to counter this asymmetric threat. Among these innovations are AI-based acoustic detection systems. Ukrainian companies like Zvook have developed acoustic sensors capable of detecting drones from several kilometers away with high precision and minimal false alarms. These lightweight and affordable devices enable quick responses, reducing the damage caused by drone strikes. Additionally, Ukraine is developing interceptor drones and portable anti-drone systems, creating a flexible and adaptive defense network suited to battlefield conditions. Initially hesitant to engage with Ukrainian defense firms, Israeli companies are now actively seeking collaboration, driven by the growing drone threat. Recent partnerships include efforts to deploy early warning systems and advanced detection technologies. Ukraine's ambassador to Israel, Yevhen Korniichuk, confirmed the growing interest from Israeli firms such as Elbit and R2 in Ukrainian solutions. These collaborations offer Israel access to proven technologies while providing Ukraine with opportunities to integrate Israeli expertise and expand its international reach. This cooperation highlights the complementary strengths of both nations. Israel’s technological expertise and access to advanced systems combine with Ukraine’s battlefield-proven innovations to address common threats. Ambassador Korniichuk emphasized the importance of this synergy, stating, 'Israel and Ukraine can together develop solutions that benefit both, during and after conflict.' As the global threat of drones continues to evolve, the collaboration between Israel and Ukraine may lay the groundwork for new innovations in defense, enhancing security at both regional and international levels.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/israel-draws-on-ukraines-expertise-to-counter-iranian-drone-threats	2024-11-21T07:58:37-08:00	
Houthis Target Turkish-Owned Ship Allegedly Tied to Israel Trade	According to information published by Tasnim on November 19, 2024, the Anadolu S, managed by Istanbul-based Oras Shipping, avoided damage from two missile strikes while navigating near Yemen’s Mocha port and later southeast of Aden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Anadolu S sails through the tense waters of the Red Sea, narrowly avoiding missile strikes amidst escalating geopolitical tensions fueled by allegations of trade with Israel.. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, accusing the vessel’s owners of breaching their declared trade ban with Israel. This incident forms part of a broader Houthi initiative targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, launched after the group imposed a blockade on companies trading with Israel in May 2024. The Anadolu S is operated by Oras Shipping, a company owned by Salih Zeki Çakır, a close associate of Yıldırım and an influential figure in Turkish shipping. Çakır’s ventures, reportedly linked to trade with Israel, have drawn scrutiny amid public anti-Israel rhetoric from Turkey’s government. Türkiye-Israel relations Turkey and Israel have shared a complex and fluctuating relationship since Turkey became the first Muslim-majority nation to recognize Israel in 1949. Over the decades, their interactions have oscillated between cooperation and tension, deeply influenced by regional conflicts and domestic political dynamics. In the latter half of the 20th century, Turkey and Israel developed significant military and economic ties. Israel provided substantial military assistance to Turkey, including the modernization of Turkish F-4 Phantom and Northrop F-5 aircraft and the upgrade of Turkey’s main battle tank, the Israeli-made Sabra. Naval and aerial cooperation also strengthened bilateral ties, with mutual training and operational coordination in shared exercises. The relationship began to strain in the late 2000s, particularly after the 2008–09 Gaza War. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan openly criticized Israel's actions in Gaza, leading to increased tension. Relations hit a low point after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. The incident prompted Turkey to downgrade diplomatic ties and suspend military cooperation with Israel. Efforts to mend relations began in 2013, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the flotilla incident, paving the way for reconciliation. By 2022, diplomatic ties were fully restored with the reappointment of ambassadors, marking a renewed focus on regional stability and economic collaboration. However, recent conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon have reignited tensions. Turkish President Erdoğan has sharply criticized Israel’s military actions. This has led to a series of measures from Turkey, including the suspension of trade relations in mid-2024 and the denial of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane access to Turkish airspace during a diplomatic trip. Most significantly, in November 2024, President Erdoğan announced that Turkey had severed all relations with Israel, signaling a potential long-term rupture in their diplomatic and economic engagement.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/houthis-target-turkish-owned-ship-allegedly-tied-to-israel-trade	2024-11-21T07:53:32-08:00
