Analysis: Lessons from Ukraine War how small arms and advanced systems redefine drone defense	The Ukrainian war has provided invaluable lessons in countering aerial drones, FPV (First-Person View) drones, and loitering munitions. The conflict has forced both sides to innovate rapidly, particularly in the realm of air defense. Ukraine’s experience offers a blueprint for future warfare, emphasizing the need for layered defenses, cost-effective solutions, and adaptability in the face of evolving aerial threats.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Ukrainian soldiers target and destroy a Russian Shahed-136 kamikaze drone at close range using a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun mounted on a truck, showcasing mobile air defense capabilities in action. (Picture source: MilitaryNewsUA X account) One of the most striking elements of the Ukrainian experience is the effectiveness of small-caliber weapons against drones. Mobile air defense teams equipped with ZU-23-2 automatic cannons, mounted on trucks for rapid deployment, have been instrumental in intercepting Russian Shahed-136 drones. These 23mm twin-barreled automatic cannons, initially designed for anti-aircraft use, have proven capable of destroying drones during their low-altitude, terminal approach phase. The combination of high mobility and a rapid rate of fire allows these units to adapt to the dynamic nature of drone warfare, particularly when drones are deployed in swarms. Shotguns have emerged as another practical solution for frontline soldiers to counter FPV drones. Ukrainian forces have adopted semi-automatic shotguns, such as the Safari HG-105M and Hatsan Escort BTS 12, using buckshot cartridges to take down low-flying drones. FPV drones, often used for reconnaissance or precision strikes, are fast and operate at very low altitudes, making them difficult targets for larger, more advanced systems. The shotguns provide an inexpensive, easy-to-deploy option for infantry, particularly in urban or trench warfare scenarios where FPV drones pose an immediate threat. The Gepard Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun (SPAAG), supplied by Germany, has been a game-changer for Ukraine’s drone defense strategy. Equipped with twin 35mm Oerlikon cannons and guided by advanced radar, the Gepard has proven especially effective against loitering munitions like the Shahed-136. Its programmable AHEAD ammunition, which disperses sub-projectiles in the target's path, ensures high lethality against small, fast-moving drones.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasized the strategic significance of the project, describing the targeted logistics hub in Poland as a vital link in the supply chain to Kyiv. The Patriot MIM-104 is a versatile missile defense system designed to counter a wide range of airborne threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft. Originally developed by the United States and first deployed in the 1980s, the Patriot system has become a cornerstone of integrated defense systems for the U.S. military and its allies. It combines high-performance radar systems, advanced interceptors, and a modular, mobile architecture that allows for rapid field deployment. Featuring passive electronically scanned array radar technology, the system provides simultaneous detection, tracking, and engagement of multiple targets while maintaining resilience against electronic countermeasures. Its ability to integrate with other air defense units further strengthens its role within comprehensive air and missile defense networks. The Patriot system features several missile variants, including the PAC-2 and PAC-3, tailored to address modern threats. Notably, the PAC-3 missile employs hit-to-kill technology to neutralize warheads with exceptional precision. A standard Patriot battery includes launchers capable of carrying up to sixteen PAC-3 missiles or four PAC-2 missiles per launcher, as well as multifunction AN/MPQ-53 or -65 radars, AN/MSQ-104 control stations, and communication and power units. During operations, the radar detects and tracks threats, relays data to the control center, calculates the optimal trajectory, and guides the missile to the target. Deployed globally, the system provides robust, adaptable air defense against increasingly sophisticated threats. The proposed deployment to Poland would be temporary, lasting up to six months, with German soldiers accompanying the systems to manage their operation and maintenance. Exact details, including the placement of the units, are under discussion between Germany, Poland, NATO allies, and Brussels authorities. This move aligns with previous deployments, such as the 2023 stationing of Patriot systems in Zamosc, southeastern Poland, near the Ukrainian border, where they were tasked with protecting a key railway hub critical to military logistics. Germany could supply these Patriot systems from its inventory, which currently includes nine operational units. To address stock reductions, partly due to deliveries of Patriot systems to Ukraine since 2022, and to enhance its defense capabilities, Berlin signed a €1.4 billion contract in March 2024 for the procurement of four additional Patriot batteries. This new commitment reflects Germany’s broader military support for Ukraine. Since the start of the invasion, Berlin has become the European Union’s primary supplier of military aid to Kyiv, though this role has strained the capabilities of Germany’s armed forces. The Bundeswehr continues to face challenges stemming from years of underfunding, an issue the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz aims to address through an ambitious rearmament program. However, this effort is constrained by financial and logistical limitations. Nonetheless, Germany’s willingness to strengthen collective defense does not extend to all aspects of Ukraine’s requests. Berlin has refused to provide long-range missiles, unlike countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom, which have supplied these capabilities. The delivery of Patriot systems to Poland would significantly enhance the country’s air defense capabilities and, by extension, bolster NATO’s eastern flank. These systems, known for their ability to counter various threats, including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft, would offer critical protection to strategic infrastructure, such as logistical hubs vital for supplying Ukraine. By deploying these systems on Polish soil, NATO would strengthen its deterrence against aerial threats while improving the security of member states near the conflict zone. This deployment would also reassure NATO partners, demonstrating the Alliance’s commitment to collective defense mechanisms.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/germany-proposes-deployment-of-patriot-systems-in-poland-to-protect-ukraines-military-supply-lines	2024-11-29T02:40:22-08:00	
France to Modernize Infantry with Advanced Electronic Warfare to Counter Enemy Jamming	During the 2024 edition of the 'Présentation de l’armée de Terre' (PRAT), the French Army introduced the ISIS project, an initiative aimed at equipping infantry regiments with electronic warfare capabilities. This project, which responds to evolving operational needs observed in recent conflicts such as in Ukraine, marks an important step in expanding these capabilities beyond specialized units. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link French Army VAB CATIZ Electronic Warfare Vehicle (Picture source: French MoD) Until now, electronic warfare has been primarily handled by specialized units such as the 44th and 54th Signal Regiments and the 785th Electronic Warfare Company. These units, now grouped under the Intelligence and Cyber-Electronics Brigade (BRCE), operate under the Command of Deep Actions and Intelligence (CAPR). They use advanced systems like LINX (Localization and Interception of Exotic Emissions), CATIZ (Ground Capability for Zone Interception), and VOBULE (Vehicle for Wideband Jamming Operations). LINX is designed to locate and intercept radio signals emitted by enemy devices, such as command posts or communication systems. On the battlefield, this system is used to identify and locate enemy radio transmissions, enabling the neutralization of a communication network or precise targeting of key infrastructure. For example, during an offensive, LINX can detect an enemy command post from several kilometers away, allowing for accurate strikes or coordinated actions. The ISIS project aims to extend these capabilities to infantry units, which face modern threats such as drones, remotely operated munitions, and electronic interference. It seeks to provide simplified tools for detecting, locating, and analyzing radio signals, thereby improving real-time tactical situational awareness. CATIZ is used to monitor a defined area and intercept all radio emissions within it. On the battlefield, this system can help secure an area before an operation by intercepting signals from enemy drones or identifying jamming devices. During reconnaissance missions, CATIZ can help detect enemy activities that are invisible to the naked eye, such as hidden sensor networks or emitters used to coordinate attacks. VOBULE is a vehicle dedicated to jamming radio frequencies over a wide range. On the battlefield, it is used to prevent the enemy from communicating effectively or controlling drones. For example, during an attack on a fortified position, VOBULE can neutralize the enemy’s radio communications, causing disruption and facilitating the advance of allied forces. For reference, ISIS is presented as a system capable of continuously analyzing the radio spectrum to identify used frequency bands, locate emission sources, and characterize intercepted signals. This system provides non-specialized units with the means to monitor the electromagnetic environment and represent tactical information in real-time. According to the Technical Section of the French Army (STAT), the system will enhance communication resilience in complex or degraded environments, contributing to better control of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is essential for modern operations. The development of ISIS is being carried out in collaboration with TRAAK, a company specializing in geolocation and biometric tracking solutions, and GeePs (Electrical and Electronic Engineering Laboratory of Paris). This collaboration between industry and academic research aims to design a performance-driven solution that meets the operational needs of the French Army. Special attention is given to the system's ergonomics to ensure it can be used by non-specialized soldiers and integrated into infantry regiments. The ISIS project will enable infantry regiments to strengthen their electronic warfare operational capabilities and better respond to current electronic threats. This initiative is part of a broader effort to equip front-line units with tools adapted to modern conflicts. Still in development, ISIS represents a technological advance that could play a key role in future operations for the French Army, ensuring a strategic advantage in increasingly contested environments.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-to-modernize-infantry-with-advanced-electronic-warfare-to-counter-enemy-jamming	2024-11-29T02:29:12-08:00

Japan’s Polar Exploration: Icebreaker Shirase Departs for Antarctic Expedition	According to information published by the Japanese MoD on November 28, 2024, the Japanese icebreaker Shirase departed from Yokosuka Port, marking the start of its 66th Antarctic Observation Mission.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Japanese icebreaker Shirase departs from Yokosuka Port on a 154-day, 21,600-nautical-mile journey for the 66th Antarctic Observation Mission. (Picture source: Japanese Navy) Antarctica presents a unique geopolitical theater, where Japan’s actions subtly intertwine science, diplomacy, and latent strategic interests. Bound by the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), which forbids militarization and emphasizes peaceful, scientific cooperation, Japan ostensibly operates within these parameters. However, the nation's engagement with Antarctica reveals a deeper strategic posture shaped by its broader security concerns and regional rivalries, particularly with China and Russia. Japan’s Antarctic operations, including its robust scientific programs and logistical support from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), are emblematic of a dual-purpose strategy. The icebreaker Shirase, a JMSDF vessel, exemplifies this balance, officially providing logistical support for research missions while implicitly signaling Japan’s capacity to project power—even in the world’s most remote regions. This dual use of military assets underscores Japan’s subtle assertion of presence in a region increasingly viewed through a strategic lens, despite its demilitarized status. In the context of Japan’s geopolitical reality, its Antarctic engagement cannot be disentangled from its Indo-Pacific strategy. China’s assertive expansion in both polar regions—characterized by the construction of research bases and resource mapping—casts a long shadow over Antarctic governance. For Japan, China's activities represent more than scientific competition; they echo the broader challenge of revisionist powers undermining established norms. This concern becomes even more pressing when coupled with Russia’s militarization of the Arctic, which Japan sees as a harbinger of potential shifts in Antarctic policy, should global tensions erode the ATS’s framework. Japan’s scientific endeavors in Antarctica also reflect a calculated effort to shape the continent’s future governance. Its leadership in research reinforces its role as a stakeholder in the ATS, ensuring that any renegotiation of the treaty or its protocols—particularly regarding resource exploitation—will include its voice. The issue of marine resources, such as krill fisheries, further highlights the tensions between conservation and economic interests.

US Bases in United Kingdom Under Surveillance Following Multiple Incursions by Drones	Since November 20, 2024, several U.S. air bases in the United Kingdom have reported repeated incursions by unidentified drones, raising significant concerns among military and political leaders. The initial incidents were reported near Royal Air Force (RAF) Lakenheath but soon extended to RAF Mildenhall, RAF Feltwell, and, most recently, RAF Fairford, approximately 210 kilometers southwest. RAF Fairford currently hosts four B-52 strategic bombers as part of the Bomber Task Force 25-1 mission. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A B-52H Stratofortress from the 2nd Bomb Wing, Barksdale Air Force Base, La., lands at Royal Air Force Base Fairford, England as part of Bomber Task Force 25-1, Nov. 5, 2024 (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) confirmed that these incursions, which occurred between November 20 and 24, now include RAF Fairford. While the incidents have not directly impacted base infrastructure or local residents, they pose a security risk. In response, fighter aircraft have been deployed to intercept the drones. Additionally, approximately 60 British troops, including specialists in counter-drone operations, have been stationed at the bases to strengthen security measures. Nick Timothy, a Member of Parliament representing the Lakenheath and Mildenhall areas, noted that nighttime interceptions have raised concerns among local residents, highlighting the challenges of safeguarding military installations situated near populated areas. The incidents underscore the limitations faced by military bases operating within a civilian framework. In the United Kingdom, airspace is managed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which enforces regulatory constraints on military actions. These restrictions limit the use of active countermeasures, such as radio jamming or kinetic weapons, complicating responses to drone incursions. Similar incidents have been recorded in the United States, notably in 2023 at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, home to F-22 Raptors. According to a senior defense official, the Pentagon records an average of two to three drone incursions weekly near U.S. military installations, although specific locations are not disclosed. The widespread availability of inexpensive commercial drones exacerbates security concerns. While often used for harmless purposes, drones can be adapted for surveillance or disruption of military activities. The conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated how commercial drones can be modified for reconnaissance or offensive missions, increasing their potential threat in military contexts. To address this growing risk, the U.S. Air Force is exploring cost-effective solutions to counter individual drones and drone swarms, avoiding the expense of traditional missile-based systems. Research is focused on technologies such as directed-energy weapons, electronic jamming systems, and advanced sensors to detect incursions in real time. The impacted bases, particularly RAF Lakenheath and RAF Fairford, are critical to U.S. military operations in Europe. RAF Lakenheath hosts squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle and F-35A Lightning II fighter jets, while RAF Fairford serves as a temporary base for B-52 bombers, which are essential for strategic deterrence and power projection missions. Although U.S. and British officials have stated that operational missions remain unaffected, these incursions highlight potential vulnerabilities. Enhanced bilateral cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States will be vital to identify those responsible for the incursions, understand their objectives, and strengthen defensive capabilities against this emerging threat. The repeated drone incursions near U.S. bases in the United Kingdom underscore the evolving challenges posed by modern threats in a global military environment. These incidents demand a coordinated strategic response and the implementation of advanced technologies to protect critical military infrastructure. Without rapid enhancement of defensive measures, such incursions could become a recurring issue, jeopardizing the security of bases and the stability of international military operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/us-bases-in-united-kingdom-under-surveillance-following-multiple-incursions-by-drones	2024-11-28T05:53:13-08:00	
France Revises Its Military Strategy by Shifting Forces from Africa to United Arab Emirates	In the framework of a strategic reassessment of its military presence abroad, France is set to significantly reduce its troop levels in Africa while increasing deployments in the United Arab Emirates. This reorientation, announced in an interview with L’Opinion by Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu, is driven by both political and operational considerations, marking a shift in France’s defense strategy aimed at balancing military effectiveness with local perceptions. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers includes 16 Leclerc tanks, VBCI-equipped infantry, five CAESAr artillery systems, and a command and logistics squadron (Picture source: French MoD) A report presented to President Emmanuel Macron by Jean-Marie Bockel recommends a drastic reduction in French forces stationed in Africa, in line with guidelines set by the Élysée in February 2023. This repositioning aligns with a strategy of enhanced partnership with local armed forces and a restructuring of French military bases. Official figures indicate that troop levels will be scaled down from 2,300 to just 600 personnel, distributed among Chad, Gabon, Côte d’Ivoire, and Senegal. Djibouti, considered part of the Indo-Pacific strategy, remains unchanged. The Chief of Defense Staff, General Thierry Burkhard, defended this adjustment during a Senate hearing, stating that while France’s military presence in Africa had proven effective, negative perceptions were undermining its benefits. The revised approach will focus on temporary deployments driven by local requests, reducing the footprint of French forces and the visibility of their bases, often located in capital cities. This transition seeks to lessen the symbolic and operational impact of their presence. France has gradually reduced its military presence in Africa and West Africa in recent years. In August 2022, French troops withdrew from Mali following tensions with the ruling military junta. In December 2022, they also pulled out of the Central African Republic, where they had been deployed since 2013, due to deteriorating relations with the Central African government and the arrival of Russian forces, notably the Wagner Group. In February 2023, France announced the withdrawal of its forces from Burkina Faso after the expulsion of its ambassador by the military junta. More recently, in September 2023, France decided to withdraw its troops from Niger following the military coup on July 26, 2023, and at the request of the new Nigerien authorities. Meanwhile, Russian and Chinese influence in Africa has intensified. Russia, through the Wagner Group and later Africka Korps, has strengthened its presence in the Central African Republic, providing military and security assistance to the government in power. This presence has been accompanied by a disinformation campaign aimed at advancing Russian interests and undermining Western influence. China, for its part, has increased its investments in Africa, particularly in West Africa, by multiplying infrastructure projects and becoming one of the continent's main trading partners. These initiatives aim to strengthen economic and political ties between China and African countries, offering an alternative to traditional partnerships with Western powers.Simultaneously, to address broader strategic needs, France plans to strengthen its military presence in the UAE, where it already maintains a substantial deployment. Under a 2008 defense agreement, the French Forces in the United Arab Emirates (FFEAU) consist of 650 to 700 personnel stationed at a naval base, the Al Dhafra Air Base—home to six Rafale jets from the 1/7 Provence Fighter Squadron—and Zayed Military City, which hosts the 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers. The 5th Regiment of Cuirassiers is a versatile unit comprising a command and logistics squadron, 16 Leclerc tanks, an infantry section equipped with Infantry Fighting Vehicles (VBCI), and an artillery sub-unit operating five CAESAr self-propelled artillery systems. Minister Lecornu announced that starting in 2025, this regiment will be bolstered by the permanent deployment of an infantry company of approximately 100 soldiers. Additional engineering capabilities may also be deployed to enhance cooperation with Emirati forces. This strategic realignment is designed to operationalize the Franco-Emirati defense agreement while meeting specific operational requirements. The FFEAU fulfill three primary missions: supporting French operational deployments in the region, fostering military cooperation with the UAE, and hosting units from metropolitan France and foreign contingents for training in desert and urban environments typical of the Middle East.This rebalancing reflects France's determination to adapt its geopolitical priorities to a shifting international context while consolidating key partnerships in strategically important regions. By strengthening its presence in the United Arab Emirates, France seizes the opportunity to project its operational capabilities in the Middle East, a critical area for global energy security and international trade. This deployment also enables more effective participation in regional stabilization efforts and counterterrorism operations. Furthermore, close cooperation with Emirati forces provides benefits in terms of training, technological exchanges, and arms sales, thereby bolstering the French defense industry.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-revises-its-military-strategy-by-shifting-forces-from-africa-to-united-arab-emirates	2024-11-28T05:13:59-08:00

Analysis: What is the 64N6 'Tombstone' Radar Destroyed by Ukraine's ATACMS Missile Strike?	The 64N6 'Tombstone' radar, a critical element of Russia's S-300 and S-400 air defense missile systems, was recently destroyed by Ukrainian forces in a precision strike using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles. This radar is a surveillance tool and a cornerstone of Russia’s air defense network, designed to detect, track, and manage aerial threats across vast distances. Its destruction marks a significant blow to the Russian military, as it directly undermines the effectiveness of one of its most formidable surface-to-air missile systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The 64N6 'Tombstone' Radar, a pivotal component of Russia's S-300 air defense system, known for its long-range surveillance and threat management capabilities. Overlayed is an image vignette of the radar's aftermath, destroyed by a precision Ukrainian ATACMS missile strike, highlighting the impact of modern warfare on critical defense infrastructure. (Picture source: Mix Army Recognition Group/Telegram) The 64N6, NATO designation Tombstone is a long-range, three-dimensional phased-array radar operating in the S-band frequency, making it highly effective in detecting aerodynamic and ballistic targets. With a maximum detection range of approximately 300 kilometers, the radar can monitor and identify threats well beyond the immediate engagement zone of the S-300 PM air defense missile systems family. It can simultaneously track up to 100 targets, including fast-moving fighter aircraft, low-flying cruise missiles, and high-speed ballistic projectiles. This multitasking capability ensures that the S-300 PM system can respond to multiple threats in a highly dynamic combat environment. A key feature of the 64N6 radar is its phased-array antenna, which allows for rapid and precise scanning of airspace. This technology enables the radar to continuously track targets accurately while resisting electronic countermeasures, such as jamming. Mounted on a semi-trailer, the radar is mobile and can be deployed quickly, ensuring that it remains operational despite shifting battlefield dynamics. The 64N6 radar is important because it acts as the 'eyes' of the S-300PM/PMU-1 system. It acts as the primary sensor for target acquisition and feeds real-time data to the command post, which coordinates the engagement of threats using the system’s missiles. Without the 64N6, the S-300 system is effectively blind, unable to detect or engage incoming threats with the same level of precision. This makes the radar a high-value target in any conflict where disrupting enemy air defenses is a priority. For Ukraine, destroying the 64N6 radar represents a major tactical victory. By neutralizing this critical component, Ukrainian forces have significantly degraded Russia's regional air defense capabilities. This creates opportunities for Ukrainian drones, missiles, and aircraft to operate with reduced risk, enabling more effective strikes against other strategic targets. The use of ATACMS missiles for this operation highlights the strategic importance of such targets. With their extended range and precision, ATACMS missiles are ideally suited for striking high-value assets like the 64N6 from well behind the front lines. The loss of the 64N6 radar also creates long-term challenges for Russia. Replacing such a sophisticated and expensive system requires significant time, resources, and logistical coordination. This delays Russia's ability to restore full air defense coverage in the area, leaving critical infrastructure and military assets vulnerable to future attacks. From a broader perspective, the destruction of the 64N6 radar underscores the evolving nature of modern warfare, where targeting critical nodes in an enemy’s air defense network can shift the operational balance. For Ukraine, this successful strike demonstrates not only its growing capability to counter advanced Russian technology but also the strategic value of leveraging Western-supplied precision-guided munitions to achieve high-impact results. As the conflict continues, operations like this will likely play a pivotal role in shaping the battlefield dynamics and weakening Russia's overall defensive posture.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-what-is-the-64n6-tombstone-radar-destroyed-by-ukraines-atacms-missile-strike	2024-11-27T07:09:41-08:00

ERSA cameras are equipped with both electro-optical and infrared imaging, high-definition resolution, and features such as infrared colorization that enhance target detection through heat signatures. These capabilities are further supported by a laser rangefinder that accurately measures the distance and altitude of objects. According to Air Force Master Sgt. Kendrick Wilburn, who oversees operations at the Joint Air Defense Operations Center (JADOC), the system can automatically lock onto and track moving targets through machine learning algorithms. The more the system is utilized, the more precise it becomes, improving its overall effectiveness. The system also includes a visual warning device using a red-green laser to alert non-compliant aircraft to immediately exit the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA). These eye-safe lasers help avoid the need for costly military aircraft deployments to investigate potential violations. Wilburn explains that these visual signals, referred to by operators as 'sparkles,' often prompt pilots to adjust their course and contact the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as required. This advanced defense system was developed to address the complex challenges of urban airspace protection. Testing conducted in 2022 compared several camera prototypes, with Teleidoscope emerging as the preferred choice due to its significant software enhancements. Currently, two cameras are operational, and in upcoming phases, plans are to deploy an additional seven cameras each year. The ERSA system could, in the future, benefit from advancements achieved with the MEGA-Army application developed by Belgian company IDDEA. Originally designed for identifying land-based military equipment through advanced image recognition, the application could be adapted for aircraft identification. Such an adaptation would not only enable recognition of aircraft but also provide detailed information on their capabilities, armaments, radar systems, and defensive measures. This integration could enhance ERSA’s ability to deliver critical real-time data for identifying and validating aerial threats. These developments highlight the potential of combining aerial surveillance technologies with advanced recognition tools, further modernizing defense strategies. Improvements brought by the ERSA system have already transformed how aerial threats are detected and managed. Wilburn notes that the cameras are capable of detecting and tracking small targets, such as birds in flight—capabilities unattainable with previous systems. Additionally, partial automation of the system allows operators to focus on more complex analytical tasks, such as evaluating the intent of suspicious aircraft. This modernization reflects a proactive approach to preventing incidents akin to those of September 11, 2001. By integrating advanced technology, artificial intelligence, and human expertise, the ERSA system provides a robust and adaptable response to contemporary aerial threats. The Department of Defense, in collaboration with the Air Force and the Accelerate the Procurement and Fielding of Innovative Technologies program, has facilitated the rapid implementation of this project, underscoring the United States' commitment to protecting its critical infrastructure.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/ai-enhanced-cameras-deployed-to-prevent-aerial-attacks-on-washingtons-strategic-sites	2024-11-27T04:59:17-08:00

Türkiye renews its interest in 40 F-35 fighter jets amid possible US policy shift	On November 26, 2024, Turkish Defense Minister Yaşar Güler addressed the Planning and Budget Committee in the Turkish Parliament, stating that the United States may reconsider selling F-35 fighter jets to Türkiye. He revealed that Türkiye had formally resubmitted its request to purchase 40 F-35s and emphasized that six aircraft originally ordered by Türkiye remain in storage in the U.S., undelivered due to Türkiye’s removal from the F-35 program in 2019.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Türkiye became a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program in 2002, intending to procure 100 F-35As, but was removed from the program following the purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems. (Picture source: US Air Force) Güler linked this potential shift in U.S. policy to Türkiye’s progress in developing its fifth-generation fighter jet, named KAAN, produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ). The KAAN conducted its maiden flight in early 2024 and is intended to replace aging F-16s in the Turkish Air Force by the 2030s. According to Güler, U.S. officials have recently expressed the possibility of providing the F-35s, though no definitive progress has been made. Güler also reiterated Türkiye’s position on reclaiming its production share in the F-35 program, alongside acquiring the additional jets. Türkiye became a partner in the Joint Strike Fighter program in 2002, intending to procure 100 F-35A variants. Turkish companies contributed to the aircraft's production with a combined investment exceeding $1 billion. The first Turkish F-35A was completed in 2018, with deliveries expected to follow training of Turkish pilots in the United States. However, deliveries were halted in 2019 after Türkiye purchased Russian S-400 air defense systems, which the U.S. argued posed a security risk to the F-35 platform. This led to Türkiye’s removal from the program and the reallocation of eight Turkish-bound F-35s to the U.S. Air Force. Despite Türkiye's suspension, production of some F-35 components in Türkiye continued until 2022 under preexisting contracts. The U.S. has not refunded the $1.4 billion paid by Türkiye for the aircraft. In early 2024, U.S. officials indicated that Türkiye could potentially rejoin the program if it abandoned the S-400 system. However, Güler stated that Türkiye has no plans to discard the S-400s, noting that the system remains inactive but could be operational within 12 hours if necessary. In parallel, Türkiye has pursued the modernization of its fighter fleet. Türkiye has committed to purchasing 40 F-16 Block 70 Viper aircraft, with an estimated total cost of $6.5–7 billion, including specialized munitions and logistical support. An initial payment of $1.4 billion has already been made. However, Güler announced that Türkiye had canceled plans to modernize 79 older F-16s with U.S. Viper kits, delegating the task to Turkish Aerospace Industries under the domestic ÖZGÜR program, which involves locally designed hardware and software. Türkiye has also sought to diversify its fleet with the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. Initial hesitancy from Germany delayed the deal, but Güler confirmed that approvals have now been obtained from all relevant European parties, allowing discussions to proceed. Türkiye’s acquisition of the S-400 system remains a central issue in its defense strategy and relations with NATO allies. Güler explained that the system is intended for use only in response to high-level air threats. Its acquisition in 2017 marked Türkiye as the first NATO member to purchase the Russian system, straining relations with the U.S. and prompting sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has previously asserted that Türkiye will recoup the $1.4 billion paid for the F-35 program, either through delivery of the jets or reimbursement. Additionally, Erdoğan has stated that Türkiye’s purchase of the S-400 was a necessity after the U.S. refused to sell Patriot missile systems. Turkish officials have maintained that the S-400s will operate independently from NATO’s defense network. The U.S.-Türkiye discussions over the F-35 coincide with broader defense developments in Türkiye. Mass production of the Altay main battle tank is set to begin by the end of 2025. Türkiye has also continued to assert its maritime claims in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean, with Güler accusing Greece of militarizing demilitarized zones and reaffirming Türkiye’s rights under international law. Türkiye’s position within NATO remains complex. Its veto power has influenced negotiations on other defense matters, such as approving Sweden and Finland’s NATO memberships. As Türkiye seeks to balance its national defense priorities with its NATO commitments, its renewed bid for F-35s highlights ongoing efforts to resolve disputes with the U.S. and diversify its military capabilities. Whether these efforts lead to Türkiye’s readmission into the F-35 program remains uncertain, as discussions continue amid longstanding geopolitical tensions.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/tuerkiye-renews-its-interest-in-40-f-35-fighter-jets-amid-possible-us-policy-shift	2024-11-27T02:03:25-08:00	
France to develop new ballistic missile for addressing gaps in long-range strike capabilities	According to Challenges on November 27, 2024, France is exploring the development of a new land-based ballistic missile with a range exceeding 1,000 kilometers, the first such initiative since 1997. This development reflects a growing global reliance on ballistic missiles, which have proven effective in various conflicts. The proposed missile aims to fill a gap in France’s capabilities, as its current ballistic missile systems are exclusively submarine-based and designed for nuclear deterrence.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Pluton land-based ballistic missile, developed in the 1960s, served as a key component of France's tactical nuclear deterrence during the Cold War, with a range of 7 to 120 km and a 25-kiloton warhead. (Picture source: Facebook/Les Historateurs) France currently lacks land-based ballistic missile capabilities. Its only ballistic missile, the submarine-launched M51, serves as a nuclear deterrent. Discussions between the French armed forces and the Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) have centered on creating a land-based missile system operable from mobile platforms, such as trucks. Early design concepts suggest the missile may feature terminal-phase maneuverability similar to other advanced systems, making it more difficult for enemy defenses to intercept. The effectiveness of such ballistic missiles has been evident in recent conflicts. For example, Ukraine’s interception rate of Russia’s Iskander-M missiles stands at just 4.3%, while Iranian strikes on Israel revealed the limitations of advanced systems like Iron Dome and David’s Sling against large-scale attacks. Historically, France has developed several ground-launched ballistic missiles since World War II. Between 1946 and 1947, German engineers in France worked on the Super V2, an intermediate-range ballistic missile project with planned variants capable of ranges up to 3,600 kilometers and warheads weighing up to 1,000 kilograms. However, the project was discontinued in 1948. The S2 missile, operational from 1971, was a two-stage, solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile equipped with a 1.2-megaton thermonuclear warhead. It was succeeded in 1980 by the S3 missile, which shared similar specifications and remained in service until 1996. In 1974, France introduced the Pluton missile, a short-range tactical ballistic missile with a range of up to 120 kilometers, designed for nuclear or conventional warheads. The Pluton was replaced in 1991 by the Hadès missile, which had a range of approximately 480 kilometers. Intended as a pre-strategic nuclear deterrent, the Hadès missile was decommissioned by 1997. This new program is distinct from France's Long-Range Land Strike (FLP-T) initiative, which focuses on developing rocket artillery replacements with ranges up to 150 kilometers. In contrast, the proposed ballistic missile would exceed 1,000 kilometers, offering additional strategic options for deep strikes in conflicts. However, funding remains a significant challenge, as France’s military budget is already allocated to high-priority projects such as M51 missile upgrades and the development of the ASN4G air-launched nuclear missile. This potential project could also align with the European Long-Range Strike Approach (ELSA), a collaborative initiative involving Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. If developed, the missile would complement France’s existing capabilities, such as Rafale jets and cruise missiles, enhancing its capacity for strategic strikes. Ballistic missiles are designed to deliver warheads over long distances via a high-arcing trajectory. They are powered during the initial phase of flight, after which they follow a ballistic path influenced by gravity and air resistance. This design enables them to strike targets at ranges varying from short to intercontinental distances. Their high speed and altitude make interception challenging. Some ballistic missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to deploy multiple warheads to different targets. These features underline the strategic importance of ballistic missiles, as demonstrated by their effectiveness in recent conflicts and their potential to address gaps in capabilities like those identified in France’s current arsenal. On October 1, 2024, Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, with several penetrating Israel's multi-layered missile defense systems and striking key military bases. In response, Israel conducted airstrikes using Blue Sparrow ballistic missiles carried by F-15 fighters. Analysts regard these exchanges as part of the first 'ballistic battle,' following similar events in April 2024. Russia has employed nearly 200 ballistic missiles since its invasion of Ukraine began, including the Iskander and Kinzhal systems, as well as North Korean-manufactured KN-23 missiles. Russia has also developed new missiles like the Oreshnik and Iskander-1000, which reportedly doubles the range of its predecessor. On October 22, 2024, Yehor Cherniev, head of Ukraine's NATO delegation, indicated forthcoming 'concrete results' from the use of domestically produced ballistic missiles, likely referring to the Hrim-2. The United States, meanwhile, has progressed with its Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) program, delivering the first units in December 2023. Non-state actors such as the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon have also demonstrated the increasing proliferation of ballistic missile technology. China has heavily invested in ballistic missile programs, with systems like the DF-21D and DF-26 capable of targeting installations across the Western Pacific. Additionally, the range of its DF-100 supersonic missile has been extended to 4,000 kilometers. South Korea’s Hyunmoo-V missile, capable of carrying an eight-ton warhead over 3,000 kilometers, targets underground facilities and strategic sites in North Korea. North Korea has also tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, potentially solid-fueled, with the capability to reach the United States. These developments underscore the increasing importance of land-based, long-range strike capabilities in modern defense strategies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-to-develop-new-ballistic-missile-for-addressing-gaps-in-long-range-strike-capabilities	2024-11-27T01:51:51-08:00

Within weeks, a preliminary technical concept was developed, quickly evolving into the drone evacuation system, named DRONEVAC. Between 2020 and 2021, the team used advanced simulation tools, such as Simulink, to model and optimize the aircraft's behavior, resolving potential issues before building a physical prototype. In 2021, a functional prototype was tested to validate its performance, including autonomy, payload capacity, and robustness. By 2022, Avilus partnered with the German Army, particularly the Bundeswehr Medical Academy and the Medical Squadron Bischofswiesen, to test the drone in real military exercises. These trials were supplemented by logistics missions and medical evacuation scenarios conducted in collaboration with KNDS to demonstrate the coordination between autonomous aerial and ground transport systems. In 2023, the drone was officially presented as a modular and operational solution, also integrating a ground control segment (GCS) linked to the BOXER armored vehicle, enabling mobile and secure mission management. This gradual development reflects Avilus' commitment to meeting modern operational needs by combining technological innovation, digital simulation, and strategic partnerships. The Grille drone stands out for its advanced technical capabilities.

Analysis: Russia’s Hypersonic Missiles Cannot Be Countered by Current US and European Air Defenses	Due to the new threats posed by hypersonic ballistic missiles, particularly those that Russia could deploy to target Ukraine and potentially Europe, the urgency of developing effective countermeasures has become critical. With their extreme speed and unpredictable flight paths, these weapons remain unstoppable by today’s air defense systems. No existing system can reliably intercept and destroy hypersonic ballistic missiles, leaving nations vulnerable to a new class of advanced weaponry. As the global arms race intensifies, countries like the United States and key European nations focus on detecting and countering this emerging threat.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Russian Air Force Mikoyan MiG-31K fighter jet carrying the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile. (Picture source: Wikimedia) Hypersonic ballistic missiles, capable of traveling at speeds greater than Mach 5 and maneuvering unpredictably, expose critical gaps in missile defense systems. While advanced radar systems have proven effective at detecting and tracking these high-speed threats, no current air defense system can intercept or destroy them. Modern radars, such as the U.S. AN/TPY-2 and SPY-6, are specifically designed to detect and track hypersonic targets from long ranges. The AN/TPY-2, a key component of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, is capable of tracking both ballistic missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. Similarly, the SPY-6 radar, integrated with the Aegis Weapon System, enhances multi-target tracking capabilities, offering a significant upgrade for naval defenses. Space-based systems, including the U.S. Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and the emerging Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensors (HBTSS), complement these ground-based capabilities by providing persistent, global surveillance and early warning of missile threats. However, detection alone is insufficient without the development of interceptors capable of neutralizing these advanced weapons. In Europe, systems like Israel's Green Pine radar—adopted as part of Germany's Arrow 3 missile defense acquisition—are being leveraged for early warning and tracking of high-speed threats. Additionally, Sweden’s Saab-developed Giraffe 4A radar highlights how European nations are investing in versatile detection systems. These capabilities, however, only address one part of the problem. Detecting a hypersonic missile is not the same as intercepting it. The inability to intercept hypersonic ballistic missiles is exacerbated by the rapid development of these weapons by nations such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. Russia has already deployed hypersonic systems like the Avangard glide vehicle and the Kinzhal missile, which have been touted as capable of evading all known missile defense systems. These weapons have been integrated into its military arsenal, with the Kinzhal reportedly used during the conflict in Ukraine. China is developing its own hypersonic arsenal, including the DF-ZF glide vehicle and other advanced systems aimed at bypassing U.S. and allied defenses. North Korea has recently tested hypersonic missiles, signaling its ambitions to incorporate such technologies into its strategic weapons program. Meanwhile, Iran has unveiled prototypes of hypersonic missiles, further raising concerns about regional stability and global proliferation. Northrop Grumman is set to produce the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), a groundbreaking defensive system designed to counter hypersonic missile threats. (Picture source: Northrop Grumman) The United States has taken a leading role in developing advanced interception technologies to address the hypersonic missile challenge. One of the most promising programs is the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI), specifically designed to neutralize hypersonic glide vehicles during their glide phase—the most vulnerable segment of their flight. This phase occurs after the missile has re-entered the atmosphere but before it reaches its terminal trajectory, providing a critical window for interception. The GPI is being developed to integrate seamlessly with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system, leveraging its advanced radar and fire-control systems for deployment from naval platforms. The GPI represents a significant technological leap in hypersonic defense, utilizing advanced propulsion, guidance, and sensor technologies to engage maneuvering hypersonic targets that conventional missile defenses cannot counter. Initial development has progressed steadily, but operational capability is not expected until the latter half of the decade, reflecting the complexity of the challenges involved. In parallel, the U.S. is also advancing directed energy solutions, such as high-energy lasers and microwave systems, aimed at disabling hypersonic weapons during their boost phase, where they are still accelerating and most vulnerable. While these technologies remain experimental in 2024, they offer a promising complementary layer of defense that could significantly enhance U.S. capabilities against hypersonic threats in the future. In Europe, collaborative efforts to address the hypersonic missile threat are gaining momentum, with the TWISTER (Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based Theater Surveillance) program standing out as a flagship initiative. Supported by the European Defence Fund, TWISTER is part of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) framework and aims to develop a next-generation missile defense system capable of addressing a broad spectrum of advanced threats, including hypersonic glide vehicles, maneuvering reentry vehicles, and other advanced ballistic threats. The TWISTER program emphasizes a multi-layered defense approach that integrates space-based and ground-based components. One of its core objectives is to develop a state-of-the-art interceptor capable of engaging hypersonic threats in both endo-atmospheric (within the Earth's atmosphere) and exo-atmospheric (outside the atmosphere) flight phases. This new interceptor, tentatively referred to as the 'Endo-Exo Interceptor,' will feature advanced propulsion and guidance systems to address the speed and maneuverability of hypersonic missiles. Key to the TWISTER program is its reliance on space-based theater surveillance. The program envisions deploying a network of advanced sensors in orbit to provide persistent tracking and early warning of missile threats. These sensors will complement existing terrestrial radar systems, significantly enhancing Europe's ability to detect and monitor hypersonic weapons during all phases of flight. France leads the TWISTER program, with participation from Germany, Italy, Finland, Spain, and the Netherlands, reflecting the EU’s commitment to pooling resources and expertise for collective security. The program’s development phase is well underway to achieve operational capability in the 2030s. Complementing TWISTER is the HYDEF (Hypersonic Defence Interceptor) program, which focuses specifically on developing an endo-atmospheric interceptor for terminal-phase interception of hypersonic threats. Together, these programs represent Europe’s proactive response to the growing capabilities of nations like Russia and China in the hypersonic domain. They also underscore the EU's determination to develop indigenous technologies that reduce reliance on external defense systems and enhance regional security. Germany will receive the Arrow 3 missile defense system, while the next-generation Arrow 4 will feature capabilities to intercept hypersonic missiles. (Picture source Is Israeli MoD) Germany’s acquisition of the Arrow 3 air defense missile system from Israel adds an important, albeit interim, layer of defense for Europe. The system, designed for exo-atmospheric interception of ballistic missiles, provides Germany with advanced capabilities to defend against high-altitude threats. While Arrow 3 offers limited potential to counter some hypersonic missiles, it remains fundamentally a ballistic missile defense system. This highlights the pressing need for Europe to accelerate the development of dedicated hypersonic countermeasures to address emerging threats fully. Israel and the United States have already embarked on developing the Arrow 4, an advanced upgrade to the Arrow family of missile defense systems. Arrow 4 aims to bridge the gap by offering enhanced capabilities to intercept next-generation threats, including hypersonic glide vehicles. Designed to replace the older Arrow 2 system and work alongside Arrow 3, the Arrow 4 is being engineered with more sophisticated propulsion, maneuverability, and advanced targeting technologies. Its ability to engage hypersonic missiles during the glide phase or high-speed terminal phase represents a significant step forward in missile defense. Although Arrow 4 remains under development, its planned capabilities align with Germany’s long-term defense strategy, suggesting that it could eventually become a cornerstone of Europe’s hypersonic missile defense architecture. By adopting and potentially co-developing such cutting-edge systems, Germany and its European allies are positioning themselves to address the growing missile threat from state actors such as Russia, China, and North Korea. Arrow 4’s anticipated deployment later in the decade further underscores the ongoing efforts to enhance collective security and technological independence within NATO and the European Union. Despite these advancements, hypersonic missiles' unpredictable trajectories and extreme speeds leave defense planners with little margin for error. Tracking systems provide early warning, but the response time for interception remains critically short. Integrating artificial intelligence into missile defense systems is being explored to enhance real-time tracking and response capabilities. Additionally, reliance on space-based detection is expected to grow, as nations expand satellite networks to provide persistent global surveillance of missile activities. While detection capabilities have seen significant progress, the absence of proven hypersonic interception technologies underscores the urgency of continued innovation. As hypersonic weapons proliferate, international collaboration and sustained investment in advanced technologies will be essential to safeguarding global security against this unprecedented threat.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-russias-hypersonic-missiles-cannot-be-stopped-by-current-us-and-european-air-defenses	2024-11-26T07:51:09-08:00

In contrast, the Nirit-class relied on diesel engines optimized for shorter, coastal missions. In terms of armament, the Reshef-class incorporates cutting-edge systems, including the Barak 8 missile system for air defense and the naval version of the Iron Dome (C-Dome), ensuring protection against aerial threats and high-speed missiles. Its secondary armaments include a 76 mm OTO Melara Super Rapid gun, along with remote weapon systems. The Nirit-class, while equipped with the Gabriel anti-ship missile and a basic Phalanx CIWS, lacks the multi-layered defense capabilities critical for modern threats like drones and advanced missiles. The sensor and radar suite in the Reshef-class is another leap forward. It integrates advanced AESA radars capable of tracking both air and surface threats, a significant improvement over the conventional radars used in the Nirit-class. Additionally, the Reshef-class is equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems to counter electronic and cyber threats, further enhancing its survivability. From a mission perspective, the Reshef-class is designed for multi-domain warfare, capable of defending offshore assets such as gas platforms, while also excelling in traditional maritime security roles.

Greece and Türkiye Draw Inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome to Develop Their Own Air Defense Systems	Amid ongoing strategic competition, Greece and Türkiye, despite being NATO allies, are intensifying efforts to develop advanced air defense systems, as reported by Forbes. While their approaches differ significantly, both nations share a key similarity: they draw substantial inspiration from Israel’s battle-tested defense technologies. Greece seeks to collaborate with Israel to either acquire or co-develop systems modeled after the Iron Dome, while Türkiye is pursuing an autonomous approach with its 'Steel Dome' project, emphasizing self-reliance against perceived threats. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link While Israeli systems serve as a model, Greece's collaboration with Israel reflects its broader strategy to diversify alliances with the US and EU, while Türkiye pursues independent defense development (Picture source: Raphael) In November 2024, Greece expressed its interest in partnering with Israel to enhance its air defense capabilities. Athens is exploring two main options: co-developing a customized system with Tel Aviv or procuring established Israeli technologies like the Iron Dome or David’s Sling. According to Reuters, this collaboration could involve an estimated €2 billion investment, reflecting Greece’s commitment to modernizing its military. The move aligns with recent acquisitions by other European nations, such as Germany and Finland, of similar Israeli systems. Israeli defense systems have become a global benchmark. The Iron Dome, designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery, has proven highly effective in high-density attacks. Complementing it, the David’s Sling intercepts medium-range ballistic threats, while the Arrow 3 targets high-altitude projectiles in the exo-atmosphere. These multi-layered capabilities are particularly appealing to Greece, whose existing military infrastructure could benefit from enhanced protection against evolving threats. Greece already maintains strong defense ties with Israel. In 2022, it deployed an anti-drone network based on Israeli technology, adapted to its specific needs. This system protects strategic sites, including islands in the Aegean Sea, an area frequently subject to Turkish military overflights. Expanding this cooperation could provide Greece with capabilities similar to the Iron Dome while bolstering its defense posture amid regional tensions. Türkiye, by contrast, is pursuing a different strategy. It is developing air defense systems independently, as its relations with Israel remain strained due to political tensions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Despite this, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced plans to create a system equivalent to the Iron Dome, branded as the 'Steel Dome.' This ambition reflects Türkiye’s effort to demonstrate its technological capacity without external assistance. Ankara is leveraging its domestic defense industry to build a multi-layered air defense system. Its low-altitude Korkut and Sungur systems are replacing U.S.-made Stinger missiles, while the Hisar O provides medium-altitude coverage. At the top of this network is the Siper, which can reportedly intercept threats at a range of up to 100 km. However, Türkiye’s acquisition of Russian S-400 systems in 2019 remains unresolved due to sanctions and NATO compatibility concerns, leaving them unintegrated into its broader defense network. The longstanding rivalry between Greece and Türkiye, rooted in historical disputes over the Aegean Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Cyprus, continues to fuel their respective military ambitions. These tensions, frequently marked by displays of force, justify both nations’ heavy investments in advanced defensive systems. Israel’s role as a global leader in air defense extends beyond this regional dynamic. European countries are increasingly adopting Israeli technologies to bolster their own capabilities. Germany recently acquired the Arrow 3 system, while Finland, a new NATO member, opted for the David’s Sling. Central European nations, including Hungary and Slovakia, have also integrated components of the Iron Dome into their arsenals. This trend underscores Europe’s growing focus on reliable defense solutions to address contemporary threats, both state and non-state in origin. The strategic implications of these developments are significant. Greece’s partnership with Israel strengthens its alignment with Western allies and enhances its deterrence against Türkiye’s military activities, particularly around contested Aegean islands. Meanwhile, Türkiye’s 'Steel Dome' project aims to address its perceived threats while projecting regional autonomy. These advancements also impact NATO, which must balance the conflicting interests of these two member states. Additionally, such initiatives may prompt other regional actors, like Cyprus or Egypt, to invest in their own defense capabilities, further militarizing an already volatile area. Although Israeli systems serve as a model, their influence on Greek and Turkish strategies is not absolute. Greece’s collaboration with Israel is part of a broader effort to diversify its alliances, which include closer ties with the United States and the European Union. These relationships play a significant role in shaping its military procurement decisions. Similarly, Türkiye’s 'Steel Dome' reflects a pursuit of technological sovereignty, even if the concept draws from Israel’s success. Furthermore, strained Israeli-Turkish relations have driven Ankara to rely on domestic industries and alternative partners like Russia and China, diluting Israel’s direct impact on its strategic developments. The contrasting approaches of Greece and Türkiye illustrate their enduring rivalry and mutual recognition of the need for advanced air defense systems. Greece’s collaborative efforts with Israel align with its broader strategic partnerships, while Türkiye’s focus on self-reliance underscores its ambition to achieve autonomy. These divergent paths reflect not only political choices but also distinct strategies for addressing contemporary security challenges. Against the backdrop of rising global tensions, these developments highlight how historical rivalries continue to shape military priorities in the region.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-and-tuerkiye-draw-inspiration-from-israels-iron-dome-to-develop-their-own-air-defense-systems	2024-11-26T02:53:37-08:00	
Greece to transfer S-300 and Tor-M1 air defense systems to Armenia instead of Ukraine in strategic shift	According to Enikos.gr on November 25, 2024, Greece is proceeding with the transfer of several Russian-made air defense systems, including the S-300 PMU-1, Tor-M1, and Osa-AK, to Armenia instead of Ukraine as part of its broader strategy to replace aging equipment with Western and Israeli technologies. This decision aligns with the Greek Armed Forces' plan to de-Russify its arsenal and address challenges related to maintaining Russian systems, which have been exacerbated by sanctions on Russia and associated supply chain disruptions.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link As NATO and the EU now prioritize providing Ukraine with Western-standard systems, Greece has therefore opted to redirect its Russian-origin systems to Armenia, where they can be more effectively integrated and maintained. (Picture source: CyprusMail) According to information from the Greek General Staff of National Defense (GEETHA), the transfer of these systems to Armenia is part of a cooperative effort involving France, which will also provide Armenia with additional weapons. This initiative reflects strategic considerations, including Greece’s historical ties with Armenia, shared religious affiliations, and mutual interests in countering Turkish support for Azerbaijan. The proximity of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its implications for regional stability also factored into this decision. The systems being transferred include Greece's S-300 PMU1 system, acquired following the Cyprus Missile Crisis and stationed in Crete. The system comprises one regiment with four systems, eight fire units, 32 launchers, and 175 missiles. The S-300, with a range of 200 kilometers and the ability to track up to 100 targets, was first used operationally in Greece during the 2013 White Eagle exercise, 15 years after its acquisition. Despite prior discussions about sending the S-300 to Ukraine in exchange for a PAC-3 Patriot missile system, concerns over potential gaps in Greek air defense led to the cancellation of those plans. Armenia, which has experience operating Russian-made systems, is considered well-equipped to integrate the S-300 and other transferred systems into its existing defenses. The country’s prior collaboration with Russia included training for the operation of S-300 systems, and Armenian forces have used these systems as part of a joint air defense framework under the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Spare parts and maintenance for these systems, previously sourced from Armenia by Greece, have played a critical role in this transfer decision. To replace the outgoing Russian systems, Greece is investing in new Israeli air defense systems, including David’s Sling, Barak MX, and Spyder. These systems offer coverage ranges from 20 to 300 kilometers and are part of a larger project to establish an 'Iron Dome' over the Aegean islands. This initiative, costing approximately €2 billion, is expected to be operational by the end of 2026, providing a timeline for when the transferred systems might leave Greek service. Armenia, which has experience operating Russian-made systems, is considered well-equipped to integrate the Soviet-era Osa-AK and other transferred air defense systems into its existing defenses. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The cooperation with Armenia extends beyond equipment transfers. The number of Armenian students in Greek military academies has doubled, and joint exercises have become more frequent. A recent exercise, 'Olympic Cooperation 24,' conducted at the Petrohori range in Xanthi, involved live-fire scenarios with Greek tanks, French armored vehicles, and simulated drone operations. Such collaborations are intended to enhance Armenia's military preparedness, particularly in light of Azerbaijan's use of drones in previous conflicts. Greece has experience replacing military assets following international transfers. An earlier initiative involved sending 40 BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine in exchange for 40 German Marder vehicles. While initial plans included 120 replacements, domestic political concerns reduced the scope. Greece is also in advanced negotiations with the United States for the acquisition of 164 Bradley armored vehicles, with a projected cost of €4 million per vehicle after reconstruction. The decision to transfer these systems to Armenia rather than Ukraine reflects changing dynamics in military supply preferences. NATO and the EU now prioritize providing Ukraine with Western-standard systems that align with existing supply chains. Greece has therefore opted to redirect its Russian-origin systems to Armenia, where they can be more effectively integrated and maintained. This transfer is part of Greece's broader effort to modernize its defense capabilities while aligning more closely with NATO and EU standards. The collaboration with France and Armenia aims to strengthen regional partnerships and address shifting security challenges in the Eastern Mediterranean and South Caucasus. By replacing Russian systems with Israeli technology and reinforcing Armenia's defenses, Greece seeks to maintain a strategic balance in a region marked by competing interests and ongoing tensions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/greece-to-transfer-s-300-and-tor-m1-air-defense-systems-to-armenia-instead-of-ukraine-in-strategic-shift	2024-11-26T02:23:56-08:00

Cyprus Presents a Plan in Collaboration with US for NATO Membership	The Republic of Cyprus, under the leadership of President Nikos Christodoulidis, is advancing a plan for gradual integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This initiative, developed both politically and strategically, was recently formalized during a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, as reported by Kathimerini. The Cypriot plan, received positively in Washington, signals a shift in the island's geopolitical positioning and an effort to deepen its engagement within the Euro-Atlantic framework. However, this ambition presents both strategic opportunities and significant political challenges. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link From November 12 to 14, 2024, operational artillery fire on maritime targets was conducted by the artillery units of the Cyprus National Guard at the Kiti firing range (Picture source: Cyprus MoD) The plan outlined by President Christodoulidis focuses on three key priorities: establishing institutionalized relations with NATO, gaining access to U.S. defense equipment, and modernizing Cyprus’ military capabilities to meet NATO standards. Achieving these goals will require substantial political progress, including resolving the longstanding Cyprus issue and improving EU-Turkey relations. These steps are essential to overcoming structural barriers currently hindering Cyprus' path to full NATO membership. Cyprus aims to enhance its security through NATO’s collective defense mechanism under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which ensures mutual defense in the event of an attack. Access to advanced military equipment and training programs would allow Cyprus to upgrade its armed forces and improve interoperability with NATO allies, strengthening its overall defense posture. Regionally, NATO membership would elevate Cyprus’ geopolitical significance in the Eastern Mediterranean, reinforcing its role in regional stability. This integration could also promote broader cooperation with neighboring countries while further embedding Cyprus in Euro-Atlantic institutions. The plan aligns with existing strategic partnerships involving Israel and Greece, supported by the United States, to address multifaceted challenges in the region. Despite its potential benefits, the proposal faces numerous challenges. The unresolved Cyprus conflict, dividing the island between the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus since 1974, poses a major obstacle. Turkey, a key NATO member, has historically blocked Cypriot participation in Euro-Atlantic institutions, and any move toward NATO membership could heighten tensions. Additionally, Cyprus must address internal resistance stemming from its historical policy of neutrality. Since gaining independence in 1960, Cyprus has pursued a non-aligned stance, including participation in the Non-Aligned Movement. Joining NATO would require a significant political shift and consensus within the country, alongside a redefinition of its strategic priorities. The prospect of increased foreign military presence also raises questions about national sovereignty. With two British military bases already operating on the island, further expansion of allied forces could provoke domestic opposition, particularly among segments of the Cypriot population.

These technological advancements, combined with NATO's collective strength, position the Challenger 3 as a critical asset in countering modern armored threats. With its new armament, enhanced survivability, and superior maneuverability, the Challenger 3 MBT positions the U.K.’s armored forces to face the challenges of modern warfare and ensures Britain’s relevance on the battlefield for decades to come.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/new-british-army-challenger-3-tank-surpasses-russias-t-90m-t-80bvm-and-t-72b3-deployed-in-ukraine-war	2024-11-24T10:25:51-08:00	
Analysis: Unspecified 155mm Shells in US Aid Suggest Delivery of ADAM Anti-Personnel Mines to Ukraine	The United States has confirmed the delivery of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine as part of a $275 million military aid package announced on November 20, 2024. While the package did not explicitly mention anti-personnel mines, it included an unspecified quantity of 155mm artillery shells. Based on previous deliveries, this has led to speculation that the package could include Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), a type of 155mm shell designed to scatter anti-personnel mines across targeted areas. ADAMs are used to impede enemy troop movements and bolster defensive capabilities, adding a strategic layer to Ukraine’s resistance against Russian forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link PowerPoint slide showcasing ADAM Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions technology from a US Army ARDEC presentation. (Picture source: US Army RDECOM) The U.S. has also been supplying Ukraine with Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAM) projectiles, the anti-tank counterpart to ADAMs. RAAMs (Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions) are designed to disperse nine anti-tank mines upon firing, which can self-destruct after a set time period, effectively creating temporary minefields to slow or block advancing armored units. Pentagon statistics indicate that, alongside over three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds, more than 70,000 RAAM projectiles have already been sent to Ukraine. The M692 and M731 are two variants of the 155mm Area Denial-Artillery-Munitions (ADAMs), designed to disperse 36 anti-personnel mines over targeted areas. These munitions use a timed release mechanism, ejecting their payload from the rear of the shell mid-flight, enabling precise placement of temporary minefields. The mines are equipped with anti-disturbance triggers, deterring attempts to clear them, and feature a programmed self-destruct mechanism, ensuring they deactivate after a specific period to reduce post-conflict hazards. The key difference between the M692 and M731 lies in their active durations. The M692 is designed for short-term engagements, with mines that deactivate within 4 to 48 hours, making it ideal for rapidly shifting battlefield conditions. The M731, in contrast, deploys mines that remain active for up to 15 days, making it suitable for prolonged defensive operations or to hinder enemy reinforcements over extended periods. Both variants deploy M74 anti-personnel mines, ensuring high effectiveness against enemy infantry while reducing risks to civilians through their self-deactivation feature. Tactically, ADAMs provide commanders with a flexible tool for battlefield control, allowing for the creation of barriers or chokepoints without direct troop involvement. These munitions are effective for delaying enemy advances, securing flanks, or covering retreats. When used alongside anti-tank systems like the Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAMS), ADAMs contribute to a layered defense strategy that targets both infantry and armored units, forcing adversaries into predictable movement patterns that can be exploited by friendly forces. The potential inclusion of ADAMs follows a pattern in U.S. military support for Ukraine. The U.S. has already supplied Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAM) projectiles, the anti-tank counterpart to ADAMs, which disperse anti-tank mines in a similar manner. According to the Pentagon, more than 70,000 RAAM projectiles have been delivered to Ukraine alongside over three million conventional 155mm artillery rounds. The addition of ADAMs would represent a further evolution in Ukraine’s capability to employ artillery-delivered munitions in both defensive and offensive operations. Defense analysts have noted that the unspecified 155mm artillery shells listed in the aid package are consistent with the U.S.'s history of providing advanced munitions tailored to Ukraine’s battlefield needs. The ongoing shift in Russian tactics, including concentrated ground assaults and infantry advances, makes systems like ADAMs highly relevant. These munitions can be deployed to block or channel enemy troops, buying time for Ukrainian forces to regroup or counterattack. While ADAMs provide significant strategic benefits, their use also carries potential humanitarian implications. The U.S. has emphasized that any mines provided to Ukraine are to be used strictly within its territory and away from civilian areas. Additionally, the self-deactivating nature of ADAM mines is intended to mitigate risks to non-combatants, addressing some concerns raised by international human rights organizations. Although not officially confirmed, the possibility of ADAMs being part of the latest aid package underlines the U.S.'s commitment to equipping Ukraine with the tools necessary to defend its sovereignty. As the situation on the ground evolves, the focus remains on leveraging advanced munitions to counter the persistent threat posed by Russian forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/analysis-unspecified-155mm-shells-in-us-aid-suggest-delivery-of-adam-anti-personnel-mines-to-ukraine	2024-11-24T05:11:32-08:00	
France Confirms Full Commitment to Support Ukraine Including Use of SCALP Missiles Against Russia	During an interview with the BBC, the United Kingdom's national broadcaster and one of the world’s most respected news organizations, on November 23, 2024, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot affirmed that France recognizes no 'red lines' when it comes to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. Barrot stressed that Ukraine is within its rights to use French-supplied SCALP long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia as part of its self-defense. However, he refrained from confirming whether these French weapons had already been utilized in such operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A French SCALP long-range cruise missile mounted on a Ukrainian Su-24 strike aircraft symbolizes France's commitment to bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities in its conflict against Russian aggression.(Picture source: Ukraine MoD) The SCALP missile, known internationally as the Storm Shadow, is a highly advanced, long-range cruise missile developed by France and the United Kingdom. It has a range of over 250 kilometers and is equipped with precision-guided technology, allowing it to strike high-value targets with minimal collateral damage. Designed to evade enemy air defense systems, the SCALP missile is an invaluable asset for operations against heavily fortified or remote locations. It is fired from aircraft, and its stealth capabilities enable it to penetrate deep into enemy territory, making it a critical component of Ukraine's ability to disrupt Russian logistics and command centers. Since the beginning of the war in February 2022, Ukraine has received unprecedented military support from Western allies. This assistance has evolved from initial deliveries of small arms, ammunition, and humanitarian aid to the provision of advanced weaponry and training. Key contributions have included U.S.-supplied HIMARS rocket systems, Patriot air-defense batteries, and artillery systems such as the French Caesar howitzers. Tanks, including the German Leopard 2 and British Challenger 2, have bolstered Ukraine's ground forces, while modern drones and counter-drone systems have enhanced its aerial capabilities. Additionally, NATO countries have provided training, logistical support, and intelligence-sharing to strengthen Ukraine’s resistance and its ability to conduct complex operations. Barrot’s comments come in the wake of the first confirmed strikes using U.S. and U.K. SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles on Russian soil, highlighting a turning point in the conflict. His remarks follow similar indications from French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this year, who suggested that French missiles could be used against Russian targets under the logic of self-defense. Barrot’s unequivocal stance now solidifies France’s position, reinforcing the message that arbitrary limitations will not constrain Western support for Ukraine. During his visit to London, where he held talks with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Barrot emphasized the importance of sustained and unrestricted aid for Ukraine. 'Western allies should not set and express red lines,' he declared, underlining the need for unity and determination among NATO members. This rhetoric aligns with France’s broader strategy of ensuring Ukraine has the resources necessary to counter Russian advances, while simultaneously preparing for a potentially prolonged conflict. The dramatic escalation of events on the ground underscores the significance of Barrot’s statement. Recent reports indicate that U.S. and U.K. SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles were used for the first time to target Russian military sites. Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly deployed a new type of missile, and President Vladimir Putin has warned of the risk of global conflict. These developments underscore the high stakes of maintaining robust Western support for Ukraine. France’s contributions are part of a broader NATO effort to sustain Ukraine’s resistance. Western nations are increasingly focused on long-term financial and military aid packages, with one source highlighting the need for a comprehensive 'war chest' to support Ukraine through 2025 and beyond. European countries are also considering intensified measures, such as seizing Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s defense. Additionally, intelligence suggests that Ukraine has been conducting effective drone operations, targeting Russian ammunition depots far behind enemy lines. In mid-September, drones reportedly destroyed four depots stocked with Russian and North Korean-supplied munitions, representing one of the most significant blows to Russia’s logistical network during the war. While it remains unclear whether these drones were provided by the U.K., France, or other allies, the strikes illustrate the growing sophistication of Ukraine’s capabilities, supported by Western technology and expertise. France’s unwavering support since the onset of the war has been instrumental in Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russian aggression. By removing so-called 'red lines' and providing advanced weaponry like the SCALP missile, France demonstrates its commitment to ensuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This approach, echoed by other Western nations, sends a clear message that the alliance is resolute in its determination to counter Russian aggression and support Ukraine for as long as it takes.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/france-confirms-full-commitment-to-support-ukraine-including-use-of-scalp-missiles-against-russia	2024-11-24T04:11:49-08:00

This adaptability and reliability make NASAMS a preferred choice for many NATO and allied nations, including the United States and Norway, which have already delivered systems to Ukraine. The United States has provided two NASAMS batteries to Ukraine since 2022 and continues to commit additional units to bolster Ukraine's air defenses. With Canada now joining these efforts, the arrival of the NASAMS system in Ukraine represents a significant enhancement to its air defense capabilities amid escalating Russian air raids. NASAMS has become a preferred choice among NATO and allied countries for its reliability and effectiveness. The system has already been donated to Ukraine by other nations, including the United States and Norway, with the U.S. leading the effort by providing two NASAMS batteries in 2022 and committing to additional units as part of its military aid packages. Canada’s latest contribution builds on its ongoing support for Ukraine, which includes over 300 air defense missiles from Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) stockpiles, armored vehicles, artillery, drone cameras, and winter gear. These efforts are complemented by Operation UNIFIER, Canada’s training mission for Ukrainian forces, and logistical support from the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in transporting military aid from Canada and allied nations. As Ukraine continues to face intensified air raids from Russia, the NASAMS system is expected to enhance the country’s integrated air defense network significantly. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair emphasized Canada’s unwavering support, stating that Canada stands united with Ukraine in its fight for sovereignty and against Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable aggression. The addition of NASAMS to Ukraine’s arsenal is not only a testament to Canada’s solidarity but also part of a broader international effort to provide Ukraine with cutting-edge military technology to defend its sovereignty and protect its people.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/canada-donated-nasams-air-defense-missile-system-now-operational-in-ukraine	2024-11-23T02:04:27-08:00	
Breaking News: Russia Confirms Use of New Oreshnik Hypersonic Ballistic Missile in Ukraine Conflict	Citing a report by Russian media outlet Sputnik, on November 22, 2024, President Vladimir Putin stated that the new Russian-made Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile system had already been employed to target Ukraine, signaling its transition from development to active deployment. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A depiction of the potential impact of the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile, illustrating its devastating power and precision. Capable of carrying multiple independently targetable warheads, the missile’s Mach 10 speed and advanced technology make it a formidable challenge for modern missile defense systems. (Picture source: Russian Social Network VK) The announcement marks a significant milestone in modern military technology and follows a reported missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro just a day earlier, allegedly involving an RS-26 'Rubezh' ICBM (InterContinental Ballistic Missile). While these claims remain unverified, the unveiling of Oreshnik underscores the central role of advanced missile systems in Russia’s current military doctrine, showcasing its focus on next-generation strategic and tactical weaponry. President Putin emphasized that Oreshnik is a wholly new development, not a modification of existing technology, and represents a culmination of work by Russia’s leading scientists. Capable of reaching speeds of Mach 10—ten times the speed of sound—Oreshnik is claimed to be virtually immune to current missile defense systems. Putin also highlighted its destructive potential, stating that, when used in a massive coordinated attack, its effectiveness rivals that of a strategic nuclear weapon. The system is reportedly capable of carrying multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to strike several distinct targets simultaneously with either conventional or nuclear warheads. A hypersonic ballistic missile like Oreshnik combines elements of both ballistic and hypersonic flight. Traditional ballistic missiles follow a high-arc trajectory and rely on sheer speed and altitude to evade interception. Hypersonic missiles, on the other hand, travel at sustained speeds exceeding Mach 5 and often employ advanced maneuvering capabilities to outpace and evade defense systems. Oreshnik appears to merge these features, achieving hypersonic speeds while maintaining ballistic properties, making it an especially challenging weapon for existing missile defenses to counter. The inclusion of MIRV technology further enhances the system's threat profile. MIRVs allow a single missile to carry multiple warheads, each capable of independent targeting upon re-entry into the atmosphere. This capability not only increases the efficiency of a single missile launch but also complicates interception efforts. A missile equipped with MIRVs can overwhelm missile defense systems by presenting multiple incoming warheads, effectively saturating defensive capabilities. With a reported range of approximately 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), Oreshnik is designed for versatility, suitable for both regional and long-range missions. Russian military sources have confirmed that it can deliver six to eight warheads per missile, underscoring its strategic value. According to Anatoly Matviychuk, a Russian military expert, the missile is likely already in service, given the scale of Russia's missile stockpiles and the decision to move forward with mass production. Putin also revealed that additional systems of similar design are currently being developed, with several prototypes being tested. These new systems aim to expand Russia's hypersonic missile arsenal, including medium- and shorter-range platforms, ensuring the country maintains its edge in this rapidly evolving domain of military technology. The Oreshnik system’s announcement comes amid reports of an intensifying conflict in Eastern Europe, with missile technology playing a growing role. The alleged strike on Dnipro by the RS-26 'Rubezh' raises concerns about deploying such advanced systems in active conflict zones. If confirmed, the use of these weapons would mark a significant escalation, emphasizing the need for renewed international dialogue on arms control. The global implications of the Oreshnik missile are profound. Its claimed ability to evade interception while delivering devastating payloads poses a challenge to nations reliant on advanced missile defense systems. The inclusion of MIRVs adds an additional layer of complexity, making it a key component in Russia’s strategic deterrence arsenal. As tensions continue to rise, the deployment of hypersonic weapons like Oreshnik underscores the urgent need for international efforts to address the emerging challenges of hypersonic and MIRV-equipped ballistic technologies.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/breaking-news-russia-confirms-use-of-oreshnik-hypersonic-ballistic-missile-in-ukraine-conflict	2024-11-22T10:11:30-08:00

US Navy seeks industry input for development of Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile SLCM-N	According to information published by the US government on November 15, 2024, the US Navy has issued a Request for Information (RFI) for the development of a Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N). The program is designed to create a modular and survivable cruise missile system that provides a proportional response and ensures critical adversary targets remain at risk. This initiative aims to field an operational system by FY 2034, with prototype demonstrations expected within the next three years.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy advances its nuclear deterrence strategy with the development of the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile (SLCM-N), aiming for rapid prototyping and operational deployment by FY 2034. (Picture source: Generated by AI) The SLCM-N will be deployed aboard Virginia-class attack submarines and built around an 'All Up Round' (AUR) concept. This encompasses an expendable booster, a nuclear-capable cruise missile, and a launch canister, enabling underwater launches from Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) or Virginia Payload Modules (VPM). The Navy’s approach emphasizes leveraging mature technologies and a modular open systems design to reduce development timelines and control costs while maintaining the flexibility for future upgrades. The United States first introduced nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles in the mid-1980s with the deployment of the TLAM-N, a nuclear variant of the Tomahawk Land-Attack Missile. These missiles were stationed on both surface ships and attack submarines, offering a range of approximately 2,500 kilometers (about 1,550 miles). In 1991, President George H.W. Bush announced the withdrawal of all sea-based tactical nuclear weapons, leading to the removal of TLAM-N missiles by mid-1992. The Navy retained the option to redeploy them on attack submarines if necessary. However, in 2010, the Obama Administration recommended retiring the TLAM-N system, deeming it redundant given other available nuclear capabilities. The retirement was completed in 2013. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) under the Trump Administration proposed developing a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, now known as SLCM-N. This initiative aimed to provide a 'non-strategic regional presence' and address the need for 'flexible and low-yield options' in the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The SLCM-N was intended to strengthen deterrence against regional adversaries and reassure U.S. allies. In its Fiscal Year 2022 budget request, the Biden Administration allocated funds for research and development of the SLCM-N. However, the 2022 NPR recommended canceling the program, suggesting that existing capabilities were sufficient to meet deterrence requirements. Despite this, Congress continued to provide funding for the SLCM-N and its warhead. The Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated the executive branch to ensure the initial operational capability of the SLCM-N. Subsequently, the Administration has taken steps to implement the program. Proponents of the SLCM-N argue that it offers a flexible and survivable nuclear option, capable of being deployed in various regions without the need for forward-basing nuclear assets on allied territories.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/us-navy-seeks-industry-input-for-development-of-nuclear-armed-sea-launched-cruise-missile-slcm-n	2024-11-22T05:46:13-08:00

French Navy's Jacques Chevallier Replenishment Ship Officially Enters Active Service	According to information published by the French MoD on November 21, 2024, Admiral Nicolas Vaujour, Chief of Staff of the French Navy, officially declared the Force Replenishment Ship (BRF) Jacques Chevallier operational. Based in Toulon, the vessel is now fully ready for deployment at the order of the Chief of Defense Staff.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The BRF Jacques Chevallier is now in active service, contributing to the French Navy's operational support and readiness. (Picture source: French MoD) The Jacques Chevallier is the first in a series of four BRFs designed to modernize and enhance the French Navy's logistical capabilities. It will be joined by its sister ship, the Jacques Stosskopf, in 2026, which was launched in August 2024, followed by two additional vessels in 2028 and 2033. These ships will progressively replace the older Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR). The BRFs are central to the extensive capacity renewal efforts outlined in France's previous Military Programming Law (LPM) and further reinforced under the 2024–2030 LPM. As part of the FlotLog program, these ships ensure the fleet's operational readiness and endurance during long-term deployments. They play a critical role in supporting the fleet’s operational effectiveness by delivering essential supplies, including fuel, munitions, provisions, and technical support. These capabilities enable the BRFs to sustain the carrier strike group centered around the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle or other units involved in strategic deterrence missions. Since its delivery by the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA) on July 18, 2023, the Jacques Chevallier has demonstrated exceptional performance in diverse environments. It has spent 193 days away from its home port, including 153 days at sea, taking part in inter-service training and high-intensity exercises with allied navies. A highlight of its early operations was its participation in the AKILA mission, integrated into the carrier strike group during Mediterranean deployments. The ship has proven its operational flexibility, successfully performing complex resupply missions. Notably, on June 24, 2024, it conducted a sophisticated ammunition replenishment maneuver in coordination with a Multi-Mission Frigate (FREMM). Replenishment ships are the backbone of any blue-water navy, enabling sustained operations far from home ports. They provide essential support in terms of fuel, munitions, spare parts, and provisions, ensuring that frontline combat units, such as aircraft carriers, frigates, and submarines, can remain at sea for extended periods. For the French Navy, which aspires to maintain its position as a global maritime power, replenishment ships are critical. The Navy's capacity to deploy its carrier strike group, centered on the Charles de Gaulle, hinges on a robust and reliable logistical support system. These ships are equally vital for France’s strategic deterrence, as they support submarines and surface ships involved in the country’s nuclear deterrence missions. However, for years, France's fleet of replenishment ships has been insufficient, outdated, and overstretched, limiting the Navy's ability to operate effectively in multiple theaters simultaneously. France's existing Command and Replenishment Ships (BCR), introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, have struggled to meet the demands of a modern blue-water navy. The Somme, Marne, and Var—the three remaining BCRs—are nearing the end of their operational lives. These ships lack the fuel and cargo capacity to support modern naval operations, particularly for high-intensity deployments involving the carrier strike group or multinational coalitions. The limited number of replenishment ships has forced the Navy to prioritize missions, often at the expense of flexibility. The BCRs have been tasked with supporting operations in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and occasionally the Indo-Pacific, stretching their capabilities and availability. This overstretch has led to increased maintenance needs and reduced readiness. The French Navy has faced significant delays in renewing its replenishment fleet. While the need for modern replenishment ships was identified over a decade ago, financial constraints and shifting defense priorities delayed the launch of the FlotLog program.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/french-navys-jacques-chevallier-replenishment-ship-officially-enters-active-service	2024-11-22T04:42:18-08:00

The E-130J, previously referred to as the E-XX, is poised to replace the venerable E-6B Mercury, becoming the backbone of the Navy’s Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) mission.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Lockheed Martin unveils the first C-130J-30 Super Hercules for the U.S. Navy's E-130J program, set to redefine strategic airborne communications for the TACAMO mission. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program is a transformative step in modernizing its airborne strategic communications, replacing the aging fleet of E-6B Mercury aircraft. The E-6B, built on the Boeing 707 airframe, has been a cornerstone of the Navy's 'Take Charge and Move Out' (TACAMO) mission since the 1980s. This mission ensures resilient and secure communication links between national command authorities and strategic ballistic missile submarines. However, with the closure of the Boeing 707 production line and increasing maintenance costs, the Navy has faced growing challenges in sustaining the E-6B fleet. The E-130J program addresses these issues by leveraging the modern and reliable Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Super Hercules as its foundation. This airframe was selected after rigorous evaluations under the Navy’s E-XX program, with the decision driven by the C-130J’s proven operational history, manufacturing sustainability, and ability to meet the demanding TACAMO mission requirements. The C-130J’s enhanced payload capacity, extended range, and advanced avionics systems make it an ideal platform for long-duration, mission-critical operations. In October 2024, the U.S. Navy officially designated this new platform as the E-130J. Lockheed Martin began assembling the first E-130J aircraft at its Marietta, Georgia facility shortly thereafter. The program's timeline aims for initial delivery by 2026, with additional units to follow in subsequent years. The Navy plans to procure between eight and twelve E-130J aircraft to fully replace the E-6B fleet, ensuring continuity of operations and enhanced performance. The U.S. Navy’s E-130J program, built on the C-130J-30 Super Hercules airframe, aligns with a global trend among nations to enhance strategic airborne command and control platforms, particularly for missions critical to national defense and continuity of government operations. While the United States is transitioning to this medium-sized, highly adaptable platform, other countries have opted for varying strategies based on their unique requirements, technological bases, and military doctrines. Russia’s primary airborne command and control aircraft are the Ilyushin Il-80 (NATO reporting name: Maxdome) and its smaller counterpart, the Il-82. These aircraft function as 'doomsday planes,' ensuring continuity of operations during nuclear or large-scale conflicts. Based on the Il-86 passenger aircraft platform, the Il-80 is heavily modified with advanced Very Low Frequency (VLF) communication systems to maintain secure communication with Russia’s nuclear forces, similar to the TACAMO role of the U.S. E-130J. The Il-80 is equipped with nuclear blast-resistant shielding, no external windows (other than the cockpit), and advanced onboard command systems capable of coordinating military forces in a crisis. Its larger size compared to the C-130J-30 offers greater payload capacity for extensive onboard communication suites and command equipment. However, this bulkier design limits operational versatility and requires substantial runway infrastructure, in contrast to the E-130J’s ability to operate from shorter, less-developed airstrips. China has adopted its domestically produced Y-20 Kunpeng strategic transport aircraft as the basis for a new generation of airborne command and control platforms. These modified Y-20s focus on integrating advanced communication systems that enable strategic coordination between the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) branches, particularly in operations requiring nuclear deterrence or rapid-response military mobilization. The Y-20 platform provides China with a dual-use capability, functioning both as a strategic transport and as an airborne command post. While the Y-20’s larger payload capacity and longer range provide advantages for hosting extensive command systems, its size may limit deployment flexibility, especially in contested regions where runway availability is constrained. India’s Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&amp;CS), primarily based on the Embraer ERJ 145 platform, represents a different approach. While primarily designed for surveillance and reconnaissance, these aircraft are also equipped with command and control capabilities, allowing them to serve dual purposes in strategic missions. India has also developed the DRDO AEW&amp;CS, an indigenous system designed to complement its Embraer-based fleet, with expanded roles for strategic communication. The AEW&amp;CS platforms offer cost-effective solutions compared to the larger aircraft used by the U.S., Russia, or China, but their smaller size and limited range reduce their utility for extended strategic missions such as TACAMO.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/lockheed-martin-prepares-1st-c-130j-30-super-hercules-aircraft-for-us-navy-strategic-mission	2024-11-22T01:32:33-08:00

Houthis Target Turkish-Owned Ship Allegedly Tied to Israel Trade	According to information published by Tasnim on November 19, 2024, the Anadolu S, managed by Istanbul-based Oras Shipping, avoided damage from two missile strikes while navigating near Yemen’s Mocha port and later southeast of Aden.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Anadolu S sails through the tense waters of the Red Sea, narrowly avoiding missile strikes amidst escalating geopolitical tensions fueled by allegations of trade with Israel.. (Picture source: Generated by AI) Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack, accusing the vessel’s owners of breaching their declared trade ban with Israel. This incident forms part of a broader Houthi initiative targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, launched after the group imposed a blockade on companies trading with Israel in May 2024. The Anadolu S is operated by Oras Shipping, a company owned by Salih Zeki Çakır, a close associate of Yıldırım and an influential figure in Turkish shipping. Çakır’s ventures, reportedly linked to trade with Israel, have drawn scrutiny amid public anti-Israel rhetoric from Turkey’s government. Türkiye-Israel relations Turkey and Israel have shared a complex and fluctuating relationship since Turkey became the first Muslim-majority nation to recognize Israel in 1949. Over the decades, their interactions have oscillated between cooperation and tension, deeply influenced by regional conflicts and domestic political dynamics. In the latter half of the 20th century, Turkey and Israel developed significant military and economic ties. Israel provided substantial military assistance to Turkey, including the modernization of Turkish F-4 Phantom and Northrop F-5 aircraft and the upgrade of Turkey’s main battle tank, the Israeli-made Sabra. Naval and aerial cooperation also strengthened bilateral ties, with mutual training and operational coordination in shared exercises. The relationship began to strain in the late 2000s, particularly after the 2008–09 Gaza War. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan openly criticized Israel's actions in Gaza, leading to increased tension. Relations hit a low point after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, which resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. The incident prompted Turkey to downgrade diplomatic ties and suspend military cooperation with Israel. Efforts to mend relations began in 2013, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for the flotilla incident, paving the way for reconciliation. By 2022, diplomatic ties were fully restored with the reappointment of ambassadors, marking a renewed focus on regional stability and economic collaboration. However, recent conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon have reignited tensions. Turkish President Erdoğan has sharply criticized Israel’s military actions. This has led to a series of measures from Turkey, including the suspension of trade relations in mid-2024 and the denial of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane access to Turkish airspace during a diplomatic trip. Most significantly, in November 2024, President Erdoğan announced that Turkey had severed all relations with Israel, signaling a potential long-term rupture in their diplomatic and economic engagement.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/houthis-target-turkish-owned-ship-allegedly-tied-to-israel-trade	2024-11-21T07:53:32-08:00

US Admiral Raises Doubts Over North Korea’s Nuclear Strike Capabilities	On November 19, 2024, Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, stated that North Korea’s numerous tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) have yet to demonstrate the capability to successfully deliver a nuclear warhead to the U.S. mainland. He made this observation during an appearance at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This photo, taken on November 18, 2022, shows North Korea's new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the 'Hwasong Gun 17,' before its launch at Pyongyang International Airport (Picture source: KCNA) North Korea recently conducted a test flight of its Hwasong-19 missile, the largest ICBM developed by the regime to date. According to Admiral Paparo, the test indicated the missile’s ability to reach the entire continental United States. However, when questioned about North Korea's capability to pair a nuclear warhead with an ICBM capable of enduring the stresses of launch, flight, and atmospheric reentry, Paparo clarified that such a capability has not yet been observed. He added that continued testing is evident in efforts to achieve this goal. Under Kim Jong Un’s leadership, North Korea has accelerated its missile and nuclear weapons development programs while adopting increasingly hostile rhetoric toward South Korea. Simultaneously, the regime has emerged as a strategic ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. Following the latest missile test, the state-run Korean Central News Agency described the Hwasong-19 as the 'ultimate version' of an ICBM intended for deployment by North Korea’s strategic forces. Admiral Paparo’s remarks align with earlier assessments by U.S. officials, offering a cautious view of the threat posed by Pyongyang’s missile advancements. In 2022, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan highlighted uncertainties regarding North Korea’s ability to successfully pair a nuclear warhead with an ICBM, fire it, and strike a precise target in the United States. Nonetheless, such uncertainties do not negate the broader threats posed by North Korea to U.S. interests. Over decades, Pyongyang has amassed an extensive arsenal of millions of artillery shells and thousands of rockets positioned north of the border with South Korea, where nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed. Furthermore, North Korea has demonstrated its ability to launch missiles over Japan, a key U.S. ally in the region. Kim Jong Un continues to pledge enhancements to North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, citing the need to counter threats posed by the security alliance among the United States and its regional allies. This week, North Korean state media reported Kim’s accusations against the U.S., Japan, and South Korea for destabilizing the Korean Peninsula and the broader region. Kim referred to the alliance as an 'Asian version of NATO' and asserted that these nations would bear responsibility for undermining peace and stability. North Korea has made significant strides in ICBM development. In July 2017, it conducted its first test of the Hwasong-14, followed in November 2017 by the Hwasong-15. These missiles, with estimated ranges of approximately 10,400 km and 8,500–13,000 km respectively, place the entire U.S. mainland within potential reach. In October 2024, Pyongyang tested the Hwasong-19, its largest ICBM to date. The missile reached a record altitude of 7,000 km and flew for 87 minutes, demonstrating a range sufficient to cover the U.S. mainland. However, analysts have raised concerns about the practicality of this missile in a conflict scenario due to its significant size, which could limit its mobility and make it more vulnerable to preemptive strikes. Despite these advancements, questions persist about North Korea’s ability to effectively integrate a nuclear warhead with an ICBM capable of withstanding the rigorous conditions of launch, flight, and atmospheric reentry. While progress is evident, U.S. officials have noted that a full demonstration of this capability has yet to occur.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/us-admiral-raises-doubts-over-north-koreas-nuclear-strike-capabilities	2024-11-21T05:38:54-08:00

Exclusive: French Army Tests British Jetpack Flying Soldier Concept Following Trials by British Special Forces	During the National Infantry Days in Canjuers, Var, the French Army unveiled a new experiment highlighting its interest in cutting-edge technology: the 'flying soldier' concept. This initiative, part of an ongoing effort to enhance the operational capabilities of troops, underscores the importance of new mobility solutions on the battlefield. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Army unveiled a new experiment highlighting its interest in cutting-edge technology. (Picture source: French MoD) The project is not entirely new. In 2019, the Flyboard Air had already garnered attention. Its military potential led the Defense Innovation Agency (AID) to grant a subsidy of €1.3 million to adapt this device to operational constraints. Concurrently, the French Aerospace Lab (ONERA) was involved in its development. Equipped with six engines, four of which deliver 250 horsepower each, the Flyboard Air can reach an altitude of 10,000 feet, thanks to advanced algorithms. In 2021, Florence Parly, then Minister of the Armed Forces, announced that the special forces would experiment with a flying platform derived from this system. The Special Operations Command (COS) viewed this device as an opportunity for infiltration and exfiltration missions. However, enthusiasm for the project waned after an accident during a demonstration over Lake Biscarrosse in 2022. In 2019, the British Royal Marines tested a jetpack developed by Gravity Industries, introducing a new approach to maritime boarding operations. This system is based on an exoskeleton equipped with five micro-gas turbines—two mounted on each arm and one on the back—generating a total thrust of 144 kilograms and combined power exceeding 1,000 horsepower. This configuration enables flight speeds of over 80 km/h and a maximum altitude of 3,000 meters, although operational flights are usually conducted at lower altitudes for safety and efficiency. The Gravity Industries jetpack was designed to provide rapid and flexible mobility, particularly in maritime environments where boarding moving ships poses significant challenges. During tests, an operator launched from a fast boat flew over the sea, and landed on a target ship’s deck within seconds, showcasing the system's ability to reduce infiltration time and minimize exposure to threats. However, integrating this technology into the armed forces raises questions about ergonomics and combat operability. The jetpack, weighing approximately 27 kilograms without fuel, can limit a soldier's range of motion and complicate the use of standard weaponry. Additionally, the limited flight duration—typically between three and four minutes depending on conditions and payload—requires precise mission planning to avoid situations where the operator could run out of fuel in hostile areas. Despite these challenges, the Royal Marines' tests demonstrated the jetpack’s potential for specific operations requiring speed and surprise. Observing these developments, the French Army is evaluating the adaptation of such technologies to meet its own operational needs, while considering the ergonomic and tactical constraints inherent in their use on the ground. The French Army justified these tests by emphasizing the importance of identifying real needs and determining how to leverage these technologies to enhance combat effectiveness. Light brigade regiments, in particular, seek to bolster their mobility and offensive capabilities, especially in challenging environments such as mountainous and airborne zones. The French Army Chief of Staff, General Pierre Schill, highlighted the key issue of these innovations: their utility for field units and their scalability across the entire army. While some solutions may be suitable for special forces, adopting them on a broader scale remains a significant challenge.The integration of a jetpack into the French infantry enhances operational capabilities by providing unparalleled mobility and flexibility on the battlefield. This technology would enable rapid deployment across challenging terrains such as mountains or urban environments, bypassing natural and man-made obstacles with ease. In high-stakes missions, jetpacks could facilitate swift infiltration and exfiltration, reducing the time soldiers spend exposed to enemy fire. While challenges remain regarding endurance and weapon operability, the potential for these devices to augment the speed, agility, and tactical options of French infantry units underscores their strategic value in modern warfare. This experimentation reflects the French Army’s commitment to innovation in addressing the challenges of modern conflicts. Despite existing technical and operational obstacles, the 'flying soldier' concept demonstrates a forward-looking vision, where technology and operational performance converge to strengthen the capabilities of the French armed forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/french-army-follows-british-royal-marines-in-testing-jetpack-and-flying-soldier-concept	2024-11-21T01:30:43-08:00

China reinforces artillery capabilities with new Dongfeng EQ2050 rocket launcher variant	As reported by the Telegram account China Army on November 19, 2024, Dongfeng EQ2050 armored vehicles in service with the PLA Western Command have been observed equipped with a rotating 16-barrel rocket launcher. Recent reports suggest that China is testing the integration of various combat modules and rocket launcher systems on existing vehicles. This operational approach emphasizes mobility and maneuverability, enabling rapid deployment: vehicles arrive, fire, and promptly vacate the position.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link This new MLRS could enable the remote deployment of smoke munitions to obscure troop movements or provide cover during air raids, as well as launching incendiary munitions to target personnel or equipment. (Picture source: Telegram/China Army) This multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) appears related to an earlier version observed in 2020. During a live-fire artillery exercise conducted by the 77th Group Army at an altitude of 4,500 meters, a 16-tube rocket launcher was mounted on a Mengshi chassis. The launcher was identified as part of the chemical defense units. The Mengshi chassis, introduced in 2008, has a top speed of 130 kilometers per hour, a range exceeding 600 kilometers, and the ability to climb 60% grades. While widely used across the PLA, it is being phased out in some roles due to relatively weak armor. The launcher platform includes a stabilizing jack at the rear to ensure firing stability. The 16-tube rocket launcher consists of two rows of fixed directional tubes mounted on a turntable with electric elevation and steering mechanisms. It supports both manual and remote aiming, as evidenced by videos showing soldiers using a manual sight and an LCD screen for targeting. The platform utilizes the Dongfeng Mengshi chassis and is primarily linked to chemical defense operations, deploying explosive, incendiary, and smoke munitions. The system's design is based on the FHJ01 62mm individual rocket launcher, first developed in 1983 and introduced into service in 1985. The FHJ01 features a double-tube design and is equipped with optical sights for engaging targets within 500 meters. It can fire three types of rockets: the FYD02 smoke bomb, the FRS02 incendiary bomb, and the 84-type incendiary bomb. The FYD02 creates a 25-meter-wide smoke screen lasting over 30 seconds, interfering with infrared targeting and causing physical irritation. The FRS02 contains a flammable agent with a burn radius exceeding 8 meters, while the 84-type delivers phosphorus-based effects over an 80-square-meter area. These rockets share similar structures, including safety fuses and folding tail fins. The Mengshi-based launcher extends the range and accuracy of these munitions beyond the original FHJ01’s 800-meter range. Modifications include lengthened directional tubes and enhanced rocket engines, improving precision. A 2012 military newspaper article highlighted tests of vehicle-mounted chemical defense rockets, which aimed to improve mobility and response times. The platform was designed to integrate legacy handheld rockets into a vehicle-mounted system. Advancements have also been made in ammunition technology. Researchers developed a combustion agent to address incomplete fuel combustion at low temperatures and introduced an electronic time fuze. This fuze calculates detonation timing automatically, enhancing accuracy and operational flexibility. Operational footage shows the rocket launcher being deployed during exercises, including those conducted by the Tibet Military Region. One video revealed a technical issue where a roof hatch was not properly secured during firing, resulting in misalignment. However, the rockets’ safety mechanisms prevented further complications. The platform enables the remote deployment of smoke munitions to obscure troop movements or provide cover during air raids. It can also launch incendiary munitions to target personnel or equipment. However, the system’s range and rocket caliber remain limited. Adjustments to these parameters could enhance its utility in future operations.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/china-reinforces-artillery-capabilities-with-new-dongfeng-eq2050-rocket-launcher-variant	2024-11-20T07:10:22-08:00

Analysis | Did China copy the US SR-71 Blackbird with the new Yunxing supersonic aircraft?	As reported by the South China Morning Post on October 28, 2024, a Chinese aerospace company, Space Transportation, has reported progress in developing its supersonic passenger aircraft, the Yunxing. The aircraft is designed to transport passengers from Beijing to New York in two hours, cruising at speeds of Mach 4—double the speed of the Concorde, which retired in 2003. However, the Yunxing's design bears a striking resemblance to the SR-71 Blackbird, the renowned American reconnaissance aircraft retired in 1998, raising questions about its intended use and suitability for commercial operations, even for sub-orbital spaceflight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Like the SR-71 Blackbird, the Yunxing's structure is composed of lightweight, high-strength composite materials, designed to withstand extreme conditions, such as aerodynamic heating that can raise surface temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. (Picture source: Lingkong Tianxing Technology) The Yunxing's structure is composed of lightweight, high-strength composite materials, designed to withstand extreme conditions, such as aerodynamic heating that can raise surface temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius. Its high lift-to-drag ratio is intended to ensure efficient performance even at high altitudes, contributing to its commercial and operational potential. Unlike traditional horizontal takeoff and landing aircraft, the Yunxing employs vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. This feature, combined with its ability to ascend to altitudes exceeding 20,000 meters, enables it to bypass traditional runway constraints and potentially operate from smaller, urban airport facilities. The company has depicted this process through animations showing the aircraft being launched by booster rockets, gliding at high speeds, and decelerating through a combination of subsonic flight and liquid rocket engines before landing vertically. Founded in 2018, Space Transportation, also known as Lingkong Tianxing Technology, operates from multiple locations across China, including Beijing, Xi'an, and Anhui, with a testing facility in Xinjiang. The company collaborates with universities and research institutions and has contributed to projects like the 'Feitian-1' hypersonic vehicle in 2022. While primarily focused on supersonic passenger aircraft, Space Transportation is also developing suborbital space tourism platforms and hypersonic vehicles for military and research purposes. Analysts speculate that its passenger-oriented projects might serve as a cover for potential military applications, such as high-altitude reconnaissance platforms or vehicles for anti-satellite weaponry. These theories are supported by the advanced aerospace technologies integrated into the project, combining aerodynamic efficiency, thermal protection, and precise control systems. Until now, there was no publicly available information indicating that China has developed or is developing a direct replica of the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft known for its high-speed and high-altitude capabilities. However, China has been advancing its own high-speed reconnaissance and surveillance technologies. The People's Liberation Army Air Force has introduced the WZ-8, an unmanned aerial vehicle capable of high-altitude, high-speed reconnaissance missions. Launched from an H-6 bomber, the WZ-8 is reported to achieve speeds exceeding Mach 3, comparable to the SR-71's performance. China has also been investing in hypersonic technology, involving speeds greater than the speed of sound, another point of convergence with the development of the SR-71 Blackbird. The development of hypersonic glide vehicles and missiles suggests a focus on advancing capabilities in high-speed flight, potentially applicable to future reconnaissance platforms. Notable developments include the DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, capable of speeds between Mach 5 and Mach 10, and performing evasive maneuvers during flight. The DF-ZF likely became operational around October 2019. In November 2024, during the China Airshow in Zhuhai, China unveiled the GDF-600 hypersonic glide vehicle, developed by the Guangdong Aerodynamic Research Academy. The GDF-600 can reach speeds up to Mach 7 and is designed to carry various payloads, including submunitions, drones, and unmanned aerial systems. The Yunxing's sleek design, with its pointed nose and twin-engine configuration, evokes a close resemblance to the SR-71's streamlined structure, optimized for high-speed performance and minimal radar signature. (Picture source: Lingkong Tianxing Technology) Additionally, China has been enhancing its anti-satellite capabilities through the use of kinetic kill vehicles (KKVs), which are designed to destroy targets through direct collision, relying on kinetic energy rather than explosive warheads. In 2007, China conducted an anti-satellite test by launching a ballistic missile carrying a kinetic kill vehicle that destroyed the defunct Fengyun-1C weather satellite at an altitude of 865 kilometers. This demonstrated China's capability to eliminate satellites in low Earth orbit using kinetic energy. China has also developed the HQ-19 anti-ballistic missile interceptor, equipped with a dual-purpose exoatmospheric kinetic kill vehicle warhead, designed to engage both ballistic missile warheads and satellites. There is therefore nothing to stop China from developing a new, more discreet and faster means of launching a KKV in the event of war, which could further enhance the strategic value of the Yunxing. In the United States, Lockheed Martin continues to work on the SR-72, the anticipated hypersonic successor to the SR-71 Blackbird. On July 29, 2024, reports indicated that Lockheed Martin’s classified program, likely related to the SR-72 hypersonic aircraft, encountered a budget overrun of $45 million in the second quarter of 2024. Total losses associated with this unnamed classified program have now reached approximately $335 million since 2022, reflecting financial challenges during the project's development. These budget overruns suggest that Lockheed Martin is making substantial investments in the SR-72 project, potentially advancing it toward operational status. The company has acknowledged uncertainties involved in such programs, emphasizing variability in cost and time estimates, along with technical challenges typical of advanced aerospace projects. Evidence of the SR-72's progression includes the expansion of Lockheed’s Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California, where advanced manufacturing techniques like 3D printing of composite structures are employed. The workforce at Lockheed’s Palmdale facility has expanded significantly, with over 5,500 employees reported as of September 2023, more than doubling since 2018. The SR-72 is expected to be powered by a turbine-based combined cycle engine, integrating a traditional turbine engine with a scramjet. This configuration allows it to transition from subsonic to hypersonic speeds, potentially reaching Mach 6—twice the speed of the SR-71. Designed to serve as both an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance asset and a strike platform, the SR-72 could provide the U.S. military with enhanced capabilities in both reconnaissance and strike operations, with an expected service entry by 2030. The officially-civilian Lockheed Martin’s X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology experimental aircraft has also reached a development milestone with its first engine run at the Skunk Works facility. Announced by NASA on November 6, 2024, the X-59 aims to reduce the noise impact of supersonic flight over land, potentially informing future regulations for commercial supersonic travel. The aircraft is designed to produce a quieter sonic effect, described as a 'thump,' even at supersonic speeds. Testing of the X-59 may provide data and engineering insights relevant to the SR-72's development, particularly in areas like high-speed aerodynamics, structural integrity at high speeds, and managing thermal and acoustic effects associated with hypersonic flight. The SR-71 Blackbird was developed as a black project by Lockheed's Skunk Works division in the 1960s, based on the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft.

By October 2024, the Italian detachment had logged over 500 flight hours and conducted 20 Alpha Scrambles (alert launches under QRA missions), underscoring its significant contribution to NATO airspace security in the Baltic region. The successful air-to-ground exercises carried out by Italian Eurofighters as part of the Baltic Air Policing mission underline NATO’s increasing focus on strengthening integrated force capabilities. These exercises not only improve tactical interoperability with allies but also demonstrate the Italian Typhoon’s ability to meet a wide range of operational requirements. As the mission progresses, the Aeronautica Militare continues to play a key role in securing NATO airspace and contributing to collective defense in Eastern Europe. This milestone reinforces Italy's commitment to NATO and its operational readiness to face emerging security challenges. The Eurofighter Typhoon originated in the 1980s, a period when European air forces faced the need to modernize their aging fleets of fighter aircraft. At the time, operational aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, F-104 Starfighter, Mirage III, and Tornado F3 ADV were becoming obsolete and unable to meet the demands of modern conflicts. Designed during the Cold War, these aircraft could no longer guarantee air superiority or perform multi-role missions effectively. To address this need, five European nations—Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and France—launched a joint program in 1983, called the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). The goal was to develop an advanced fighter capable of bolstering collective defense capabilities while sharing costs and fostering industrial cooperation across Europe. However, disagreements soon emerged among the partners. France, in particular, sought an aircraft tailored to its specific national needs, including naval missions. In 1985, France withdrew from the project to develop the Dassault Rafale, while the other four nations continued with the design of the aircraft based on common specifications. The development of the Eurofighter Typhoon was structured around specific needs for each nation. Germany aimed to replace its F-4 Phantom II, the United Kingdom intended to retire its Tornado F3 ADV, and Italy and Spain sought to modernize their fleets of F-104 Starfighters and Mirage III. After a decade of negotiations and technical work, the four countries signed a production contract in 1998 for an initial total of 620 aircraft, proportionally distributed. The aircraft's manufacturing was entrusted to a consortium of industries, including BAE Systems, Airbus, and Leonardo, ensuring an equitable distribution of tasks among the partners. Deliveries of the Eurofighter Typhoon began in 2003. This advanced aircraft quickly became a cornerstone of European air forces, undertaking missions in air defense, deterrence, and allied support. Today, it stands as a testament to successful European technological collaboration despite the challenges encountered during its development.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/italian-typhoons-conduct-first-air-to-ground-training-in-lithuania-as-part-of-baltic-air-policing	2024-11-20T06:30:28-08:00

Before docking, HMS Queen Elizabeth collaborated with the German Navy and Army helicopters, including NH90 and Navy Lynx Mk88, conducting deck landing operations on the carrier’s vast flight deck. Comments During a hypothetical conflict with Russia, the carrier's primary purpose would be to project power, provide air superiority, and secure critical sea lanes vital for sustaining NATO's logistical and operational frameworks. Its F-35B Lightning II aircraft could conduct precision strikes on Russian military targets, perform reconnaissance, and provide close air support to NATO ground forces in Germany and Eastern Europe. Positioning the carrier in the North Sea would offer a safer operational environment, allowing it to launch sustained air operations while remaining outside the immediate range of Russia's A2/AD capabilities, such as Kaliningrad's S-400 systems and Iskander missiles. However, deploying it into the Baltic Sea would provide more direct support to Germany and frontline NATO states, though at the cost of heightened exposure to Russian missile and naval threats. As part of a carrier strike group, the HMS Queen Elizabeth would enhance NATO’s maritime dominance, leveraging its escorts—destroyers, frigates, and submarines—to counter Russian naval movements and secure strategic maritime corridors. However, this deployment would not be without risks. The carrier’s proximity to Russian territory could make it a high-value target for missile strikes and hybrid warfare tactics, such as cyberattacks aimed at disrupting its operations. Extended missions would also strain logistical networks, requiring access to well-secured ports in northern Germany or allied states for resupply and maintenance.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/uk-germany-military-ties-deepened-as-aircraft-carrier-hms-queen-elizabeth-visits-hamburg	2024-11-20T04:14:49-08:00

Additionally, this purchase does not include industrial, economic, or technological compensation (offset) clauses, unlike previous Brazilian military acquisitions such as the F-39 Gripen fighter and H-36 Caracal helicopter projects. Maintenance capabilities for Sikorsky helicopters in Brazil have been a longstanding issue. The manufacturer does not operate a dedicated maintenance center in the country, instead relying on logistics support contracts and authorized workshops. This differs from competitors like Airbus and Leonardo, which have more comprehensive local support facilities. The acquisition follows a history of Black Hawk operations in Brazil. The first four UH-60L Black Hawks were delivered to the Brazilian Army in 1997 for peacekeeping missions. Additional deliveries included six configured for special forces and search-and-rescue in 2008, followed by ten more in 2009, with deliveries continuing through 2011. The new helicopters will be distributed across Army Aviation Battalions in Taubaté, Campo Grande, and Manaus, replacing older aircraft to support a range of missions. Earlier in 2024, a delegation led by Army General Flávio Marcus Lancia Barbosa visited the U.S. Army Materiel Command, Sikorsky, and the Brazilian Army Commission in Washington to finalize details of the acquisition. The delegation coordinated with U.S. agencies to ensure the terms of the Government-to-Government (G2G) purchase met operational needs. Furthermore, this acquisition reflects the Brazilian Army’s ongoing modernization of its aviation fleet, with the delivery of the UH-60M helicopters aiming to enhance operational capabilities across its units. The helicopters are expected to provide continuity in roles previously fulfilled by the UH-60L and AS532UE fleets, including troop transport, medical evacuation, and support for special operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2024/brazil-to-start-receiving-new-us-uh-60m-black-hawk-helicopters-in-2025	2024-11-18T03:31:26-08:00

The CTM-290 is a 600mm tactical ballistic missile designed for integration with the K239 Chunmoo system. It features a high-explosive fragmentation warhead and utilizes a GPS/INS hybrid navigation system, ensuring high precision even against moving targets. The CTM-290 has an operational range of up to 290 kilometers and maintains a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of approximately 9 meters, making it a formidable asset for long-range precision strikes. Saudi Arabia has been progressively enhancing its artillery capabilities by acquiring advanced systems like the K239 Chunmoo. In March 2022, the kingdom reportedly purchased the K239 Chunmoo multiple rocket launcher system. The recent deployment of the K239 equipped with CTM-290 missiles signifies a strategic advancement in Saudi Arabia's defense posture, significantly boosting its long-range strike and deterrence capabilities. The integration of the CTM-290 missile into Saudi Arabia's K239 systems aligns with similar regional developments. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has also been observed deploying the K239 system with ballistic missile pods, indicating a regional trend towards bolstering long-range precision strike capabilities. These advancements reflect a broader strategic initiative among Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to modernize their military assets in response to evolving security dynamics. The sighting of Saudi Arabia's K239 Chunmoo MLRS configured with CTM-290 tactical ballistic missiles underscores a significant enhancement in the kingdom's military capabilities. This development not only strengthens Saudi Arabia's defense infrastructure but also contributes to the broader regional security architecture, reflecting a commitment to maintaining stability and deterrence in the Middle East.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/army-news-2024/exclusive-saudi-arabias-k239-chunmoo-launchers-now-armed-with-south-koreas-ctm-290-ballistic-missiles	2024-11-17T09:47:56-08:00
