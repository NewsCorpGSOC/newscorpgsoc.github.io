Operators rely on the CMS for decision support in navigation, weapons direction, target tracking, and threat analysis, making it one of the most critical components in modern naval warfare. A major aspect of this upgrade program involves the introduction of RECODE (Reportedly Enhanced Combat Operational Decision Engine), which will significantly enhance the Royal Navy’s ability to process and analyze combat data. By integrating artificial intelligence-driven analytics and automation, RECODE improves the speed and accuracy of threat evaluation and weapon assignment. Modern warships must be able to react to hostile actions within seconds, making the ability to process sensor data and execute defensive or offensive measures in real time a crucial capability. With enhanced situational awareness and a refined tactical picture, the upgraded CMS will improve response efficiency, reducing human workload and the risk of operator error. The modernization effort also includes advancements in navigation and blind pilotage capabilities, allowing ships to maneuver more effectively in GPS-denied environments, which is particularly relevant in electronic warfare scenarios. Weapon direction and control systems will also see improvements, ensuring more precise targeting for missiles, naval guns, and countermeasure deployment. By integrating these elements into a unified command structure, the Royal Navy enhances its ability to respond to both asymmetric threats, such as drone swarms and small fast-attack boats, and conventional threats from submarines, aircraft, and warships. This announcement follows a recent Royal Navy operation in which British forces tracked the Russian intelligence-gathering ship Yantar as it moved through UK waters. The ability to monitor, track, and analyze the movements of potentially adversarial vessels demonstrates the importance of having an advanced CMS capable of handling complex surveillance and threat detection tasks. Given the increasing frequency of such encounters, particularly with near-peer adversaries, the modernization of combat management capabilities is not only a defensive necessity but also a strategic imperative. The Royal Navy’s commitment to digital transformation extends beyond just CMS upgrades. The integration of data fusion technologies, AI-driven automation, and next-generation electronic warfare systems reflects a broader effort to enhance fleet-wide interoperability and operational effectiveness. As the Type 26 and Type 31 frigates enter service, these new platforms will be equipped with advanced digital infrastructure, allowing seamless coordination with existing warships. Ensuring that legacy vessels remain technologically competitive is equally important, as the transition to a fully modernized fleet takes time. Investments in CMS modernization also align with the UK’s strategic vision for maritime security, which emphasizes deterrence, power projection, and rapid response capabilities. Future conflicts are expected to be characterized by high-speed engagements, cyber warfare, and multi-domain operations, making the ability to rapidly process and act on intelligence a key factor in mission success. Beyond direct combat applications, an upgraded CMS also enhances a warship’s role in intelligence gathering, reconnaissance, and network-centric warfare. The ability to integrate with allied naval forces and share real-time data across joint task forces ensures that Royal Navy assets remain a crucial part of multinational security operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/british-navy-overhauls-combat-systems-to-improve-threat-detection-after-monitoring-russian-vessel	2025-01-29T06:02:12-08:00	
Iran tests new Badr anti-tank guided missile to modernize its infantry strike capabilities	As reported by Patarames on January 28, 2025, Iran has conducted the first publicly documented test of its new Badr anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). The system, which appears to be a modified version of the Almas missile, features a reduced caliber from 130 mm to 110 mm. The Badr ATGM is a single-operator, fire-and-forget weapon with an operational range of up to two kilometers, designed to counter armored vehicles.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Compared to the earlier Almas missile, the Badr’s lighter design enables a single soldier to carry and deploy this fire-and-forget weapon without additional personnel or setup while maintaining the ability to penetrate up to 60 centimeters of armor at a range of up to two kilometers. (Picture source: Twitter/Fatherland9_) The caliber reduction has led to discussions about weight reduction and improved portability for individual operators. The lighter design allows a single soldier to carry and deploy the system without additional personnel or setup. Available specifications indicate that the Badr missile can penetrate up to 60 centimeters of armor. The missile has a flight duration of 13 seconds and a total weight of approximately 15 kilograms, contributing to its ease of use. During a recent Iranian military exercise in the western region of the country, the Badr ATGM was tested alongside other weapon systems. The exercise, conducted in the Qasr Shirin to Naft Shahr axis, included joint operations using platforms such as Ababil and Arash Nezaja attack drones. These unmanned systems were used in coordinated attacks and target destruction missions, demonstrating efforts to integrate precision-guided munitions into military operations. Brigadier General Karim Cheshak, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations of the Iranian Army Ground Forces, stated that the Badr missile was one of the new weapons evaluated during the exercise. The new Badr anti-tank guided missile system is expected to replace older models, such as the Saeghe ATGMs, which have been used by Iranian forces and allied groups in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon. This suggests that the Badr ATGM may follow a similar deployment pattern. Footage of the missile launch has been analyzed, with some suggesting that the Badr ATGM employs a high-angle attack trajectory, possibly indicating a top-attack capability. While not officially confirmed, this feature would improve effectiveness against armored vehicles by targeting less protected areas. Additionally, the reduction in caliber compared to the Almas (a copy of the Israeli ATGM) is not easily visible but contributes to reduced weight and increased portability. Some commentators have noted that stability during launch is crucial for operators, but the fire-and-forget capability simplifies its use by eliminating the need for manual guidance after launch. Iran's development of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) dates back to the 1970s with the acquisition of American BGM-71 TOW missiles in 1971. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Iran sought to develop indigenous ATGM capabilities, leading to the production of the Toophan missile, a reverse-engineered variant of the TOW. The Toophan became the foundation of Iran’s ATGM industry, with serial production beginning in the late 1980s. Additionally, Iran developed the Raad missile, modeled after the Soviet 9M14M Malyutka (AT-3b Sagger), which entered mass production in 1988 and was publicly unveiled in 1997. Over time, Iran expanded its ATGM arsenal, introducing more advanced variants of the Toophan and other systems with improved guidance and penetration capabilities. In recent years, Iran has expanded its anti-tank capabilities through the development and deployment of multiple missile systems. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) introduced a ground-launched version of the Almas anti-tank missile in July 2021, a top-attack system with an 8-kilometer range. In April 2023, the IRGC test-fired the Sadid-365, a guided anti-tank missile with a similar 8-kilometer range. In February 2024, Iran unveiled the Shafaq missile system, designed to engage armored targets at distances of up to 20 kilometers. These developments indicate Iran's efforts to improve its precision-guided anti-armor systems and increase the operational range of its anti-tank weapons. Additionally, Iran has renewed its focus on developing indigenous missile systems, including the hypersonic Fatah, the Paveh, and the ballistic Khorramshahr-4 missile, to support its defense strategy and enhance the capabilities of its armed forces.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/iran-tests-new-badr-anti-tank-guided-missile-to-modernize-its-infantry-strike-capabilities	2025-01-29T05:01:13-08:00

Since 2015, Spanish armed forces have maintained a continuous presence in Adana with a PATRIOT surface-to-air missile battery, operating under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the operational control of Allied Air Command. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The PATRIOT system, designed to intercept and neutralize various airborne threats, plays a crucial role in this mission (Picture source: NATO) This ongoing commitment reflects Spain’s active role within NATO and its contribution to the collective security of its allies. Over the past ten years, the mission has required 21 rotations and involved nearly 3,000 Spanish military personnel, deployed successively to support the protection of Turkish airspace. NATO Support to Türkiye was established to enhance Türkiye’s air defense capabilities with the PATRIOT missile system, an integral component of NATO’s air defense network, designed to counter aerial and ballistic threats. The mission traces its origins to 2013 when the Turkish government requested assistance from NATO due to security risks stemming from the conflict in Syria. Following a decision by NATO foreign ministers, the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands deployed PATRIOT batteries to counter ballistic threats. In 2015, Spain took over the deployment, stationing a unit in Adana, where it continues its mission today. Spain currently operates three PATRIOT missile batteries. The first was acquired second-hand from Germany in 2004, followed by two more in 2014, enhancing Spain’s capability to meet NATO air defense requirements. One of these batteries has been permanently stationed in Türkiye since 2015, ensuring continuous surveillance and protection of Turkish airspace. To further strengthen these capabilities, Spain received authorization in October 2023 to acquire four additional PATRIOT PAC-3+ systems for €2.67 billion.

Analysis: President Trump Orders Next-Gen Missile Shield: How US Plans to Defend Against New Missile Threats?	U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to develop a 'next-generation missile defense shield' to protect the U.S. from aerial threats, including hypersonic weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and cruise missiles. The executive order, signed on January 28, 2025, directs the U.S. Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed plan within 60 days, outlining the technology, deployment strategy, and budget for this ambitious project.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Integrated Battle Command System continues to demonstrate its transformative Air and Missile Defense integration capability through participating in the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor live fire flight tests. LTAMDS is a new, advanced sensor developed to integrate into the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense architecture and will replace the current Patriot radar. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The initiative, being informally called 'America’s Iron Dome,' seeks to reinforce U.S. homeland defense by integrating advanced interception technologies and potentially even space-based defenses. However, the plan raises several key questions: How will it differ from existing U.S. missile defense systems? What additional protection does America actually need? And is such an initiative even feasible given current military capabilities and budget constraints? The United States already has one of the most advanced and layered air and missile defense architectures in the world, protecting against various threats ranging from enemy aircraft to ballistic missiles. This system comprises land, sea, and space-based assets that work together to detect, track, and neutralize potential threats. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is the U.S.'s primary defense against long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched by adversaries like North Korea, China, and Russia. It is based in Alaska and California, with 44 interceptor missiles designed to engage incoming threats outside the Earth's atmosphere in mid-flight. However, the GMD system has been criticized for inconsistent test results and limited capacity against multiple incoming missiles or decoys. Deployed on U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system can intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The system uses the SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6 interceptors and is crucial for defending the U.S. fleet and key allies such as Japan and South Korea. Aegis Ashore installations in Romania and Poland also serve as land-based missile defense sites against regional threats. Meanwhile, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system is designed to intercept short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in their final phase before impact. It is deployed in locations such as Guam, South Korea, and the U.S. mainland, providing additional protection for key military installations. Unlike Israel’s Iron Dome, THAAD does not counter short-range threats like drones and artillery. The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) system is widely used for defending against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and enemy aircraft. Patriots have been deployed in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific to counter threats from adversaries such as Iran and North Korea. However, their effectiveness against hypersonic missiles remains a concern. For short-range air defense, the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) is used to defend Washington, D.C., and key locations against cruise missiles, drones, and aircraft. The Avenger system, mounted on Humvees, provides mobile low-altitude protection against drones and helicopters. Beyond ground-based defenses, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) provides early missile warning by detecting heat signatures from launches around the globe. Future Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensors (HBTSS) will enhance tracking and targeting of hypersonic weapons. Trump’s new directive aims to create a more comprehensive defense system that goes beyond the existing regional and strategic defenses currently in place. Unlike Israel’s Iron Dome, which specializes in intercepting short-range rockets and artillery, Trump’s version is expected to address ICBMs, hypersonic missiles, and long-range cruise missiles. The system may incorporate directed energy weapons (lasers) and space-based interceptors to neutralize threats earlier in flight. Current defenses are focused on military installations and strategic sites. Trump’s proposal might include localized air defense systems for major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. The plan could involve integrating AI and advanced radar networks to detect and neutralize incoming threats faster. However, several challenges and concerns exist. Missile defense is expensive. The existing GMD program alone has cost over $67 billion, and THAAD and Aegis programs also require billions in maintenance and upgrades. A nationwide missile shield could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, raising concerns about affordability and congressional approval. Technical feasibility is also a major concern. Intercepting hypersonic missiles is extremely difficult. China and Russia are rapidly advancing their hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) programs, and current U.S. defenses struggle to track and intercept them. Space-based interceptors, while promising, have not yet been proven effective in real-world scenarios. Geopolitically, Russia and China have strongly opposed U.S. missile defense expansions, arguing that such systems could destabilize global strategic balance. A more advanced U.S. missile shield might provoke adversaries to develop more offensive missile capabilities, triggering a new arms race. Trump’s new missile defense initiative marks a major shift in U.S. national security strategy, aiming for comprehensive homeland protection beyond current regional defenses. While enhancing air defense is crucial given the rise of hypersonic and advanced missile threats, the plan faces significant technical, financial, and geopolitical hurdles. As the Pentagon prepares its report within 60 days, the world will be watching closely to see whether Trump’s vision for a next-generation missile shield will become a revolutionary step in U.S. defense—or an unattainable dream.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/analysis-president-trump-orders-next-gen-missile-shield-how-us-plans-to-defend-against-new-missile-threats	2025-01-29T03:58:16-08:00	
Spanish Navy’s Flagship to Operate SIRTAP Drone for Next-Gen Carrier-Based Drone Missions	According to information published by Airbus on January 28, 2025, Airbus and Navantia have launched an initiative to integrate the SIRTAP tactical unmanned aerial system (UAS) into the Juan Carlos I (L61) amphibious assault ship. This effort focuses on seamless integration with the ship’s combat systems, secure real-time data transmission, and safe launch and recovery procedures in maritime conditions. The initiative reflects a broader trend in modern naval warfare, where unmanned systems play an increasingly critical role in surveillance, reconnaissance, force projection, and operational flexibility.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Spanish drone SIRTAP on the amphibious assault ship Juan Carlos I. (Picture source: Airbus Defence) The core of the integration lies in linking SIRTAP with the SCOMBA combat management system, which acts as the command and control backbone of the ship. This requires adapting the UAV’s data transmission capabilities to work within the ship’s sensor fusion and fire control network, ensuring real-time situational awareness across all operational units. The challenge involves optimizing latency-free communication between the UAV and onboard operators, allowing for effective reconnaissance and target acquisition. This will demand a robust, encrypted data link capable of resisting electronic warfare threats, ensuring that adversaries cannot disrupt ISR operations through jamming, cyber intrusions, or signal spoofing. Operating a fixed-wing UAV from a ship like the Juan Carlos I requires precise launch and recovery adaptations. The ship’s flight deck, originally designed for Harrier fighter jets and helicopters, lacks the catapult systems typically used for fixed-wing UAVs. Airbus and Navantia must either develop a dedicated net or arrestor-based recovery system or modify SIRTAP’s software for precision-assisted landings using optical, radar, and inertial navigation cues. Stability during takeoff and landing is further complicated by the ship’s movement, deck pitching, and unpredictable wind patterns, requiring advanced stabilization algorithms and real-time course corrections to ensure successful drone operations in varying sea states. The flight control software and autonomous guidance system must be modified to integrate with the ship’s aviation coordination framework. This includes adapting the UAV’s autopilot to work with ship-based navigation radars and inertial stabilization systems, ensuring precise positioning even in rough seas. The ability to execute automated landings with AI-assisted adjustments for wind conditions, deck movement, and aircraft deconfliction is critical, especially when operating in a mixed-aircraft environment. With existing air operations including AV-8B Harrier II jets, NH90 helicopters, and SH-60 Seahawk helicopters, the introduction of a UAV requires new air traffic control protocols, ensuring that drone launch and recovery do not interfere with manned aircraft operations. Expanding the ISR capabilities of Juan Carlos I, SIRTAP will provide beyond-line-of-sight reconnaissance, essential for anti-submarine warfare, maritime interdiction, amphibious assault coordination, and early warning threat detection. The UAV’s ability to track surface contacts, monitor littoral zones, and relay real-time intelligence to deployed forces significantly extends the ship’s operational reach, reducing reliance on traditional airborne surveillance assets. With its multi-sensor payload, including electro-optical, infrared, and maritime radar systems, SIRTAP can detect and track naval threats, identify irregular maritime activity, and provide force protection against asymmetric threats such as swarm drone attacks or small fast-attack craft. The integration of an automated launch and recovery system (ALRS) will be essential for enabling repeatable, reliable UAV operations at sea. The lack of a dedicated runway means SIRTAP will require either a shipborne recovery system using arresting cables, nets, or a robotic arm-assisted capture mechanism, or modifications that allow short-roll landings on the deck with rapid retrieval. Launch operations must also account for deck stability, wave motion, and wind interference, requiring adaptive flight control settings based on real-time meteorological and ship movement data. With increasing reliance on network-centric warfare, ensuring secure UAV communication and data sharing within the Spanish Navy’s fleet-wide tactical network is crucial. SIRTAP’s integration must support multi-platform interoperability, allowing data to be distributed not just to the Juan Carlos I but also to supporting assets such as frigates, offshore patrol vessels, and allied maritime task forces. To achieve this, Airbus and Navantia will likely implement tactical datalink protocols similar to NATO’s Link 16 or Link 22 standards, ensuring that ISR feeds can be shared with joint and coalition forces for enhanced situational awareness and coordinated mission execution. The introduction of SIRTAP aboard Juan Carlos I represents a technological leap in Spanish naval doctrine, marking the first true integration of a tactical UAV into a Spanish Navy amphibious and power projection platform. Beyond its immediate ISR benefits, the program paves the way for future UAV deployments across Spain’s surface fleet, including potential applications aboard the F-110 frigates and BAM offshore patrol vessels. The knowledge gained from integrating a fixed-wing UAV into a naval aviation environment will inform future unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) programs, shaping the next generation of manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) concepts in Spanish maritime operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/spanish-navys-flagship-to-operate-sirtap-drone-for-next-gen-carrier-based-drone-missions	2025-01-29T03:55:11-08:00

F-35s from Three Nations Conduct Joint Drills in Guam to Strengthen Indo-Pacific Air Operations	Amid rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, the air forces of Japan, the United States, and Australia are set to conduct a large-scale military exercise in Guam, marking a significant step in their trilateral cooperation. For the first time, F-35 stealth fighters from all three nations will operate together in the Cope North exercise, scheduled from February 3 to 21 at Andersen Air Force Base. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Japan will deploy six F-35As, two E-2D Hawkeye early warning aircraft, a KC-46A Pegasus tanker, and 250 personnel from the 3rd Air Wing, Airborne Warning and Control Wing, and 3rd Tactical Airlift Group (Picture source: Lockheed Martin) Organized under the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) command, this exercise aims to enhance interoperability between the participating forces and strengthen their ability to conduct complex operations in a modern combat environment. The focus will be on aerial combat and large-force employment, providing an opportunity for pilots and command structures to refine their coordination against opponents with similar capabilities. General Hiroaki Uchikura, Chief of Staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), emphasized the importance of this training in evaluating strategies and tactics against comparable threats. The F-35A Lightning II is a fifth-generation multirole stealth fighter developed by Lockheed Martin for the U.S. Air Force under the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. As the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant of the F-35 family, it is designed for air superiority, precision strikes, and close air support. Equipped with advanced stealth, cutting-edge avionics, and real-time sensor fusion, the F-35A is capable of operating in contested environments, detecting and engaging targets beyond visual range (BVR). Its AN/APG-81 AESA radar, Distributed Aperture System (DAS), and Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provide enhanced situational awareness, complemented by the Helmet-Mounted Display System (HMDS), which projects tactical data directly onto the pilot’s visor. The F-35A carries a diverse array of armaments, including an internal M61A2 Vulcan 20mm cannon, AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, as well as GBU-31 JDAM and GBU-39 SDB guided bombs for precision strikes. The integration of the AGM-88 HARM missile allows it to conduct suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) missions. Designed for interoperability with allied forces, the aircraft has been adopted by multiple nations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, Norway, and other NATO and strategic partners. Powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135-PW-100 engine, it reaches speeds of Mach 1.6 with a combat range of over 2,200 km, making it a key asset in modern air operations. Japan will deploy six F-35As, accompanied by two E-2D Advanced Hawkeye early warning aircraft and a KC-46A Pegasus tanker, with approximately 250 personnel from the 3rd Air Wing, the Airborne Warning and Control Wing at Misawa Air Base, and the 3rd Tactical Airlift Group at Miho Air Base. Cope North, first launched in 1978 as a bilateral U.S.-Japan training exercise, has evolved into a large-scale multinational operation, incorporating Australia in 2012. In 1999, the exercise moved from Misawa to Guam in response to expanding operational requirements, allowing for larger deployments and more comprehensive combat simulations. The increasing role of the F-35 in joint operations reflects the three nations’ commitment to strengthening deterrence capabilities in the region. In 2023, the JASDF deployed two F-35s to Australia for the first time, seen as a preparatory step for potential future deployments. This rapid relocation capability holds strategic importance amid growing regional security concerns. The vulnerability of Japanese air bases to ballistic and cruise missile threats has led Japan to explore alternative operational strategies to ensure continuity in a conflict scenario. The potential use of allied bases, particularly in Australia and Guam, would enable more effective force dispersion in case of hostilities. Andersen Air Force Base, located at a greater distance from China, serves as a key hub for trilateral air operations. However, the expansion of China’s long-range strike capabilities has prompted the United States to consider additional options, such as Wake Island, to bolster its defense posture. This exercise highlights a significant shift in military cooperation within the Indo-Pacific. The joint deployment of F-35s by these three nations underscores their shared objective of maintaining regional security and stability amid evolving threats. Through Cope North, the air forces of the United States, Japan, and Australia continue efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, reinforcing operational readiness and enhancing mutual capabilities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/f-35s-from-three-nations-conduct-joint-drills-in-guam-to-strengthen-indo-pacific-air-operations	2025-01-29T00:34:47-08:00

The training, which will focus on the advanced capabilities of the Typhon system, particularly its cruise missile capabilities, will not involve live-fire exercises. This initiative marks a significant step in the Philippines' ongoing defense modernization efforts and strengthens the military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link On June 27, 2023, the U.S. Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, in collaboration with Soldiers from the 1st Multi-Domain Task Force and the U.S. Navy's Program Executive Office for Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons, successfully demonstrated the launch of a Tomahawk missile from the Army's prototype Mid-Range Capability system. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The Typhon missile system is the nickname for the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) system, which is designed to address a critical gap in the U.S. and allied defense capabilities. This system is capable of launching long-range missiles, providing the flexibility to strike a wide range of targets with precision. The Typhon is especially significant due to its versatility and operational mobility, as it can deploy rapidly and engage a variety of targets across large distances. The Typhon is specifically designed for mid-range missile defense, enabling high-precision strikes in regions where traditional long-range or short-range systems would be less effective. Key missile systems compatible with the Typhon MRC include the SM-6 (Standard Missile-6) and the Tomahawk Block V cruise missile. The SM-6 is a multi-role missile capable of targeting air, surface, and ballistic missile threats. Its inclusion in the Typhon system allows for effective anti-air and anti-surface warfare, giving it an edge in countering advanced threats such as enemy aircraft, drones, and maritime assets. The Tomahawk Block V, one of the most advanced versions of the Tomahawk cruise missile, is a long-range, precision strike weapon that can target land-based facilities, including command centers, missile sites, and other strategic infrastructure. The Philippines' interest in acquiring the Typhon system stems from its strategic location in the South China Sea, an area that has become a focal point of heightened military tensions, particularly with China. China’s expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea directly challenge Philippine sovereignty, making the acquisition of advanced missile systems like Typhon crucial for enhancing the country's defense capabilities.

The system’s combination of SM-6 and Tomahawk Block V missiles offers the Philippines a potent deterrence against potential regional threats, particularly from adversaries with sophisticated air and naval assets. As China continues to expand its military presence in the South China Sea, the Philippine government sees the Typhon system as a vital component of its defense modernization efforts, which are aimed at enhancing the country's ability to defend its territorial integrity and safeguard its strategic interests. This training initiative is part of broader defense cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines, built on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The Typhon system was deployed during the Balikatan joint exercises in 2024, a clear demonstration of the growing military interoperability between the two nations. Despite strong objections from China, the Typhon missile system remains stationed in the Philippines, symbolizing the deepening defense ties between Washington and Manila. The Philippines has expressed its desire to acquire its own Typhon launchers, with discussions about this potential acquisition ongoing. Philippine officials recognize the strategic importance of having such advanced missile capabilities as part of the country’s defense infrastructure. The upcoming training is expected to prepare Philippine forces for the potential operational integration of the Typhon system, ensuring that the military is fully equipped to manage and deploy the system should the country move forward with acquiring its own launchers in the future. The integration of the Typhon missile system into the Philippine military would not only strengthen its defense capabilities but also have significant implications for the regional security environment. By acquiring the Typhon, the Philippines would enhance its position within the broader security architecture of the Indo-Pacific region, which continues to experience rising tensions, particularly in relation to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The training of Philippine Army personnel on the U.S. Mid-Range Capability (MRC) Typhon missile system marks a pivotal moment in the country's defense modernization. As the Philippines looks to enhance its deterrence capabilities and build stronger defense relationships with the U.S. and other allies, the Typhon missile system, with its advanced SM-6 and Tomahawk Block V missiles, will play a crucial role in securing the nation’s strategic interests and strengthening its defense posture against potential regional threats.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-philippine-army-to-begin-training-with-us-mrc-typhon-missile-system-in-february-2025	2025-01-28T07:46:07-08:00	
US Navy's Medium Landing Ship (LSM) Program: Transforming Amphibious Warfare for Indo-Pacific	The Navy Medium Landing Ship (LSM) Program: Background and Issues for Congress, published on January 23, 2025, examines the Navy’s initiative to develop a fleet of 18 to 35 cost-effective amphibious vessels, a key component of the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy, aimed at enhancing U.S. operational agility in Indo-Pacific maritime environments.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The US Navy's new Medium Landing Ship (LSM) will play a pivotal role in supporting the Marine Corps' island-hopping operations under the Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy in the Indo-Pacific. (Picture source: US Congress) The U.S. Navy’s Medium Landing Ship (LSM) program, formerly known as the Light Amphibious Warship (LAW) initiative, is a crucial component of the Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) strategy. Designed to operate in contested maritime environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, the program aims to procure between 18 and 35 amphibious ships. These vessels will enhance the Marine Corps’ ability to rapidly deploy, maneuver, and sustain small, mobile units as part of the broader U.S. military concept of Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO). The Navy’s proposed FY2025 budget includes $268.1 million to procure the lead ship in the program. Subsequent vessels are expected to be less costly due to the distribution of nonrecurring engineering and design costs, with per-ship costs stabilizing around $152.5 to $155.7 million by FY2029. The first ship in the class, named LSM-1 'McClung' in honor of Major Megan M. L. McClung, a Marine Corps officer killed in action during the Iraq War, is expected to be delivered in February 2029, following a contract award in March 2025. The LSM program emphasizes affordability, simplicity, and operational efficiency. The ships are smaller and less expensive to operate than traditional amphibious vessels like the LHA, LHD, and LPD classes. They are designed with a shallow draft, enabling them to operate in littoral waters and beach directly onshore. Each ship will have the capacity to transport 50 Marines, 648 short tons of equipment, and provide approximately 8,000 square feet of deck cargo space. Equipped with a helicopter landing pad, roll-on/roll-off beaching capability, and light defensive armament, the LSM is tailored for the Marine Corps’ vision of swift, distributed, shore-to-shore operations. The LSM is essential to the Marine Corps’ EABO strategy, which focuses on small, platoon-sized units maneuvering across island chains to deny adversaries sea control. These units are envisioned to operate from remote bases, conducting missions such as firing anti-ship cruise missiles, providing forward arming and refueling for aircraft, and delivering intelligence and early warning capabilities. The LSM’s ability to transport, sustain, and support these forces will play a pivotal role in countering potential adversaries, particularly China, in the Western Pacific. Congressional oversight of the program has intensified, with concerns about cost estimates, schedule risks, and design stability. Historical challenges with lead-ship construction in Navy programs, such as significant cost overruns and delays, remain a point of contention. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected higher per-ship costs than the Navy’s estimates, with a potential average cost of $340-430 million compared to the Navy’s projection of approximately $150 million per ship for the first eight vessels. In December 2024, the Navy canceled its original Request for Proposals (RFP) for the LSM program due to higher-than-expected bids and is now exploring the acquisition of non-developmental vessels as an interim solution. Efforts to refine the program include examining the possibility of adapting existing Army Logistics Support Vessels (LSVs) or using commercially available designs to meet operational needs. Army watercraft, such as the General Frank S. Besson-class and Runnymede-class vessels, have been identified as potential options for bridging the capability gap. These vessels, already equipped with beaching capabilities and significant cargo capacity, could provide a cost-effective alternative while the Navy works to refine the LSM’s final design. The industrial base implications of the program are another critical aspect under congressional review. The Navy has indicated a preference for having a single shipyard build all LSMs but remains open to multi-yard construction if it expedites delivery or reduces costs. The program has the potential to distribute shipbuilding work across multiple U.S. yards, fostering competition and strengthening the industrial base. However, lawmakers have expressed concerns that delays or design immaturity could lead to costly rework and jeopardize the program’s long-term affordability. The Marine Corps has also explored interim solutions to address the operational gap before the LSM becomes operational. These include chartering civilian vessels, using existing Navy platforms like the Expeditionary Fast Transport (T-EPF), and experimenting with commercially available stern landing vessels. These bridging efforts aim to support Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs), which have already begun forming in regions like Hawaii, where they are tasked with testing the EABO concept in realistic scenarios. Despite the program’s challenges, the LSM remains a critical investment for the future of U.S. naval and amphibious operations.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navys-medium-landing-ship-lsm-program-transforming-amphibious-warfare-for-indo-pacific	2025-01-28T07:23:30-08:00	
US Navy TAGOS-25 Explorer-class ships: cost overruns delays and strategic importance in Anti-Submarine Warfare	The report 'Navy TAGOS-25 Ocean Surveillance Shipbuilding Program: Background and Issues for Congress', published on January 23, 2025, provides an in-depth analysis of the Navy's plan to procure seven TAGOS-25 class ships, recently renamed the Explorer class, while addressing critical issues such as cost overruns, schedule delays, and the strategic importance of countering submarine threats from adversaries like China and Russia.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Artist rendering of the future TAGOS-25 Explorer-class Ocean Surveillance Ships. (Picture source: Austal USA) The U.S. Navy’s TAGOS-25 class ocean surveillance ships, recently named the Explorer class, represent a modernization effort to enhance the Navy’s anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities. Designed to replace the aging Victorious and Impeccable classes, these ships will serve as critical assets in the Navy’s Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). However, the program faces challenges, including rising costs, procurement delays, and evolving operational requirements, prompting heightened scrutiny from Congress and defense stakeholders. The TAGOS-25 class ships are designed to gather undersea acoustic data using the advanced Surveillance Towed-Array Sensor System (SURTASS). This data supports ASW missions by providing critical insights into submarine activities, particularly from near-peer adversaries such as China and Russia. The current TAGOS fleet comprises five vessels—four Victorious-class ships commissioned between 1991 and 1993, and one Impeccable-class ship commissioned in 2000. All are homeported in Yokohama, Japan, and feature the Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) design, which enhances stability in high seas, an essential attribute for extended surveillance operations. The new TAGOS-25 class builds on this legacy, employing a larger and faster SWATH design to improve operational efficiency. Named the Explorer class in January 2025, the first two ships, Don Walsh and Victor Vescovo, honor pioneers in exploration, reflecting the Navy’s acknowledgment of the critical role these vessels will play in charting the future of undersea surveillance. The Navy plans to procure seven Explorer-class ships to replace the five aging vessels, but procurement schedules have been adjusted, with the second ship deferred from FY2025 to FY2026. The revised schedule anticipates the procurement of one ship annually from FY2026 to FY2029 under the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), with the final two ships planned beyond this timeline. Cost escalation has become a major concern. The estimated cost of the first TAGOS-25 ship has risen to $789.6 million, marking an increase of nearly 82% over initial projections. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, and higher non-recurring engineering expenses are cited as contributing factors. Additionally, procurement costs for the sixth and seventh ships have been adjusted upward to reflect these trends, raising questions about whether similar adjustments will be necessary for earlier ships in the class. The first ship’s design and construction have also faced delays, with a reported one-year setback raising concerns about the program’s overall schedule. The Navy awarded Austal USA a $113.9 million contract in May 2023 for the design of the TAGOS-25 class, with options for up to seven ships. If all options are exercised, the total contract value could reach $3.2 billion. In May 2024, Austal received a $516 million contract modification for long-lead materials and construction of the first ship, signaling progress but also highlighting the financial complexity of the program. The decision to defer FY2025 funding for the TAGOS-25 program has drawn attention from Congress. Lawmakers have expressed concerns over the implications of this delay on fleet readiness, particularly as adversaries continue to modernize their submarine capabilities. The deferral aligns with broader budgetary adjustments but underscores the importance of maintaining momentum in delivering these critical assets. Strategically, the TAGOS-25 program is essential to countering submarine threats from adversaries like China, which has made significant advancements in its nuclear-powered attack submarine fleet. The Explorer-class ships will provide enhanced surveillance capabilities, ensuring the Navy remains at the forefront of undersea warfare and maritime dominance. While the program promises to strengthen the Navy’s ability to monitor global undersea activities, challenges such as cost growth, schedule delays, and shifting procurement timelines must be addressed to ensure its success.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/us-navy-tagos-25-explorer-class-ships-cost-overruns-delays-and-strategic-importance-in-anti-submarine-warfare	2025-01-28T06:26:33-08:00

Trump Launches Iron Dome Project to Protect US From Ballistic Missiles	On January 27, 2025, in a speech delivered in Miami, President Donald Trump announced the launch of an ambitious missile defense project aimed at protecting the United States from a wide range of threats, including ballistic, hypersonic, and advanced cruise missiles. Dubbed the 'Iron Dome for America,' the initiative draws inspiration from Israel's well-known system designed to intercept rockets and short-range missiles while incorporating advanced technologies tailored to the specific needs of the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The partnership between Raytheon Technologies and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has led to the development of the SkyHunter, a U.S.-adapted version of Israel’s Iron Dome (Picture source: Army Recognition) In an executive order signed the same day, Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to submit a detailed plan within 60 days for this defense shield. Among the proposed solutions are space-based interceptors, underscoring the administration's interest in leveraging space technologies for national defense. 'The United States will not remain passive in the face of countries like China and Russia advancing militarization in space,' Trump stated, linking this initiative to earlier efforts during his first presidency, such as the creation of the Space Force in 2019. Trump emphasized that the system would provide unparalleled protection, similar to the Israeli Iron Dome, which has demonstrated its effectiveness by intercepting thousands of rockets launched from Gaza and Lebanon. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in collaboration with Israel Aerospace Industries, the Iron Dome relies on the EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptor missiles to counter short-range threats with an interception rate close to 90%. However, many experts argue that simply replicating the Iron Dome technology would not be sufficient to defend a nation as vast as the United States, which primarily faces threats from intercontinental and hypersonic missiles. These advanced threats demand more sophisticated solutions, potentially including orbital platforms and laser defense systems. The current geopolitical environment, marked by the growing missile capabilities of China and Russia and the proliferation of advanced missile technologies, highlights the need for an adaptable and robust defense system. Space-related threats, such as anti-satellite weapons and hypersonic missiles capable of evading conventional systems, have further driven the Trump administration to explore innovative defensive measures. In 2024, Israel demonstrated the effectiveness of a multi-layered defense system during an attack involving over 300 Iranian drones and ballistic missiles. This approach, combining the Iron Dome with the David’s Sling and Arrow systems, may serve as a model for the U.S. However, adapting this concept to the scale and complexity of U.S. defense requirements poses significant challenges. Since 2019, the U.S. Army has acquired two Iron Dome batteries to protect specific strategic bases from localized attacks. The partnership between Raytheon Technologies and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems has led to the development of the SkyHunter, a U.S.-adapted version of Israel’s Iron Dome. Designed to intercept and neutralize rockets, artillery shells, drones, and short-range missiles, the SkyHunter retains the key features of the Iron Dome, including the EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptors. However, it has been tailored to meet specific U.S. requirements. As part of this collaboration, Raytheon localized part of the production process, establishing a manufacturing facility in Arizona to produce critical components such as the Tamir interceptors. This move not only strengthens the U.S. defense industrial base but also ensures compliance with congressional mandates for domestic production, making the SkyHunter a vital asset in America’s layered defense strategy. Trump has insisted that this new system will be fully designed and manufactured domestically, highlighting the importance of national technological capabilities. However, the financial, technological, and strategic hurdles remain considerable. Developing a defense shield incorporating space-based interceptors will require extensive research and significant funding, raising concerns about the feasibility of achieving such a goal within a reasonable timeframe. While the concept of an 'Iron Dome for America' represents a recognition of modern threats, its realization faces numerous challenges. This project has the potential to become a pivotal development in U.S. national defense, but its success will depend on overcoming technical, financial, and political obstacles in the coming months.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/trump-launches-iron-dome-project-to-protect-us-from-ballistic-missiles	2025-01-28T01:14:43-08:00	
Analysis: Iran's confirmation of Su-35 fighter jet purchase could threaten US air superiority in the Middle East	As reported by Radio Farda on January 27, 2025, Iran officially confirmed the purchase of Russian Su-35 fighter jets. General Ali Shadmani, Deputy Chief of Staff at the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, announced that the acquisition aims to strengthen the country's air, land, and naval forces, including a. He did not disclose the number of aircraft purchased or their delivery status. This statement marks the first official confirmation from a senior Iranian official regarding the deal, which Army Recognition had hinted over the past two years as being aimed at countering Israeli variants of the American F-35 Lightning II, F-15 Eagle, and F-16 Fighting Falcon.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Su-35's Irbis-E radar, a passive electronically scanned array, is one of its key advantages, as it can detect and track up to 30 targets simultaneously and engage up to eight, with a maximum detection range of 400 kilometers for larger targets. (Picture source: Vitaly Kuzmin) Iran’s efforts to acquire modern Russian fighter jets date back to 2007, when it explored purchasing Su-30MK aircraft, but these discussions were halted by international sanctions and concerns over Iran's nuclear program. Attempts in 2015 to procure Su-30SM jets, including requests for domestic production rights, also failed. Iranian media previously reported that personnel began training on Su-35 operations in Russia in 2022. In 2023, reports surfaced that Iran and Russia had finalized a deal for Su-35SE fighters, following Iran’s provision of drones and missile technology to Russia during the Ukraine conflict. Initially, 25 Su-35SE jets were ordered, but this number was later increased to 50. The first two jets were delivered in late 2024, signaling the beginning of their integration into Iran’s air force as replacements for older American-made F-14 Tomcats and F-4 Phantoms, acquired in the 1970s. These new jets will complement Iran's existing fleet, which includes Russian MiG-29 and Su-24 aircraft, as well as domestically produced models like the Saeqeh and Kowsar. Iran has made significant upgrades to its airbases to accommodate the Su-35SE. Notably, the first two Su-35SE jets were delivered disassembled by cargo plane to Tehran, where they were subsequently assembled at Hamadan Air Base. This base, also referred to as the 3rd Tactical Air Base, now features new, larger hangars specifically designed for these larger aircraft. Additionally, Iran has constructed fortified facilities, including the underground Eagle 44 airbase unveiled in early 2023, to enhance the security and operational readiness of its air assets, including its Su-35s. These facilities are strategically located near Tehran, key nuclear sites, and regions requiring rapid air defense response, ensuring that the new fighters can operate securely and effectively while reducing vulnerability to airstrikes in centralized locations. Alongside the Su-35SE, Iran has acquired Yak-130 trainer aircraft, with deliveries starting in 2023, and Mi-28 attack helicopters, reportedly for use by the Revolutionary Guard Corps. In October 2024, reports also indicated that Iran has expressed interest in Su-30 fighter jets and may seek a license production agreement for both Su-35 and Su-30 aircraft, with plans for producing between 48 and 72 units. However, economic constraints and technical challenges make the feasibility of domestic production uncertain. While the F-35I Adir's stealth features reduce its radar cross-section, the Su-35SE's infrared search and track (IRST) system can detect aircraft based on heat signatures, potentially mitigating this advantage. (Picture source: Twitter/J.J.) Iran and Russia have been increasingly strengthening their military and economic ties in recent years, particularly in the face of Western sanctions. In early 2024, Iran joined the BRICS geopolitical bloc, aligning itself more closely with nations seeking alternatives to the Western-led global order. The comprehensive strategic partnership agreement signed between Tehran and Moscow emphasizes joint military efforts against common threats, intelligence exchanges, and collaboration to counter sanctions. For instance, Iran has supported Russia with drones and ballistic missiles during the conflict in Ukraine, while Russia has reciprocated with the delivery of modern assets, including the Murmansk-BN electronic warfare system to counter Israeli F-35s. The Su-35SE is an export version of the Sukhoi Su-35, a 4+ generation multirole fighter jet developed as a modernization of the Su-27 Flanker. It incorporates modern avionics, twin Saturn AL-41F1S afterburning turbofan engines, and thrust-vectoring nozzles, which contribute to its maneuverability. The Irbis-E radar, a passive electronically scanned array, can detect and track up to 30 targets simultaneously and engage up to eight, with a maximum detection range of 400 kilometers for larger targets. The Su-35 is equipped with 12 hardpoints, supporting a payload of up to 8,000 kilograms, including air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, and a 30mm GSh-30-1 internal cannon. While not designed as a stealth aircraft, it features electronic countermeasure systems aimed at disrupting enemy radar and missile systems, improving its operational survivability. With a combat radius exceeding 2,000 kilometers and the ability to launch the R-37M missile, capable of tracking targets at ranges up to 400 kilometers, the Su-35 allows Iran to project power across the region, including the Straits of Hormuz and beyond, as well as conduct extended air patrols over the Persian Gulf. These capabilities could improve Iran's ability to monitor and potentially challenge Turkish, Israeli, and US naval operations in the region, secure key air corridors, and provide air support to allied forces in conflict zones such as Syria. The Su-35’s combination of advanced radar and missile systems also strengthen Iran’s ability to counter air incursions and defend strategic sites. Additionally, its deployment at fortified bases such as Hamadan Air Base and Eagle 44 ensures the security and operational readiness of the aircraft, which could influence the defense strategies of regional adversaries, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, while reshaping the balance of air power in the Middle East. Furthermore, the Su-35SE offers specific capabilities that could be considered advantageous against the Israeli variants of the American F-35 Lightning II, F-15 Eagle, and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Its Irbis-E radar can detect targets at ranges up to 400 kilometers, which may allow it to identify non-stealth aircraft such as the F-15I Ra'am and F-16I Sufa before being detected. In beyond-visual-range (BVR) scenarios, the Su-35SE's R-37 missiles have a longer range compared to the AIM-120D missiles used by these fighters. In within-visual-range (WVR) engagements, its thrust-vectoring engines enable high maneuverability, which could provide an advantage over the F-15I and F-16I. While the F-35I Adir's stealth features reduce its radar cross-section, the Su-35SE's infrared search and track (IRST) system can detect aircraft based on heat signatures, potentially mitigating this advantage. Actual combat performance would depend on factors such as pilot expertise, mission objectives, and supporting systems.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/analysis-irans-confirmation-of-su-35-fighter-jet-purchase-could-threaten-us-air-superiority-in-the-middle-east	2025-01-28T01:01:49-08:00

US Army Revises Future XM-30 Combat Vehicle Requirements to Counter Lessons from Ukraine Conflict	The U.S. Army has requested to update its technical requirements for the future XM-30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle (MICV), taking into account the valuable lessons learned from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War. These updates are aimed at addressing the evolving threats posed by anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), which have had a devastating impact on modern armored vehicles. Among the key updates is the integration of advanced active protection systems (APS) designed to shield the vehicle from these emerging threats. However, the question remains: will these APS be sufficient to address the full spectrum of dangers that have emerged in the Ukraine conflict? The XM-30’s design reflects a broader trend of adapting military hardware to counter the vulnerabilities exposed by recent combat operations.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link U.S. soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment participate in a virtual simulation at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, offering feedback on potential crew configurations for the XM30 Combat Vehicle. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The XM-30 is a rebranding of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program, which was initiated to replace the M-2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV). The Bradley, in service since 1981, has long been an essential platform for U.S. mechanized infantry units, providing mobility, fire support, and the ability to engage enemy combat vehicles. Over the years, it has undergone several upgrades, but it has now reached the technological limits of its capacity to integrate new electronics, armor, and defensive systems. Past efforts to replace the Bradley, including the Future Combat System (FCS) and Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) programs, were canceled due to cost overruns and programmatic challenges. The OMFV program, which began with the goal of creating a next-generation fighting vehicle, was designed with optionally manned capabilities. This means that the vehicle could operate with or without a crew, depending on the operational situation. This flexibility is essential in modern warfare, where unmanned systems and semi-autonomous technologies are becoming increasingly significant. The optional manning concept would allow the vehicle to operate remotely, minimizing risks to the crew in high-threat environments. The OMFV aimed to provide a versatile platform that could maneuver soldiers, engage in close combat, and deliver lethality while operating alongside unmanned systems. On June 26, 2023, after completing the initial digital design phase, the Army officially redesignated the OMFV as the XM-30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle. The XM-30 will be an integral part of the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) and is slated to replace the M-2 Bradley to provide the capabilities needed to engage and defeat near-peer adversaries. The XM-30 will not only transport soldiers but will also enhance their effectiveness in combat through its advanced technology, including the ability to control robotics and semi-autonomous systems. The vehicle’s optionally manned design ensures that it can operate with or without a crew, depending on the mission requirements. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has revealed a series of lessons about the vulnerability of armored vehicles to modern weapon systems. ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided Missiles) and UASs (Unmanned Aerial Systems) have emerged as primary threats to traditional armored platforms, with Ukrainian forces making extensive use of systems like the Javelin and NLAW to destroy Russian tanks and IFVs. At the same time, drones have proven to be an especially lethal threat, often used for precision strikes against armored vehicles. These platforms, which can fly at low altitudes and strike vulnerable targets with guided munitions, have highlighted the need for armored vehicles to evolve in response to these emerging threats. The vulnerability of armored vehicles to ATGMs is particularly concerning. These missiles, which can be launched from a distance by enemy forces in hidden or mobile positions, have been highly effective against tanks and IFVs. Similarly, UAS have demonstrated their ability to conduct precision strikes against armor, often targeting vulnerable points like turret rings or the tops of vehicles, where the armor is thinner. These new threats emphasize the importance of developing Active Protection Systems (APSs) that can detect and neutralize incoming projectiles before they reach their targets. In response to these threats, the XM-30 will be equipped with advanced APS designed to defend against ATGMs, rockets, and projectiles. APS are systems that use a combination of sensors and countermeasures to intercept and destroy incoming threats. These systems can include radar-guided interceptors, jammers, and even high-energy projectiles designed to neutralize missiles and rockets. The Army has identified APS as essential to the XM-30’s design to protect the vehicle from the types of threats that have become increasingly common in modern conflict. The integration of APS into the XM-30 is a direct response to the lessons learned from the Ukraine conflict, where drones and ATGMs have significantly impacted the effectiveness of armored vehicles. While APS like the Iron Fist or AMAP-ADS have shown promise in countering ATGMs, the challenge remains in adapting these systems to deal with the variety of threats now present on the battlefield, especially the diverse and fast-moving drones. UAS, with their low cost and high versatility, can be used to harass armored vehicles from a variety of angles, making them difficult targets for traditional defense systems. To address these challenges, the APS on the XM-30 will likely combine both kinetic and electronic countermeasures to address a broad range of threats. In addition to APS, the XM-30 will likely incorporate advanced electronic warfare capabilities to counter the growing threat of drones. These systems could include jammers that disrupt drone communications and guidance systems, or even directed-energy weapons (DEWs) designed to disable or destroy small drones mid-flight. With drones being used increasingly in swarms, APS will need to be adaptive and responsive, capable of distinguishing between threats and neutralizing them in real-time. The development of the XM-30 also highlights broader trends in armored vehicle design, particularly the shift toward multi-functional platforms that can operate alongside autonomous systems and integrate robotics. The vehicle is designed not only to transport soldiers and engage in combat but also to control and coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles and robotic systems on the battlefield. This approach allows for more flexible and dynamic operations, especially in complex, fast-moving combat environments. In the face of emerging threats and changing warfare dynamics, the XM-30 represents a significant evolution in infantry fighting vehicles. By incorporating advanced active protection systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and semi-autonomous features, it promises to enhance the survivability and lethality of U.S. forces in future conflicts. The lessons learned from the Russia-Ukraine War have played a pivotal role in shaping the XM-30’s design, ensuring that it will be better equipped to face the challenges posed by modern anti-tank systems and drones. As these technologies continue to evolve, the XM-30 will serve as a cornerstone of future U.S. Army operations, providing a new level of capability for mechanized infantry and setting the standard for next-generation combat vehicles.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/us-army-revises-future-xm-30-combat-vehicle-requirements-to-counter-lessons-from-ukraine-conflict	2025-01-27T09:34:12-08:00

Spain Equips Its Paratroopers with New EIMOS Mortars Mounted on VAMTAC All-Terrain Vehicles	On January 22, 2025, Spain's 'Almogávares' VI Paratrooper Brigade (BRIPAC) became one of the first Spanish military units to be equipped with the new EIMOS mortars mounted on the VAMTAC ST5 all-terrain vehicle. This new fire support system was officially received by the BRIPAC at the end of 2024, marking an important step in strengthening the operational capabilities of the Spanish Army's infantry units. This was reported by Infodefensa on January 22, 2025. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The EIMOS mortars are mounted on the VAMTAC ST5 all-terrain vehicle. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The EIMOS (Expal Integrated Mortar System) is currently in use by the Second Paratrooper Battalion 'Roger de Lauria' at the Paracuellos de Jarama base near Madrid. The system is used for training purposes, and more units are expected to be delivered soon. This delivery comes from the nearby Park and Maintenance Center of Wheeled Vehicles (PCMVR) nº 1, where Rheinmetall Expal Munitions, the system’s supplier, handed over the equipment to the Spanish Army. In preparation for the new system, a small team of BRIPAC personnel attended a specialized maintenance training course last year at Rheinmetall Expal’s plant in Albacete. Additionally, members of both the Second Paratrooper Battalion and the 'Príncipe' Infantry Regiment no. 3, part of the 'Galicia' VII Brigade, also underwent a two-week technical training course at the BRIPAC’s facilities, conducted by Rheinmetall Expal technicians. The 'Galicia' VII Brigade is currently leading the Spanish contingent within the Multinational Brigade Slovakia (MN BDE SVK), a deployment that replaced the BRIPAC’s participation. In this multinational context, a support fires section equipped with the veteran Soltam Cardom mortar system, produced by the Israeli company Elbit, is deployed. This system also utilizes the VAMTAC ST5 as its mobile platform, which is planned to be replaced in the future by the EIMOS system. At the end of 2023, the Spanish Army’s Logistic Support Command (MALE) signed a contract with Rheinmetall Expal Systems for the acquisition of an initial batch of EIMOS mortars, valued at €8.2 million (approximately €10 million including VAT). The system is one of the fundamental components of the Army’s modernization, having been selected, evaluated, and tested within the framework of the 'Fuerza 35' project. This experimental unit, reporting to the 'Alfonso XII' Brigade no. II of the Spanish Legion has also received its share of the first batch of EIMOS mortars. The EIMOS is a solution developed by Expal (now part of Rheinmetall Expal Munitions) to fulfill a research and development program launched by Spain’s Ministry of Defence. It is designed to meet the needs of the Spanish Army and Navy (Marine Infantry) and provide a modern self-propelled mortar system. One of the most remarkable features of the EIMOS system is its fully automated firing control and 360º aiming capability, allowing for precise firing without requiring the vehicle to change its position or orientation. This advanced functionality enhances the 'shoot and scoot' tactic—firing support shots and quickly relocating to avoid counter-battery fire. The choice of the VAMTAC ST5, the Spanish military’s standard 4x4 armored platform, ensures seamless integration of the EIMOS system, especially for logistical support and maintenance. This is a key advantage for international deployments, such as Spain’s current involvement in Slovakia. Traditionally, most of the Spanish Army’s mortars require fixed emplacement, with entry and exit times that can limit the responsiveness of fire support operations. The EIMOS, however, allows for highly accurate firing on the move, eliminating the need for hydraulic mounts for stabilization during firing. Thus, compared to systems like the Soltam Cardom, positioning times are reduced. Positioning and firing calculations are fully automated via the TALOS Command and Control System, which is also used by the Spanish Army’s field artillery units, ensuring interoperability across different platforms and enhancing operational efficiency. The EIMOS system represents a major leap in the Spanish Army’s mortar capabilities, offering increased mobility, precision, and operational flexibility.

Facing financial and industrial difficulties, the A400M program may find a significant opportunity through a potential Polish order, offering renewed export prospects for this strategic aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link An A400M AAR refuels two Eurofighter of 73 Tactical Air Force Wing equipped with Guided Bomb Unit (Picture source: Bundeswehr) In 2010, the A400M program, already encountering significant challenges, was saved through an agreement between Airbus and its seven main client nations: France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Turkey. These nations provided an additional €3.5 billion in funding, partly in the form of repayable advances contingent upon future exports. At the time, Airbus had high ambitions, aiming to sell between 400 and 500 A400M aircraft. However, fifteen years later, the results are modest, with only two export contracts secured: two aircraft for Kazakhstan and another two for Indonesia, which also holds an option for four more units. National decisions to reduce orders have further impacted production outlooks. In both Spain and France, initial commitments have been scaled back. According to France's 2024-2035 military programming law, the French Air and Space Force is now expected to receive 35 aircraft by 2035, well below the originally planned 50 units. Despite this, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu has reaffirmed the strategic importance of the A400M for French forces, while emphasizing the need to secure new export contracts to ensure the program’s economic viability and maintain the production chain. The Airbus A400M is a versatile military transport aircraft designed by Airbus Military to meet the tactical and strategic needs of modern armed forces. Equipped with four Europrop TP400-D6 turboprop engines, it can carry up to 32 tons of equipment, heavy machinery, or armored vehicles over distances of 2,300 nautical miles at a maximum speed of 780 km/h. Its adaptable cargo bay can accommodate up to 108 paratroopers, helicopters, or a mix of troops and cargo, while its onboard systems enable autonomous operations, even on short or rough airstrips. The aircraft can also undertake missions such as medical evacuation, aerial refueling, and transport in crisis zones. The A400M incorporates advanced technologies, including a night-vision-compatible glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and modern defensive aids such as radar and infrared detectors, electronic countermeasures, and flare dispensers. Its robust and innovative design, including composite wings and woven-fiber propellers, makes it more efficient and reliable than its predecessors. Capable of operating at low altitudes or up to 11,300 meters, it offers flexibility, performance, and reduced operating costs, meeting the demands of both military and humanitarian missions. Despite these recognized capabilities, the A400M has struggled to attract new clients in Europe, where countries like the Netherlands and Sweden have opted for Embraer's C-390 Millennium to modernize their aging C-130 Hercules fleets. In this context, Poland presents a significant opportunity for Airbus. The country, seeking to replace its second-hand C-130E/H aircraft acquired from the United States, has been identified by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius as a potential client. During a visit to Airbus's Bremen facility, which produces the A400M’s fuselage, Pistorius confirmed a 'very specific interest' from Poland and noted that discussions are ongoing. Reports suggest that the Polish Air Force could consider acquiring ten aircraft. However, the A400M program faces substantial challenges. German labor unions warn that production could cease as early as 2027 or 2028 if no strategic decisions are made. This outlook raises concerns, particularly for workers at the Bremen facility, a key site in the aircraft's manufacturing process. Following Pistorius's visit, A400M program director Gerd Weber emphasized the critical situation. While Germany, as the largest operator with 53 aircraft, has met its contractual obligations, export orders remain insufficient to offset reduced purchases from historical clients such as Spain and France. This situation has also highlighted tensions over the distribution of production value. According to observers cited by Hartpunkt, it is problematic that France and Spain retain equivalent shares in production despite their reduced orders, as this contradicts the usual European practice of proportional value distribution in defense projects. In response, German unions have proposed relocating the A400M’s final assembly line from Seville to Bremen, adding to the existing challenges among European partners. Amid this uncertain environment, Airbus and its partner nations are intensifying efforts to promote the A400M internationally. German Defense Minister Pistorius has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to supporting the export of this strategic aircraft, while negotiations with Poland offer a potential lifeline for the program. Nonetheless, the A400M’s future depends on swift decisions and strengthened cooperation among stakeholders to overcome the economic and industrial challenges threatening its continuity. Poland’s interest in the A400M represents a significant opportunity for Airbus in the context of declining orders and uncertainties about production sustainability. However, the situation remains critical, requiring urgent action to safeguard this emblem of European aeronautical industry—one that embodies shared technological ambitions yet faces the realities of global markets and shifting national priorities.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/polands-interest-in-airbus-a400m-revives-export-prospects-for-european-transport-aircraft	2025-01-27T00:32:08-08:00

This support is crucial as Israel continues to confront a complex battlefield, where Hamas has built a vast network of tunnels and underground facilities in densely populated areas. While critics argue that the MK-84’s destructive power can lead to heavy civilian casualties, proponents stress its utility against Hamas’s fortified positions. The bombs’ ability to target hardened structures such as tunnels, weapon caches, and command centers provides the Israeli military with a critical advantage in neutralizing Hamas’s infrastructure. The MK-84 bomb is a versatile weapon that can be deployed by several different aircraft platforms, making it an asset in joint operations across various theaters of war. It is typically dropped by aircraft equipped with specialized bomb racks, and it is compatible with a wide range of combat aircraft, including the U.S. and Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighters, which are key components of the Israeli Air Force’s tactical capabilities. These aircraft are capable of delivering a wide range of ordinance, including the MK-84, with precision targeting systems, ensuring that the bombs are released with maximum effectiveness. Israel’s advanced F-35 stealth fighters are also capable of carrying and deploying the MK-84. With its advanced avionics and stealth capabilities, the F-35 can deliver this heavy ordinance with minimal risk of detection, making it particularly useful in high-stakes operations where stealth and surprise are paramount. Additionally, while the U.S. B-52 bomber, though not currently in active service with Israel, can also carry the MK-84, its use would likely be limited to larger, strategic bombing missions, as would be the case with the B-1B Lancer and B-2 Spirit bombers, which are also capable of deploying the MK-84. The MK-84 bomb shipment comes at a critical time as Israel continues its military operations in Gaza. Following the U.S. government's pause on foreign military sales, the shipment of these bombs signals a return to normalcy in defense aid. Throughout the Biden administration's tenure, the U.S. has sent a variety of munitions to Israel, including precision-guided munitions, bombs, and ammunition, to help bolster its defense against Hamas and other militant groups operating in the region. Notably, the Biden administration has faced internal and external pressures regarding the continued supply of weapons to Israel, particularly due to concerns over civilian casualties. However, U.S. officials have justified their support by emphasizing the need to ensure Israel’s right to self-defense and its ability to combat threats posed by Hamas. While the MK-84 bomb remains one of the most powerful and destructive bombs in the U.S. arsenal, its role in modern warfare is balanced by its potential for collateral damage. As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, the use of such heavy ordnance in urban environments will likely remain a contentious issue, but its effectiveness in striking heavily fortified targets in Gaza ensures its continued presence in Israel’s military inventory. With the resumption of bomb shipments, the U.S. is reinforcing its strategic partnership with Israel as both nations work to address the ongoing security threats in the Middle East.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-us-greenlights-mk-84-bombs-for-israel-despite-us-president-donald-trumps-military-sales-pause	2025-01-26T07:34:47-08:00

Breaking News: Iran Demonstrates Fajr-5 Rocket Launcher for Sea Mine Laying Threatening Global Maritime Security	On January 25, 2025, Iranian state television unveiled a striking new tactic the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) employed during their naval exercises: using the Fajr-5 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) to lay sea mines. This novel application of Iran’s well-known artillery rocket system raised eyebrows within military circles, as it introduces a highly efficient method of deploying sea mines over a broad area at long distances. Traditionally, sea mines have been deployed using specialized naval vessels or aircraft. Still, Iran’s adaptation of the Fajr-5 MLRS to deliver mines offers an innovative approach that could have profound implications for both regional and global maritime security.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Fajr-5 Multiple Launch Rocket System MLRS in Action: Iranian forces demonstrate the deployment of sea mines during a naval exercise, showcasing a new capability for maritime security threats. (Picture source: Iranian TV) The Fajr-5 MLRS is an Iranian-made, medium-range multiple launch rocket system designed to deliver large-scale artillery rocket fire over significant distances. It is part of Iran’s efforts to bolster its conventional artillery and missile capabilities, offering a cost-effective yet powerful means of conducting bombardment operations. Typically, the Fajr-5 is mounted on a truck-based platform, making it highly mobile and capable of rapid deployment in a variety of terrain. The system is capable of firing rockets that range from 80 to 100 kilometers, depending on the specific variant. These rockets can carry a variety of payloads, including high-explosive fragmentation, anti-personnel, and, as seen in recent exercises, sea mines. The Fajr-5’s launch platform is designed to fire multiple rockets in quick succession, delivering a saturation effect to overwhelm targets over a wide area. The flexibility and mobility of the Fajr-5 make it particularly useful in asymmetric warfare, allowing Iran to strike high-value targets while remaining elusive quickly. Additionally, the system has been adapted for use in several theaters of conflict, reflecting its versatility and importance in Iran’s military doctrine. While it has conventional uses in targeting ground forces and infrastructure, the recent demonstration of its ability to lay sea mines marks a notable evolution in its tactical application. The recent Iranian naval exercise showcased the Fajr-5 launching several rockets, each carrying sea mines designed to disrupt naval operations and commercial shipping. This marks a significant shift in Iran’s naval strategy, adding a new layer to its already sophisticated array of asymmetric tactics. Using MLRS to lay mines allows for a highly mobile and effective means of creating minefields, without relying on more detectable or vulnerable platforms like dedicated mine-laying ships. The ability to rapidly deploy mines over a large area with the Fajr-5 makes this method a powerful tool for disrupting naval traffic, particularly in regions like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a vital passage for global oil shipments. Sea mines, in general, have long been a weapon of choice in asymmetric warfare. They are particularly effective in chokepoints or high-traffic maritime areas where they can significantly hinder the movement of enemy naval forces or commercial shipping. By using a rocket artillery system to deploy these mines, Iran has found a way to enhance its capacity for maritime denial, particularly in critical corridors like the Strait of Hormuz or the Bab-el-Mandeb. Given the importance of these waterways in global energy transit, the ability to use rockets to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines could have disastrous economic and geopolitical consequences. Iran’s development of this capability is not entirely unprecedented, though it is relatively unique. Countries like Russia have also employed artillery-based systems for laying mines. Russia’s Zemledeliye system, for instance, uses rocket artillery to deploy mines in both land and sea environments. This method allows for the rapid establishment of minefields and can be employed to target both land forces and maritime vessels. Such systems have become increasingly important in modern warfare, particularly for nations and militias that lack the resources to compete with superior naval powers directly. The concept of using missile-launched sea mines is gaining traction in many parts of the world, with countries like North Korea and Ukraine also having explored similar methods to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries. Despite this, Iran's application of the Fajr-5 to lay sea mines is particularly significant due to the strategic context in which it is deployed. The ability to lay mines using MLRS systems can significantly alter the balance of power in maritime regions, particularly in the Middle East. For instance, if Iran’s MLRS capabilities were to be shared with proxy groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthi rebels in Yemen, these groups could gain access to a highly effective method of disrupting the flow of global energy. In fact, it is precisely in these contested regions that the tactical advantage of laying mines without the need for traditional naval assets becomes most apparent. Groups that might otherwise be unable to challenge the naval might of Western powers could employ such systems to effectively cut off vital maritime routes, creating uncertainty and economic disruption on a global scale. The use of the Fajr-5 MLRS for laying sea mines underscores the broader strategic shift towards asymmetric warfare in which countries and non-state actors are increasingly relying on low-cost, high-impact tactics to undermine superior military forces. This tactic, while not entirely unique, adds to the growing trend of countries and factions leveraging missile systems in unconventional ways to achieve tactical goals. For Iran, which is already well-versed in asymmetric naval tactics, the ability to rapidly and covertly lay sea mines enhances its power projection in strategic maritime regions. The global ramifications of this new development could be far-reaching. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil supply passes, could become a highly contested zone. The ability to rapidly lay sea mines in such areas could give Iran—or any actor equipped with similar technology—substantial leverage over global shipping and energy flows. In times of conflict, such minefields could cripple naval operations, halt commercial shipping, and disrupt the global economy. As tensions in the region continue to simmer, this new capability becomes a tool of naval denial, forcing adversaries to reconsider their strategies in regions where free passage has traditionally been guaranteed. Iran’s recent demonstration of using the Fajr-5 MLRS to lay sea mines represents a game-changing development in modern naval tactics. While missile-based mine-laying is not entirely new, the use of the Fajr-5 system for this purpose adds a new layer of asymmetric warfare to Iran’s already extensive military playbook. The potential for other nations or proxy groups to adopt similar strategies raises serious questions about the future of maritime security, particularly in regions vital to global trade and energy. As more nations and militant groups gain access to such technologies, the world may see an increasing number of missile-laid minefields, which could reshape the landscape of modern naval warfare.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-demonstrates-fajr-5-rocket-launcher-for-sea-mine-laying-threatening-global-maritime-security	2025-01-26T02:05:03-08:00	
Exclusive: US Navy USS Lyndon B. Johnson Destroyer to Integrate Hypersonic Missiles Enhancing Modern Naval Warfare	The U.S. Navy's USS Zumwalt class destroyer is poised for a major leap in combat capabilities with the integration of hypersonic missile systems. According to a recent report from Interesting Engineer, the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, a ship within the Zumwalt-class, is set to undergo rigorous testing as the first at-sea platform equipped with the next-generation hypersonic missile system. This significant milestone underscores the Navy’s ongoing modernization efforts and its commitment to fielding cutting-edge technology. The integration of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapon system, a key component of the U.S. military’s hypersonic capabilities, will position the Zumwalt-class as a formidable force in future naval combat.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The USS Lyndon B. Johnson Zumwalt-class destroyer undergoes significant modernization, with the two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems replaced by hypersonic missile launchers, enhancing its offensive capabilities for long-range precision strikes. (Picture source: Wikimedia) The Zumwalt class is a series of advanced guided-missile destroyers designed with versatility in mind. These ships are built to handle various missions, from precision strikes to air and missile defense. Recognized for their stealthy appearance, Zumwalt-class ships feature a reduced radar cross-section, which allows them to operate covertly and evade detection in hostile environments. The class is equipped with advanced technologies, such as an integrated power system, a highly efficient hull shape, and the capacity to deploy both conventional and sophisticated weaponry. Initially intended to be equipped with a 155mm Advanced Gun System (AGS) for shore bombardment, the Zumwalt-class ships have undergone significant modifications to suit modern naval warfare needs better. These changes have transformed the ships into highly adaptable platforms capable of housing more advanced weapon systems. Hypersonic missiles represent a transformative shift in naval warfare, and their inclusion in Zumwalt-class destroyers will significantly enhance the offensive capabilities of the fleet. Hypersonic weapons are defined as projectiles that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5—five times the speed of sound. This extreme velocity, combined with their maneuverability, makes hypersonic missiles incredibly difficult for traditional missile defense systems to intercept. As such, they offer a significant advantage over conventional missiles. In the context of naval warfare, hypersonic missiles bring several strategic benefits. First, their high speed drastically reduces the reaction time available to enemy defense systems, making it more difficult for adversaries to mount an effective countermeasure. Hypersonic missiles are also highly maneuverable during flight, enabling them to adjust their trajectories unpredictably, further complicating interception efforts. Additionally, these missiles are capable of long-range precision strikes, allowing naval forces to target critical assets from distances well beyond the reach of conventional weapons. The CPS system, for example, is designed to strike targets over 1,000 nautical miles away, which is ideal for engaging adversary targets in highly contested regions without the need for close proximity. The speed and unpredictability of hypersonic missiles also allow for surprise attacks, overwhelming enemy defenses before they can react. The transformation of the Zumwalt class destroyer to accommodate hypersonic missile systems began in 2023, marking a pivotal step in the Navy’s strategic shift. The first phase of this modernization involved removing the ship's original 155mm AGS, which had proven to be ineffective for modern operational needs. In its place, four vertical launch system (VLS) missile tubes were installed. Each VLS tube is capable of launching three hypersonic missiles, providing the Zumwalt class with the ability to carry up to 12 of these advanced munitions. This redesign required substantial modifications, including reconfiguring the ship’s bow to house the new missile tubes and integrating systems that can support hypersonic launches. Despite these changes, the ship’s rear gun mount, equipped with an auto-loading system, remains intact, preserving its multi-role combat flexibility. The inclusion of hypersonic missiles positions the Zumwalt class as a dominant offensive platform. According to Captain Lawler, the integration of the CPS weapon system makes the Zumwalt-class destroyer the 'foremost offensive surface combatant,' capable of delivering long-range precision strikes against high-value targets in future naval operations. With these enhancements, the Zumwalt class will play a crucial role in the Navy's ability to project power in maritime theaters, capable of striking strategic targets with unmatched speed and accuracy. The comparison between hypersonic and conventional missiles reveals significant advantages for the former. Conventional missiles, such as cruise or ballistic missiles, typically travel at subsonic or supersonic speeds, giving adversaries ample time to detect and intercept them. In contrast, hypersonic missiles' extreme speed makes them far more challenging to counter. Furthermore, conventional missiles tend to follow more predictable ballistic paths, making them easier to track. Hypersonic missiles, however, can alter their trajectory mid-flight, allowing them to avoid interception and penetrate even the most sophisticated missile defense systems, such as Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense or THAAD. The operational profile of the Zumwalt-class destroyer will be radically altered with the addition of hypersonic missiles. While traditional missile-equipped destroyers focus on anti-air warfare or strike missions, Zumwalt-class destroyers equipped with hypersonic weapons will be able to conduct precision strikes at far greater ranges, providing a near-guaranteed success rate against high-priority, time-sensitive targets. The ability to deliver powerful blows from such a distance offers a level of flexibility and survivability that was previously unattainable with conventional systems. With the integration of hypersonic missile systems, Zumwalt-class destroyers, especially the USS Lyndon B. Johnson, are set to become an essential part of the U.S. Navy's future combat strategy.

India’s Submarine Revolution: German-Indian Collaboration Brings AIP to Navy	According to information published by Reuters on January 23, 2025, the German-Indian joint venture led by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender for India's ambitious $5 billion Project-75(I) submarine program.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link German built Type 214 submarine. (Picture source: TKMS) India’s Project-75(I) is one of the most ambitious and long-awaited defense acquisition programs, aimed at revitalizing the country’s submarine fleet to counter growing threats in the Indian Ocean region. With a budget of $5 billion, the program seeks to procure six next-generation diesel-electric attack submarines equipped with cutting-edge technologies, including air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. Following a rigorous evaluation process, the joint venture between German shipbuilder ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and India’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) has emerged as the sole contender, after the Spanish consortium of Navantia and Larsen &amp; Toubro (L&amp;T) failed to meet critical requirements. The program was envisioned as an extension of the original Project-75, under which MDL collaborated with French company Naval Group to produce six Scorpène-class submarines. These submarines, while a significant leap forward at the time, lack AIP technology, which is now critical for modern naval operations. The objective of Project-75(I) is to develop a new class of conventional submarines that can stay submerged for extended periods, enhance stealth capabilities, and feature cutting-edge weapons and sensor systems. Despite its urgency, the project has faced delays spanning more than a decade due to procurement hurdles, technological complexities, and debates over the degree of technology transfer required under the 'Make in India' initiative. TKMS brings to the table its highly advanced Type 214 submarine, a proven platform that has been adopted by navies in Germany, Greece, South Korea, and Turkey. The Type 214 features an advanced hydrogen fuel cell-based AIP system, which enables the submarine to remain submerged for up to two weeks without surfacing. This system operates silently, significantly reducing the submarine’s acoustic signature, a critical factor in modern anti-submarine warfare. Navantia proposed a design based on its S-80 Plus submarine, which is still under development and has yet to achieve operational deployment. The S-80 Plus relies on a bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, which converts bio-ethanol into hydrogen for powering fuel cells. While innovative, this system has not been field-proven to the extent of TKMS's AIP technology. Moreover, Navantia’s design faced setbacks in the past, including issues with buoyancy calculations that delayed Spain’s own submarine program. These technical challenges may have undermined confidence in their ability to meet the Indian Navy’s rigorous specifications. In terms of industrial partnership, Larsen &amp; Toubro is a leading Indian defense company with significant expertise in shipbuilding and engineering. However, its collaboration with Navantia was relatively nascent compared to the established relationship between TKMS and MDL, which had successfully navigated previous submarine-building challenges under Project-75. The centerpiece of the competition was the AIP system, a transformative technology for diesel-electric submarines. Conventional submarines without AIP must surface or use a snorkel to recharge their batteries, making them vulnerable to detection. AIP systems, by contrast, allow prolonged underwater endurance and enhanced stealth. The hydrogen fuel cell system used by TKMS is regarded as one of the most mature and efficient AIP technologies available. It operates silently, generates no vibrations, and produces minimal heat, making detection by thermal and acoustic sensors difficult. Navantia’s bio-ethanol reformer-based AIP system, while innovative, introduces potential complexities in fuel management and system integration. Its unproven track record compared unfavorably to TKMS’s operationally validated system, which has seen years of deployment and performance refinement. Both contenders proposed submarines capable of carrying heavyweight torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, and land-attack cruise missiles. TKMS’s Type 214 is already compatible with a range of munitions, including the DM2A4 SeaHake torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The S-80 Plus, while theoretically offering similar versatility, is still undergoing integration testing for many of these systems. On the sensor front, both designs emphasized advanced sonar suites, electronic warfare capabilities, and integrated combat management systems. However, TKMS’s submarines benefit from operational feedback from multiple navies, whereas the S-80 Plus remains in developmental stages. With a rapidly aging fleet and increasing threats from China's expanding submarine force and Pakistan’s AIP-equipped Agosta-class submarines, the Indian Navy urgently requires these advanced platforms. Selecting a proven design like the Type 214 minimizes developmental risks and ensures timely delivery. If negotiations proceed as planned, the first submarine from Project-75(I) could enter service within three to five years.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/indias-submarine-revolution-german-indian-collaboration-brings-aip-to-navy	2025-01-24T07:02:18-08:00

British Intelligence Reveals Strategic Partnership Between Russia and Iran Despite Persistent Tensions	On January 23, 2025, British Intelligence disclosed details of a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement signed between Russia and Iran on January 17. This 20-year agreement, formalized by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Massoud Pezeshkian, highlights the two nations' intention to strengthen bilateral relations in an increasingly tense geopolitical context. However, despite its scope, the partnership remains constrained by mutual distrust and underlying tensions, casting doubt on its potential to significantly enhance cooperation between the two countries. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The recently signed 20-year agreement extends this partnership to encompass a broader range of strategic sectors, including defense, security, trade, energy, technology, and transportation (Picture source: Russian MoD) According to British Intelligence reports, the alliance between Russia and Iran is primarily rooted in shared security and economic interests, which have become increasingly aligned since Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Iran has emerged as a crucial partner for Moscow in its military campaign, providing significant support through the supply of Shahed-136 drones. These drones, often referred to as 'kamikaze drones' due to their self-destructive nature upon impact, have been widely used by Russia to target Ukrainian infrastructure, including energy facilities and urban centers. Their tactical value lies in their ability to conduct long-range strikes with precision at a relatively low cost, giving Russia a means to sustain its offensive operations despite international sanctions and resource constraints. Beyond drones, Iran has also supplied Russia with weapons and ammunition, addressing critical shortages in Moscow's arsenal caused by prolonged conflict and the impact of Western economic measures. In exchange, Russia has provided Iran with substantial military and technological support, aimed at modernizing the latter's defense capabilities. This includes the transfer of advanced air defense systems, such as the S-300, which have bolstered Iran's ability to protect its airspace against potential threats. Additionally, Russia has shared expertise in other areas of military technology, including cybersecurity. Reports indicate an increase in technical cooperation between the two nations, with Russia assisting Iran in fortifying its digital infrastructure to better resist cyberattacks, particularly those originating from Western nations. This exchange of resources and knowledge underscores the depth of their military collaboration, with both nations leveraging their strengths to address mutual vulnerabilities. The recently signed 20-year agreement extends this partnership to encompass a broader range of strategic sectors, including defense, security, trade, energy, technology, and transportation. However, a notable omission in the agreement is a mutual defense clause, which differentiates it from Russia's agreements with other allies such as North Korea and Belarus. This absence highlights the underlying mistrust that continues to define the relationship between Moscow and Tehran. Despite their collaboration, the two nations have a complex history of competing regional ambitions and divergent priorities on the global stage, which have prevented a fully integrated alliance. While the agreement establishes a legal framework for formalizing and potentially expanding their cooperation, its practical impact appears limited. On one hand, Russia remains heavily reliant on Iranian military support to sustain its operations in Ukraine, as it continues to face international isolation and resource depletion. On the other hand, Iran benefits from Russian military technology and expertise to modernize its defense infrastructure and strengthen its position in the region. However, analysts from British Intelligence emphasize that structural obstacles, including mutual suspicion and differing strategic goals, are likely to hinder any significant enhancement of their partnership. As a result, the collaboration between Russia and Iran is seen as pragmatic rather than transformative, driven by immediate necessities rather than a long-term alignment of interests. In summary, the agreement between Russia and Iran reflects an effort to deepen an already well-established relationship, particularly in the defense sector. However, the challenges identified by British Intelligence underscore the fragile and limited nature of this alliance. While the accord provides a mechanism for formalizing cooperation, its ability to overcome mutual distrust and geopolitical tensions remains uncertain. This development exemplifies a partnership shaped more by necessity than by mutual confidence, reflecting the complex dynamics of two nations navigating a hostile international environment.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/british-intelligence-reveals-strategic-partnership-between-russia-and-iran-despite-persistent-tensions	2025-01-24T00:48:38-08:00

It is used to target high-value land targets, such as enemy command centers, missile sites, and critical infrastructure. The Tomahawk’s accuracy and ability to strike from long distances make it an ideal tool for projecting U.S. military power and engaging adversaries without the need for manned aircraft or carrier strike groups. Its long range also positions it as a critical asset in regions like the South China Sea, where the U.S. must maintain a credible deterrence against China’s growing military presence. The redeployment of the MRC Typhon missile launcher system to Luzon is part of a broader effort by the U.S. military to refine its approach to force projection in the Indo-Pacific. According to the Philippine government source, the redeployment's primary goal is to assess how quickly and efficiently the missile batteries can be moved to new positions. Such flexibility is critical in an environment where rapid repositioning can increase the survivability of military assets during a potential conflict. The move also reflects the U.S. military's commitment to ensuring that its missile systems can be quickly repositioned across the region, making them harder to target and increasing their overall effectiveness in the face of emerging threats. The Typhon missile system was first deployed in the Philippines in April 2024 during a training exercise, a move that drew strong criticism from China. The Chinese government condemned the deployment, viewing it as an escalation of U.S. military presence in the region and a direct challenge to China's growing influence, particularly in the South China Sea. In response, Beijing reiterated its concerns about the militarization of the region, accusing the U.S. of exacerbating tensions and undermining regional stability. However, the U.S. maintains that the deployment of these advanced missile systems is a necessary countermeasure to China's increasing military assertiveness, particularly its ongoing efforts to establish control over disputed territories in the South China Sea and its growing missile capabilities. The MRC Typhon missile launcher system's combination of the SM-6 and Tomahawk provides the U.S. with a potent mix of defense and offense. The SM-6 enhances the U.S. Navy’s capability to defend against aerial threats at extended ranges, while the Tomahawk provides a means to strike enemy targets far beyond the reach of most conventional systems. This combination gives the U.S. military a powerful deterrent in the region, especially in scenarios involving anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) systems, which are central to China's defense strategy. The ability to engage air and ground targets from a land-based position extends the reach of U.S. forces and complements existing naval and air assets, enabling a more flexible and layered defense posture. The U.S. military's ongoing presence in the Philippines, with the deployment of advanced systems like Typhon, is also indicative of the deepening U.S.-Philippine security cooperation. The Philippines, which has territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, benefits from the presence of U.S. missile systems that can protect its sovereignty and ensure regional stability. The Typhon’s ability to operate from Philippine territory allows the U.S. to project power while also strengthening the defensive capabilities of its ally in the region. Furthermore, the mobility of the Typhon system ensures that U.S. forces can respond swiftly to any escalation in the region, maintaining a strong deterrent presence against potential adversaries. The redeployment of Typhon to Luzon is also a strategic measure to refine the U.S. military’s overall posture in the Indo-Pacific. The ability to quickly reposition key missile assets in the region provides the U.S. with greater flexibility and operational readiness. In the event of a crisis, this capacity for rapid relocation makes U.S. missile systems less vulnerable to preemptive strikes and ensures that they can continue to operate effectively across a vast and contested region. This increased mobility also enhances the system’s survivability, which is essential in the event of a conflict with a peer competitor like China. The redeployment of the MRC Typhon missile launcher system to Luzon enhances the U.S. military’s ability to project power, defend allies, and deter potential adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region. By combining the defensive capabilities of the SM-6 with the long-range precision strike power of the Tomahawk, the Typhon system provides a highly flexible and capable tool for responding to threats in a region marked by growing geopolitical tension. The U.S. military's focus on mobility, survivability, and strategic flexibility in its missile systems ensures that it can maintain a credible deterrent against China and other regional challengers, while strengthening its defense commitments to allies like the Philippines. As tensions in the South China Sea and surrounding areas continue to rise, the Typhon missile system is poised to play a pivotal role in the U.S. military's efforts to maintain regional stability and safeguard its interests in the Indo-Pacific.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/breaking-news-us-redeploys-mrc-typhon-surface-to-surface-missile-launchers-in-philippines-to-test-rapid-mobility	2025-01-23T07:47:26-08:00

Flash News: US Navy Arleigh Burke destroyer USS Spruance scores impressive missiles & UAVs downs in Red Sea Battle	According to information published by the US DoD on January 18, 2025, the USS Spruance (DDG-111), an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, emerged from a recent engagement in the Red Sea bearing thirteen new mission marks. These marks signify a successful defense against a diverse and complex array of threats, underscoring the ship's readiness and its crew's proficiency in operating naval systems.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link USS Spruance (DDG-111) returns to port bearing 13 mission marks after successfully intercepting ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs in a high-stakes engagement against Houthi forces in the Red Sea. (Picture source: US DoD) At the core of the USS Spruance’s defense is the Aegis Combat System, a fully integrated combat management system designed to process vast amounts of sensor data and coordinate the ship’s weapons to neutralize diverse threats. The Aegis system is centered around the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar and the ship’s command and control suite, which collectively provide rapid detection, tracking, and engagement across multiple domains. The AN/SPY-1D(V) radar is a high-power, multi-function phased-array radar that operates in the S-band frequency range. It is capable of detecting and tracking hundreds of targets simultaneously, including low-observable threats such as sea-skimming cruise missiles and high-altitude ballistic missiles. The radar’s phased-array technology eliminates the need for moving parts, allowing it to maintain constant surveillance over its area of coverage. During the engagement, this radar was responsible for detecting inbound threats at their maximum range, providing critical early-warning data. Once threats were detected, the Aegis Command and Decision Suite processed the data and classified the targets based on their threat level. The system’s real-time processing capability enables rapid assignment of weapons to targets, prioritizing engagements based on speed, proximity, and lethality. This ensures that the ship’s defenses are neither overwhelmed nor misallocated during a multi-vector attack. The interception of three anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) by the USS Spruance represents a significant technological achievement. Ballistic missiles follow a high-arcing trajectory and typically re-enter the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often exceeding Mach 5. These characteristics make them extremely challenging targets, requiring precise timing and advanced intercept technology. The Aegis BMD system, an upgraded component of the ship’s combat suite, provides the capability to track and intercept ballistic missiles during their midcourse or terminal phase. When the AN/SPY-1D(V) radar detected the inbound ASBMs, the Aegis system calculated their trajectory, speed, and re-entry path. This data was shared with regional and space-based sensors through the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), creating a unified threat picture. To neutralize the ASBMs, the Spruance likely launched Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors from its Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS). The SM-3 is a hit-to-kill interceptor designed specifically for ballistic missile engagements. It uses a multi-stage booster to achieve high velocity and deploys a kinetic kill vehicle (KKV) in the missile’s terminal phase. The KKV does not carry an explosive warhead; instead, it relies on sheer kinetic energy to destroy the target by colliding with it at high speed. For terminal-phase threats closer to the ship, the Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) could have been employed. The SM-6 is a dual-role missile capable of intercepting both ballistic and air-breathing threats, such as cruise missiles, at extended ranges. Its active radar seeker and advanced guidance system make it particularly effective in dealing with maneuvering re-entry vehicles (RVs). The interception of three anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) further illustrates the Spruance’s layered defensive architecture. Cruise missiles, which fly at low altitudes and often use terrain-following radar to evade detection, are designed to overwhelm shipboard defenses with speed and maneuverability. The SPY-1D(V) radar played a pivotal role in detecting these missiles despite their low-altitude flight paths and potentially stealthy designs. Upon detection, the Aegis system assigned Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) interceptors for mid-range engagements. The SM-2 employs semi-active radar homing, guided by the ship’s radar, to track and intercept the target. Its dual-thrust rocket motor provides the necessary speed and range to engage cruise missiles before they reach their terminal phase. For threats that penetrated closer to the ship, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) likely came into play. The ESSM is designed for point defense and is capable of engaging highly maneuverable targets at short ranges. Its active radar seeker provides high accuracy, while its advanced control surfaces enable rapid course adjustments to counter evasive maneuvers. Additionally, the ship’s Mk 99 Fire Control System directed the engagement, ensuring precise guidance of each interceptor. This system uses radar illuminators to 'paint' the target, providing the SM-2 and ESSM with continuous updates on the target’s location and trajectory during flight. The successful interception of seven UAVs showcased the Spruance’s ability to counter the growing use of drones in asymmetric warfare. UAVs are often deployed in swarms to saturate defenses and are particularly challenging to detect due to their small radar cross-sections and erratic flight patterns. The ship’s Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) likely played a central role in UAV defense. The CIWS, commonly referred to as 'Phalanx,' is a 20mm Gatling gun mounted on a swiveling turret. It is radar-guided and designed for last-ditch defense against incoming threats. Operating at a rate of up to 4,500 rounds per minute, the CIWS can effectively destroy small, fast-moving targets like UAVs at ranges of 1-2 kilometers. Electronic warfare measures, such as the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), complemented kinetic defenses. SEWIP provides advanced electronic attack capabilities, allowing the ship to disrupt the command, control, and navigation systems of UAVs. By jamming communication links, SEWIP can render drones ineffective without expending munitions. The Mk 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) on the USS Spruance provides the foundation for its multi-mission flexibility. With 96 launch cells, the ship can carry a mix of interceptors, land-attack missiles, and anti-submarine weapons, tailored to mission requirements. The VLS uses a 'hot launch' system, where missiles are ignited within the cell and expelled upward through a hatch. This system allows for rapid, sequential launches, ensuring the ship can respond to high-intensity engagements like the one in the Red Sea. The ability to switch seamlessly between different types of munitions—such as SM-2 for air defense, SM-3 for ballistic missile defense, and ESSM for point defense—gives the Spruance unmatched tactical flexibility.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-news-us-navy-arleigh-burke-destroyer-uss-spruance-scores-impressive-missiles-uavs-downs-in-red-sea-battle	2025-01-23T03:50:54-08:00

Critical Undersea Infrastructure Defense: Finland Sends FNS Pori to NATO Mission	According to information published by NATO on January 22, 2025, Finland has taken a decisive step in enhancing NATO’s maritime operations by deploying the Hamina-class missile boat FNS Pori to join Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1) as part of the Baltic Sentry operation.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Finnish Navy's Hamina-class missile boat. (Picture source: Finnish MoD) The Baltic Sentry operation is a direct response to mounting security concerns in the region, particularly the protection of critical undersea infrastructure, such as pipelines and communication cables, that underpin European economies. Finland’s participation represents a significant enhancement of NATO’s operational capabilities in the Baltic, a maritime domain where both conventional and hybrid threats are becoming more frequent. The Baltic Sea’s security dynamics have undergone profound changes since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The region has become a hotspot for military activity, economic pressure, and covert operations. Incidents such as the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2022 underscored the vulnerabilities of undersea infrastructure and highlighted the need for comprehensive security measures. The FNS Pori, one of four Hamina-class missile boats in the Finnish Navy, is particularly suited for operations in the Baltic Sea. Unlike larger NATO vessels designed for deep-ocean engagements, the Pori is built for effectiveness in the shallow, congested, and strategically constrained waters of the Baltic. Its design reflects Finland’s decades of experience in defending its own 1,100-kilometer Baltic coastline. The Pori’s stealth capabilities give it an operational edge. Its reduced radar and infrared signatures allow it to operate undetected in environments where surveillance is high and threats are often unconventional. This stealth, combined with its speed and maneuverability, makes the Pori highly effective for coastal patrol, interdiction, and rapid-response missions.

Israel's Rafael upgrades its Trophy active protection system to counter kamikaze drones	During the Defence IQ International Armoured Vehicles (IAV) conference, held in Farnborough, UK, from January 21 to 23, 2025, the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defence Systems announced an upgrade to its Trophy Active Protection System (APS) to intercept drones. According to a company representative, the enhancement addresses challenges posed by low-altitude aerial threats, including commercially available drones, kamikaze drones, and larger fixed-wing UAVs. The upgrade, requiring software adjustments and minor hardware changes, is compatible with existing systems used by operators in the United States and Europe.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link By 2017, the Trophy APS had accumulated 50,000 operational hours since its introduction in 2011, showcasing its effectiveness in both low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) During testing, the upgraded Trophy system, mounted on a 30 mm turret, successfully intercepted a jet-powered fixed-wing drone classified between classes 2 and 3. The drone approached in a near-vertical dive. Rafael emphasized that these enhancements were achieved without altering the system’s core hardware. In addition to drone interception, Trophy has been updated based on operational experience, including lessons learned from conflicts in Gaza and northern Israel. These improvements address the system’s performance against short-range threats in urban environments and long-range threats such as ATGMs in open terrain. A representative of EuroTrophy—a joint venture between Rafael, GDELS, and KNDS to market Trophy in Europe—stated that the system has achieved high interception rates during conflicts. The venture is working to integrate Trophy onto platforms like the MGCS and ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles, as well as three European 8x8 armored vehicles. The representative noted that Trophy contributes to operational effectiveness by providing consistent vehicle protection, which is critical for mission continuity. They also highlighted the operational challenges commanders face when vehicle losses threaten the success of an operation. The Trophy APS, also known as 'Windbreaker,' was developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems in collaboration with Elta Systems to counter modern anti-armor threats such as ATGMs, RPGs, and other anti-tank weapons. Development began in the 1980s to enhance the survivability of armored vehicles in urban and open battlefields, with the system becoming operational in 2009 and achieving its first recorded interception in 2011. Variants have been developed for different vehicle weight classes, including Trophy HV for heavy vehicles, Trophy MV for medium vehicles, and Trophy LV for light vehicles. Trophy's functionality is based on the Elta EL/M-2133 fire-control radar, which uses four flat-panel antennas to provide 360-degree coverage. When detecting an incoming projectile, it calculates the approach vector, threat type, time to impact, and angle. Rotating launchers deploy Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs) in a precise pattern to neutralize threats at a safe distance. The system counters ATGMs, high-explosive anti-tank rounds, RPGs, and similar threats. It can engage multiple threats simultaneously on stationary and moving vehicles and integrates with C4I systems and remote-controlled weapons stations. Newer models feature automated reloading for consecutive engagements. By 2023, the production of the Trophy APS increased to 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month, as it has been deployed on tanks like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4, the American Abrams, the German Leopard 2A7A1 and 2A8, as well as the British Challenger 3. (Picture source: Rafael Advanced Defence Systems) The Trophy APS has been operational since 2011, demonstrating success in low- and high-intensity combat across urban, open, and forested environments. It has intercepted threats like Kornet ATGMs and RPG-29s. By 2017, Trophy accumulated 50,000 operational hours, and by 2023, production reached 40 units and 500 countermeasures per month. The radar system can share data with other vehicles, enabling improved threat coordination and targeting. It can identify whether a projectile will miss its target, withholding countermeasures and sharing data for tactical use. Reports suggest it offers protection against certain top-attack missiles and is used in Israel and the U.S. However, the Trophy APS has limitations. It cannot counter kinetic energy penetrators and is vulnerable to direct top-down attacks, as demonstrated in 2023 when drones dropped grenades on protected vehicles. Its weight, approximately 500 kilograms, may impact the performance of lighter vehicles. The use of EFPs poses risks to nearby infantry, complicating operations involving dismounted soldiers. Techniques such as rapid successive missile firings, ultra-close-range RPG attacks, and supersonic projectiles have exploited system weaknesses. Conflicts in 2023 and 2024 highlighted instances where the system was overwhelmed, with video evidence showing some failures. Rafael representatives emphasized that despite its new anti-drone capability, Trophy alone cannot provide comprehensive air defense against drones. They advocate a layered defense strategy incorporating mobility, lethality, and survivability, supported by technologies like lasers, electromagnetic spectrum control, and hard- and soft-kill systems. This approach aims to address the growing challenges posed by drones, including swarms and top-attack threats, which complicate operations for maneuver forces. Production of Trophy APS began in Israel in 2007 and in the U.S. in 2012, with a combined output of 40 systems and 500 countermeasures per month by 2023. Since 2010, it has been deployed on platforms like Israeli Merkava Mark 3 and 4 tanks, Namer APCs, and U.S. M1A2 Abrams tanks. It has been tested on Stryker APCs and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The lighter Trophy MV/VPS version was developed for medium and light vehicles, while the Trophy LV is designed for vehicles under 8 tons. It has been integrated into Germany's Leopard 2A7A1 tanks and is included in orders for the Leopard 2A8. The UK has signed contracts to evaluate it for Challenger 3 tanks. Other potential operators include Croatia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/israels-rafael-upgrades-its-trophy-active-protection-system-to-counter-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-23T01:47:31-08:00

This latest development reflects the UK’s intensified efforts to counter potential threats to undersea infrastructure, which is increasingly seen as a target of strategic importance. Yantar, known for its specialized surveillance capabilities, has been under scrutiny for its potential to interfere with critical assets such as undersea cables and pipelines.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Russian Project 22010-class intelligence ship and a Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset. (Picture source: UK MoD) This is not the first encounter between Yantar and British forces. Late last year, the vessel was observed lingering near key infrastructure in UK waters, prompting the Royal Navy to send a submarine to surface near Yantar and issue a pointed warning. Following that incident, the vessel left UK territory for the Mediterranean. Its return this week has reignited concerns over its intentions, leading to its close monitoring by the frigate HMS Somerset as it transited the Channel. The broader context for these developments is the rising tension over the security of offshore infrastructure across Europe. Undersea cables, which carry the vast majority of the world’s internet traffic, and pipelines, essential for energy supplies, have become focal points of geopolitical vulnerability. Recent damage to the Estlink2 undersea cable between Estonia and Finland has heightened these concerns, prompting NATO to launch new measures to protect these critical assets. The UK is playing a leading role in these efforts, deploying advanced capabilities to deter and monitor threats. As part of the NATO Baltic Sentry initiative, the UK is contributing advanced P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and Rivet Joint surveillance platforms. These assets are designed to bolster reconnaissance and response capabilities in regions where the risk to undersea infrastructure is particularly acute. At the heart of Britain’s response is a new AI-driven system known as Nordic Warden. This technology, recently activated, leverages real-time data from a variety of sources to track and analyze ship movements, assessing the potential risks posed by suspicious vessels. Nordic Warden has been specifically configured to monitor Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet,' a network of tankers used to evade sanctions by transporting oil and gas to international buyers. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy’s RFA Proteus, equipped with submersible drones, has been a critical component in safeguarding undersea assets. Proteus, which previously shadowed Yantar during its activities in UK waters, remains on the front lines of undersea surveillance and inspection, ensuring that cables and pipelines remain secure.

In terms of costs, the Typhoon presents significant advantages for the British economy. A purchase of 24 aircraft could sustain 26,000 jobs over two years across BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo, and the broader national supply chain. By comparison, a similar order for the F-35A would create only two to three months of work for approximately 2,000 workers in the UK. While the Typhoon directly supports local industry, the F-35A benefits from economies of scale due to its large-scale production, potentially offsetting its higher initial costs. However, the infrastructure required to maintain its stealth technology adds significant long-term expenses. The choice between the two aircraft depends on the UK’s strategic priorities. The Typhoon would support industrial autonomy and preserve national expertise while remaining a proven, versatile tool for diverse missions. Meanwhile, the F-35A, with its stealth and advanced capabilities, is better suited to modern conflicts involving contested environments. A hybrid solution combining both aircraft could offer a strategic balance, addressing immediate military needs while supporting the long-term viability of the national aerospace sector. Unite emphasizes the urgency of this decision. General Secretary Sharon Graham highlighted the importance of retaining the highly skilled engineers and technicians in the aerospace sector. She called on the government to invest in Typhoons to meet military and economic needs while ensuring continuity of expertise for future programs. Rhys McCarthy, Unite’s national defense officer, warned that neglecting the domestic defense industry in an increasingly unstable world would be irresponsible. He also stressed that the UK government cannot expect to sell Typhoons abroad if it does not demonstrate confidence in the product itself. The decision between the Typhoon and the F-35A represents a critical strategic choice for the UK. Beyond military considerations, it could redefine the future of the national aerospace industry while addressing global security challenges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/british-aerospace-industry-at-stake-with-choice-between-typhoon-and-f-35a-fighter-jets	2025-01-22T06:11:32-08:00

South Korea Develops Long-Range Interceptor to Counter North Korean Artillery Threats by 2028	On January 20, 2025, South Korea officially initiated the development of a domestically produced interception system comparable to Israel's Iron Dome. The project, overseen by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), aims to enhance South Korea's defense capabilities against the persistent threat of North Korean artillery. According to The Korea Times, this program marks a significant step in safeguarding critical military and civilian infrastructure, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area. Home to nearly 25 million people, this region is a key target for North Korea due to its high population density and economic importance. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The development of the LAMD system is also part of a broader vision to position South Korea as a leader in advanced defense technology (Picture source: DAPA) Known as the Low-Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system, the project is set to receive funding of 479.8 billion won (approximately $329 million) and is planned for completion by 2028. During a critical meeting on January 20, 2025, DAPA confirmed the involvement of the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) alongside leading South Korean defense companies, including LIG Nex1, Hanwha Aerospace, and Hanwha Systems. These industry partners will play a pivotal role in developing technology capable of intercepting multiple artillery rounds simultaneously, addressing the increasing threat posed by North Korea's long-range artillery. The concept of a domestic system akin to the Iron Dome was first announced in June 2021, when the South Korean government outlined plans to create a defense system valued at 2.89 trillion won ($2.6 billion). The initiative was designed to protect critical installations and densely populated areas from a large arsenal of North Korean artillery, estimated to include thousands of long-range systems capable of striking Seoul and its surroundings. In advancing the project, South Korea has expedited the deployment timeline for the LAMD system, initially planned for the next decade. The system is now expected to become operational between 2025 and 2028.

South Korea develops a land-based CIWS-II 30mm system to counter future North Korean kamikaze drones	As reported by the Korea Bizwire on January 20, 2025, South Korea has begun developing a land-based adaptation of its Close-In Weapon System (CIWS-II) to address North Korean threats, including artillery, drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) manages the project, building on the naval CIWS-II equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun and Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. For the land-based version, design changes include replacing the four-sided fixed AESA radar with a single-faced rotating radar to prioritize monitoring northern threats and reducing costs.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after several North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 incident when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. (Picture source: DAPA) A close-in weapon system (CIWS) is a point-defense weapon designed to detect and intercept short-range threats, such as incoming missiles and aircraft, that have penetrated outer defenses. Typically installed on naval ships, CIWS is standard on most large modern warships and has also been adapted for land-based applications. There are two main types: gun-based and missile-based. Gun-based CIWS, such as the American Phalanx, Dutch Goalkeeper, and Russian Kashtan systems, employ rotary or revolver cannons with radar and computer systems mounted on rotating turrets for automatic targeting. Missile-based CIWS, like the American RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile and Russian Pantsir system, use radar or infrared guidance to direct short-range missiles at close-range threats. The South Korean need for a land-based CIWS-II became evident after North Korean drone incursions, including the 2022 event when drones breached Seoul’s airspace. Existing ground-based systems, such as the K30 Biho, have struggled to detect and track small or low-flying threats. The new system aims to counter a range of threats, including long-range artillery, close-range ballistic missiles, short-range ballistic missiles, multiple rocket launchers, low-flying cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. It will use AESA radar and electro-optical tracking systems for improved detection and interception. Advanced Hit Efficiency And Destruction (AHEAD) ammunition, designed to release fragments upon detonation, will increase its effectiveness against drones and artillery shells. Cost-saving measures for the land-based adaptation include using a rotating AESA radar instead of the fixed version used on naval systems. The system is designed to counter specific threats such as kamikaze drones and missile swarms. Rep. Yoo Yong-won of the People Power Party emphasized the importance of deploying the system, citing North Korea’s advancements and their risks to Seoul and nearby areas. The US-made Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, serves as a notable example of a naval close-in weapon system modified for ground-based applications. (Picture source: US DoD) The U.S. Counter-Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (C-RAM) system, introduced in 2004 and deployed in Iraq by 2005, offers a comparable example. Based on the Phalanx CIWS, the C-RAM uses a 20mm M61A1 Gatling gun and Ku-band radar to protect forward operating bases from rockets and mortars. It employs high-explosive incendiary tracer self-destructing (HEIT-SD) ammunition to minimize collateral damage and successfully intercepted 105 attacks during its initial deployment. The C-RAM influenced South Korea’s approach to the CIWS-II program. Expected to reach initial capability by 2027, the CIWS-II project addresses limitations in foreign systems, such as the Dutch SGE-30 Goalkeeper and U.S. Phalanx, which have faced issues related to cost, maintenance, and operational capability. Dissatisfaction with reliance on external suppliers led to the decision to develop a domestic solution. In 2021, LIG Nex1 and Hanwha Systems competed for the CIWS-II contract, presenting models with AESA radar and electro-optical systems at MADEX 2021. LIG Nex1 was chosen for its expertise in radar, fire control, and maintenance, including its work with the Goalkeeper system. The project has a budget of 895.7 billion KRW (approximately $626,990,000) and will continue through 2036. The naval CIWS-II, equipped with a 30mm GAU-8 Gatling gun capable of high rates of fire, integrates AESA radars for detection and tracking. Its configuration includes four detection radars and one tracking radar, whereas the land-based variant may use a simplified setup to reduce costs. Electro-optical targeting enhances interception of drones, supersonic missiles, and other aerial threats. Future upgrades aim to enhance the system’s effectiveness against swarming drone attacks using AHEAD ammunition. Initial deployment will occur on Chungnam-class frigates, potentially serving as test platforms. The land-based version is expected to defend urban and strategic areas, including Seoul, addressing South Korea’s security challenges. However, gun-based CIWS systems have limitations, particularly in range and effectiveness. These systems typically have a maximum range of 5,000 meters, with real-world interception often occurring closer to 500 meters, increasing the risk of fragments or damaged threats causing harm. Additionally, their kill probability is limited, as direct hits may not neutralize threats entirely, especially with kinetic-energy-only projectiles. Missile-based CIWS mitigates some of these challenges by offering extended range and improved interception capabilities. Systems like the dual-role Kashtan and Pantsir combine guns and missiles for greater tactical flexibility.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/south-korea-develops-a-land-based-ciws-ii-30mm-system-to-counter-future-north-korean-kamikaze-drones	2025-01-22T04:57:40-08:00

Soldiers from both units requested drones that would be more versatile, durable, and, importantly, expendable—capabilities that existing systems often lacked. The new drones will be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, where the Division will field 100 custom-made sUAS units. 'We are able to print these systems at a fraction of the cost of traditional models, without sacrificing operational functionality,' said Capt. Andrew Blomquist, the 2nd Mobile Brigade Combat Team’s innovation officer. He emphasized the excitement within the Division to see these new, 3D-printed drones put to the test in the hands of soldiers during the exercise. Operation Lethal Eagle is a 21-day training exercise designed to push the limits of the Division's capabilities, particularly in large-scale, long-range air assault (L2A2) operations. The event aims to prototype and test emerging Army technologies, enhance the lethality of soldiers, and build proficiency in complex, multi-domain operations. During the exercise, soldiers will conduct a range of missions that integrate these new sUAS into tactical operations. This will provide invaluable data for refining drone usage and manufacturing at the tactical level. The training is expected to showcase the practical benefits of 3D-printed drones, such as their ease of replacement in the field and lower costs for procurement, maintenance, and training. The 3D manufacturing initiative is a reflection of the Army's broader strategy to modernize and improve its technological edge. As Col. McIntosh notes, the effort is part of an ongoing transformation that will make the Division’s drone systems more adaptable to ever-evolving mission requirements, from surveillance to electronic warfare. While the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division’s 3D-printed drones will first be tested during Operation Lethal Eagle, they are expected to be a permanent fixture within the Division’s technological arsenal. The success of the program could serve as a blueprint for other units in the U.S. Army, offering a new model for rapid, cost-effective drone manufacturing that can be easily scaled across other operational theaters. As U.S. soldiers continue to experiment with and refine these new systems, the 101st’s venture into 3D printing is setting the stage for broader innovations in military drone development, offering a glimpse into the future of Army warfare—one where agility, speed, and innovation take center stage.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/exclusive-us-army-101st-airborne-division-develops-3d-printed-small-drones-for-air-assault-operations	2025-01-22T03:24:22-08:00

(Picture source: Army Recognition) India's procurement of 47 T-72 BLTs aims to improve the operational capacity of its mechanized forces by enabling the rapid deployment of bridges during both offensive and defensive operations. The T-72 BLTs are designed to support the movement of armored units across obstacles such as rivers and trenches, addressing mobility challenges and ensuring tactical flexibility. This acquisition is part of a broader initiative to modernize India's military infrastructure and maintain the operational relevance of the T-72 fleet. The T-72 BLT, also known as BLT T-72, is an armored engineering vehicle (AEV) used to deploy prefabricated steel bridges during military operations. It assists in crossing natural and artificial obstacles, enabling tanks and armored vehicles to maintain mobility during combat. The system includes a scissors-type bridge that can be deployed in two configurations: a 20-meter span with a Military Load Classification (MLC) of 60, supporting vehicles up to 60 tons, and a 22-meter span with an MLC of 70, supporting vehicles up to 70 tons. The Military Load Classification (MLC) is a standardized system used by NATO to indicate the load-bearing capacity of infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and routes, as well as the load impact of military vehicles. It is represented in whole numbers, with higher numbers corresponding to the capacity to support heavier loads. Vehicles are assigned MLC numbers based on their weight, type (wheeled or tracked), and their impact on infrastructure, while infrastructure elements are categorized according to their structural characteristics and ability to handle specific traffic conditions. This system ensures compatibility between military vehicles and the infrastructure they use, supporting the safe and efficient movement of forces. The bridge system of the BLT T-72 consists of a launching mechanism, hydraulic systems, auxiliary systems, an electronic control system, and the bridge structure itself. During transit, the bridge remains folded atop the tank and can be deployed in approximately three to five minutes using manual or automatic controls. The vehicle’s ability to deploy and recover the bridge ensures tank columns can cross obstacles and maintain efficient movement. The T-72 BLT, also known as BLT T-72, features a scissors-type bridge that can be deployed in two configurations: a 20-meter span supporting vehicles up to 60 tons, and a 22-meter span supporting vehicles up to 70 tons. (Picture source: Army Recognition) The BLTs are built on the T-72M1 tank chassis and powered by a 780-horsepower engine. Weighing 49 tons, they measure 11.36 meters in length, 4.0 meters in width, and 3.8 meters in height. The maximum road speed is 60 kilometers per hour, and the vehicle can traverse gradients of up to 25 degrees, cross trenches up to 2.4 meters wide, and ford shallow waters up to 1.8 meters deep. Armament includes a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun, with provisions for attaching a KMT-6 mine plow for landmine clearance. India’s association with the T-72M1 began in 1978 with the purchase of 500 tanks from the Soviet Union, including T-72, T-72M, and T-72M1 variants. Licensed production was subsequently initiated at the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) in Avadi, Tamil Nadu, where the tank was designated as the Ajeya. Over a 15-year production period, more than 1,100 units were manufactured domestically before production ceased in 1998. In the 1990s, the Indian Army launched the Combat Improved Ajeya program, also known as Project Rhino, upgrading approximately 1,500 T-72M1 tanks. This program introduced enhancements such as upgraded engines, advanced fire control systems, Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA), fire detection and suppression systems, and modern communication and navigation systems. As of 2023, the Indian Army operates a fleet of 2,418 T-72M1 tanks, with plans to replace them under the Future Ready Combat Vehicle (FRCV) program. The BLTs fall under the 'Buy (Indian-Indigenously Designed, Developed, and Manufactured)' (IDDM) procurement category, introduced in India's Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016. This category prioritizes defense products that are indigenously designed, developed, and manufactured, requiring at least 50% indigenous content. The policy aligns with the 'Make in India' program, launched in 2014 to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports across various sectors, including defense. Additionally, the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) campaign, initiated in 2020, emphasizes fostering self-sufficiency by encouraging indigenous production capabilities. In the defense sector, these initiatives aim to develop a domestic defense industry, reduce dependency on foreign suppliers, stimulate economic growth through local manufacturing, and advance technological innovation within India.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/indian-army-purchases-47-new-t-72-blt-bridge-laying-tanks-to-strengthen-obstacle-crossing-capabilities	2025-01-22T01:48:29-08:00

(Picture source: Kalashnikov) This new generation of small and medium-sized loitering munitions is designed to enhance modern military capabilities, marking a significant milestone in Russian unmanned defense technology. The emergence of drones in the conflict in Ukraine has marked a major turning point in the conduct of modern military operations. From the outset of the Russian invasion in 2022, Ukraine quickly integrated reconnaissance and attack drones, such as the Turkish Bayraktar TB2, to carry out precision strikes against strategic Russian targets, including bridges, armored vehicles, and command facilities. The use of drones, including loitering munition systems, has helped overcome certain limitations related to manpower shortages or equipment while providing greater flexibility to conduct asymmetric attacks. On the other hand, Russia has also intensified the use of drones, particularly for kamikaze strikes or intelligence-gathering missions. These technologies have changed the nature of combat by making operations more fluid and responsive, but they have also redefined warfare strategies, where speed, precision, and the ability to strike from a distance have become key elements. The small-class KUB-2-E system is designed to target enemy infantry, including individual soldiers, as well as unarmored military vehicles. It is therefore ideal for precise strikes against lighter, more vulnerable targets on the battlefield. Meanwhile, the medium-class KUB-2-E broadens the scope by allowing strikes against a wider range of targets, such as enemy personnel, launch positions for unmanned aerial systems, helicopter landing zones, and both unarmored and lightly armored military vehicles. Both versions of the KUB-2-E loitering munitions are equipped with advanced electro-optical systems, allowing operators to guide the munitions with precision toward their targets, even if those targets change positions during the operation. Weighing over 10 kg, these munitions can operate in various challenging conditions, such as day and night operations, complex weather scenarios, smoke, and dust. They can also operate in wind speeds of up to 15 m/s and in temperature ranges from -40°C to +50°C. Moreover, these systems resist passive and active jamming tactics that may occur in a battlefield environment. Developed as an initiative by the Kalashnikov Group, the KUB-2-E complexes offer significant advancements in loitering munition technology, providing armed forces with the ability to conduct more flexible and effective strikes under diverse battlefield conditions. With IDEX 2025 fast approaching, the presentation of the KUB-2-E system at the event will highlight the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern warfare and their potential to redefine the dynamics of combat engagements.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/kalashnikov-and-russia-to-soon-present-new-kub-2-e-loitering-munition	2025-01-21T23:59:01-08:00

At speeds greater than Mach 5, hypersonic missiles encounter intense friction with the atmosphere, which can cause temperatures to soar and potentially damage the missile’s structural integrity or disrupt its internal electronics. To ensure the missile’s reliability, China has conducted extensive trials, including those in high-cost wind tunnels typically used for space missions like simulating Mars landings. Hypersonic air-to-air missiles are capable of traveling at speeds that exceed Mach 5, and as such, they present entirely new challenges and opportunities in air combat. Unlike traditional air-to-air missiles, which generally operate within a range of several hundred kilometers, hypersonic variants could strike targets as far as 1,000 km away or more, significantly extending the operational reach of platforms like China’s J-16 fighter. This increased range is not just a matter of distance, but also a matter of speed—hypersonic missiles can cover that ground much more quickly than their subsonic counterparts. With less time for an adversary to react, and an incredibly fast trajectory that evades interception, these missiles present a new type of threat for modern air forces. Conventional air-to-air missiles require complex guidance systems and long engagement times, while hypersonic missiles, due to their speed, can drastically shorten the time from launch to target impact, leaving little opportunity for escape. The introduction of this weapon has serious implications for global air combat strategies, especially for the U.S. military and its allies. The U.S. B-21 Raider new stealth bomber, with its stealth capabilities and long-range strike capabilities, represents the cutting edge of American air power, but the threat of hypersonic weapons could force a reconsideration of how such aircraft are deployed in contested airspace. The B-21 was designed with the assumption that adversaries would rely on traditional anti-air threats, such as surface-to-air missiles and fighter jets. The hypersonic missile, however, could engage even the most advanced stealth bombers at ranges far beyond the capabilities of conventional interception systems, making them vulnerable in ways previously unimagined. While China's hypersonic air-to-air missile represents a new phase in military aerospace development, it is not alone in this endeavor. Other nations have also made significant strides in hypersonic and supersonic missile technology, some of which include air-to-air capabilities. The United States, for example, is actively working on a range of hypersonic missile systems through its various programs such as the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) and the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). These systems, while primarily intended for surface-to-air and air-to-ground applications, are indicative of the U.S.'s interest in keeping pace with China and Russia in the hypersonic race. In fact, the U.S. has been focusing efforts on deploying hypersonic missiles in various configurations, including for air-to-air engagements, albeit with a somewhat longer timeline for deployment than China. Russia, too, has demonstrated significant progress in hypersonic technology with its Kinzhal missile, which, while primarily designed for air-to-ground strikes, is expected to serve as the basis for further developments in air-to-air variants. The Kinzhal is launched from a MiG-31 fighter jet and has already been used in combat, highlighting its potential in real-world scenarios. However, the focus for both the U.S. and Russia has largely been on using hypersonic systems for long-range strike missions rather than air-to-air combat, which is a niche that China appears to be pioneering. The development of air-to-air supersonic and hypersonic missiles represents a new frontier in aerial warfare. These weapons offer far greater ranges and speeds than traditional air-to-air missiles, which are typically limited by their reliance on radar guidance and the necessity of in-flight updates from the launching platform. A hypersonic air-to-air missile, due to its sheer speed, could engage targets with little to no warning and without relying on extensive data links to ensure its accuracy. This dramatically changes the nature of air combat, as enemy aircraft—especially slower-moving tankers, bombers, and early warning platforms—will have limited options for evasion. The strategic implications of this technology are profound. Air forces must now rethink their defense strategies in the face of such advanced missile technology. Countries with significant air forces, particularly the United States, will have to develop countermeasures capable of defeating or mitigating the effects of hypersonic missiles. This could involve developing better detection systems, faster interception capabilities, and more advanced electronic warfare tactics to thwart these high-speed threats. The challenge is not only technological but also economic. Hypersonic systems, due to their complex engineering and high operating costs (such as the expense of running advanced wind tunnels), represent a significant investment. For now, only a handful of nations, including China, the U.S., and Russia, are investing heavily in this cutting-edge technology. However, as the missile race intensifies, other nations may also seek to develop their own variants, potentially changing the future balance of air superiority. In conclusion, the Chinese hypersonic air-to-air missile marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of modern warfare, setting a new standard for the speed, range, and lethality of air-launched weapons. While other nations, including the U.S. and Russia, are working on their own hypersonic and supersonic missile technologies, China’s advancements in this area could lead to a shift in the tactical and strategic dimensions of aerial combat. The development of such weapons challenges not only current defense systems but also long-held assumptions about the effectiveness of traditional air-to-air missile engagements. As the world watches this technological race unfold, the implications for future air combat are both revolutionary and uncertain.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/flash-news-china-develops-secret-hypersonic-air-to-air-missile-posing-new-threat-to-us-b-21-stealth-bomber	2025-01-21T09:13:15-08:00

What Happened to Russia’s Destroyer Lider and Its S-500 Missile Defense Plan?	Russia’s ambitious Project 23560 destroyer Lider was envisioned as a next-generation warship that could replace multiple classes of vessels in the Russian Navy. This advanced platform was designed to carry a naval version of the S-500 Prometey air defense system, positioning it as a formidable counter to the U.S. Navy’s Aegis missile defense system.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A model of the Russian Navy's Project 23560 destroyer. (Picture source: Navy Recognition) Military expert Sergey Marzhetsky highlighted that the destroyer Lider, with its full displacement of 19,000 tons, was uniquely suited to accommodate the massive S-500 interceptors, something smaller ships like the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates could not achieve without compromising their mission capabilities. The S-500 system offered unprecedented capabilities in air and missile defense, including the ability to engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 600 kilometers and detect threats at a distance of 800 kilometers. With a maximum engagement altitude of 200 kilometers and the capacity to neutralize targets traveling at speeds up to 7 kilometers per second, the S-500 promised to counter advanced threats such as the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, an early-warning aircraft capable of detecting cruise missiles from a distance of 258 kilometers. This system could have given the destroyer Lider a critical edge in naval warfare by extending its defensive reach far beyond that of the U.S. Navy’s Aegis system, which relies on SM-3 Block IB missiles with a range of 700 kilometers and a speed of 3 kilometers per second. The Aegis system, a cornerstone of U.S. naval defense, is an advanced, multi-layered combat system designed to detect, track, and intercept a wide array of threats, including ballistic missiles, aircraft, and surface targets. Central to its effectiveness is the AN/SPY-1 radar, a powerful, phased-array system that provides continuous 360-degree surveillance and fire control. This radar works in tandem with the Standard Missile family, particularly the SM-3 and SM-6 variants, to deliver precise and effective missile interceptions. Deployed across a fleet of over 70 ships worldwide, including U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers, as well as allied vessels, the Aegis system is renowned for its integration capabilities, allowing ships to work as part of a larger missile defense network. Despite its promise, the Project Lider was halted due to a combination of financial, technical, and strategic challenges. Russia’s economic constraints made it difficult to allocate the significant funding required for such an advanced and massive destroyer. Technological hurdles in adapting the land-based S-500 system for naval use, particularly integrating the complex radar and launcher systems, further complicated the project. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy’s focus shifted toward smaller, more versatile ships like the Project 22350 frigates and Karakurt-class corvettes, which were more practical given budgetary limitations and immediate operational needs. The destroyer Lider could have been a game-changer in modern naval warfare, providing Russia with unmatched air and missile defense capabilities and challenging the dominance of Western naval systems. However, its cancellation reflects a broader shift in Russia’s naval strategy toward cost-effective solutions and multipurpose platforms.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/what-happened-to-russias-destroyer-lider-and-its-s-500-missile-defense-plan	2025-01-21T07:30:00-08:00

The JFD SEAL Carrier is one such hybrid craft, built for surface and submersible operations with small teams. It emphasizes stealth and the efficient insertion of operators but does not achieve the same level of rapid transition or high-speed surface performance. Similarly, Lockheed Martin’s Dry Combat Submersible (DCS) provides an enclosed, pressurized environment for operators, allowing for extended underwater missions. However, the DCS is primarily an underwater platform and lacks the high-speed surface capabilities that characterize the VICTA. The MSubs S201 submersible also serves as a valuable platform for special forces. It offers a dry, modular environment for operators and can be tailored to specific mission requirements, focusing on endurance and payload capacity. This makes it ideal for long-range underwater operations but limits its operational speed and adaptability compared to the VICTA. Meanwhile, diver propulsion devices such as those from STIDD cater to short-range, individual underwater mobility. While effective for certain missions, these devices do not offer the integrated hybrid functionality or mission scope of larger surface-submersible crafts. Other specialized platforms, like Triton’s submersibles, provide deep-sea and covert operational capabilities tailored for specific scenarios. These vehicles prioritize operator safety and endurance but are not designed for hybrid operations involving high-speed surface transit.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/greeces-skaramagas-shipyards-to-lead-production-of-victa-special-forces-vessel	2025-01-21T05:37:17-08:00

Both prototypes incorporate advanced stealth features, modular capabilities, and designs intended to reduce radar signatures and improve operational flexibility. These developments indicate significant progress in China's ambition to challenge U.S. aerial dominance as the United States continues to struggle with its own sixth-generation fighter programs, the NGAD and F/A-XX initiatives. The Tiangang bomb features a diameter of 377mm and weighs approximately 590kg (±15kg). Equipped with a GPS-based guidance system, it is capable of targeting various fixed installations, including communication hubs, military bases, missile sites, bridges, power stations, and storage facilities. Tests have demonstrated that it generates overpressure exceeding 25 kPa within a 45-meter radius and achieves a static destruction area of 47 square meters. Its extended range allows deployment platforms to remain beyond the reach of many air defense systems, improving survivability during missions. China’s glide bomb development originated with the LS-6 series, introduced in 2006 by the Luoyang Optoelectro Technology Development Center. The LS-6 family includes precision-guided glide bomb kits compatible with multiple weights: 50kg, 100kg, 250kg, and 500kg. The 500kg LS-6 achieves a range of up to 60 kilometers when released from an altitude of 10,000 meters. The Tiangang bomb builds on this foundation, offering improved range capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing systems. The Tiangang's performance invites comparisons with the AGM-154 JSOW, as its design and purpose are closely aligned with this U.S. counterpart. The Tiangang, developed by Norinco Group, offers a range exceeding 80 kilometers and a CEP of less than 15 meters, targeting fixed installations such as communication hubs and military bases. By contrast, the AGM-154 JSOW, manufactured by Raytheon, achieves ranges of approximately 22 kilometers from low-altitude releases and up to 130 kilometers from high-altitude releases, utilizing a GPS/INS system with optional imaging infrared guidance. Compared to the JDAM, the Tiangang demonstrates a superior range; the standard JDAM achieves up to 28 kilometers with a CEP of 5 meters under optimal conditions. However, the JDAM-Extended Range (JDAM-ER) narrows the gap by incorporating a wing kit to extend its range to approximately 80 kilometers. The design and purpose of the Tiangang guided bomb closely resemble those of its U.S. counterpart, particularly the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon, also known as the JSOW. (Picture source: US DoD) Globally, glide bombs and modular guidance kits are increasingly valued for their ability to enhance the effectiveness of unguided munitions. Systems like the U.S. AGM-154 JSOW, Russia’s UMPK, and Pakistan’s Takbir glide bomb improve accuracy and operational range, enabling launch platforms to remain outside defended airspace. These upgrades are cost-efficient, repurposing existing bombs with advanced guidance modules and aerodynamic surfaces, making them highly effective in modern combat scenarios. The concept of glide bombs dates back to World War II, with Germany’s Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 introducing remote-controlled munitions for precision strikes, primarily against naval targets. Early systems faced accuracy challenges and required clear visibility from the launch aircraft but marked the advent of precision-guided munitions. Advancements in guidance systems, such as GPS and inertial navigation, have since significantly improved accuracy and standoff ranges, broadening their operational applications. The primary advantage of glide bombs lies in their ability to deliver precise strikes from extended distances, keeping aircraft outside the range of air defense systems. Their modular nature allows unguided bombs to be converted into precision-guided munitions, offering a cost-effective solution for many militaries. Additionally, their small radar signatures and short flight times reduce vulnerability to interception, making them versatile for various missions. For China, the Tiangang bomb provides a practical solution to enhance precision-strike capabilities by leveraging its extensive inventory of FAB-series bombs, reducing the need for entirely new munitions. This approach increases operational flexibility and cost-efficiency. By incorporating advanced guidance systems, the Tiangang bomb significantly enhances the effectiveness of China’s aerial munitions, bolstering its ability to conduct strategic operations with precision at extended ranges.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/aerospace-news/2025/china-continues-to-challenge-us-aerial-superiority-with-its-tiangang-guided-bomb	2025-01-21T03:53:04-08:00

Donald Trump Announces an Ambitious Plan for a Fully American Iron Dome	On January 19, 2025, during the rally preceding his inauguration in Washington, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump generated interest by announcing his plan to order the construction of a fully American 'Iron Dome' once his second term begins. Inspired by the renowned Israeli missile defense system, this initiative, highlighted in the Republican Party's electoral platform, aims to create a 'force field' around the United States. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launcher was placed and prepared to launch interceptors to counter ballistic missile threats at an undisclosed location in CENTCOM area of responsibility (Picture source: US DoD) Trump emphasized the project's national character, pledging that it would be developed and constructed within the United States. This plan raises critical questions regarding technical details, costs, and the technologies that might be incorporated. While the possibility of a system distinct from Israel's Iron Dome is not excluded, the proposal aligns with the goal of enhancing technological self-reliance and fostering innovation in the U.S. defense industry. The Israeli Iron Dome, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems with U.S. financial support, is globally recognized for its short-range missile defense capabilities. The mobile, all-weather system intercepts and neutralizes enemy projectiles, including rockets, artillery shells, and mortars. Equipped with an EL/M-2084 radar and Tamir interceptor missiles, it calculates threat trajectories in real time and engages only those likely to cause harm. With interception rates frequently exceeding 90%, the system has demonstrated its effectiveness in protecting civilian populations during multiple conflicts. However, the Israeli Iron Dome has limitations. While highly effective against short-range threats, it offers only partial protection against long-range missiles, advanced drones, or hypersonic weapons. As a result, it is often supplemented by other systems, such as David's Sling and Arrow, to provide layered defense. Trump’s proposed project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a system capable of addressing a broader range of threats, including emerging weapon technologies. This endeavor would require substantial investments to establish new production facilities and integrate advanced technologies. Additional challenges include ensuring compatibility with existing U.S. systems, such as the Patriot, THAAD, and Aegis, which form the backbone of the nation’s missile defense architecture. The future U.S. 'Iron Dome' could leverage existing defense systems to create a comprehensive, multi-layered network capable of countering diverse threats. The Patriot PAC-3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement) is a key component of U.S. air defense, designed to counter evolving threats like tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and low-orbit satellites. Equipped with an upgraded solid-fuel rocket motor, improved aerodynamic controls, and advanced guidance systems, this hit-to-kill missile ensures total target destruction. Operating at speeds of Mach 5, it has a range of 35 kilometers and an interception altitude of 15 kilometers. Each launcher, mounted on a mobile platform, carries up to 16 missiles, enabling rapid and effective responses to complex threats, including those employing electronic countermeasures. The THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system is specifically designed to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles during their terminal phase, both within (endoatmospheric) and outside (exoatmospheric) the atmosphere. Highly mobile and transportable, the system uses hit-to-kill technology, neutralizing threats with kinetic energy to minimize risks associated with weapons of mass destruction. A single THAAD battery includes up to nine mobile launchers, each carrying eight missiles, an AN/TPY-2 X-band radar with a detection range of 1,000 kilometers, and command-and-control vehicles. THAAD operates seamlessly alongside systems like the Patriot and Aegis, ensuring robust protection for military forces, strategic infrastructure, and civilian populations. The Aegis combat system, at the core of Aegis-equipped destroyers, provides unparalleled air defense and ballistic missile interception capabilities. Paired with the AN/SPY-1D phased-array radar, it can detect and track multiple aerial threats over 300 kilometers. Aegis-equipped destroyers are armed with Standard Missiles (SM), including SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6, capable of intercepting threats ranging from aircraft to medium-range ballistic missiles. Incorporating the Aegis system into the proposed U.S. Iron Dome could offer a formidable shield for critical locations and infrastructure. The U.S. is also heavily investing in high-powered lasers and directed energy weapons to counter drones and missiles. These technologies could complement the system by providing cost-effective and rapid solutions for neutralizing specific threats. Advanced radars, such as the Sentinel A4, used for aerial threat detection and surveillance, could play an integral role in the proposed Iron Dome. These radars are critical for real-time detection, tracking, and engagement of threats, ensuring optimal system performance. Integrating the Iron Dome with the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) could further enhance coordination between different defense platforms. Through real-time data sharing, this would improve interception speed and accuracy. The proposed Iron Dome could serve as a catalyst for the U.S. defense industry, promoting strategic independence and reinforcing the country’s position on the global stage. However, its success will depend on the ability to develop a system that is efficient, adaptable, and economically sustainable. This initiative could also redefine global standards in missile defense. Trump’s announcement marks a potential turning point in the evolution of U.S. defense technologies. This project represents a critical step in safeguarding the nation against adversaries such as China, Russia, and North Korea, whose advancements in ballistic and hypersonic missile technologies pose significant threats. By addressing these strategic challenges, the U.S. Iron Dome could provide a vital defensive edge while strengthening alliances with key partners who share similar security concerns.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/donald-trump-announces-an-ambitious-plan-for-a-fully-american-iron-dome	2025-01-20T00:51:26-08:00	
Analysis: How Russia’s Innovative Submarine Coating Reduces Detection Risks	The Russian Ministry of Defense initiated a significant modernization program in 2022 to upgrade the hydroacoustic coatings of its nuclear-powered submarines. This effort aims to improve the stealth capabilities of these vessels, enabling them to evade detection more effectively. The new coating reduces the acoustic signature of the submarines by suppressing noises generated by the vessels and external sonar signals.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of Project 677 Lada submarines Vologda and Yaroslavl. (Picture source: bmpd) The hydroacoustic coating is made up of specialized plates, each weighing up to 80 kilograms. These plates are composed of multiple pressed layers of advanced rubber materials and feature unique channels designed for acoustic performance. They are affixed to the submarine's lightweight hull using an adhesive with a classified composition. Once attached, the plates are coated with paint to ensure durability and optimal performance. Each nuclear-powered submarine requires approximately 10,000 of these plates, meticulously installed to create an effective barrier against enemy sonar detection. The stringent testing process for the new hydroacoustic coating was recently showcased on the Russian television program Voennaya Priyomka (Military Acceptance) aired on the Zvezda channel. The tests, conducted at the Sevmash shipyard—Russia’s premier submarine manufacturing facility—demonstrated the robustness of the adhesive bonding the plates to the hull. The testing procedure begins with a drill featuring a cup-shaped bit, which is lubricated with soapy water and used to bore into the rubber coating. A metal corkscrew is then inserted into the resulting hole and pulled out using a specialized device that measures the force required to dislodge it. Results show that the adhesive can withstand a force of over 4.5 kN (kilonewtons), confirming its exceptional strength. To ensure minimal impact on the coating’s acoustic properties, the hole is sealed with a fast-curing sealant, rendering it virtually undetectable. This rigorous process is applied to every tenth plate, meaning approximately 1,000 plates are tested before a submarine undergoes state trials. The upgraded hydroacoustic coating is expected to enhance the operational effectiveness of Russia’s nuclear submarine fleet. By reducing detectability, these submarines will have a greater edge in strategic missions, such as patrolling and covert operations, particularly in contested waters. In contrast, the United States has long utilized lightweight synthetic polymer tiles on its Virginia-class and Ohio-class submarines. These tiles are engineered to absorb sonar waves effectively while maintaining a reduced thickness to minimize weight and hydrodynamic drag. The U.S. approach integrates these coatings with other noise-reduction technologies, such as pump-jet propulsion systems, to create a multi-layered stealth system. However, issues with long-term adhesive durability have been reported, which may compromise performance over extended periods. China has focused its efforts on developing composite rubber and polymer coatings for its Type 093B Shang-class submarines. These coatings aim to absorb a broad range of sonar frequencies, enhancing stealth in the Indo-Pacific region. Recent reports suggest that China is transitioning to modular panels for easier maintenance, but the overall robustness and longevity of these systems appear to lag behind those of Russian and American technologies. Germany, representing NATO’s expertise in stealth coatings, employs advanced rubberized materials on its Type 212 and Type 214 diesel-electric submarines. These coatings are optimized for smaller, non-nuclear platforms and are used in conjunction with Air-Independent Propulsion systems to achieve near-silent operation. While highly effective for their intended platforms, these coatings are less scalable to the larger nuclear submarines operated by Russia and the U.S.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/analysis-how-russias-innovative-submarine-coating-reduces-detection-risks	2025-01-20T00:47:42-08:00

Dutch Defense Budget 2025 Reaches 2% GDP Target as Trump May Demand 5%	The Netherlands achieved a significant milestone in 2024, reaching the NATO requirement of spending 2% of GDP on defense. This decision comes in a global context marked by rising tensions, particularly with the war in Ukraine and China's growing military presence. After several decades of military budget reductions, this increase marks a major shift, illustrating a growing awareness of global threats and the need to strengthen the Netherlands' military posture. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. (Picture source: Dutch MoD) Since the end of the Cold War, Dutch defense spending has been heavily influenced by the idea of the 'peace dividend.' In 2013, defense spending dropped to just 1% of GDP, a trend that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis when austerity measures led to significant cuts in the military budget. However, Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and, more recently, the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, highlighted Europe's vulnerability to rising military threats. These events accelerated a realignment of priorities, progressively strengthening the Netherlands' defense capabilities to respond to new geopolitical realities. In response, the Dutch government decided to increase its military spending. In 2024, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands' defense budget reached 2% of GDP, in line with NATO's requirements. This increase is the result of adopting a more proactive defense policy aimed at modernizing the armed forces and strengthening the country's deterrence and defense capabilities. This effort is supported by the recent adoption of the Defense Financial Obligations Act, which ensures the long-term maintenance of this goal. The Netherlands' increase in defense spending aligns with a broader global trend. NATO as a whole has seen rising contributions from its members, with countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Eastern European members significantly increasing their military budgets. Notably, the United States remains by far the largest contributor to NATO, with an estimated defense budget of $28.791 trillion in 2024, representing around 66% of the Alliance's total defense spending. Globally, other major powers such as Russia and China have also increased their military expenditures. Russia's defense spending for 2025 is projected to reach $120 billion, while China's defense spending in 2024 is estimated at $231 billion. These figures illustrate the growing commitment of these nations to strengthen their military capabilities, particularly in cybersecurity, nuclear armaments, and advanced technologies. These developments highlight the growing military competition among major powers and emphasize the need for European countries, including the Netherlands, to maintain a modern and effective defense posture. In this unstable geopolitical context, the Dutch government has implemented a series of initiatives to modernize its armed forces. This includes investments in advanced military equipment, increased training for soldiers, and an increase in the number of military personnel to ensure that the Netherlands' armed forces are ready to respond to any threat. The strengthening of defense capabilities translates into investments in modern weapon systems, including missile defense, cybersecurity, and electronic warfare. These areas are seen as essential in the face of contemporary threats, such as cyberattacks and hybrid warfare. Additionally, the Netherlands is enhancing its cooperation within NATO, actively participating in joint exercises and increasing its contribution to Alliance missions. Despite achieving the 2% target, challenges remain. The Netherlands' defense budget will need to continue growing to meet future military threats. The ongoing increase in military spending, necessary to keep up with evolving threats, is likely to pose significant challenges for the national economy. In particular, balancing defense needs with other budgetary priorities such as healthcare, education, and social services will be crucial. Another challenge for the Netherlands, as for other NATO members, is the need to modernize the armed forces to address new military technologies continually. Adapting to new forms of warfare, such as cyber warfare and autonomous weaponry, will be a key area of investment for the coming years. The 2% of GDP allocated to defense is now considered not a ceiling, but a minimum. Several NATO officials, including the Secretary General of the Alliance, have emphasized that defense spending above this threshold will be necessary to make up for the accumulated gap and prepare for the future. Indeed, the pace of global threats and new geopolitical dynamics necessitate a constant reassessment of defense budgets. The Netherlands' position on this issue is clear: although the 2% target has been met, the government is ready to consider future increases to further strengthen national security and continue playing a significant role within NATO. Additionally, discussions are underway to incorporate this standard into more binding legislation, ensuring the continued increase in military spending in the years to come. The Netherlands has taken an important step by meeting the 2% defense spending target, but this increase is just the beginning. The growing global challenges, new geopolitical threats, and the need to modernize the armed forces mean that the country will need to continue investing heavily in its defense to respond to the evolving global situation effectively. In the face of these challenges, the Netherlands will continue to strengthen its military capabilities and support NATO in its collective missions.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/dutch-defense-budget-2025-reaches-2-gdp-target-as-trump-may-demand-5	2025-01-20T00:01:15-08:00

Breaking News: Iran's IRGC Navy Reveals Secret Underground Naval Base Housing Dozens of Missile Assault Boats	On January 18, 2025, Iran's Revolutionary Guards unveiled an underground naval missile base at an undisclosed location in the Persian Gulf. The base, one of several underground facilities built to house vessels capable of launching long-range missiles and conducting distant warfare, was revealed by IRGC Chief Commander Hossein Salami. During ongoing war games, Salami visited the secret base and highlighted its strategic significance in enhancing Iran’s naval capabilities and deterrence in the region.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Screenshot from a video broadcast by IRGC-affiliated media showing the newly unveiled underground naval base in the Persian Gulf, housing several missile-equipped assault boats. (Picture source: Iranian state media video footage) This naval underground facility is part of a larger network of 'cities' specifically designed to house and deploy the IRGC (Iran Revolutionary Guard) Navy’s combat vessels. These subterranean complexes are central to Iran's naval defense strategy, allowing the IRGC to quickly mobilize its fleet of missile-equipped assault boats in the region. General Salami, in his speech at the unveiling, emphasized that the base is just one small component of a much larger system of subterranean installations. He asserted that the IRGC Navy operates numerous such bases, all designed to reinforce its operational resilience and readiness against external threats. By hiding these vessels in underground facilities, the IRGC significantly complicates efforts to locate and neutralize its fleet, providing a strategic advantage in the event of regional conflict. The underground base is specifically tailored to house fast-moving, missile-equipped boats, which are a core component of the IRGC Navy's asymmetric warfare strategy. These boats, capable of launching precision-guided missiles, allow the IRGC to challenge more technologically advanced adversaries, particularly the U.S. Navy, which operates in the region. The base also includes vessels equipped for mine-laying, further enhancing the IRGC’s ability to control key maritime chokepoints in the Strait of Hormuz and the broader Persian Gulf. The ability to lay naval mines is a critical element of Iran's strategy to deny access to critical shipping routes, complicating operations for foreign naval forces in the region. The choice to build such a base underground stems from several strategic considerations. First, it offers protection from airstrikes, which is increasingly important as satellite surveillance and precision-guided munitions become more advanced. With many foreign powers, particularly the United States, capable of targeting and destroying surface ships, housing assets in hidden underground facilities helps mitigate this risk. Furthermore, by dispersing its fleet across multiple hidden sites, the IRGC enhances the survivability of its naval forces. This network of subterranean bases ensures that if one or more facilities are attacked, others remain operational, allowing for continuity in defense operations. Another crucial reason behind this underground infrastructure is the IRGC's focus on asymmetric warfare. Unlike traditional naval forces, which rely on large surface ships, Iran uses small, fast-moving missile boats that can strike quickly and retreat before enemy forces can respond. This hit-and-run tactic is central to Iran's approach to naval defense, allowing them to challenge more powerful forces using low-cost, high-impact weapons. The underground bases also make it more difficult for enemies to predict the locations of these vessels, giving the IRGC the element of surprise. The unveiling of this base also underscores Iran’s growing emphasis on maritime defense, especially as tensions in the Persian Gulf continue to rise. The Strait of Hormuz, through which a significant portion of the world’s oil passes, is a vital geopolitical chokepoint. By deploying missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels, Iran can create a constant threat to any foreign navy operating in the region, potentially disrupting global oil trade. As tensions with the U.S. and its allies persist, these developments serve as a reminder of Iran's commitment to maintaining control over this strategic waterway. Looking forward, General Salami's remarks suggest that the underground base is only a fraction of the IRGC’s broader defense infrastructure. Iran is continuing to build a network of such subterranean complexes, all designed to enhance its naval deterrence capabilities. These bases, hidden from view and designed to withstand airstrikes, play a key role in Iran’s defense strategy. As the IRGC expands its network of underground facilities, it is clear that the regime intends to continue fortifying its naval power while challenging foreign naval dominance in the region. The unveiling of this underground combat vessel base marks a significant milestone in Iran's ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen its IRGC Navy. With missile-equipped boats and mine-laying vessels strategically housed in these subterranean complexes, Iran is positioning itself to exert greater influence over the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This move further solidifies the IRGC’s asymmetric warfare capabilities, and as the region remains on edge, global powers will be closely watching Iran's growing naval infrastructure for its broader implications on regional security and maritime stability.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-irans-irgc-navy-reveals-secret-underground-naval-base-housing-dozens-of-missile-assault-boats	2025-01-18T17:50:50-08:00	
Flash Info: US Navy MH-60R Seahawk Helicopter Shoot Down Aerial Drone in Flight for the First Time	On January 16, 2025, Admiral James Kilby, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, revealed an important milestone for U.S. Navy aviation. During his address at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium near Washington, D.C., Admiral Kilby confirmed that a U.S. Navy MH-60R 'Romeo' Seahawk helicopter deployed to the Red Sea had successfully shot down a drone operated by Houthi militants. This event, first reported by The War Zone, an online platform covering defense, military technology, and security-related topics, marks the first time a U.S. Navy helicopter has engaged and downed an enemy UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in flight.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, a multi-role maritime helicopter, played a pivotal role in the first-ever shootdown of an aerial drone in flight over the Red Sea, marking a significant milestone in counter-drone operations. (Picture source: U.S. DoD) The specific type of aerial drone targeted and the exact method used by the U.S. Navy Mh-60R Seahawk naval helicopter to neutralize the UAV remain undisclosed. However, Admiral Kilby mentioned that the helicopter crew had employed 'a little bit of an unconventional system' to carry out the operation. This statement hints at the use of non-traditional or advanced technologies to deal with the increasingly common threat posed by drones in maritime and conflict zones. The MH-60R Seahawk is a versatile and multi-role maritime helicopter used extensively by the U.S. Navy. Primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASuW), and reconnaissance missions, the MH-60R is equipped with a suite of advanced sensors and armaments, making it well-suited for conventional and unconventional operations. Its core capabilities include detecting and tracking submarines, conducting surface strikes against maritime targets, and providing real-time intelligence and surveillance for fleet operations. The Seahawk is fitted with the state-of-the-art APS-153 radar system, a multi-mode radar capable of detecting both surface and airborne threats, which would have been crucial in identifying and tracking the Houthi drone. Additionally, the helicopter is equipped with advanced sonar and communications systems that allow for precise coordination with other naval assets. Regarding armament, the MH-60R is armed with a range of precision-guided weapons, including AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Mk 50 torpedoes, and various machine guns. These capabilities make it a formidable platform for engaging both surface and air targets, as well as providing close-air support to ground forces. The versatility of the MH-60R, coupled with its powerful sensors and armament, positions it as an essential tool in modern naval warfare, capable of addressing a broad range of threats from conventional naval targets to emerging asymmetrical threats like drones. In this case, it can be speculated that the U.S. Navy MH-60R Seahawk, with its advanced radar and sensor systems, likely played a key role in detecting the Houthi drone. However, downing a drone in flight, especially in a maritime environment, is far from simple. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are often small, agile, and capable of flying at low altitudes, which makes them challenging to detect and track. Given the operational challenges in the Red Sea, including potential interference from variable weather conditions, electromagnetic noise from the sea, and the unpredictable flight patterns of drones, the engagement would have required precise coordination and possibly unconventional methods to overcome these obstacles. The success of this operation underscores the Seahawk's advanced detection and tracking capabilities, but the exact nature of how the drone was engaged remains speculative at this stage. The growing use of drones in the Red Sea region, particularly by Houthi rebels, has added another layer of complexity to maritime security operations. The Houthis have increasingly deployed drones in their ongoing conflict with Saudi-led coalition forces, targeting both military assets and civilian shipping. Drones are often used to strike critical infrastructure, including oil tankers and naval vessels, raising concerns over the safety of international shipping routes. In this context, the successful downing of a drone by a U.S. Navy Seahawk is more than just a tactical victory—it represents a significant step in the evolving counter-drone capabilities of naval forces. The Red Sea's importance as a vital global trade route means that ensuring its security is of paramount concern for international naval forces. With the proliferation of UAV technology, particularly in conflict zones, the ability to intercept and neutralize these threats is becoming an essential capability for modern naval operations. The engagement of the drone by the U.S. Navy's MH-60R Seahawk is a noteworthy achievement, signaling the increasing importance of counter-drone capabilities within naval forces. As Admiral Kilby’s comments highlight, the use of 'unconventional systems' to take out the UAV underscores the innovative approaches needed to address the growing threat of drones in maritime operations. This successful mission also reinforces the idea that the battlefield is evolving—naval forces are no longer just focused on traditional threats like surface combatants and submarines but must also contend with the growing menace of UAVs. As demonstrated in this historic operation, the U.S. Navy’s ability to adapt to these new challenges will be crucial for maintaining maritime security in the Red Sea and beyond. As drone technology continues to evolve, it is likely that naval forces will increasingly rely on both conventional and unconventional means to detect, track, and neutralize these threats. The integration of advanced sensors, electronic warfare, and other countermeasures will shape the future of naval operations in increasingly complex and contested environments.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/flash-info-us-navy-mh-60r-seahawk-helicopter-shoot-down-aerial-drone-in-flight-for-the-first-time	2025-01-18T03:10:41-08:00

On January 15, 2025, Infodefensa reported that the Chilean Army is considering purchasing Senator 4x4 armored vehicles from the Canadian manufacturer Roshel Inc. as part of a revised approach to the Cromo project. Initiated in 2018 by the Army Projects and Research Directorate (Dipride), the Cromo project aimed to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Over 1,400 Roshel Senator 4x4 armored vehicles have been supplied to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, where they have been utilized for troop transport and medical evacuation, and Roshel recently expanded its production capabilities by opening its first U.S. facility in Shelby Township, Michigan. (Picture source: Roshel) The original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles for the Mechanized Battalion of the 1st Buin Infantry Regiment, with a budget allocation of $111.8 million. Due to delays and complications, the tender process was declared void in April 2024, prompting an expansion of the project’s scope to include 4x4 and 6x6 platforms. The initial tender specified several requirements, including vehicles capable of carrying ten personnel, meeting NATO STANAG 4569 Level 3 standards for ballistic and mine protection, and integrating remote weapon stations for NATO-classified armaments. These vehicles were intended for use in non-war military operations, disaster response, and training in Peldehue, located north of Santiago. However, financial limitations and challenges integrating L3Harris telecommunications systems led to the rejection of all submitted bids. Following the cancellation of the tender, the Chilean Army issued a request for information (RFI) to manufacturers, expanding its interest to 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 configurations. Companies responding to the RFI include BMC and Otokar from Turkey, Excalibur Army from the Czech Republic, Iveco from Italy, Patria Group from Finland, and General Dynamics Land Systems. The RFI outlined specifications such as STANAG 4569 Level 2/2A/2B protection, operational functionality in extreme conditions at altitudes above 4,500 meters, and temperature ranges from -20°C to 45°C. The vehicles are also expected to demonstrate versatility across various terrains. Roshel’s Senator 4x4 is among the vehicles being evaluated. This Canadian-made Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle has been used in Ukraine, with more than 1,400 units delivered since 2022. Reports from Ukraine have described the vehicle’s reliability and off-road performance under frontline conditions. Therefore, the Chilean Army is reportedly considering direct procurement of the Senator through the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), bypassing a competitive bidding process. This method has been criticized for potentially limiting market competition and excluding alternatives, such as Colombia’s Hunter TR-12 or France’s Arquus Bastion. Chile's original plan involved acquiring 40 new 8x8 armored vehicles to replace Mowag Famae Piraña 6x6 vehicles, which have been in service for over 30 years and are nearing the end of their operational lifecycle.

Flash info: Russian S-400 System Targets a French Atlantique 2 Aircraft Over Baltic Sea	During the night of January 15-16, 2025, a French Navy Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, operating as part of a NATO mission, was illuminated by the targeting radar of a Russian S-400 air defense system. This action, described as aggressive and contrary to international norms, was condemned on X (formerly Twitter) by French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu. The incident occurred amidst heightened tensions in the Baltic Sea, a strategically critical region where Russian and Western interests frequently clash. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The French Atlantique 2 was inspecting Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning 200 ships without detecting threats when targeted by a Russian S-400 radar (Picture source: French MoD) NATO patrols in the Baltic Sea aim to ensure maritime security and protect critical infrastructure in the region. These operations have intensified in response to recent incidents, including damage to undersea telecommunications and power cables, which European leaders attribute to potential acts of sabotage by Russia. The Baltic Sentry operation mobilizes frigates, maritime patrol aircraft like the Atlantique 2, and naval drones to effectively monitor these strategic waters. On this occasion, the French Atlantique 2 was conducting inspections near Swedish and Baltic waters, scanning around 200 ships without identifying any suspicious vessels. Based on radar capabilities and operational ranges of the S-400 system, it is likely the responsible battery was located in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. Kaliningrad, a Russian territory situated between Poland and Lithuania, plays a pivotal role in Russia's air defense strategy. The region has hosted S-400 batteries since their initial deployment in April 2012, aimed at bolstering the Baltic Fleet’s air defense. Additional systems were installed at the Gvardeysk military base near Kaliningrad in March 2019 to further secure this strategically sensitive area. These deployments also serve as a deterrent to NATO forces operating in the region, where tensions continue to rise. The S-400 Triumf, developed by Almaz-Antey, is a sophisticated air defense system featuring an advanced radar architecture. At its core is the 92N6 Grave Stone fire control radar, capable of detecting targets up to 400 kilometers away and at altitudes exceeding 50 kilometers. Supporting this is the 96L6 Cheese Board radar, optimized for tracking targets at both low and high altitudes, and the 91N6E Big Bird radar, which can identify threats at ranges up to 600 kilometers in some configurations. This combination enables the S-400 to detect a wide range of threats, from ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft to drones and cruise missiles. The S-400 is further distinguished by its ability to deploy a variety of missiles tailored to specific threats. The 40N6E missile, with a range of 380 kilometers, can engage targets beyond the radar horizon, including those flying at low altitudes. The 48N6DM/48N6E3 missiles with ranges of 250 kilometers and 48N6E2 with 200 kilometers are designed to intercept high-altitude threats, while the 9M96E missiles with a range of 40 kilometers and 9M96E2 with 120 kilometers are optimized for maneuverable threats and those at low altitudes. These hypersonic missiles, capable of speeds up to Mach 15, ensure rapid and precise interception. In its maximum configuration, an S-400 battery can engage up to 80 targets simultaneously and direct 160 missiles within a 360-degree radius. While the S-400’s modular design and advanced capabilities make it a formidable defense system, they come with significant logistical demands, including maintenance and highly trained personnel. These factors underscore the importance of the S-400 systems stationed in Kaliningrad within Russia's broader anti-access and area denial strategy, effectively securing the region against unauthorized aerial incursions. This incident highlights the growing geopolitical tensions between NATO and Russia, particularly against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, specializes in anti-submarine warfare and surveillance missions. With a flight endurance of 14 hours and a range of 4,300 nautical miles, it is a critical asset for NATO operations in the Baltic Sea. Equipped with state-of-the-art sensors, including a magnetic anomaly detector and a 360-degree radar, the Atlantique 2 can efficiently monitor maritime activity in strategic zones. The use of a targeting radar against the Atlantique 2 represents a provocative act, often interpreted as a warning or show of force. While the situation did not escalate further, it underscores the risks of operating in a region where NATO and Russian forces frequently interact. NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, noted that such incidents, though serious, are relatively common and not confined to European theaters. This incident underscores the need for NATO to maintain heightened vigilance against destabilizing actions in the region. In conclusion, this event reflects the delicate balance of power in the Baltic Sea, a critical theater in the broader NATO-Russia rivalry. The advanced capabilities of the S-400 system, coupled with NATO’s strategic resilience, highlight the precarious nature of this region, where each action carries potential implications for international security.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/flash-info-russian-s-400-system-targets-a-french-atlantique-2-aircraft-over-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T05:40:11-08:00	
Belgium Invests in Mine Countermeasures with New Ship Liege	According to information published by the Belgian MoD on January 16, 2025, a momentous occasion for the Belgian Navy and the city of Liege unfolded at the Giurgiu shipyard in Romania with the keel-laying ceremony for the Liege, a new mine countermeasures vessel (MCMV).Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link Keel-laying ceremony of the Belgian City-class rMcM Liege. (Picture source: Belgian MoD) The keel-laying, a traditional naval ceremony symbolizing the beginning of a ship’s construction, was attended by Belgian Navy officials, local dignitaries, and representatives from Liège. The Liège is being constructed as part of the Belgian-Dutch Replacement Mine Countermeasures (rMCM) program, a joint initiative to replace the aging minehunting fleets of both nations. The ship’s construction follows a phased approach, beginning with the assembly of its hull in Romania. Once this stage is completed, the vessel will be transported to Concarneau, France, where advanced systems and equipment will be installed by Naval Group, a key partner in the project. After its completion, the Liège will undergo rigorous testing, including harbor and sea trials, before being equipped with its weapon systems in Lorient, France. The Liège is one of 12 vessels being built under the rMCM program, with six designated for the Belgian Navy and six for the Royal Netherlands Navy. Scheduled for full operational deployment by 2030, these ships will incorporate innovative minehunting technologies, including a fleet of approximately 100 unmanned drones. These systems, part of a modular toolbox, will enhance the fleet’s ability to detect and neutralize mines effectively. Context Historically, mine warfare in the North Sea has been a pivotal aspect of naval strategy due to the region's strategic importance as a maritime gateway. During the World Wars, the North Sea became a critical theater for deploying naval mines to control access, protect key shipping routes, and limit the movement of enemy fleets. In World War I, the North Sea saw the implementation of extensive minefields, such as the North Sea Mine Barrage. This Allied operation aimed to deter German U-boat activity by creating a massive minefield stretching between Scotland and Norway. Over 70,000 mines were laid in deep waters, marking one of the most ambitious mining operations of the time. The barrage was a logistical feat, demonstrating the role of mines in countering undersea threats, although its actual effectiveness remains debated. During World War II, the North Sea once again became a contested space. Both the Axis and Allied forces employed mines extensively, using them to blockade ports, disrupt shipping lanes, and deny access to critical areas. Mines proved to be a relatively inexpensive yet highly effective tool for naval dominance. The German Navy used magnetic mines, a technological innovation of the era, to great effect, challenging traditional mine-sweeping techniques and forcing the Allies to develop countermeasures. The aftermath of these conflicts left thousands of mines scattered across the seabed, posing long-term risks to navigation, fishing, and infrastructure development. The effort to clear these mines was a monumental task undertaken in the post-war years, and unexploded ordnance from these periods continues to be discovered and neutralized today.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/belgium-invests-in-mine-countermeasures-with-new-ship-liege	2025-01-17T04:49:25-08:00

NATO Surveillance Mission French Aircraft Faces Russian Hostility in Baltic Sea	As reported by Le Figaro, a high-tension incident occurred on January 16, 2025, during an aerial surveillance mission over the Baltic Sea. A French Navy Atlantique 2 (ATL2) operating under NATO's framework was targeted by Russian forces while conducting a surveillance flight in response to recent undersea cable damage. The French Armed Forces General Staff confirmed this event, which an AFP journalist witnessed firsthand onboard the aircraft. Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The Atlantique 2 is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions (Picture source: Dassault Aviation) The aircraft departed Brittany earlier that day and was tasked with inspecting approximately 200 vessels operating in international waters near Sweden and the Baltic states. During the mission, the plane encountered electronic jamming and was designated by a fire-control radar, a procedure known in military terms as ' illumination.' According to Colonel Guillaume Vernet, spokesperson for the General Staff, this act signals hostility, even though it is not uncommon in this strategically sensitive region. The Atlantique 2, designed by Bréguet and Dassault Aviation, is a long-range maritime patrol aircraft optimized for anti-submarine warfare and other aeronautical missions. It is an evolution of the Breguet Atlantic, featuring advanced operational capabilities, robust endurance, and notable maneuverability.

The professionalism of the French crew was pivotal in preventing escalation despite the heightened tensions. Colonel Vernet emphasized that Russia’s radar illumination aimed to express restrained hostility, stopping short of direct military action. An attack on a NATO aircraft would have risked triggering a severe and uncontrollable escalation with the Alliance. This incident occurs amid growing suspicions of sabotage targeting critical undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Over recent months, several undersea communication and power cables have been damaged. On December 25, the EstLink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia, along with several telecommunication lines, were compromised shortly after similar events in Swedish waters. Finnish authorities suspect Russian involvement and have seized the Eagle S, a tanker under the Cook Islands flag, allegedly part of a Russian 'ghost fleet.' General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, described the event as 'serious,' noting that such provocations are not confined to Europe. Experts, including former military aviator Xavier Tytelman, highlighted the risks of miscalculation or immediate responses in such situations, which could inadvertently lead to significant escalation. Despite these provocations, the ATL2 completed its mission without identifying suspicious vessels. However, the incident underscores the persistent confrontations in the Baltic region, where hybrid warfare tactics and intimidation measures are prevalent. NATO continues to heighten its vigilance, reflecting the ongoing challenges to maritime security and regional stability posed by geopolitical rivalries. The Baltic Sea has long been a hotspot for tensions between Russia and NATO member states, characterized by frequent interceptions of military aircraft. Russian planes, such as Su-27 Flankers and Il-20s, often operate without flight plans or active transponders in international airspace, complicating their identification and endangering air safety. In response, NATO interceptors, including German and British Eurofighters, are routinely deployed to escort these aircraft out of the area. While these encounters are typically handled professionally, they exemplify the heightened geopolitical strains fueled by the Ukraine conflict and intensified military activities on both sides.	https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/army-news/2025/nato-surveillance-mission-french-aircraft-faces-russian-hostility-in-baltic-sea	2025-01-17T00:09:01-08:00

These new launcher units will be integrated into both the Iranian Navy and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy, providing a new layer of operational flexibility and reach for the country’s defense forces.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link The new mobile launcher unit for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship missile, delivered to the Iranian Navy on January 16, 2025, enhances Iran's naval strike capabilities with increased mobility and operational flexibility (Picture source: X Account Hamid) First unveiled in August 2020, the Abu Mahdi cruise missile is a domestically developed long-range anti-ship weapon with a striking range of over 1,000 kilometers. Named after the influential Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the missile has been designed to deliver both anti-ship and land-attack capabilities, providing Iran with a versatile tool to challenge naval forces operating in its strategic waters. One of the most significant features of the Abu Mahdi missile is its long range, which at over 1,000 kilometers, is approximately three times the range of Iran's previous most capable anti-ship missiles, such as the 350 km Raad missile and the 300 km Qadir missile. This substantial increase in range allows Iran to project its power much further, complicating the ability of adversaries to operate near its coastline. The Abu Mahdi missile is equipped with cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)-powered guidance, which allows it to perform advanced maneuvering in-flight, avoiding radar detection through low-altitude flight patterns and unpredictable course alterations. These features make the missile particularly effective against heavily defended targets such as aircraft carriers and naval vessels equipped with advanced air defense systems. This combination of long-range capabilities and high precision makes the Abu Mahdi a formidable tool in Iran's naval arsenal. The newly delivered mobile launcher units will allow the Abu Mahdi missiles to be deployed quickly and efficiently from various locations, enhancing their operational flexibility. These launchers can fire multiple missiles at short intervals and from diverse fixed and mobile platforms, enabling Iranian forces to strike multiple targets simultaneously and with a variety of attack trajectories. The dual-mode seekers on the Abu Mahdi, which combine both active and passive radar homing systems, are designed to ensure high precision even in the face of electronic warfare attempts. The integration of mobile launchers with the missile system further complicates adversaries' attempts to neutralize Iran's capabilities. The delivery of these launcher units significantly extends Iran's naval deterrence capabilities. With the Abu Mahdi missile, Iranian forces now possess a weapon that can strike enemy ships from a distance well beyond their shores, effectively forcing foreign military assets, such as aircraft carriers, to stay at least 1,000 kilometers from Iranian waters. This ability to deny access to large swathes of the Persian Gulf and beyond significantly alters the regional naval balance of power. As Iranian defense officials have emphasized, the Abu Mahdi missile is a crucial component of Iran's strategy to defend its maritime borders and exert influence over the Strait of Hormuz, through which a substantial portion of global oil shipments pass. The missile's advanced guidance systems and ability to operate from various platforms, including coastal installations and ships, further enhance its role in Iran's defense strategy. The importance of anti-ship missile capabilities for Iran cannot be overstated, especially in the context of its current strategic environment. Iran is located in a region where maritime security is a constant concern, with the strategic Strait of Hormuz being a chokepoint for global oil transport and a focal point for international tension. In recent years, Iran's adversarial relations with Israel have intensified, with both countries accusing each other of hostile actions and interventions. Israel's growing presence and alliances in the region, particularly in the Mediterranean and around the Gulf, have heightened Iran's concerns over its maritime sovereignty and the security of its critical oil exports. In this volatile context, the Abu Mahdi missile system represents a crucial component of Iran's broader military strategy to deter any foreign military intervention, particularly by Israel and its allies. With the ability to strike naval assets at ranges previously beyond Iran's reach, these missiles bolster Tehran’s strategic posture, allowing it to challenge the naval superiority of regional adversaries, including Israel, and create a formidable defense against any attempts to restrict its maritime access. The Abu Mahdi missile, with its ability to target enemy vessels from a distance and evade advanced radar systems, ensures that Israel and other regional powers would have to stay far out of range to avoid devastating strikes. This increases the deterrence effect, complicating any military planning and making any potential naval engagement in the Persian Gulf a highly risky endeavor. The successful integration of mobile launchers into Iran's naval strategy underscores the increasing sophistication of its military assets, positioning it as a formidable maritime force in the Middle East. The delivery of these mobile launchers for the Abu Mahdi long-range anti-ship cruise missiles represents a major leap in Iran's naval defense capabilities. Iran has significantly bolstered its deterrence capabilities by enhancing its range, precision, and flexibility of its missile forces, making it better positioned to defend its territorial waters and project power in the region. With these new assets in place, Iran’s military is now more capable of challenging foreign naval forces and asserting its dominance in the strategically vital waters of the Persian Gulf.	https://armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2025/breaking-news-iran-strengthens-anti-ship-arsenal-with-new-mobile-abu-mahdi-missiles-launchers	2025-01-16T08:23:52-08:00
